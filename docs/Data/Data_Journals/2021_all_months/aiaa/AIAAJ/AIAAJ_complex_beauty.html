  abstract     = {The overset grid assembly (OGA) method is an effective computational fluid dynamics technique for the simulation of flows with complex geometries or relative moving parts. Using OGA, the effort for mesh generation is significantly reduced by generating the grid for different parts and then assembling them to form the computational grid. New methods have been developed that are generally divided into implicit and explicit methods in which a donor cell search for the defined query points is often time-consuming. Besides, the parallelization of OGA is a complex task that is not currently supported by many software platforms. In this paper, a new OGA approach is developed based on the wall distance and a user-defined reference length. The proposed approach is relatively more convenient to implement and more robust among the existing methods. The number of query points defined by this method is also significantly reduced, resulting in a higher speed of performing the overall donor search process. Validity tests are conducted, and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Computational engineering design methods and tools are common practices in the modern industry. Such approaches are integral in enabling designers to efficiently explore large and complex design spaces. However, they also tend to dramatically increase the number of candidate solutions that decision makers must correctly interpret. Because all candidate solutions can be represented in a digital form together with their assessment criteria, a natural way to explore and understand the complexities of the design problem is to visualize their multidimensional nature. The task now involves the discovery of patterns and trends within a multidimensional design space. This work aims to enhance the design decision-making process with immersive Parallel Coordinates Plot (IPCP) in virtual reality. This paper presents the design of this system, which allows representation and exploration of multidimensional scientific datasets. A qualitative validation with two surrogate expert users demonstrated that the system can be used successfully to detect both known and previously unknown patterns and support learning the decision-making process in a shorter time. The results serve as a promising indication of how immersive parallel coordinate plots can enhance decision support in complex engineering design processes.},

  abstract     = {In high-speed rotorcraft applications, large sections of a blade undergo reverse flow due to a high advance ratio. Flow separation at the sharp aerodynamic leading edge during reverse flow leads to negative lift, pitching moment, and drag penalties. The kinematics of a rotor blade leads to a dynamic stall in reverse flow, which further accentuates the problem by causing unsteady loading. The present experimental study shows that these problems can be mitigated by passively morphing the camber near the trailing edge of the blade. A finite-span cantilevered NACA 63-218 blade was examined at a chord-based Reynolds number of with and without trailing-edge morphing. The morphing was implemented by deflecting the last quarter-chord near the trailing edge by 5, 10, or 15 deg. Experiments included global measurements of the forces and moments using a load cell as well as detailed flow measurements using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. A couple of scenarios were explored: static pitch and dynamic pitch at different pitch amplitudes and frequencies. Cambering of the blade near its trailing edge led to a significant reduction in the size of the separation region over the model, and of the wake. For the static pitch case, it led to a large reduction in drag and pitching moment and a minor reduction in negative lift. For the dynamic pitch cases, the hysteresis loop was significantly reduced, leading to a large reduction in unsteady loading.},

Aerodynamic forces, surface pressures, and particle image velocimetry images were obtained in the experiments. The results of the aerodynamic force and surface pressure measurements showed that the characteristics of the flow separation control by ns-DBDPA are clearly different depending on the airfoil shape, and particularly the type of stall. NACA0015 exhibited leading-edge stall under the conditions investigated, and ns-DBDPA achieved flow control by producing vortices. NASA-CRM exhibited thin-airfoil stall, and ns-DBDPA increased the maximum lift of the lift curve even after the stall. On the other hand, Gottingen387, which exhibited trailing-edge stall, achieved almost no flow control at any actuator position, actuation frequency, or voltage amplitude. The flow control mechanisms for different types of airfoils are discussed based on the particle image velocimetry measurement results.},

Numerical simulations of the four fluidic oscillator pairs were carried out to observe and evaluate both flow and sweeping characteristics of each fluidic oscillator pair under a nozzle pressure ratio of 3.0. The numerical setup was validated through a comparison between the experimental results and computational simulation results. The results indicate that, based on the interbridge arrangements, the main flows in two fluidic oscillators were synchronized by flow interaction via interbridges. Consistent in-phase jets and out-of-phase jets were obtained. By arranging an inport bridge and an outport bridge between each fluidic oscillator and removing the inner feedback loops, in-phase jets were obtained. By contrast, by arranging an outport bridge between each fluidic oscillator, out-of-phase jets were obtained. Meanwhile, when a chamber bridge was additionally arranged between the recirculation chambers of each fluidic oscillator, increases in the sweeping frequency and flow instability were observed. In addition, the relationship between the recirculation in the recirculation chamber and the sweeping characteristics was quantitatively evaluated.},

  abstract     = {This study describes a rotating detonation combustor (RDC) equipped with a set of nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) of variable number and inclination angle. Different instrumented guide vanes were manufactured and integrated for in situ measurements of static and stagnation pressure. It is shown that the mode progression and stagnation pressure gain of the device are not negatively affected by addition of the NGV stage. The positive effects of increasing mass flux, increasing NGV throat restriction, and decreasing air injector pressure drop are observed; however, no positive pressure gain is ultimately measured. A large number of individual runs with a single detonation wave mode is statistically analyzed. In this analysis, the wave direction is automatically determined using a cross-correlation method, and binomial hypothesis testing is subsequently applied to the dataset. It is demonstrated that changing the vane inclination influences the preferential detonation wave direction such that the oblique shock is oriented at a less acute angle with respect to the vane’s axial chord. This results in less energy reflected back to the detonation wave and increases the ability of the vane stage to ingest the high-enthalpy flow, which also impacts a number of performance metrics. The combination of wave direction and vane inclination is categorized as either “aligned” or “misaligned” based on these observations. For the aligned configuration, the flow acceleration across the vane stage is larger, as is the static pressure difference between pressure and suction sides. The average flow Mach number at the NGV leading and trailing edges and the static pressure distribution in the converging–diverging vane section are shown to agree well with predicted values from isentropic relations. Pressure fluctuations are attenuated by some 80\% across the NGV stage. The study demonstrates that for RDCs integrated into larger systems, it is imperative to know and control the wave direction, and that NGVs may be a useful tool to achieve this goal. It further underlines that a careful integration of turbomachinery with RDCs is key to harnessing the full potential of this promising technology.},

Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) was used to measure the path-averaged rotational and vibrational temperatures of NO in the flow, in addition to the NO partial pressure. The temperature measurements demonstrate strong evidence of NO rotational and vibrational equilibrium during the 1 ms test period. Agreement between vibrational and rotational temperatures was observed in all experiments, including one and four experiments, during and after the nominal test time. Absorption from CO and was also observed in the TDLAS measurements, though their concentrations cannot be accurately estimated.

  abstract     = {Swirling flows are widely used to enhance heat and mass transfer in energy conversion devices, and predicting the swirl decay rate is important in several applications. This study investigates the swirl decay rate inside a straight annular pipe and its primary parameters. A one-dimensional model of the swirl number is derived. We revise the empirical wall shear stress model by considering the azimuthal velocity profile and the wall shear stress difference between two walls. The swirl numbers given by the model exhibit improved agreement with simulation results. The model has three primary parameters that affect the swirl decay rate: the inlet Reynolds number, the ratio of the inner and outer radii (i.e., gamma), and the swirl intensity. Using the ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based model, the parametric maps of the swirl decay rate are presented. Although the effects of the primary parameters on the swirl decay rate from the literature are mostly confirmed, the geometric parameter of gamma shows an effect distinguished from the others. There exist gamma values that minimize the swirl decay rate or angular momentum loss. It is found that the optimal gamma values result from a balance between the wall shear stress and turbulent stress in the radial direction. The optimal gamma value increases slightly as the swirl intensity or Reynolds number increases. A physical analysis is presented using the ODE components and the flow fields of the cross-stream velocities.},

No definitive trend was observed with viscosity on drop size, while liquid–gas surface tension showed a weak correlation with drop size due to its small variation in value among fuels.

Transition, relaminarization, wake interactions, and interrow influence form complex, highly unsteady flow patterns. Large eddy simulation (LES) emerges as a promising method to deliver improved accuracy over Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) approaches as the major energy-carrying scales are fully resolved. However, for wall-bounded flows, modeling of (parts of) the boundary layer might still be inevitable to keep the computational costs manageable. In this paper, we aim to characterize and analyze the boundary-layer state in such a scenario. We employ the high-order discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method to perform a wall-resolved LES of a stator-rotor-stator cascade ( up to 0.65, up to ). The interfaces between the blade rows are treated with a high-order accurate sliding mesh approach. Time-averaged performance characteristics are compared against experimental and numerical data. The temporal evolution of the solution is first assessed through the phase-averaged flowfield at different stator-rotor positions. Subsequently, special emphasis is placed on the spatiotemporal evolution of turbulence near the blade surface. Boundary-layer profile and energy spectra analysis are used to give insight into the turbulence development. This investigation not only reveals the complexities of the boundary-layer dynamics but can also serve as benchmark and reference for evaluation and development of wall-modeled LES approaches for turbomachinery applications.},

  abstract     = {Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI) is a promising propulsion integration technology capable of enhancing aircraft propulsive efficiency. The Propulsive Fuselage Concept (PFC), a tube-and-wing configuration with an aft-fuselage-mounted BLI propulsor, is particularly suited for BLI. Although extensively studied on a system level, the aerodynamic performance of the PFC, resulting from the complex interaction between the airframe and the propulsor, is still largely uncharted. In this paper, the results of wind-tunnel tests on a simplified PFC model are presented. The model featured an axisymmetric fuselage body with an integrated BLI shrouded fan. Flowfield measurements were performed through particle image velocimetry to analyze the key aerodynamic phenomena and to assess the distribution of momentum and mechanical energy around the aft-fuselage propulsor. Results show that the BLI fan alters the surrounding flowfield by increasing the mass flow in the inner part of the fuselage boundary layer and by reducing the boundary-layer thickness. Moreover, the power analysis indicates that the potential benefit of BLI is strongly dependent on the fan setting. Increasing the fan shaft power leads to a higher amount of power dissipated in the near wake. However, an increasing share of the energy flux is associated with the momentum excess contained in the wake.},

Experimental results show that the radial circulation of wingtip vortex satisfies a scaling formula. Moreover, the LSA results demonstrate that the instability characteristics, including the stability curve, growth rate eigenvalue spectrum, and perturbation mode, are uniformed in time and space, laying the basis for scaling the wingtip vortex by considering them.

Planar particle image velocimetry over the full span of the wing demonstrated that with increasing angle of attack, isolated pockets of backflow, which appeared near the trailing edge, merged and formed an asymmetric stall cell at angle of attack of 9.7°. The asymmetry was mainly associated with the dissimilar boundary layers developed on the wind tunnel walls at the spanwise ends of the wing. Secondary structures were also observed between the stall cell and the spanwise end. The stall cell topology was characterized using large-scale three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry measurements using helium-filled soap bubbles. The results showed that the separation bubble had a small wall-normal height with two wall-normal counter-rotating vortices extended up to the edge of the separation bubble. In addition, the investigations demonstrated that vortex generators can induce a symmetric stall cell by removing the secondary structures and isolating the stall cell from the flows at the spanwise ends.},

In the conventional design process of mechanical design, the conceptual design is the earliest stage of the design process; and it is carried out based on the designer’s own idea/experience. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain innovative and high-quality concepts overwhelming the designer’s knowledge since the earliest stage of the design process has the largest impact. In this research, therefore, the black-box function aerodynamic topology optimization algorithm via machine learning technologies (FANTOM) is developed to overcome the problem. In the FANTOM approach, topology optimization problems are solved using/combining two efficient global optimization methods developed by the authors: the efficient global optimization method for discontinuous optimization problems with infeasible regions using classification method, and the efficient global optimization method via clustering/classification methods and exploration strategy. In the present approach, topological optimal designs can be obtained only by setting an objective function and constraint conditions. The validity of the FANTOM approach is demonstrated in an inviscid drag minimization problem at a two-dimensional supersonic flow condition, which provides an optimal topology as the Busemann biplane airfoil. Executing topology optimizations with the variation in freestream Mach number, it is also demonstrated that the FANTOM approach can explore topological optimal designs robustly.},

The overall airfoil shape, the suction velocity distribution, and its location are optimized for minimum total drag while sustaining laminar flow over 80\% of the airfoil top surface. Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II is used with the aerodynamic load computations from XFOILSUC and transition prediction from the improved Van Ingen method. The airfoil is designed for short-range subsonic conditions for three design lift-coefficient scenarios: 1) 0.4, 2) in the range of 0.3–0.7, and 3) in the range of 0.3–0.7 with suction onset at midchord. The optimized airfoil for scenario 3, with suction onset at midchord, results in a thicker airfoil with natural laminar flow (NLF) on the upper surface comparable to NLF airfoils. The total drag reduces by one-third due to the effects of suction. On the other hand, without limiting the suction onset (scenario 2), a thinner airfoil with longer NLF on the bottom surface and lower total drag is obtained. Optimum suction onset location is predicted to be at 30\% of the chord. Suction is also observed to improve the drag bucket at off-design conditions.},

The BSVR model possesses the features of original SVR as well as providing the prediction variance to direct the sequential sampling process for probabilistic analysis in RBDO. In the meanwhile, a learning function combined with the sample pool truncation strategy is proposed to select the new training samples to adaptively update the BSVR model, which can accurately and efficiently approximate the important probabilistic constraint boundaries in the desired regions, and the newly selected training samples tend to be far away from the existing training points under the current design to avoid clustering. The computational capability and the good engineering applicability of the proposed method are verified by three numerical examples and two engineering applications about a stiffened rib of the wing edge and a latch-lock mechanism of the cabin hatch.},

  abstract     = {Fatigue damage accumulation needs to be monitored for extending the lifetime of horizontal axis wind turbines. To monitor accumulation of fatigue damage, this paper proposes a blade load and fatigue damage monitoring system consisting of physics models coupled with the Kalman filter (KF). The proposed monitoring system estimates bending moment distribution along the blade as a time series from 1 Hz data collected by a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and from 20 Hz strain sensor data collected at the blade root. Static load is computed on the basis of blade element and momentum theory from SCADA data, whereas dynamic response of the blade is computed by assuming a mass–spring–damper system. The KF corrects the estimated moment distribution with moment measured at the blade root. The monitoring system is demonstrated and validated by installing it on a 2 MW floating downwind turbine and estimating strain and fatigue damage at the medium span position of the blades, where a strain sensor is installed. The validation results show that strain wave forms and fatigue damage estimated by the monitoring system with the KF are consistent with those computed from the strain measurement with sufficient accuracy for structural health monitoring.},

The presence of cutouts in composite panels results in stress or strain concentrations, leading to potentially reduced load-carrying capacity. Steering tows around cutouts using emerging techniques in three-dimensional (3-D) printing and advanced fiber placement can potentially alleviate such problems. Continuous tow steering around cutouts also eliminates fiber cutting, thereby precluding ply-level 3-D stress concentration, which could otherwise lead to delamination-induced damage. This work examines stress and strain concentrations, using continuous tow steering, around a representative wingbox access hole. Buckling response under compression loading together with stress and strain concentrations under both tensile and compression loads are examined. A steered configuration shows a 26\% improvement in buckling performance in comparison with the equivalent straight-fiber configuration. Under tensile loading, the maximum stress and strain concentration factors around the cutout are 29 and 32\% larger, respectively, for straight-fiber orientations than those with steered tows around the cutout. For the compression loading condition, the direct strain of the panel with straight-fiber orientations was found to be three times that of steered-fiber trajectories in the vicinity of the cutout.},

The equilibrium equations are determined by considering the von Kármán theory, and they are coupled nonlinear differential equations that are solved by employing the perturbation technique. The buckling load has been determined analytically by solving the stability equations, which are a system of coupled differential equations with variable coefficients. By conducting a parametric study, the effects of the honeycomb structure and the aspect ratios on the buckling load have been investigated.

It is assumed that the fluid is nonrotating, nonviscous, incompressible; and steady; and the pipe is simply supported at both ends. Under the framework of refined displacement fields, a reduced constitutive relation is developed. On this basis, the nonlinear governing equations are derived through the Hamilton variational principle. The two-step perturbation–Galerkin integral is extended to obtain the equilibrium paths as the initial configurations of the pipes for impact studies. The fourth-order Runge–Kutta method is employed to numerically obtain the contact force and the pipe vibration responses. The effects of flow velocity, impact velocity, structural material, and geometric factors on the dynamic responses are discussed.

  abstract     = {Recent works have addressed piezoelectrically induced stresses as a potential technique for aeroelastic stability augmentation of biclamped structures. Because active-control-based techniques are conventionally used for aeroelastic stabilization, this paper presents a comparative study on the effectiveness of piezoelectrically induced stresses and active control for aeroelastic stability augmentation. A finite-element-method-based piezoaeroelastic model is proposed employing two-node, eight-degree-of-freedom smart beam elements and an unsteady, strip-theory-based aerodynamic approach involving vertical gust components. A stability augmentation system was designed for stiffness control and used for comparison in a particular wing configuration. Analyses involving the stability margins, input signal energy, and the response to vertical gust were performed and discussed. The results showed that piezoelectrically induced stresses and active control can provide equivalent flutter speed increase for the two cases of gain margin considered. However, the system can become unstable due to control signal saturation when submitted to high-amplitude gusts, which was not observed when piezoelectrically induced stresses is used. On the other hand, it was observed that the active control required a much smaller amount of energy for stabilization. In general, it was noticed that the piezoelectrically induced stresses technique was not as effective as active control to increase the flight envelope of biclamped structures, because active control can provide equivalent aeroelastic stability improvement with smaller amount of energy. However, it is found to be a promising strategy to be used on emergency devices, where the aeroelastic stability of biclamped structures needs to be guaranteed in critical aerodynamic disturbance conditions.},

  abstract     = {The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory Structural Sciences Center recently started an experimental campaign in the Arnold Engineering Development Center von Kármán Facility Tunnel C to investigate the aerothermoelastic (combined aerodynamics, heat transfer, and structural mechanics) behavior of a flight-weight stiffened aerostructure at high-supersonic flow conditions. Optical measurement techniques were employed to record simultaneously the panel deformation (three-dimensional digital image correlation), panel surface temperature, and the boundary-layer state/dynamics (high-speed schlieren and Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor). Panel transient behavior, including a dynamic snap-through event, was captured using these full-field measurement techniques. Importantly, panel surface deformation on the order of 8 mm, or five times the panel thickness, was realized. Maximum pressure and heat flux amplifications of about 1.7 and 1.5, respectively, were measured/estimated across a rigid article that mimicked, and closely matched, the expected thin panel deformation. The unique results and knowledge gained from this campaign will be provided to the aerospace community for the purpose of calibrating and validating coupled aerothermoelastic simulation methods.},

  abstract     = {U.S. national research priorities include reducing the disruption caused by sonic booms, which hindered the economic viability of supersonic aircraft in decades past. However, shock waves are unavoidable during supersonic flight; and exposure of people, animals, and structures to these shock waves on the ground cannot be eliminated entirely. It is herein shown that changing atmospheric conditions, gusts, and heights above ground can result in any supersonic aircraft that is acceptably quiet at specific atmospheric conditions becoming uncomfortably loud in other flight conditions. These performance variations are noticeable for periods ranging from 12 h to one year across the continental United States of America. Therefore, strategies to actively mitigate sonic booms may become necessary as researchers work toward resumption of overland commercial supersonic flight.},

  abstract     = {This experiment demonstrates the generation of trapped acoustic surface waves excited by a turbulent flow source through the coupling of pressure fluctuations at the interface between an acoustic metamaterial and a flow environment. The turbulent flow, which behaves as a stochastic pressure source, was interfaced with an acoustic metasurface waveguide stationed in a quiescent environment via a single Kevlar-covered cavity, which ensured no significant disturbance to the flow. The metasurface waveguide produced an acoustic surface mode through evanescent diffractive coupling of the pressure field. This acoustic mode was trapped at the quiescent surface, with its mode dispersion determined by the surface geometry. The results of two different metasurface geometries are discussed: 1) a slotted cavity array, and 2) a meander connected cavity array, with each demonstrating a different trapped surface wave characteristic. Fourier transform and correlation analyses of spatially resolved temporal acoustic signals, measured close to the metamaterial surface, were used to construct the frequency- and wavevector-dependent acoustic mode dispersion. The results demonstrate that the flow can be used to excite acoustic surface modes and that their mode dispersion may be tailored toward realizing novel control of turbulent flow through acoustic-flow interactions.},

This paper describes an experimental study of the effects of two passive devices (namely, slat extensions and a cove filler) on the aerodynamics and acoustic radiation from a 30P30N model. Test conditions include three effective free-air angles of attack of 5.5, 7.5, and 13 deg, as well as three Reynolds numbers of 1.2, 1.5, and . Steady surface pressure measurements are used to assess the aerodynamics near the midspan section. Unsteady surface pressure and far-field acoustic array measurements are performed to evaluate the near- and far-field pressure fluctuations, respectively. Delay-and-sum beamforming is applied to localize the noise sources and to provide integrated spectra. The slat cusp extensions barely affect the mean distribution, whereas the longest extension achieves up to a 5.4 dB reduction in the overall sound pressure level. The slat-cove filler yields an even higher noise reduction that is lower than the baseline by up to 14 dB. Even though the aerodynamic assessment of the cove filler is incomplete due to the covered pressure ports, the mean distribution over the remaining surface of the model indicates a rather small change compared with the baseline measurements.},

In a first step, a wind-tunnel study was carried out. This consisted of detailed aerodynamic and aeroacoustic measurements on 16 airfoils with different permeable leading-edge designs that were performed for various flow speeds and geometric angles of attack. Based on the results from that study, unskewed fan blades with four different permeable leading-edge designs were manufactured in a second step. With the aim of reducing turbulence interaction noise of axial fans, the fans were examined with regard to their aerodynamic and acoustic properties under grid-generated turbulent inflow conditions. In a third step, a possible transfer of the observed noise emission from airfoils with permeable leading edge to that of fan blades was investigated. It was found that a notable broadband noise reduction can be transferred from airfoil applications to the sound spectra of axial fans. At the same time, the porous modifications can reduce the aerodynamic performance, and hence the fan efficiency.},

  abstract     = {A novel optical-tracking technique is presented for aerodynamic measurements on free-flying models in hypersonic wind tunnels. This technique is a generalization of the edge-fitting concept developed for simple geometries in earlier work; it tracks a given model by matching its outline, captured in high-speed backlit imaging, to a computer-generated silhouette. Computer-graphics algorithms enable the generation of a mesh-resolution silhouette for any geometry in arbitrary orientation; for models without rotational symmetry, the method can thus follow at least five-degree-of-freedom motion from a single view (with six degrees of freedom possible with nonparallel illumination). In calibrated bench-top experiments, submicron positional accuracy is shown to be achievable. In Mach 6 wind-tunnel experiments in the University of Maryland HyperTERP shock tunnel, the drag of a sphere is derived with less than 1\% uncertainty contribution from the position measurements, whereas the corresponding lift and drag of a capsule geometry could be obtained with less than 4\% and 1\% uncertainty. These accuracies are comparable to or better than existing short-duration force measurement techniques and are achieved without significant pre-experiment calibration. The technique is also highly flexible, in that the same software can be applied to measurements on a variety of test geometries with few modifications.},

  abstract     = {Hypersonic boundary layers are crucial in aerospace applications such as hypersonic glide vehicles, rockets, and other advanced space vehicles. Hypersonic flows present unique transport phenomena, including nonnegligible flow compression/dilation, extra strain rates, and large momentum/thermal gradients. In this paper, the performance of three widely used turbulence models is compared, namely, the standard , the shear stress transport (SST) , and the Spalart–Allmaras (SA). Based on our turbulence modeling assessment plus the analysis of turbulent transport equation budgets over the experimental geometry from a previous study at a Mach number of 4.9, a moderate supremacy of SA over two equation models was found. To back our conclusions, previous experiments and direct numerical simulations at Mach numbers around 5 have been employed. Overall, the three considered models exhibited a consistent ability to predict first-order statistics both inside and outside the boundary layer. The SST variants were capable of describing the amplification of the constant shear layer induced by the presence of an adverse pressure gradient (APG). Furthermore, the SST model also replicated the second peak of turbulence production induced by the concave wall. There was a more aggressive distortion of the boundary layer by APG than by favorable pressure gradient (FPG) as compared with a zero pressure gradient (ZPG) boundary layer. A reasonable performance by Walz’s equation in the FPG region is also shown, whereas a notable lack of agreement is seen in the APG. Overall, one could argue for the SA model’s best compromise between accurate predictions, numerical stability, and mesh resolution insensitivity in the FPG and ZPG regions, particularly, in outer or integral boundary-layer parameters such as or . That being said, the two-equation models are far superior in terms of predicting near-wall parameters (such as or ) or their ability to accurately describe the physics of the hypersonic boundary layer for APG regions (for instance, outer-secondary peaks of turbulent kinetic energy production).},

Spectral analyses of these data are presented and compared, as are the results from modal analyses using both proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and spectral POD (SPOD). Comparisons revealed that both schlieren images and pulse-burst PIV vector fields could be decomposed to capture the same oscillatory phenomenon in the jet (screech) at . Both techniques captured strong periodic behavior in the shear layer where the influence of screech is observed to be significant and in the turbulent breakdown region of the jet where the shock cells are unsteady. Excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement was found between the spectral and modal analyses of these data, despite the fundamental differences between schlieren and PIV. Challenges associated with the pulse-burst PIV experiment are discussed, and detailed uncertainty analyses of these data are presented, showing excellent convergence of the data with low statistical uncertainties. The comparisons between these diagnostics help to demonstrate the capabilities of pulse-burst PIV, which is still a relatively new diagnostic technique for studying high-speed flows.},

In this work, the conceptual Bedford wing-body vehicle is studied to analyze flow patterns in shock/shock and shock/boundary-layer interactions with thermochemical nonequilibrium. A parametric computational fluid dynamics study is carried out for different hypersonic operating conditions, with respect to the freestream Mach number. Simulations are performed with the SU2-NEMO solver coupled to the Mutation++ library, which provides all the necessary thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport properties of the mixture and chemical species. The Adaptive Mesh Generation library is used for automatic anisotropic mesh adaptation. Numerical results show that increasing the freestream Mach number from 4 to 10 leads to changes in the shock layer, locations of shock impingement, and regions of boundary-layer separation. Despite these changes, the change in freestream Mach number has little impact on the overall shock interaction structures.},

Wall static pressure measurements along the primary and corner regions obtained a more complete pressure distribution. Detailed structures of the shock train were recorded using schlieren visualization with circular, horizontal, vertical, and color knife edges. The results show that the wake and wave structures generated by the micro-ramp control the shock train. The taller the device, the stronger the wake and wave structures, and the greater the control. The wake and wave structures shorten or eliminate the Mach stem in the shock train leading edge, causing modification of shocks downstream from pseudonormal to oblique, inhibiting the thickening of the boundary layer that results from shock impingement, slowing down the contraction of the supersonic core flow, and allowing more high total pressure fluid to develop downstream. The wake structure was found to promote the oscillation and upstream motion of the shock train. The wave structure can restrain shock train oscillation and upstream propagation of the downstream adverse pressure gradient, enhancing the resistance backpressure of the flowfield downstream of the micro-ramp.},

The flowfield is investigated in depth by visualizing velocity isosurfaces, with special emphasis on the growth of the interaction as one moves away from the interaction origin, which is a unique feature of swept interactions with strong crossflow. Initial results of the flowfield response to microjet actuation at four separate locations within the interaction are also discussed.

All the interactions were strong enough for the boundary layer to separate, and the separated flow features displayed a quasi-conical nature emanating from a virtual conical origin. The concept of quasi-conical fin-induced interactions, initially developed for turbulent interactions, was used to extend the free interaction theory to three-dimensional laminar interactions considered in the present study. The well-established scaling functions in free interaction theory were extended, and the results were found to agree reasonably with the theoretical trend. Surface-pressure distributions were plotted for the different cases studied and were found to have a plateau and dip that is typical of separated flows. The overlapping of the scaled pressure distributions reinforced the concept of quasi-conical free interactions for the range of Mach numbers and fin angles considered.},

Specifically, this effort characterizes the behavior of a thickening of the boundary layer upstream of the separation shock location that appears to strongly correlate with the motion of the upstream influence shock; this work also verifies that the focused spectra observed in measurements with a cylinder on a flat plate are also observed in interactions generated by a blunt fin or on a cone with similar boundary layer edge conditions. The dynamic motion of the shock waves in the transitional interactions are characterized using high-speed schlieren and statistical information derived by tracking the location of various features of the interaction within the frame sequence.},

  abstract     = {Strong laminar/transitional shock boundary layer interactions (SBLIs) have been investigated in a Mach 4 vacuum-driven wind tunnel with supporting computational fluid dynamics analysis. Such flows are extremely susceptible to large-scale separation, unsteadiness, and high surface heat flux, which can limit control authority on high-speed vehicles. The research community has heavily focused on turbulent interactions, leaving little understanding of how laminar/transitional cases behave with varying external parameters. Four compression ramp angles of 15, 18, 22, and 28° have been tested on a flat plate (unit Reynolds number ) with a range of external length scales (flat plate Reynolds number varies between and at the ramp corner). Laminar separation was observed at boundary-layer thickness Reynolds number between 2700 and 4300, with the centerline length of separation scaling mildly with Reynolds number, increasing proportionally with . Transitional reattachment is observed for strong SBLIs at higher values of . Analysis of high-speed schlieren images shows that the separation shock exhibits low-frequency unsteadiness at a Strouhal number near , consistent with turbulent SBLIs. Detailed phase analysis of schlieren data shows no evidence of upstream influence. Instead, motion of the shear layer and reattachment shock precedes motion of the separation shock foot, suggesting a downstream unsteadiness mechanism. In addition, extensive analysis of subtle features within the interaction identified a slow-moving density disturbance within the bubble that convects toward the shock foot and directly leads separation shock motion. Negligible coherence was observed between low-frequency separation shock motion and acoustic content within the separation bubble.},

The cylinder is driven at a constant rotational rate about its respective axial coordinate. Four nondimensional rotation rates were selected: 0.5, 1, 2, and 3, representing rates based on the static cylinder’s natural shedding frequency and corresponding harmonics. Two aspect ratios were investigated: i) and ii) . The case of represents a cylinder height equal to the local boundary-layer thickness. Both streamwise and cross-stream (transverse) particle image velocimetry (PIV) planes are presented, and the resulting time-averaged flowfield is examined. Results for the rotating cylinder reveal the development of a dominant streamwise vortex that persists for several length scales downstream of the cylinder. Accompanying the streamwise vortex formation is an enhancement in the wall-normal velocity component (downwash) behind the rotating cylinder. Additionally, the maximum downwash occurs immediately behind the rotating cylinder near 0.27 diameters downstream in contradistinction to a stationary cylinder with peak downwash near 2–3 diameters. The maximum downwash, being in line with the formation of the dominant streamwise vortex, shortens the recirculation region in the cylinder’s wake, thus shifting the plate reattachment point further upstream. In the case of , where the cylinder is submerged within the boundary layer, although the length of the recirculation region reflected by the mean flow is lengthened by the rotary motion, the maximum downwash for the rotating cylinder is enhanced by a factor of 10 from that of the maximum downwash experienced by a static counterpart.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, static warhead arena tests have used stereoscopic cameras to count fragments in real time and correlate their individual velocity and mass. This new technique provides the ability to generate higher confidence dynamic fragmentation data that in turn can be used for code validation and much more realistic lethality and collateral damage calculations. Arena tests involve detonating static warheads; whereas, in reality, warheads arrive and detonate at high speeds. State-of-the-art simulations for high-speed warhead detonations can be challenging and time consuming while potentially missing the relevant physics of real-world detonations. In this investigation, a framework to predict warhead fragment track characteristics from real-world static arena experimental data and dynamic simulation data is explored. A model is trained on simulation and experimental data to predict the number of fragments that pass through a defined surface of interest given warhead in-flight terminal conditions. Distributions of fragment–surface intersections are modeled by Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), and random forest regressors are trained to predict these GMMs. Monte Carlo methods are used to show that random forests trained by both simulation and experimental data can predict fragment–surface intersection distributions of both static and dynamic high-speed warhead configurations.},

Parallel grid adaptation that resolves multiple scales with anisotropy is identified as one of the challenges in the CFD Vision 2030 Study to increase the capacity and capability of CFD simulation. The study also cautions that computer architectures are undergoing a radical change, and dramatic increases in algorithm concurrency will be required to exploit full performance. This paper reviews four different methods to parallel anisotropic grid adaptation. They cover both ends of the spectrum: 1) using existing state-of-the-art software optimized for a single core and modifying it for parallel platforms, and 2) designing and implementing scalable software with incomplete but rapidly maturing functionality. A brief overview for each grid adaptation system is presented in the context of a telescopic approach for multilevel concurrency. These methods employ different approaches to enable parallel execution, which provides a unique opportunity to illustrate the relative behavior of each approach. Qualitative and quantitative metric evaluations are used to draw lessons for future developments in this critical area for parallel CFD simulation.},

The initial acceleration peak is 15.8 g, and the secondary acceleration peak is 24.2 g with a duration of 0.02 s. The crash load efficiency is only 25.8\%. The structural behavior above cannot satisfy the design requirements. In this paper, the topometry optimization method is applied to the crashworthiness design of the aircraft. The crashworthiness design of the fuselage is optimized using the target force–displacement response method proposed by the authors. The results show that the optimized fuselage structure of the airliner will produce more plastic hinges to dissipate the kinetic impact energy during the crash process. Therefore, the initial acceleration peak decreased to 11.7 g (decreased by 25.7\%) and the secondary acceleration peak is completely eliminated. The acceleration–time curve is smoother than the initial design, and the crash load efficiency increased to 54.1\% from 25.8\%.},

The computational framework also blends the concept of a global PROM as a surrogate model of a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE)-based behavior function with that of a database of local, linear PROMs for approximating a linear PDE-based behavior function. It is demonstrated for the solution of a flexible instance of NASA’s Common Research Model for transport aircraft, where the objective function pertains to aerodynamics, the constraint relates to flutter, and the design space contains 58 structural and shape parameters. The obtained results illustrate the potential of the AM concept for mitigating the aforementioned curse of dimensionality.

  abstract     = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is used to estimate unknown parameter values, as well as their uncertainties, in Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations of turbulent flows. The ABC method approximates posterior distributions of model parameters, but does not require the direct computation, or estimation, of a likelihood function. This method thus enables relatively simple and flexible parameter estimation for complex models and a wide range of reference data. This paper describes the ABC approach, including the use of a calibration step, adaptive proposal, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to accelerate the parameter estimation, resulting in an ABC approach with improved MCMC, denoted ABC-IMCMC. As a test of the classic ABC rejection algorithm and ABC-IMCMC, parameters are estimated in a nonequilibrium RANS model using reference data from direct numerical simulations of periodically sheared homogeneous turbulence. The use of ABC-IMCMC is then demonstrated to estimate parameters in the Menter shear-stress-transport (SST) model using experimental reference data for an axisymmetric transonic bump. This paper shows that the accuracy of the SST model for this test case can be improved using ABC-IMCMC, indicating that ABC-IMCMC is a promising method for the calibration of RANS models using a wide range of reference data.},

  abstract     = {Robustly identifying nonlinear mechanical systems is generally a challenging task, and this is particularly true when the structure under test exhibits nonlinear behaviors related to both stiffness and damping. In this work, a hybrid nonlinear identification approach is proposed by combining the restoring force surface (RFS) method and the nonlinear subspace identification method. The multiparameter nonlinear identification strategy is based on a first characterization conducted using the RFS method, followed by a nonlinear state-space representation using subspace algorithms. Two common friction simulation examples and one complex multi-degree-of-freedom system are employed to verify the proposed method. The effect of the measurement noise on the parameter estimation results is investigated by corrupting the previously generated output, adding different levels of Gaussian zero-mean noise. Results show that the nonlinear coefficients associated with the stiffness and damping nonlinearities can be identified with a high level of confidence, and the proposed method works well under different noise-level contaminations.},

  abstract     = {The rapidly growing communication demands in our society require the design of high-performance solid paraboloid antennas with extremely high surface accuracy, which remains a challenge due to the inevitable thermal deformations. This paper proposes a novel design of thermally stable segmented solid surface antenna with high surface accuracy. In this novel design, the antenna reflector is divided into a certain number of segmented pieces, each of which is then individually supported by an innovative thermally stable grid structure. An analytical model based on Sanders improved first-approximation shell theory is developed to predict the thermal deformation of antenna surface, with which the proposed segmenting method in improving the surface accuracy of reflector antenna is theoretically approved. The working mechanism of the proposed thermally stable grid structure that the thermal deformations at the supporting points can maintain a minimum level is verified using finite element analysis. A case study is performed in a practical environment to demonstrate that a segmented antenna supported by thermally stable grid structure can largely suppress the thermal deformation compared with a continuous surface antenna. This study provides a novel and useful engineering solution for paraboloid solid surface antennas to achieve extremely high surface accuracy under various thermal conditions.},

  abstract     = {Ice crystal icing has been identified as a risk to flight safety, due to its ability to reduce engine performance and its potential to cause engine damage and flameout. A critical factor in the sticking efficiency of ice crystals is the melting behavior of ice crystals. This paper presents an ice melting model integrated with surface blowing and porosity. A parametric study is performed to understand the effects of flow conditions (total pressure, humidity, total temperature, Mach number, and slip velocity) and particle properties (particle size, aspect ratio, and porosity factor) on ice melting behavior. The model is compared against the melting time of single ice particles in an acoustic levitator. The results show that employing sphericity and porosity could improve prediction performance. Surface blowing from evaporation increases melting time, and its effect is larger with a higher gas temperature. Ice melting time increases with pressure at high humidity, whereas an opposite trend is observed at low humidity. Increasing gas temperature, humidity, slip velocity, aspect ratio, and particle temperature can decrease ice melting time, whereas increasing Mach number, particle size, and porosity factor can increase ice melting time. Although wet bulb temperature can be used to evaluate ice melting potential when only one flow parameter is varied, it appears insufficient alone under scenarios where multiple flow parameters are changing simultaneously.},

The physical mechanism that causes the bimodal behavior is not well understood. Large-eddy simulations of a canonical junction flow geometry, the Rood wing, were carried out for a Reynolds number based on approach flow velocity and maximum thickness of 7000, and the junction flow physics were analyzed. The approach boundary-layer profile, mean flow data, and turbulent statistics obtained from the simulation are in good agreement with measurements at Penn State University. The present results for clearly exhibit a bimodal behavior that is characterized by a forward and backward motion and intermittent loss of coherence of the horseshoe vortex. Instantaneous flow visualizations reveal that the interaction of pockets of elevated upstream boundary-layer turbulence with the horseshoe vortex can both strengthen and weaken the horseshoe vortex. This suggests that the bimodal behavior may be triggered by the turbulent boundary layer. In addition, simulations with two different circular endwall fillets were carried out. In accordance with the literature, the fillets were found to suppress the bimodal behavior.},

  abstract     = {To mitigate the risk of wake vortex encounters during final approach, so-called plate lines have been developed. Wake vortices generated by landing aircraft induce secondary vortices at the plates’ surfaces that approach the primary vortices and trigger premature wake vortex decay. Each plate line consists of several upright plates being installed underneath the approach slope. While the plate line extends perpendicular to the flight direction, its individual plates are oriented in parallel to the runway centerline. To obtain the approval of the authorities for the installation of the plate lines at runway 16 of Vienna International Airport, the plate design had to comply with airport requirements like obstacle clearance, stability, and frangibility. During a six-month campaign, wake vortex behavior of about 9500 landings with and without plates was measured simultaneously by three lidars complemented by a comprehensive suite of meteorological instrumentation. The analysis of over 1000 measured wake vortex evolutions indicates that the plate lines reduce the lifetimes of the vortices in a safety corridor along the final approach by 22–37\% depending on the aircraft type. This corresponds to a reduction of vortex circulation by about 50\% for the most relevant International Civil Aviation Organization separation (Medium behind Heavy).},

This paper describes the data acquisition experiments that involved two laser beams propagating between an orbiting airborne platform and a stationary ground terminal over an 8 km slant path. Ground-based and in-flight measurements were collected simultaneously, and profiles were computed using the difference of differential-tilt variance (DDTV) technique. This paper describes the DDTV technique that enables the path-resolved measurement of turbulence strength resulting in profiles. The resulting turbulence profiles reveal what is believed to be the aero-optical contamination from the aircraft boundary layer within the statistics closest to the aircraft. Therefore, the contamination of the aero-optical environment can be quantified with respect to the rest of the atmospheric propagation path. Lastly, this paper presents analyses that compare the measured atmospheric turbulence profiles to state-of-the-art atmospheric models. The analyses extend beyond comparisons and show the measurement-versus-modeling comparison in terms of key directed energy system propagation parameters such as Greenwood frequency, coherence diameter, Rytov number, isoplanatic angle, Tyler frequency, open-loop jitter, and open-loop Strehl ratio. The slant path turbulence is analyzed in the context of air-to-ground and ground-to-air directed energy systems.},

The first is a more traditional open-jet configuration, where test section flow passes unbounded through the facility anechoic chamber. The second is a Kevlar® panel configuration, where a tensioned Kevlar sheet constrains the test section flow from the facility anechoic chamber. For both configurations, acoustic instrumentation is in the surrounding quiescent space. Both configurations are evaluated with a laser-based pulsed acoustic source, which provides unique capability for assessing the facility unsteady acoustic propagation characteristics. Metrics based on the wander and spread of the pulses are evaluated, and show that measurements using Kevlar walls experience dramatically reduced unsteady effects when compared to the open-jet configuration. This leads to a corresponding improvement in coherence between microphones with the Kevlar configuration, by reducing the variation in magnitude and phase differences between channels. Magnitude corrections for propagation through Kevlar as compared to open-jet propagation are calculated. Although limitations in the experimental setup make quantitative analysis difficult, qualitative analysis shows Kevlar magnitude corrections similar to those determined in previous literature. Directivity effects beyond those already present for open-jet configurations are minimal. When compared with the open-jet configuration, the background noise produced by the Kevlar is found to be its one drawback, showing significantly greater levels at high frequencies.},

  abstract     = {To understand the fundamental physics of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) actuator array for flow control, the flowfield induced by two successive DBD actuators is investigated under burst-mode actuation. The vortical structures generated by the actuators are revealed using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and high-speed schlieren visualization, allowing their interactions to be explored. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) are used to analyze the plasma-induced flow. Both POD and DMD modes indicate staggered vortical structures, whose dynamic features are associated with the burst frequency of the DBD actuation and its harmonics. The POD–DMD coherence indicates that the most relevant dynamic structure is also the most energetic. Spatial DMD analysis reveals an increase in the convection speeds of the flow structures from the upstream DBD actuator to the downstream DBD actuator. The effects of duty cycle and burst frequency on the coherent structures are explored. For different duty cycle cases, the most energetic mode structures evolve in a similar fashion. As the burst frequency increases, the size of the coherent structures decreases, but their number increases. Both POD and DMD analyses reveal that the burst frequency has a greater effect on the coherent structures than the duty cycle.},

Based on azimuthal and frequency mode decomposition of pressure signals at six circumferential positions, these oscillations are found to result from acoustic modes that are excited by PDC operation. This conclusion is verified by comparison with numerically calculated eigenmodes of the plenum. The impact of different operating parameters and the plenum outlet geometry on the acoustic oscillations are determined. The sequential firing of the PDC tubes at the lowest firing frequency in combination with a small blockage ratio was identified as the favorable configuration for the smallest acoustic fluctuations.},

Oxygen enrichment, in which fuel is premixed with oxygen, is a promising technique to overcome constraints in altitude due to low oxygen availability, and the difficulty to generate positive thrust at high Mach numbers. Large-eddy simulations of an inlet-fueled Mach 10 scramjet engine are performed to investigate the effect of oxygen enrichment on the flowfield and to characterize the turbulent combustion regimes. It is shown that combustion levels increase substantially with the addition of premixed oxygen, which leads to a considerable increase in combustion efficiency. It is shown that the mixing process is altered by oxygen enrichment in such a way that the observed increase in mixing efficiency is higher than the increase caused by premixing alone. Finally, the combustion regimes in the simulated engine are analyzed. This shows that combustion is mostly nonpremixed, and oxygen enrichment leads to an increase in premixed combustion, but without significantly altering turbulent combustion overall, which is distributed over a large range of regimes.},

Two classes of the supersonic modes, the radiation mode and the incoming mode, are distinguished according to their different group velocities in wall-normal direction. The radiation mode is more unstable than the incoming one, for which it is the dominant instability. It is also found that both the stable and unstable radiation modes can radiate slow acoustic waves into the freestream, and no coalescence occurs between the radiation mode and the wave of the slow acoustic spectrum. This process can only be predicted by the linear stability theory with the new boundary condition. The slow acoustic wave has no effect on the supersonic radiation mode.},

The experiments were carried out at Mach 2, and the planar shock wave was generated using a wedge-shaped shock generator with a turn angle of 10 deg. Measurements include steady and unsteady pressures, surface oil flow, and shadowgraph flow visualizations on the axisymmetric body. Results of the surface flow visualizations and steady pressure contours show that the separation on the body is an open-type region similar to that observed for 3-D SBLI canonical configurations. Flow separation on the surface is driven by pressure gradients caused by both the impingement of the oblique shock and the curvature of the body. Unsteady pressure measurements reveal that the shock impingement on the surface is governed by large-amplitude pressure fluctuations beneath the shock foot and flow reattachment regions.},

  abstract     = {Microramp vortex generators are robust, reliable, and simple devices for passively controlling the boundary layer in several aerospace applications. Various past studies have investigated the effectiveness of microramps in controlling the flow separation induced by shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions. Building upon the past knowledge, this paper reports a systematic investigation of the relation between the microramp geometry and the downstream flow characteristics. A simplified flow model of the microramp wake is provided to explain and predict the influence of changing the geometry on the circulation of the primary vortex pair. The model also provides scaling relations for the evolution of the wake characteristics (that is, wake velocity, wake location, and added incompressible momentum), incorporating the effect of all geometry parameters. Extensive experimental data have been used to validate the model.},

  abstract     = {Supersonic flow over a wall-mounted hemisphere was experimentally investigated to understand the shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions, flow separation, and other complex flow features associated with it. The experiments were carried out on a hemisphere mounted on the wind-tunnel floor at Mach 2 and a Reynolds number of 3.6 million. Measurements include oil flow visualizations, shadowgraph visualizations, and steady and unsteady pressure distributions on the floor and the hemisphere. Although the supersonic flow around the hemisphere and the shock/boundary-layer interactions associated with it share some similarities with well-documented supersonic flows over wall-mounted blunt bodies like cylinders and blunt fins, some marked differences unique to the hemisphere were noticeable in the present study. The triple point of the -shock structure formed ahead of the hemisphere due to the interaction between the separation shock and the bow shock made a significant excursion over the hemisphere. The excursion of the triple point over the hemisphere closely correlated with the movement of the separation shock rather than the bow shock. Strong vortex structures seemed to form at the foot of the reattachment bow shock repetitively and convect over the hemisphere. Unsteady pressure measurement results provided useful insights on the distribution of flow unsteadiness over the hemisphere.},

It remains a challenging problem for both computational and experimental analyses, with massive separation and coexistence of steady and unsteady regions. A number of researchers have studied the complex separated flow on the lee side. This paper focuses on the role played by the attached flow on the windward side. Solutions obtained with unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computation, shown to be in good agreement with experimental data, are used to investigate the contributions of the attached and separated regions of the flow to the forces acting on the body. A strongly unbalanced pressure distribution of the attached flow is responsible of most of the side force. A description of the crossflow structure is given to explain the large magnitude of the sectional side force, sometimes exceeding that of the normal force.},

A distinctive flow model, organized and chaotic, occurs in this regime driven by the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, and therefore the appearance of coherent structures such as the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. This phenomenon is crucial for designing transonic airfoils because it leads to a high rise in drag. Experimental observations show that the main variables of transonic airfoil flow are the freestream Mach number, the Reynolds number, and boundary-layer thickness. Simulations are performed to investigate the relation of various components of the shock/boundary-layer interaction, that is, the pressure rise to shock-induced separation, the length of the separation bubble, and the rear separation to the unit Reynolds number and the boundary-layer condition upstream of the shock. Flow around NACA0012 is investigated in a range of transonic Mach numbers at various unit Reynolds numbers. It is found that the bubble length on the airfoil changes rapidly with relatively small changes in the freestream Mach number. Simulation results show that the separation length decreases with increasing of the unit Reynolds number; however, increasing the boundary-layer thickness results in an increase in the bubble’s extent. Evaluation of the rear-separation region shows that, as the Reynolds number increases, the length of the rear separation declines at a given Mach number.},

In the present work, a temperature-sensitive paint was used to systematically study boundary-layer transition on the suction side of a DU 91-W2-250 airfoil. The experiments were performed in the High-Pressure Wind Tunnel Göttingen at chord Reynolds numbers up to 12 million and angles of attack from to 20°. The coefficients of airfoil lift, drag, and pitching moment were also obtained after integration of the pressure distributions measured on the surface and in the wake of the wind-tunnel model. The global information obtained via temperature-sensitive paint not only enabled the analysis of the change in the transition location with varying angle of attack and chord Reynolds number, but also provided an explanation for the evolution of the aerodynamic coefficients measured at stall and poststall conditions. The stability of the laminar boundary layers investigated in the experiments was analyzed according to linear stability theory. The results of the stability computations supported the experimentally observed variations in the transition location. The amplification factors of boundary-layer disturbances at transition were also determined by correlating the experimental and numerical results.},

For a Clark-Y airfoil, changes in the drag, the lift, and the lift-to-drag ratio are found to be caused by different mechanisms depending on the type and locations of control input. Improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio by body forces is achieved by both pressure drag reduction and pressure lift enhancement. The effective angle for blowing/suction is nearly normal to the surface, and blowing around the leading edge and blowing/suction on the lower/upper surface near the trailing edge improve the lift-to-drag ratio effectively. Investigation on the control amplitude reveals that the present sensitivity analysis is valid when the blowing/suction velocity is less than 1\% of the freestream velocity. The sensitivities are observed to be slightly weakened by decreasing the Reynolds number due to the difference in the baseline drag and lift coefficients, whereas the higher angle of attack is found to raise the sensitivities. Finally, the similar sensitivity analysis is performed also for NACA4412 and NACA0012, and it is found that slight differences in the shape result in substantial differences in the sensitivities.},

Two comprehensive metrics, designed to account for the additional energy required by the control, are introduced to evaluate the net aerodynamic performance enhancements. The study confirms previous findings for suction-side boundary-layer control and demonstrates the interesting potential of blowing on the pressure side under various conditions, which achieves a maximum total net drag saving of 14\% within the considered parameter space.

In this work, the natural-laminar-flow airfoil at and pitches with a constant nondimensional rate of from an initial incidence angle of 4 deg to angles of attack beyond the onset of dynamic stall. It is found that the transition of the NLF-0414’s unsteady boundary layer during the pitchup is much more abrupt than the standard airfoil sections before the formation of the laminar separation bubble. Once the laminar separation bubble is established near the leading edge, the overall dynamic stall process of the NLF-0414 evolves very similarly to that of the SD 7003 and the NACA 0012. Minor differences are observed in the formation of the turbulent separation vortex near the trailing edge and convection of the dynamic stall and shear-layer vortices. The dynamic stall of the NLF-0414 airfoil more closely resembles that of the SD 7003 and the NACA 0012 at reduced Reynolds numbers, suggesting that the extended laminar flow acts to delay Reynolds number effects of traditional airfoil profiles.},

Two designs of the junction, a backward-facing step (BFS) and a backward-facing notch (BFN), are first evaluated to identify three linear frequency bands (high, medium, and low) of the shear layer instabilities. Compared with BFS, the laminar flow and linear instabilities of BFN are largely insensitive to the incoming boundary layer thickness and show relatively weaker low-frequency unsteadiness. Subsequent linear analysis of the combined ramp and BFN junction identifies a two-dimensional Kelvin–Helmholtz (K-H) instability within the ramp separation, the spectral signature of which extends further downstream. Corresponding large-eddy simulation (LES) predicts transition over the ramp and a turbulized boundary layer at the BFN junction. Modal analysis of LES shows that transition is primarily driven by the breakdown of Görtler vortices due to secondary instabilities, which are tailored by the two-dimensional K-H mode of the ramp separation. The linear analysis provides a reasonable estimate of the pre-transition LES spectrum. The topology of the BFN junction includes streamwise vortices within the turbulent separation bubble, and low-frequency convecting structures further downstream. Statistical parameters from LES indicate strong non-equilibrium effects in the boundary layer post-transition.},

  abstract     = {Smooth morphing trailing edge (SMTE) has been receiving more attention as a new wing design concept in the past few years due to its high potential in reducing cruise drag, structural weight, aerodynamic noise, and fuel consumption. Apart from the necessity of using new flexible materials and compact actuation mechanisms, it is also faced with the challenge of providing sufficient lift as conventional high-lift devices did during low-speed flight phases. Insufficient low-speed aerodynamics could compromise aircraft takeoff and landing performance. In light of this, a concept of the embedded slot is proposed for use with SMTE. To study the full benefits of the embedded slot, constrained single-objective optimization is first conducted on a two-dimensional airfoil using kriging surrogate models built from Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solutions. The final optimal results show that the maximum lift coefficient from SMTE with a slot is only slightly lower than that of a typical three-element Fowler flap. The parametric analysis showed the strong coupling effects on the aerodynamic performance of slot entry and exit geometry dimensions. Based on the optimal two-dimensional slot design, computer-aided design models of three-dimensional SMTE configurations are built and analyzed. Comparisons among High-Lift Common Research Model SMTEs with and without slot show that the embedded slot improved high-lift performance. After introducing the embedded slot, the maximum lift coefficient for SMTE is raised by 7.9\% from 2.277 to 2.457, and the stall angle is increased by 2 deg. This is in comparison with the maximum lift coefficient of 2.572 for the conventional Common Research Model Fowler flap configuration. The results demonstrated the benefits of introducing embedded slot into SMTE for future high-lift designs.},

A wall-to-wall NACA 0006 wing is bisected about the midchord for a 50\%-chord flap length. Experiments are performed in a water tunnel at a chord-based Reynolds number of . The wing is driven in a sinusoidal vertical plunge motion as a spatially uniform, temporally varying surrogate to a vertical disturbance. Concurrently, the flap is actively deflected in a survey of kinematic parameters designed to suppress the influence of a plunge-induced disturbance. Plunge rates explored amount to disturbances incurred over a temporal range from one convective time to eight convective times. Two methodologies are employed to guide selection of flap deflection phase and amplitude necessary to preserve the baseline zero-lift state of the undisturbed wing. In the first method, Theodorsen’s model is applied to arrive at an analytical solution to flap kinematics for a given prescribed plunge history. The theoretical derivation makes the standard assumptions of attached flow, planar wake, and no leading-edge vortical formations. Direct force measurements reveal reduction in lift transients by flap actuation of up to 87\%, verifying the applicability of Theodorsen’s classical model. Further improvement is sought in a second method where empirical state-space modeling is formulated for lift cancellation. In this approach two separate lift models for wing plunge and flap deflection are constructed independently, and their superposition is employed to approximate the total lift in combined plunge and deflection motions. It is shown that although the empirical state-space approach performs similar to the inviscid theory of Theodorsen’s model, the empirical model proves more effective in suppressing the formation of the leading-edge vortex induced by plunge.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the dynamics and adaptive control of an airfoil with structural stiffness and damping uncertainties, which is subjected to atmospheric gusts. The motion of the airfoil is modeled by three degrees of freedom (DOFs), namely, pitch, plunge, and flap. A flat spot or dead-zone-type stiffness is used for modeling the flap hinge free play. The nonlinear dynamics of the system without control and parametric uncertainty, where a cubic stiffness for pitch and a linear stiffness for plunge are considered, is examined. Numerical results show that the airfoil may become unstable via a Hopf bifurcation at a flow velocity well below the linear flutter speed; if the structural damping is not sufficiently high, it may also undergo chaotic motion. It was found that a proportional–derivative controller based on the partial feedback linearized system could effectively alleviate oscillations induced by gusts at flow velocities below and above the linear flutter speed. Next, an uncertain th-order polynomial stiffness for pitch and uncertain structural damping (modeled by viscous damping) coefficients for all DOFs are assumed. Considering such uncertainties, an adaptive controller with an estimation update law is designed to stabilize the airfoil subjected to gusts. A Lyapunov function is established to prove the stability of the closed-loop system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed controller.},

The buckling mode is postulated as a high-order polynomial. Six novel closed-form solutions are found by the semi-inverse technique. These solutions can be used as benchmark problems with which numerous approximate solution techniques can be tested. Technical novelty consists in searching solutions via semi-inverse method, namely, by postulating the mode shape and searching for the variable flexural rigidity that matches the mode shape. The method is not universal in the sense that it does not develop method of finding the buckling loads for any, arbitrarily, axially graded columns; rather it furnishes closed-form solutions for flexural rigidity grading for columns that might possess the seventh-order polynomial mode shape. Still, this finding appears to be remarkable because it delivers the closed-form solution for the buckling loads.},

The conditions of the hygrothermal stability of interlayer hybrid laminates are derived, which are suitable for most elastic materials. Three types of multicoupled interlayer hybrid laminates capable of constituting self-adaptive structures with extension–shear coupling are designed. An example of 18–22 plies laminates is chosen to realize the optimization of maximum extension–shear coupling by the Differential Evolution algorithm. The influences of multicouplings on the mechanical properties of structures are analyzed, including hygrothermal stability, extension–shear coupling, yield load, and buckling load. The feasibility of stacking sequences and effectiveness of the mechanical properties are verified, respectively, through the robustness analysis and finite element method numerical simulation. Based on the Monte Carlo method, the robustness analysis caused by angular deviation is achieved for hybrid laminates, and the confidence intervals are obtained.},

For the last 60 years, traditional quad laminates (quad) based on collections of 0, 90 plies have controlled composite laminates. However, restriction to four specific angle orientations has unnecessarily limited design and production. The newly discovered laminate family, called double–double laminates (DD), based on two pairs of angle-plies, can redirect the trend instead toward simplicity and rationality. Advantages enabled by DD include homogenization, tapering to save weight, ply drop placement to improve quality, and card sliding to simplify ply stacking. A switch from quad to DD laminates can bring a renaissance to the composites industry for the production of better airplanes, cars, and other important engineering applications.},

Two data processing methods to calculate the Stanton number and recovery factor simultaneously are presented, using the experimentally measured wall temperature in a hypersonic wind-tunnel test. The first method is the linear fitting of the measured temperature and calculated heat flux. The second method is to solve an inverse problem of a one-dimensional transient heat conduction equation with the convection boundary condition. Distributions of heat flux, Stanton number, and recovery factor for the flared cone with a smooth wall or wavy wall are obtained. Compared with the smooth wall, the wavy wall can remove the local high Stanton number region before the boundary-layer transition. In addition, the wavy wall can reduce the growth rate of Stanton number in the boundary-layer transition and delay the transition process.},

The main focus is to provide an advanced model for the accurate prediction of the interlaminar three-dimensional stress state of shells subjected to large displacements/rotations, buckling, and snap-through phenomena. In this context, a two-dimensional shell finite element based on the Carrera unified formulation (CUF) is formulated in an orthogonal curvilinear reference system. Thanks to CUF, the governing equations are expressed in terms of fundamental nuclei, which are invariant of the shell theory approximation order. Thus, classical theories of structures to layerwise approaches can be implemented with ease and in a unified manner. The full Green–Lagrange strain tensor is employed because far nonlinear regimes are investigated. Furthermore, the geometrical nonlinear equations are written in a total Lagrangian framework and solved with an opportune Newton–Raphson method along with a path-following approach based on the arc-length constraint. The results demonstrate that classical theories may bring to wrong and unconservative stress predictions, especially in nonlinear equilibrium states, where the use of advanced and layerwise approaches shall be recommended.},

  abstract     = {The corrugated core sandwich structure is a potential candidate for the integrated thermal protection system (ITPS) of reusable launch vehicles (RLVs). The sandwich structure can develop a significant thickness-wise thermal gradient during operation, resulting in a temperature-dependent property variation along the cross section as well as thermal stresses. In this work, a homogenization method has been developed that incorporates these effects into the first-order shear deformation plate theory to facilitate thermomechanical structural analysis of RLV components such as wings, fuselage, etc., with the ITPS sandwich panels represented as thick orthotropic plates. The formulation expands the classical plate theory by assuming a polynomial form of thickness-wise temperature variation, as well as a linear dependence of elastic moduli and thermal expansion coefficients on temperature. This expansion introduces unknown constants into the homogenized model that could then be evaluated from unit-cell analyses with periodic boundary conditions and beam analyses of the corrugated core sandwich structure. The accuracy of the homogenized plate has been demonstrated by comparing its response with a full-scale model for a uniform and spatially varying in-plane temperature field. For both cases, a thickness-wise linear temperature variation has been used. The comparisons show that the homogenization approach is reasonably accurate in capturing the midplane deflections as well as stresses on the face sheets. An error of less than 1\% could be seen in the maximum midplane transverse deflection for the problem with a spatially varying in-plane temperature field.},

The approach implemented an actuation-driven parametric model for a hinged-flap concept. The optimization methodology incorporates an adaptive data sampling method in the update of a series of surrogate models. Inclusion of an actuation mechanism in the definition of the model eliminated a large number of gap and overlap settings that are not practically possible, leading to further savings in the number of computational fluid dynamic calculations required. Parameters for the actuation definition, flap geometries, and spoiler settings are included simultaneously in the optimization in order to consider the interactions among these factors and to obtain near-global-optimal solutions. Compared with a traditional sequential shape/mechanism optimization methodology, which can only produce one design point meeting the landing requirement, a series of design points can be obtained from the proposed methodology, meeting the requirements for both takeoff and landing configurations. The optimal result not only significantly improves at an angle of attack of eight by 17.8\% but also decreases the distance between the hinge and the lower surface of the airfoil by 22.4\%, which can reduce the fairing size. Comparisons are given between the optimized ADHF and the traditional Fowler flap, along with detailed analysis on the potential benefits by supplementing the design with spoiler deflections.},

A reduced-order computational aeroacoustic model is constructed in order to implement the nonparametric probabilistic model of uncertainties induced by the modeling errors in the aeroacoustic model and in the liner model. In addition, the uncertainties on the acoustic excitation induced by the fan are taken into account using the parametric probabilistic approach.

The validity of the model is examined on a flow-duct facility, and the liner impedances are obtained from an impedance eduction method. The proposed model shows a reasonable agreement with the educed data, and better accuracy is found in terms of the transmission loss. Geometric parameters including the length of the extended tube and the grazing-flow speed are then investigated. It is found that the frequency for maximum attenuation is shifted to lower frequencies for a longer extended tube, but it is less sensitive to the grazing-flow speed.

  abstract     = {Holographic reconstructions of the sound field in the vicinity of a tied-down F-35 aircraft were achieved by applying multisource statistically optimized near-field acoustical holography to measurements taken at a linear ground array approximately parallel to the shear layer of the jet. The measured field, as well as reconstructions to locations where the field was not measured, show that the field can be described as a superposition of multiple lobes in the spatiospectral domain. These lobes are observed in the field when the aircraft is operated at a variety of engine powers, including afterburner. For a given engine power, as frequency is increased, the spatial lobes in the mixing-noise region shift aft in directivity until they disappear beyond the aperture of the measurement while new ones appear toward the sideline and shift aft with the others. At a fixed frequency, when engine power is increased, the forward-most spatial lobe increases in level more than the other lobes, which is a major factor in the observed forward shift in overall directivity with increasing engine power. Frequency-dependent raytracing of the spatial lobes gives insight into the directivity and apparent source locations for jet noise components as a function of frequency and engine power.},

In this paper, hybrid large-eddy simulation (LES) and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) is performed to investigate the serration effects on installed jet flows and acoustics in an industrially relevant configuration: an ultra-high-bypass-ratio aeroengine mounted under a three-dimensional wing. The results show that the serrations are able to weaken jet and wing interactions, and consequently reduce far-field installation noise. The noise reduction mechanisms have been sought through the quadrupole sources in the jet plume and evanescent pressure wave scattering at the wing trailing edge.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies of postflutter limit-cycle oscillations (LCOs) have suggested the presence/effects of a nonlinear structural damping in addition to other potential sources of nonlinearity. Such a nonlinearity occurs, for example, for structures with linear viscoelastic properties when their responses are in the nonlinear geometric regime. The present effort focuses on such situations; first on developing a structural reduced-order model (ROM) which could be used in aeroelastic analyses. Adopting a linear Kelvin–Voigt constitutive model in the undeformed configuration, the ROM governing equations are obtained and found to be of a generalized Van der Pol–Duffing form. A nonintrusive identification approach is next developed to determine the parameters of these governing equations from a structural finite element model constructed in a commercial software. Finally, the effects of this nonlinear damping on postflutter response are analyzed on the Goland wing assuming a linear aerodynamic model. It is found that the nonlinearity in the damping can stabilize the unstable aerodynamics and lead to finite amplitude limit-cycle oscillations, even when the stiffness-related nonlinear geometric effects and aerodynamic nonlinearities are neglected. The dependence of the LCO amplitude and frequency on the parameters of the Kelvin–Voigt model is analyzed to provide insight into this nonlinearity.},

This work uses a parametric reduced order model (PROM) that can adjust the system stiffness based on the rotational speed within the reduced space. Component mode mistuning was coupled with the PROM to create a mistuned model capable of capturing the mistuned system dynamics.

Such metrics are widely used in scientific computing for adaptation, but the solution metrics are not smooth, which adversely affects adaptation. A novel algorithm is proposed in this paper to smooth the metric as a whole and to improve anisotropic mesh-size gradation. First, the concept of Log–Euclidean metrics is used to convert the metric tensors from the Riemannian space into a Euclidean space. Then, the variations of metric tensors are limited by constraining the gradients of metric tensors in this space over the region of each background mesh element. Finally, a convex nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to smooth the metric tensors over the entire meshing domain. Theoretical analysis reveals the existence of a globally optimal smoothed sizing function. Numerical experiments on anisotropic meshes in both analytical and real laminar and turbulent flow cases are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Type I fluid with different viscosities and Type IV fluids were tested. The CFD simulations considered only 0.6 m plate model. The effect of viscosity alteration causes an ensemble of consequences, which together caused a delay and decrease in the initial flow-off rate. These are the alterations in the wind tunnel speed for wave onset, in the wave speeds and in the flow-off process at the trailing edge. The CFD simulations supported most of the reasoning for fluid viscosity effects on fluid flow-off. However, the effect of viscosity was considerably exaggerated in simulations. Based on a simplified relation between air velocity and fluid flow-off rate, a scaling model for wind tunnel tests was created. A dimensionless parameter was found to scale the model dimensions and to consider the wind tunnel speed sequence.},

Three grid-related components (metric building, metric-based grid generation, and solution interpolation) in conjunction with a large-eddy simulation solver based on the thickened flame model were used to implement anisotropic mesh adaptation. The results show the following: 1) The proposed mesh generation always led to a grid with high quality overall. 2) It has a remarkable capability to reduce computational cost while improving the numerical resolution. 3) A joint metric based on multiple fields should be used to ensure the accuracy of the computed velocity field and the interface between species. 4) The increase in computational cost incurred by grid-related operation was small enough to be ignored compared with the remarkable reduction in overall computational cost. 5) We simulated turbulent premixed combustion, and the statistical mean flows obtained were in good agreement with experimental measurements.},

The spatial evolution of a target volume is probabilistically described by a Gaussian mixture model propagated using Taylor’s hypothesis. The identified linear model is then required to track a reference output that creates negative wall-normal velocity along the predicted trajectory. Under the model predictive control framework, an output tracking optimal control problem with input constraints is solved at each time step as new targets are taken into account on the fly, yielding an input signal that effectively drives the target volumes toward the wall while avoiding excessive actuation. The effectiveness of the control scheme is demonstrated by steering passive volumes as well as synthetically generated vortical structures, suggesting the potential of this method to be used in novel flow-control strategies that selectively displace vortical structures in boundary layers.},

Five inflow parameters (freestream Mach number, freestream pressure, freestream temperature, wall temperature, and angle of attack) are chosen as the uncertainty variables. The transition predictions are obtained using Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations with the -- transition model. The point-collocation nonintrusive polynomial chaos method is employed to describe and propagate the uncertainty of the output quantities of interests. Moreover, the Sobol index is adopted to quantify the contribution of each variable to the total uncertainty. Our results reveal that small changes (less than 3.4\%) in the inflow parameters could yield roughly 10\% uncertainty in the transition lengths and more than 15\% uncertainty in the transitional aeroheating and skin friction. The freestream temperature and angle of attack strongly influence the transitional aeroheating. The angle of attack, freestream pressure, and freestream temperature are the major uncertainty contributors to the skin friction. The freestream pressure and angle of attack significantly impact the transition onset and length.},

However, for industrial applications, the degradation of robustness and efficiency of adjoint solvers for edge-of-the-envelope conditions still poses a challenge to the successful deployment of adjoint methods in the industry. This work attempts to alleviate such problems by using the Newton–Krylov method to solve both the flow and adjoint equations. The developed parallel adjoint solver reuses the Jacobian matrix computed by the flow solver and obtains the adjoint matrix–vector product via an accumulative parallel communication. Consequently, the development of an adjoint solver is significantly simplified, as reverse differentiation is not needed. Combining an already validated Newton–Krylov flow solver with the adjoint solver developed in this work, robust and efficient residual convergence is demonstrated for representative turbomachinery cases, including an axial and a centrifugal compressor. The compressor maps are first computed and adjoint solutions for both design and typical off-design conditions are calculated. Design sensitivities are computed using the adjoint approach and verified against finite differences. Compared with a representative implicit scheme, the Newton–Krylov approach allows the flow, adjoint, and sensitivities to be stably computed over a wider operating range, which facilitates whole-map adjoint aerodynamic shape optimization for turbomachinery components.},

Here, locust tandem wings are subjected to a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation using two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3-D) Navier–Stokes equations, revealing fore–hindwing interactions and the influence of their corrugations on aerodynamic performance. Furthermore, the obtained CFD results are mathematically parameterized using the PARSEC method and optimized based on a novel fusion of genetic algorithms and Nash game theory to achieve Nash equilibrium. It was concluded that the lift–drag (gliding) ratio of the optimized profiles were improved by at least 77\% and 150\% compared to the original wing and the published literature, respectively. Ultimately, the profiles are integrated and analyzed using 3-D CFD simulations that demonstrated a 14\% performance improvement, validating the proposed wing models for further fabrication and rapid prototyping presented in a future study.},

  abstract     = {The aerodynamic design of modern civil aircraft requires a true sense of intelligence since it requires a good understanding of transonic aerodynamics and sufficient experience. Reinforcement learning is an artificial general intelligence that can learn sophisticated skills by trial and error, rather than by simply extracting features or making predictions from data. The present paper uses a deep reinforcement-learning algorithm to learn the policy for reducing the aerodynamic drag of supercritical airfoils. The policy is designed to take actions based on features of the wall Mach number distribution so that the learned policy can be more general. The initial policy for reinforcement learning is pretrained through imitation learning, and the result is compared with randomly generated initial policies. The policy is then trained in environments based on surrogate models, of which the mean drag reduction of 200 airfoils can be effectively improved by reinforcement learning. The policy is also tested by multiple airfoils in different flow conditions using computational fluid dynamics calculations. The results show that the policy is effective in both the training condition and other similar conditions, and the policy can be applied repeatedly to achieve greater drag reduction.},

  abstract     = {During the pullout maneuver, peregrine falcons were observed to adopt a succession of specific flight configurations that are thought to offer an aerodynamic advantage over aerial prey. Analysis of the flight trajectory of a falcon in a controlled environment shows it experiencing load factors up to , and further predictions suggest this could be increased up to almost during high-speed pullout. This can be attributed to the high maneuverability promoted by lift-generating vortical structures over the wing. Wind-tunnel experiments on life-sized models in the different configurations together with high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations (large-eddy simulations) show that deploying the hand wing in a pullout creates extra vortex lift, which is similar to that of combat aircraft with delta wings. The aerodynamic forces and the position of the aerodynamic center were calculated from the simulations of the flow around the different configurations. This allowed for an analysis of the longitudinal static stability in the early pullout phase, confirming that the falcon is flying unstably in pitch with a positive slope in the pitching moment and a trim angle of attack of about 5 deg, which is possibly to maximize responsiveness. The hand wings/primaries were seen to contribute to the augmented stability, acting as “elevons” would on a tailless blended-wing/body aircraft.},

The experiments were carried out at a low Reynolds number of , where the transition to turbulent flow still occurred on the suction side of the airfoil. The leading-edge patterns of the models were produced by using only either one wave function or one superposition of two wave functions. Two tubercle models with uniform distribution and nine more realistic biomimicked airfoil models with amplitude modulation in tubercle geometry were tested in experiments. Force measurements showed that when compared to the baseline model, models with tubercles did not experience a sudden loss of lift and have higher lift coefficients in the poststall regime, irrespective of the model. It was found that the W15 model performs best in terms of maximum lift coefficient, stall angle, aerodynamic performance in the poststall regime; as well as in terms of the minimum fluctuating lift coefficient in both pre- and poststall regimes. Enhancement of aerodynamic performance is due to the presence of stall cell formation with the counter-rotating vortex pairs and three-dimensional spanwise flow pattern initiated by leading-edge tubercles at the poststall regime.},

Two types of vortex structures are observed. For , jets penetrate into the crossflow, and distinct, asymmetrical vortex rings are produced. For , as well as for , starting jets attach to the wall as leading vortex half-rings are formed. The latter type is better suited to energize the boundary layer as low-momentum fluid is shifted away from the surface and high-momentum fluid from the freestream is entrained into the jet wake. In terms of the overall gain in streamwise momentum, the impulse provided due to overpressure during the rapid jet initiation is of major importance in the present study, and its exploitation may enable a significant enhancement in future flow control applications.},

The behavior of the jet is examined in the near-field area, immediately downstream of the nozzle exit plane, to determine the parameters influencing the characteristics of the jet. The Mach reflection phenomenon is thoroughly studied, and a criterion is defined for the transformation from regular reflection to Mach reflection. Furthermore, the location and height of the Mach disk are found to be governed by the exit pressure ratio, the stagnation temperature, and the type of gas used. Although the temperature does not have a significant impact, the pressure ratio and specific heat ratio are found to affect the jet structure.

The mixed-fidelity low-boom MDO problem aims to enforce the weight consistency for CFD-based low-boom inverse design optimization: the optimum low-boom configuration is designed for the weight at the start of cruise of the same configuration for the low-boom overland mission. Moreover, it also seeks the optimum trades between the maximum takeoff gross weight (MTOGW), cruise Mach, and range for the low-boom overland mission while meeting the requirement of flying a transatlantic overwater mission. A block coordinate optimization (BCO) method is developed to find an approximate solution of the mixed-fidelity low-boom MDO problem. The BCO method is successfully applied to generate two CFD-based low-boom configurations that closely match two reversed equivalent area targets with ground noise levels below 70 PLdB, respectively. Moreover, these CFD-based low-boom configurations can be obtained with minor wing modifications from the solutions of the low-fidelity MDO problem. The low-fidelity MDO solutions are Pareto points for constrained multi-objective optimization of MTOGW, low-boom cruise Mach, and low-boom range. The best low-fidelity MDO concept flies at cruise Mach 1.8 for a low-boom overland mission with range of 2950 nm and an overwater mission with range of 3600 nm.},

The proposed method is based on a coupling relation between skin friction and surface pressure, where the boundary enstrophy flux is suitably modeled or approximated. This method is applied to unsteady PSP data obtained in incident SWBLIs at Mach 2.5 for different Reynolds numbers, revealing the skin-friction structures of the flows: particularly, the separation bubble induced by the incident shock wave.

The integrated vortex-generating shock control bump is parameterized as a whole, in a manner that the contour bump is designed for shock control and the vortex-generating fins are integrated to the contour bump for separation control. This allows the balance between the two factors affecting the total wing drag. The optimization studies based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations have been carried out to find the optimal vortex-generating bump designs at the given design conditions. Single-point and multipoint global optimizations are carried out to search the optimum parameters at the corresponding design points. It is found that the vortex-generating bump can further reduce the total drag at the higher transonic Mach numbers due to the alleviation of after-bump streamwise separation by a pair of counter-rotating vortices generated. The inclusion of the vortex generators in the bump design allows for a better balance of the design in controlling both the shock strength and the flow separation after the bump at higher Mach numbers. A multipoint optimization leads to a robust vortex-generating bump design for a range of Mach numbers. The distinctive vortical flow structures induced by the vortex-generating bump are highlighted and discussed.},

The study examines the effect of Reynolds numbers on the fin-generated shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions (SBLIs) and the practical limits imposed on such scaling due to different test facilities. The present study involves a parametric variation of the incoming Mach number, fin angle of attack, and a wide range of unit Reynolds numbers in combination with advanced flowfield diagnostics. The results indicate that the interaction footprint is distinctly affected by the Reynolds number, though the effects are more prominent near the fin/surface junction and the outer edges of the interaction region. The results suggest that the effect of the Reynolds number on the SBLI is significantly reduced at higher Reynolds numbers. This sensitivity to Reynolds number is a function of the fin angle of incidence and freestream Mach number, with weaker strength interactions being more receptive to Reynolds number variation. Identical measurements carried out in facilities of different size compare favorably throughout the interaction region with Reynolds-based scaling; however, incoming boundary-layer thickness imposes limitations on the extent of the inception region and the onset of finite fin effects.},

The results show that a significant hysteresis occurs in the shock train position during the backpressure cyclic variation process. It is found that a large-scale subsonic wake flow region forms behind the ramp when the shock train reaches the ramp trailing edge. The capability of the ramp to retain the existence of the wake flow determines the occurrence of the hysteresis. The effects of the ramp height and width on the hysteresis were examined.

A systematic investigation is carried out varying the blockage of the intake channel, and, in particular, three blockage levels are investigated as far as their effect on the flow. The analysis shows that two main unsteady phenomena occur, the former at high frequency (little buzz) and the latter at low frequency (big buzz). When the intake channel is entirely opened, only the little buzz is present, whereas in partially blocked conditions, the big buzz prevails. This paper will show how the big buzz is correlated to the convection of high-density, high-pressure spots from the entrance of the intake channel, which creates the oscillatory unsteady behavior.},

The frequency-dependence damping effectiveness is investigated, as are any other side effects the porous coating might have on the mean flow. It is found that the second-mode instability, which dominates the high-Mach number flow regime, is strongly suppressed for all excitation frequencies considered. The DNS solutions are also found to compare favorably with linearized stability theory.

  abstract     = {High-enthalpy hypersonic boundary-layer transition plays an important role in many entry/descent vehicles. The aerothermodynamic performance of these vehicles strongly depends on the transition location on the surface. However, detailed transition flow physics in these chemically reacting boundary layers are poorly understood and transition estimates during the design phase rely heavily on empirically derived transition criteria such as . One of the most intriguing characteristics in hypersonic boundary layers is the presence of unstable supersonic modes, first identified in the 1990s. Due to a recent surge in hypersonic applications, there has been renewed interest in studying the flow physics of supersonic modes using either theory or direct numerical simulations. This paper investigates the rise of supersonic modes in a high-enthalpy hypersonic flow over a 5 deg half-angle cone at various wall temperatures using both quasi-parallel linear stability theory and linear parabolized stability equations (PSEs). It was found that supersonic modes exist in all wall temperature conditions, including the adiabatic wall case. A cooler wall temperature causes the second Mack mode to become an unstable supersonic mode naturally downstream of the upper-branch neutral location when the wall is sufficiently cooled. In terms of the integrated growth, the second mode is still the dominant mode. Nonetheless, supersonic modes can cause additional series of relatively weaker growth than that of the second mode beyond the peak amplitude location. According to the present linear PSE results, the formation of unstable supersonic modes is mainly associated with the synchronization of phase speed between the instability and acoustic waves in a nonparallel boundary layer, and not due to nonlinear modal interaction as suggested in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Velocity-slip and temperature-jump effects on sharp leading-edge geometries are studied for three canonical hypersonic flows: the hollow-cylinder-flare, the double-cone, and the double-wedge. Simulation results are compared between the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method that naturally captures slip effects and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using an appropriate slip model. Only the leading-edge portions of these flow configurations are studied. The simulations are verified to be converged in terms of grid and particle resolution. Overall, excellent agreement is found between DSMC and CFD predictions of the leading-edge boundary layer, the magnitude of velocity-slip and temperature-jump, and surface heat flux for all cases considered, with the exception of the double-cone case due to the relatively high Knudsen number of the flow. The largest discrepancies were found for the double-cone (transitional flow conditions), and near-exact agreement was found for the double-wedge (continuum flow conditions). It was determined that slip effects cannot account for the discrepancy between CFD predictions and experimentally measured heat flux for the hollow-cylinder flare. Furthermore, it was determined that the previously recommended threshold for the continuum breakdown parameter might be overly conservative in the near-wall region if appropriate slip models are used in CFD.},

  abstract     = {High-fidelity three-dimensional numerical simulations are analyzed to investigate cratering on a granular bed of particles due to a supersonic multi-species fluid jet. In the simulations, the volume-averaged two-phase equations are solved with a multi-species large-eddy simulation formulation for the fluid and a kinetic-theory-based model for the particle bed. The simulations vary according to the ratio of the jet-to-ambient-fluid density (and pressure) and the ambient density. The characteristics of the jets and crater are different according to the cross-sectional shape, which is determined by the jet/ambient density ratio: a conical shape is observed when the ratio is near unity, and a parabolic shape occurs when this ratio is large. Craters are characterized by their diameter, an upper depth, and a lower depth, with the difference between the two depths accounting for the granular medium compaction zone. The variation of the crater diameter timewise evolution is evaluated, and the evolution of the ratio between the upper or lower crater depths and the crater diameter is examined. Joint probability density functions of the Mach number based either on the fluid velocity or the relative velocity between the fluid and particles show that a large portion of the granular medium is dominated by subsonic conditions. The azimuthally averaged ejecta’s radial variation is inspected, and joint probability density functions elucidate the regions where gravity effects are important.},

The wind-tunnel measurements included the acquisition of force and moment data, steady pressure data, as well as surface flow visualization using minitufts. For some select cases, numerical simulations were performed to aid in understanding the wind-tunnel data. Wind-tunnel tests, with and without the nacelle/pylon, indicated a lift degradation of the conventional CRM-HL at high angles of attack. The surface flow visualization with fluorescent minitufts revealed that the lift degradation is due to flow separation caused by the nacelle/pylon vortex system on the inboard wing. The consequent flow separation was successfully mitigated using a nacelle chine installed on the inboard side of the engine nacelle.},

The load transfer functions are used as an intermediate variable for topology optimization. This approach uses the total variation to minimize different objective functions such as the norm of the stress tensor and deviatoric principal stress subjected to equilibrium. To attain the topology of the microstructure, the principal load paths that follow the optimized principal stress directions are calculated. The principal vector field has singularities that are removed by an interpolation scheme. The optimal periodic microstructure is constructed using the load functions and the microstructures’ dimensions. The first advantage of this scheme is that using the load functions reduces the number of equilibrium constraints from two to one and reduces the number of variables from three stress tensor components to two load functions, leading to computational cost savings. The second advantage is that the nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations derived from the total variation equations are solved using the Gauss–Newton method, which has a quadratic convergence, speeding up the convergence toward the optimal structure. The third feature of the load-path-based optimization method is that the equilibrium and optimization problems are solved simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Flight and ground test applications for in-flow and near-wall flow temperature sensing demand robust and accurate sensing, making thermocouple sensors attractive. Even for these extremely well-developed sensors, an accurate prediction of stresses within thermocouple sheaths for custom-configured probes remains a topic of great concern for ensuring an adequate lifetime of sensors. In contemporary practice, high-fidelity simulations must be run to prove survivability, albeit at significant time and expense. Given the resources it takes to run high-fidelity simulations, rapid optimization of sensor configurations is often impossible or, at a minimum, impractical. The developments presented in this paper address the need for high-temperature sensor structural predictions that are compatible with rapid design iteration. The derivation and implementation of a new analytical, low-order model to predict stresses within the sheath of a thermocouple are provided. The analytical model is compared to three-dimensional elastic finite element method simulations as well as experimental data from a simplified configuration. The low-order model sheath stress predictions, which are critical to probe survival, are in excellent agreement with the numerically simulated results and experimental results with root-mean-squared percentage errors of approximately 1.2 and 2.6\%, respectively, thus, validating the model.},

  abstract     = {The three-dimensional steady incompressible numerical results of an isothermal flowfield resulting from the interaction of two swirl-stabilized air nozzles in a multiple lean direct injection combustor configuration are analyzed. The spacing between nozzles is varied from 1.1 to 2.72 nozzle diameters to analyze the degree of swirl interaction between them and their impact on the resulting flow structure. The numerical results were verified by performing a grid dependence and turbulence model implementation study and validated by comparing them with time-averaged particle image velocimetry and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes formulation data. The numerical solution resolves aerodynamic flow features typically associated with swirl-based combustion such as a form of vortex breakdown at the center of both nozzles and highly complex flow structures both upstream and downstream of the dome wall. Nozzle spacing has an important effect on the shape of the recirculation region and the flow velocities. In particular, interaction in the tangential velocity between the two nozzles has large effects on the swirl number and the size of the recirculation zone. Most of the changes in flowfield seem to be affected after the inner shear-layer jets of both nozzles have merged into a single jet flow in the axial direction. Two intermediate spacings (, ) exhibit unusual behavior in that the inner shear layers (towards the adjacent nozzle) are drawn into the center of the combustor, and a wide and low-velocity flow is created between the swirlers. This could be due to the inner shear-layer jets between adjacent nozzles not merging properly and behaving in a classical manner of two turbulent opposed planar jets.},

  abstract     = {Aerodynamic prediction of glaze-ice accretion on airfoils and wings is studied using the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes method. Two separation fixed turbulence models are developed by considering the nonequilibrium characteristics of turbulence. The key ad hoc fix is a term of the local ratio of turbulent production to dissipation, which is used to amplify the destruction term of the equation to increase the eddy viscosity in a separating shear layer of the fully turbulent region. A shear stress limiter is adopted to appropriately simulate the beginning process of the shear layer transition when the turbulence is under development. The proposed separation fixed terms can be easily implemented into current solvers. The case of flat-plate, periodic hill, and two iced airfoils and a three-dimensional swept wing with ice accretions are numerically tested using the modified models. The results indicate that the separating shear layer fixes improve the ability of the models in predicting the stall behavior at large angles of attack. The simulated averaged flowfield and turbulence intensity distribution are consistent with experimental data.},

Experiments were performed in an icing research wind tunnel for dry (without water droplets) and sprayed cases. The results show that the impinged droplets can decrease the surface temperature, even on areas without droplet impingement or a water film. Theoretically, the impinged droplets exchange heat with solid surfaces through two heat flow rate terms: , which contains the kinematic and internal energies of the impinged droplets; and the evaporation energy . Adding these two terms to the solid surface when simulating the dry case provides a method to predict the surface temperature after spraying. Calculations for depend on the film coverage that varies due to different operating conditions. However, calculating for the impinged area or over the entire surface can give the upper and lower bounds of the prediction for surface temperature.

  abstract     = {Fluidically oscillating jet actuators that generate sweeping jets when supplied with a pressurized fluid have been used to mitigate separation and reduce drag in a range of flow control applications. Their implementation in future flight vehicles would require fundamental understanding and accurate predictive techniques of the physics of their internal flow and jet formation. The present investigations focus on high-fidelity, time-accurate simulations to characterize the flow physics of the actuator in quiescent conditions. An important element of the present simulations is to demonstrate the ability of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver to predict the jet characteristics and provide a basis for the development of improved boundary conditions (BC) without entirely resolving the geometrical features of the fluidic device. The CFD-predicted oscillation frequencies of the engendered jets were found to be in excellent agreement with experiments, even on two-dimensional meshes. The study revealed that three-dimensional simulations are required to capture some of the flow features of the sweeping jet such as the double peak in time-averaged velocity distributions downstream of the actuator’s orifice that were measured in experiments. Several approaches for modeling the actuator were implemented and assessed in quiescent conditions. The evaluation of a boundary condition at the device throat, based on the phase-averaged flow variables, provides the basis for devising surface-based boundary conditions. The influence and necessity of including turbulent characteristics as part of the boundary conditions have also been identified.},

The overtip-rotor liner concept has been studied as a technology with the potential to further reduce fan noise, and significant noise reductions have been measured. This paper describes a fundamental experimental evaluation that represents the overtip-rotor liner as a static airfoil with its tip located over a flat plate containing a flush-mounted lined insert and separated from the airfoil tip by a small gap. Differences in measured far-field sound spectra and in source power estimates derived from postprocessed spiral array data have shown broadband gap noise reductions of 5–10 dB, even in the absence of a tip gap. Overtip liners are found to suppress noise sources when located in the immediate vicinity, irrespective of the generation mechanism, mainly due to backreaction effects on the source. An analytical prediction model for the overtip liner noise reduction, based on a point source located over an infinite lined plane, is evaluated and compared with the experimental data. The model captures the backreaction effects and provides qualitative agreement with the measured data, including the variation of noise reduction with increasing gap size.},

Flight conditions ranging from calm to moderately turbulent and natural transition driven by Tollmien–Schlichting waves are considered. The inflow conditions are first characterized and reported using single and two-point statistics. Moreover, it is shown how characteristic parameters can be estimated from the turbulence intensity. Then, the sensitivity of the transition location to an increase of turbulence level is investigated. Flight results show a low sensitivity of the transition location to an increase of turbulence level, when the latter is not associated with significant variations of pressure gradient. Similar investigations are also conducted in a wind tunnel where the turbulence level is increased using an active grid and a significant change of the transition location is observed with increasing turbulence level. The differences in the response of the transition to freestream turbulence level in flight and in the wind tunnel are postulated to be attributable to differences in the probability density distributions of the inflow velocity fluctuations.},

  abstract     = {Discretization error is a common source of uncertainty in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses. Traditional means of controlling discretization error through fixed-mesh refinement studies have proved to be difficult particularly when modeling complex geometries and flowfields. One reason for this is that mesh generation in today’s production CFD workflow is often a labor-intensive process that is heavily dependent on user judgment. Unstructured mesh adaptation is known to be an efficient way to control discretization errors in CFD. Adaptive methods replace user-based decision-making with automated processes that optimize a mesh to reduce discretization error. This paper compares the application of multiple solution adaptive techniques in combination with multiple flow solvers to solve for the flowfield about a 2-D airfoil section of the NASA High-Lift Common Research Model. By driving the adaptive mesh processes to a similar level of mesh convergence, the ability to achieve consistent results between multiple adaptive techniques and flow solvers is demonstrated. Mesh convergence for the various adaptive mesh approaches is compared, identifying potential areas for improvement and providing mesh generation guidance for future workshops.},

Freestream fast acoustic, slow acoustic, temperature, and vorticity pulses of both geometries were studied to investigate a wide range of forcing conditions. Unsteady DNS predicts second mode growth and agrees well with LST. DNS and LST data are used to extract second mode receptivity coefficients and phase spectra. For the finite pulses the strongest to weakest responses are for the fast acoustic, temperature, slow acoustic, and vorticity pulses, respectively. The planar disturbances show the strongest response for the slow acoustic, temperature, vorticity, and fast acoustic pulses in that order. Fast Fourier transform results show significant variation in the spectral disturbance response between disturbance types and geometries, and the planar fast acoustic pulse in particular is shown to much more readily excite modal disturbances other than the primary second mode.},

Good agreement with the experiments performed in the Boeing/Air Force Office of Scientific Research Mach-6 Quiet Tunnel at Purdue University was obtained in terms of wall heat-flux and wall-pressure fluctuations. First, an isolated roughness was considered. The presence of the roughness in the span-inhomogeneous base flow leads to the formation of a crossflowlike vortex. High-frequency secondary instabilities of the stationary crossflow vortex are observed in the wake and are found to be responsible for the breakdown to turbulence. Spatial linear modal instability analysis of this flow has been performed at selected streamwise locations. The linear stability approach is found to give accurate predictions in terms of mode shapes, most-amplified disturbance frequencies, and growth rates, as it only underpredicts the N-factor of the most unstable mode by 10\% compared to the direct numerical simulations. Unsteady simulations were then carried out for a trip array configuration and showed that it does not change the transition mechanisms, but the frequencies of the most unstable secondary instabilities were found to be higher.},

In this paper, a new data-driven strategy is proposed to attain real-time identification of the inflow aerodynamic parameters through a combination of experimental data (offline) and distributed pressure sensor measurements (online). In the offline procedure, pressures on the airfoil surface are measured by 10 distributed sensors under 45 different conditions. Particle image velocimetry measurements are recorded to determine the correlation between the pressure distribution and the aerodynamic parameters. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is applied on the pressure data under all conditions to encode this correlation into a three-dimensional domain, with a compression ratio of more than 90\%. In the online procedure, the -nearest neighbor algorithm is used to identify the aerodynamic parameters of testing data in the established POD domain. Furthermore, a mathematical model is applied to optimize the pressure sensor locations. Using just four pressure measurement points, accuracy of 100\% can be achieved for the flow separation detection, angle of attack, and inflow velocity. After flow separation, the new approach achieves an error of approximately for the angle of attack.},

Given additional data from related sensors, a Kalman observer is used to maintain a separate real-time estimate of the measurement of interest. Sustained deviation between the measurements and the estimate is used to detect anomalous behavior. A decision tree, informed by integrating other sensor measurement values, is used to determine the amount of deviation required to identify a sensor fault. The method is validated by applying it to three test systems exhibiting various types of sensor faults: commercial flight test data, an unsteady aerodynamics model with dynamic stall, and a model for longitudinal flight dynamics forced by atmospheric turbulence. In the latter two cases, fault detection was tested for several prototypical failure modes. The combination of a learned dynamic model with the automated decision tree accurately detects sensor faults in each case.},

  abstract     = {Model updating processes are important for improving a model’s accuracy by considering experimental data. Structural system identification was achieved here by applying the degree-of-freedom-based reduction method and the inverse perturbation method. Experimental data were obtained using the specific sensor location selection method. Experimental vibration data were restored to a full finite element model using the reduction method to compare and update the numerical model. Applied iteratively, the improved reduced system method boosts model accuracy during full model restoration; however, iterative processes are time consuming. The computation efficiency was improved using the system equivalent reduction–expansion process in concert with proper orthogonal decomposition.

  abstract     = {Design optimization problems with black-box computation-intensive objective and constraints are extremely challenging in engineering practices. To address this issue, an efficient metamodel-based optimization strategy using parallel adaptive kriging method with constraint aggregation (PAKM-CA) is proposed. In PAKM-CA, the complex expensive constraints are aggregated using the Kreisselmeier and Steinhauser (KS) function. Besides, based on the notion of Pareto nondomination in terms of objective optimality and KS function feasibility, a novel parallel comprehensive feasible expected improvement (PCFEI) function considering the correlations of sample points is developed to effectively determine the sequential infill sample points. The infill sample points with the highest PCFEI function values are selected to dynamically refine the kriging metamodels, which simultaneously improves the optimality and feasibility of optimization. Moreover, the optimization time can be further reduced via the parallel sampling framework of PCFEI. Then the convergence and efficiency merits of PAKM-CA are demonstrated via comparing with competitive state-of-the-art metamodel-based constrained optimization methods on numerical benchmarks. Finally, PAKM-CA is applied to a practical long-range slender guided rocket multidisciplinary design optimization problem to illustrate its effectiveness and practicality for solving real-world engineering problems.},

  abstract     = {A computationally efficient one-shot approach with a low memory footprint is presented for unsteady optimization. The proposed technique is based on a novel and unique approach that combines local-in-time and fixed-point iteration methods to advance the unconverged primal and adjoint solutions forward and backward in time to evaluate the sensitivity of the globally time-integrated objective function. This is in some ways similar to the piggyback iterations in which primal and adjoint solutions are evaluated at a frozen design. During each cycle, the primal, adjoint, and design update problems are solved to advance the optimization problem. This new coupled approach is shown to provide significant savings in the memory footprint while reducing the computational cost of primal and adjoint evaluations per design cycle. The method is first applied to an inverse design problem for the unsteady lid-driven cavity. Following this, vortex suppression and mean drag reduction for a circular cylinder in crossflow is considered. Both of these objectives are achieved by optimizing the rotational speeds for steady or periodically oscillating excitations. For all cases presented in this work, the proposed technique is shown to provide significant reductions in memory as well as computational time. It is also shown that the unsteady optimization problem converges to the same optimal solution obtained using a conventional approach.},

High-fidelity optimization of unsteady rotor flows in forward flight, however, is a challenging problem due to the high computational resources required. To minimize the computational costs, a fully turbulent, overset, adjoint harmonic-balance optimization framework has been developed, which maintains the fidelity of the Navier–Stokes equations. The framework is demonstrated in the aerodynamic redesign of the AH-64A rotor blade. An analysis of the optimized rotor blade is presented, including the key design features that contribute to the performance benefits in each of the examined design conditions. In particular, the benefits and drawbacks of rotor designs with an offloaded blade tip have been discussed. The formulation of the optimization objective function, blade surface parameterization, and treatment of trim were seen to have an impact on the final planform shape; and they have been deemed to be key in obtaining a practical rotor design suitable for use on real-life helicopters.},

Because achieving large-scale flow-control applications is impossible with only one high-voltage power supply, a multichannel PSJ actuator (PSJA) driven by a four-stage Marx high-voltage generator (Marx-generator plasma synthetic jet [MPSJ]) was designed, and its basic discharge characteristics and jet performance were determined. In this study, discharge images were captured, discharge voltages and currents of five discharge channels were measured, and discharge frequencies were analyzed theoretically. Lastly, the jet performance of the multichannel actuators was studied at different discharge frequencies via high-speed schlieren imaging. The results show that the MPSJ can discharge in a synchronized manner to excite the multichannel PSJAs repeatedly. In the breakdown process, the discharge voltage can be multiplied by the MPSJ. The discharge frequency calculated via the theoretical model was near the measured value at low discharge frequencies. The jet intensity of the last-stage actuator was the strongest because its discharge voltage was the highest. The discharge frequency can affect the jet start time but has little negative effect on the jet front speed, which is beneficial for MPSJ applications in active flow control.},

  abstract     = {The present work experimentally investigates two forcing strategies toward controlling stationary crossflow instability (CFI) induced transition manifesting on a swept wing at subsonic conditions. The effectiveness of upstream flow deformation (UFD) and the base-flow modification strategies, realized through the application of spanwise-modulated and spanwise-uniform dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuation, respectively, is compared experimentally. Specialized, patterned actuators that generate spanwise-modulated plasma jets have been fabricated using a spray-on technique and positioned near the leading edge. An array of discrete roughness elements (DREs) is installed upstream of the plasma forcing to lock the origin and evolution of the critical stationary CFI vortices in the boundary layer. The impact of the phase relation between the spanwise-modulated plasma jets and the incoming CFI vortices is inspected. Infrared thermography is employed to detect and quantify the transition location. A delay in transition is observed with all tested forcing configurations. However, as the incoming CFI vortices are highly amplified due to the application of DREs, the acquired results suggest that with spanwise-modulated forcing the control mechanism responsible for the observed transition delay is not purely UFD; rather the beneficial effects observed leverage on a combination of direct attenuation of the CFI vortices and localized base-flow modification, depending on the aforementioned phase relation. For all forcing strategies and configurations, a simplified drag reduction efficiency estimation is performed using the experimentally measured transition location and the electrical power use of the actuators. A net gain is found for selected configurations.},

This paper addresses stability of a hypersonic (Mach 6) flow over the planar expansion corners of 0° (flat plate case), 5°, and 10°, where the Mack second mode is dominant. The linear analysis and direct numerical simulations of three-dimensional wave packets are performed to investigate details and understand mechanisms behind the stabilization effect. The theoretical and numerical results are compared demonstrating applicability of the linear stability theory to hypersonic expansion-corner configurations. No new modes of boundary layer are found over the expansion corners but the second Mack mode that is relevant to the flat plate boundary layer. Downstream the corner line, the second mode instability region shifts to lower frequencies due to an abrupt thickening of the boundary layer that causes the stabilization effect. The results of direct computations agree well with predictions of linear stability theory.},

Experimental and numerical studies are used to understand the nature of three-dimensional shock downstream of the leading edge of the shock generator. The incident shock curved downstream in the streamwise and spanwise directions, and the curvature increased with the decreasing width of the shock generator. The local strength of the incident shock at the bottom wall varied significantly due to this curvature for each of the cases. Consequently, even for shock generators with the same flow deflection, the shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction nature transitioned from separated to unseparated. An explanation and a model for the three-dimensionality of the incident shock are presented, and numerical simulations validate the model. The model shows that the shape of the incident shock is a function of the freestream Mach number, the flow deflection angle, and the width of the shock generator.},

At high angles of attack, the flow is asymmetric and shows a dependence on the orientation angle, provided the body surface has sufficient roughness. Regarding theoretical simulations based on the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, eddy-viscosity turbulence models fail to simulate the unsteady flow structure in the rear zone of the body, yielding sectional side forces far different from those measured in experiments. Solutions obtained in this work by using Reynolds stress turbulence models combined with scale-adaptive simulation past an ogive-cylinder configuration show their ability to reproduce the essential features of the unsteady flow in the rear body. The model appears to be a suitable tool to investigate the complexities of this type of flow.},

A 3-D -type arch vortex appeared behind the standard and RIH cylinders, and the height of the RIH cylinders was higher than that of the standard cylinder. Compared to the standard cylinder, the 3-D -type arch vortex and large-scale vortices broke down slowly in the wake of the RIH cylinders. A 3-D orthogonal wavelet multiresolution technique was used to decompose the 3-D velocity fields from the Tomo-PIV data. The time-averaged large-scale structures of the RIH cylinders exhibited a stronger M-shape arch vortex, and a strong -type-shape arch structure was extracted from the time-averaged intermediate-scale structures. Meanwhile, the tip vortices simultaneously existed in the large- and intermediate-scale structures. The heights of instantaneous large-scale streamwise structures were proportional to the hole height of the RIH cylinders.

  abstract     = {Numerical calculations were carried out in order to investigate the delay of transition to turbulence on a wing section by means of local dynamic surface deformation. Physically, the deformation may be produced by piezoelectrically driven actuators located below a compliant aerodynamic surface, which have been explored experimentally. One actuator was located in the upstream region of the wing, and it was oscillated at the most unstable frequency in order to develop small disturbances corresponding to Tollmien–Schlichting instabilities. A second controlling actuator was placed further downstream, and then it was oscillated at the same frequency but with an appropriate phase shift and modified amplitude in order to decrease the disturbance growth and delay the transition process. The configuration consists of a NLF(1) 0414F natural laminar flow wing section in subsonic flow at a chord-based Reynolds number of . Angles of attack of both 3.0 and 4.0 deg were considered. Large-eddy simulations were carried out via solution of the unsteady three-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations using a high-fidelity computational scheme and an implicit time-marching approach. Two-dimensional simulations were used to develop an empirical process that was applied to determine the optimal phase shift and amplitude of the controlling actuator. Results of the simulations are described, features of the flowfields are elucidated, and comparisons are made between solutions for the uncontrolled and controlled cases in order quantify effectiveness of the control. It is shown that dynamic surface control can return approximately 20\% of the upper wing surface to laminar flow that is lost to premature transition when disturbances are present.},

An existing methodology designed for improving the LES performance in complex flows is adapted and tested. This is based on reducing the numerical diffusion in critical areas for permitting a more accurate development of turbulence. The new formulation comprises both a two-dimensional sensitive velocity gradient model and an alternative definition of the subgrid length scale, which are tested both individually and in tandem, and compared with the other formulations commonly used for addressing the gray area. Four test cases are examined, a flat plate, two variants of the incompressible backward-facing step, and an open jet compressible case, all of which are selected to expose the adverse impact of numerical diffusion that this study seeks to address. Furthermore, the proposed changes are implemented in two different codes for the purpose of cross-validation. Encouraging results are observed, supporting the suitability of the new approach as a candidate for addressing the gray area issue in flows of this kind.},

Aeroacoustic concerns must be addressed for such installed pusher-propeller configurations, though limited validation of reduced-order models has constrained designers who require rapid and accurate predictions of unsteady blade loading and noise due to nonuniform inflow. The current work introduces a benchmark experiment aimed at low-speed pusher-propeller configurations including ingestion of thick wakes such as from an unstreamlined pylon or muffler. Data derived from wind-tunnel measurements on two-bladed propellers downstream of a blunt-ended NACA0015 airfoil include inflow characterizations, on-blade unsteady pressure measurements, and far-field aeroacoustic measurements. The experimental data are compared with blade-loading predictions stemming from existing indicial gust-response functions combined with Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings calculations of acoustic sources. A good correlation is found between the performance of the gust-response functions for blade loading and for far-field noise levels. The reduced-order approach presented here demonstrates promising accuracy, especially considering its low computational expense compared to computational fluid dynamics.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, we propose a new surrogate model [common kernel-smoothed proper orthogonal decomposition (CKSPOD)] to emulate spatiotemporally evolving flows. The model integrates and extends recent developments in Gaussian process learning, high-fidelity simulations, projection-based model reduction, uncertainty quantification, and experimental design, rendering a systematic, multidisciplinary framework. The novelty lies in the construction of a common Gram matrix: the Hadamard product of Gram matrices of all observed design settings. The common Gram matrix synthesizes the temporal dynamics by transferring proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes into spatial functions at each observed design setting, which remedies the phase-difference issue encountered in the kernel-smoothed POD (KSPOD) emulation. The CKSPOD methodology is demonstrated through a case study of flow dynamics of swirl injectors with three design parameters. A total of 30 training design settings and eight validation design settings are included. The CKSPOD emulation outperforms the KSPOD counterpart, and it is capable of capturing small-scale flow structures faithfully. The CKSPOD prediction of turbulent kinetic energy reveals lower uncertainty than KSPOD. The turnaround time of the CKSPOD emulation is about five orders of magnitude faster than the corresponding high-fidelity simulation, which enables an efficient and scalable framework for design exploration and optimization.},

The primary characterization parameter included the relative Mach, Knudsen, and Reynolds numbers based on the relative velocity, the sphere diameter, and other parameters. This review of data showed that the previously proposed nexus at a Reynolds number below 45 was not strictly met, and it instead included a weak transonic bump, which was identified numerically for the first time with the present simulations. New continuum-gas and rarefied-gas simulations were conducted and were combined with the expanded experimental dataset to improve the quantitative description of the drag coefficient in this region. The results indicated that a quasi nexus bridges the rarefaction regime and the compressible flow regimes. The comprehensive dataset was then used to develop new empirical models for the drag coefficient that showed improved robustness and accuracy as compared to previous models. These models are limited by the critical Reynolds number associated with boundary-layer transition on the sphere, which was found to increase substantially with the sphere Mach number.},

The result indicates that the shear breakup mode whose mechanism is similar to the “stretched ligament breakup” occurs at different Weber numbers in the present simulations. Still, droplets have significantly different deformation and breakup characteristics even at the same Weber number. The dimensionless cross-stream and streamwise diameters turn into approximately and in the final stage of deformation, respectively. Indeed, as the Weber number increases, the extents of cross-stream and streamwise deformations are relatively weaker before the parent droplet breakup. Finally, both dimensional and dimensionless initial breakup times are directly proportional to the initial droplet diameter but inversely proportional to the initial airflow velocity, demonstrating that increasing initial airflow velocity can promote the droplet breakup but increasing initial droplet diameter can delay the droplet breakup.},

Based on the results of wide parametric computations, this paper demonstrates an inherent weakness of shock-capturing methods related to an ambiguous station of a stationary shock on a grid cell. To this end, the interaction of stationary shocks of different intensities with elementary waves of acoustic and nonacoustic nature is investigated in a simplified formulation. The computations reveal unpredictable postshock amplitudes of disturbances unless the viscous structure of the shock is sufficiently resolved. A shock resolution criterion and possible cures are suggested and discussed.},

The X2 expansion tube of the University of Queensland was used, which could provide realistic flowfield boundary conditions, where ionization is spontaneously generated within the shock layer as in true flight and the freestream is nonconducting. Suitable flow conditions providing strong MHD interaction at superorbital Earth reentry velocities were developed. Steel ball and neodymium permanent magnet models were tested, both uncoated and coated with electrically insulating high-temperature epoxy. Shock-layer high-speed imaging showed a significant increase in shock standoff distance for the magnetic models. The experimental shock standoff results generally agreed well with analytical and numerical shock standoff predictions. These experiments demonstrate that a strong MHD interaction can be generated for a Mars return trajectory with moderate magnetic field strengths. Furthermore, they provide a promising framework for future MHD aerobraking experiments to investigate MHD drag force and heat-flux mitigation.},

Emission spectroscopy was conducted to determine the populations of electronic energy levels of the argon by measuring electromagnetic radiation intensity at visible and infrared wavelengths. Excitation temperatures were resolved along spatial lines above the model, from upstream of the shock to downstream of the expansion fan. These temperatures were found to increase from 9000 to 10,000 K between the shock and the expansion fan, with the temperature frozen in the expansion fan. Numerical simulations of the flow showed a similar trend, with the computed excitation temperature in the expansion fan also freezing. Shock precursor radiation was also detected, indicating that the excitation temperature upstream of the shock and through the expansion fan is likely to be influenced by radiation from the immediate postshock region.},

Analysis of the synthetic BOS data show that a two-dimensional sinusoidal background produces the highest reconstruction accuracy for both wOFA and iterative least squares (ILS) algorithms. wOFA outperforms ILS in terms of overall accuracy for displacement fields with sufficiently high spatial frequency content. In addition, wOFA provides higher spatial resolution, about an order of magnitude in terms of the total number of pixels in the final BOS image. Finally, wOFA is demonstrated on two sets of experimental data: a heat gun plume experiment with nearly ideal imaging characteristics, and experiments in a supersonic wind tunnel flow with more realistic restrictions on the acquisition of images. BOS images computed with wOFA are shown to have higher spatial resolution and sensitivity than ILS, without introducing additional noise. Therefore, wOFA of BOS images are able to reveal flow features not detected by ILS analysis.},

The relationship between the aforementioned ratio and the main mode of oscillation is verified by far-field noise data for a high-lift configuration with different geometrical settings. As the slat translation along the chordwise direction of the main wing increases, the ratio also increases; and the main mode of self-excited oscillation switches from mode II to a transition phase, and then to mode III.},

The wrinkle-scaling law treated in this study indicates that a wrinkle amplitude ratio during a formation and a dissipation process of wrinkle are determined by the ratio of a virtual shrinkage strain to a major principal strain, which is not affected by a membrane size. A formation and a dissipation process of wrinkles on five rectangular isotropic membranes with different sizes were measured by photogrammetry, and the relationship between the wrinkle amplitude ratio and the strain ratio was discussed. The results showed that the relationship between the wrinkle amplitude ratio and the strain ratio is linear, which represents the scaling law, regardless of the membrane size, while confirming the validity of the scaling law. This paper also presents a utilization method of the wrinkle-scaling law to a practicable situation using photogrammetric measurement.},

However, considering the two optimizations separately is noncollaborative. To solve this problem, a global–local collaborative optimization method is proposed. Based on the sequential sampling method, a set of sampling points is obtained in the design space. Local optimization is carried out to optimize the stiffener layout around the cutout for each sampling point along with its strain energy and stress. The radial basis function surrogate model is constructed based on the aforementioned sampling points. Based on the surrogate model, global optimization is carried out to obtain the optimal global stiffener layout and the stiffener layout around the cutout. In this way, the layout of the global stiffener and the layout of the local stiffener can be designed collaboratively. An illustrative example of the stiffened cylindrical shell with the cutout is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. An innovative stiffened cylindrical shell with the cutout is obtained by a collaborative optimization method.

  abstract     = {Most of the sensitivity algorithms with respect to the design parameters adopted the normalization relationship with system property matrices weighted when analyzing an asymmetrical damping linear discrete dynamic system. In this paper, two new methods (an algebraic method and a direct method) based on the Euclidean norm as the normalization conditions are proposed. Both proposed methods are developed to calculate the first- and second-order sensitivities of the complex modal parameters for an asymmetric damped system. The precisions of the Taylor approximations of the second degree are also discussed in the proposed methods. Like other algebraic methods, this paper outlines the proof of numerical stability. Different from Nelson’s direct method (“Simplified Calculation of Eigenvector Derivatives,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 14, No. 9, 1976, pp. 1201–1205), this paper considers complexity of the solution space in complex vector space, and the partitioning scheme of the proposed direct algorithm is more practical. The usefulness and correctness are demonstrated by a one-parameter numerical experiment and a two-parameter numerical experiment.},

Schlieren videos showed that the extended ramps stabilized the jet, reduced spreading, and elongated the shock cell systems. Far-field acoustics revealed that the most severe noise penalties arose from the impingement of the shear layer on the ramps and the expansion of the jet at the trailing edge of the ramp. For transonic jets, which contain only broadband sources of noise, noise due to ramps was louder than turbulence mixing noise. The penalty increased with the ramp length. On the contrary, the ramps were effective at reducing noise at higher jet Mach numbers, where the shock-associated components of noise were strong and turbulence mixing noise dominated jet scraping noise. The extent of reduction was dependent on the relative length between the ramp and the jet potential core. A ramp approximately as long as, but no longer than, the potential core minimizes peak mixing noise, shock-associated noise, and noise arising from the interaction between flow and the ramp.},

In this paper, the authors assess the of a stoichiometric ethylene/oxygen mixture in four capillary tubes based on high-speed photography measurements. Compared with macrotubes, the experimental results indicate that the area divergence induced by the boundary layer causes the relationship between and and/or to vary. Further comparative analysis suggests that a critical value of about can be employed to distinguish between microtube and macrotube behavior. As such, microtube behavior is defined according to the area divergence , and not only based on the tube diameter. Finally, a theoretical model is introduced to predict the and is reliable for a stoichiometric ethylene/oxygen mixture in micro- and macrotubes.

The emission recorded by a high-speed camera with an image intensifier was used to investigate the effects of equivalence ratio on the chemiluminescence from electronically excited hydroxyl (OH*) and methylidyne (CH*) radicals. High-speed movies of OH*, CH*, and total broadband signals were recorded. The line-of-sight integrated images were Abel-inverted to obtain the spatially resolved two-dimensional flame structure and the temporal evolution of radical zone thickness. Features such as direct laminar flame-speed determination, flame wrinkling at elevated pressures, and the reaction zones of flames propagating under well-characterized initial turbulent conditions were all well-captured by the high-speed chemiluminescence imaging. In addition to visualizing the flame fronts and subsequent determination of the flame speed, this technique provides the simultaneous information of reactive chemical species that is not available using commonly used schlieren-based imaging methods.},

Wall-pressure measurements and electronically excited CH (CH*) chemiluminescence imaging were performed to characterize the behavior of the unstarting flows. The overall equivalence ratio in the engine was increased to induce inlet unstart, which was detected based on sudden drops in the pressure, a reduction in power of high-frequency pressure fluctuations, and abnormal CH* emissions in the combustion zone. Two perforated plates with suction holes were installed on the top and one side of the internal surface of the model, and boundary-layer suction control was activated using fast-acting solenoid valves at designated times. Suction from each plate could extract approximately 1\% of the freestream flow. Single- and double-plate suction control was also tested under various overall equivalence ratios, with boundary-layer suction found to significantly delay inlet unstart under marginal unstart conditions.},

Collection of high-fidelity data is optimized with two different objectives for comparison: by minimizing the error between synthetic data and the multifidelity prediction; and by maximizing the expected information gain, where the information gain is measured between the prior and posterior distributions. Once the multifidelity model is trained with optimal high-fidelity simulations, it is used to optimize the placement of sensors on a wind-tunnel test specimen, again by comparing the minimum expected error and the maximum expected information gain from the experiment.

  abstract     = {The structural dynamics of turbomachinery bladed disks is of paramount importance to ensure safety and reliability. Due to their sensitivity to mistuning (that is, any deviation from nominal properties), bladed disk vibrations encountered in practical applications can be significantly amplified. Thus, it is important to identify mistuning of as-manufactured blisks so that computational models can be updated to include mistuning and used to accurately characterize the behavior of blisks in operating conditions. Several mistuning identification techniques based on bench tests have been developed. This paper focuses on the techniques based on blade isolation through mass detuning and modal testing: methods that require a simple experimental setup. The typical shortcoming of these methods is that they rely on measured blade frequencies as a proxy for blade mistuning. However, as presented in this study, it is often impossible to completely isolate a blade from the neighboring ones using mass detuning; as a result, the measured frequencies do not represent the cantilevered blade frequencies that many reduced-order models use to model mistuning. This is especially true for blisks in which the blade-to-disk stiffness ratio is not negligible: a scenario that could become more and more prevalent as the trend to design thinner disks to reduce blisk mass continues. A technique based on modal testing that is able to accurately identify mistuning by appropriately capturing the effect of residual blade-to-blade and blade-to-disk coupling is introduced in this paper. A validation is carried out using an academic blisk model and surrogate data, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the direct use of blade frequencies as proxies for mistuning.},

A planar entropy wave was injected at the inlet for a range of frequencies from 200 to 1000 Hz. Additionally, the compact model by Cumpsty and Marble was extended to account for a cooling flow. Results show that for an increase in coolant mass flow rate of 3.4\%, the entropy noise increases by about 12\% for the transmitted pressure wave, whereas the reflected pressure wave increases by about 9\%. This is attributed to the change in convective acceleration in the blade passage. The film cooling was found to have a minor effect in promoting the entropy wave attenuation. The extended compact model was capable of capturing both the entropy wave attenuation and increase in the acoustic transfer function due to film cooling.},

The first, minor, enhancement adjusts the model for scale-resolving approaches to turbulence in flows over lined surfaces, whereas the second one presents an extension that accounts for a dependence of the impedance on the level of wall pressure fluctuations, typical of many acoustic liners. The enhanced model is implemented in the high-fidelity numerical system developed by the authors earlier for aeroengine fan-noise prediction. It is then validated by computations of the sound propagation in the NASA Grazing Impedance Tube with turbulent grazing flow and of the attenuation of the noise emitted by NASA’s high-bypass-ratio turbofan model, due to acoustic treatment of the fan duct walls. The computations are performed in the framework of 2D and 3D problem statements with the use of the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (URANS) and the zonal URANS-wall modeled large eddy simulation approaches to turbulence representation.},

This enables very fast calculations of the two-dimensional transient temperature response of a transpiration-cooled thermal protection system suitable for first-order systems studies. To solve for the transpiration-cooled outer wall and a two-dimensional solid substructure, PIRATE has been coupled with the commercial finite element package COMSOL. This enables modeling of the longer-duration thermal effects of the integrated heat load over a flight trajectory. Transpiration cooling using helium coolant has been applied to a wing leading-edge model with an aluminum substructure. Carbon–carbon ceramic composite and the ultra-high-temperature ceramic Zirconium diboride are chosen as candidate materials. Results for the substructure temperature history for the space shuttle reentry trajectory are obtained, showing that transpiration cooling can lead to a 35\% reduction in peak substructure temperature and a 65\% reduction in thermal gradients.},

For the hypersonic waverider, the nonaxisymmetric, flat, and slender geometric feature makes it susceptible to the problem of lateral–directional instability. Therefore, the influence of geometric feature on the lateral–directional static and dynamic stability of hypersonic waverider is studied so as to enable the designer to consider this problem in the preliminary aircraft design stage. A series of power-law waveriders is generated at a given design space of the leading-edge parameters. Then, the variation of the static and dynamic derivatives with the design parameter is obtained by use of a surrogate model. It is found that increasing the dihedral angle of the lower surface can improve both the lateral and directional static stability of the total waverider. Furthermore, the dynamic instability mechanisms are analyzed in detail based on the approximate formulas derived from the linearized small-disturbance equations of motion. Especially, a concept of the Dutch-roll dynamic derivative is proposed, which plays an important part in the damping of the Dutch roll. Finally, it is found that increasing the dihedral angle can also improve the damping of the dynamic modes, including the roll, spiral, and Dutch roll.},

  abstract     = {Because much computing time is required for the refined turbulence simulations, it is imperative to develop efficient acceleration methods. An improved mode multigrid method is proposed to accelerate the convergence of turbulent flow in this paper. It is found that the zero-frequency shift modes, which are characterized as the boundary layer and the wake of turbulent flows, represent the main modes of turbulent flows, and retaining the shift modes can make the turbulence flow converge faster. Numerical experiments indicate that the improved mode multigrid method can eliminate the problem of irregular residual jump shown in the original mode multigrid method and can be successfully applied to accelerate the turbulent flows to steady state. The improved method is more robust and more efficient compared with the original mode multigrid method. The number of iteration steps can be significantly reduced by 2–3 times than the nonacceleration method while maintaining the computational accuracy. The improved mode multigrid method is further extended to accelerate the convergence of various turbulent flows for complex configurations, which demonstrates that the method can be widely used in engineering problems.},

  abstract     = {A third-order compact gas-kinetic scheme is proposed for three-dimensional compressible flow computations. The new scheme is based on three key ingredients: the time-accurate gas evolution model for interface flux, the Hermite weighted essentially nonoscillatory reconstruction, and the two-stage temporal discretization. In contrast to the Riemann-solver-based methods, due to the use of time-accurate flux function the proposed scheme can achieve a third-order temporal accuracy with two stages instead of three stages in the standard Runge–Kutta method. As an extension of the existing high-order reconstructions, a Hermite weighted essentially nonoscillatory reconstruction is specifically designed for the current scheme with the implementation of the constrained least-square technique, which subsequently improves the accuracy and robustness of the compact scheme. There is no trouble cell identification in the current scheme. A third-order accuracy can be achieved even with curved boundary. Numerical examples for both smooth and discontinuous flows show the robustness and high accuracy of the compact third-order scheme, which has a comparable performance as the fifth-order noncompact gas-kinetic scheme. A large Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy number around 0.5 can be used in the computations.},

  abstract     = {As wind turbine diameters continue to increase, the cyclic loading experienced by the turbine blade due to wind shear and yaw misalignment increases dramatically hindering the development of larger more efficient turbines. Based on current literature, controlling a section of the trailing edge of the turbine blade was found to reduce cyclic loading. To quantify the load control capability of a trailing edge flap (TEF), an experimental rig was designed to evaluate a TEF on a 3.5-m-diam wind turbine operating under different tip speed ratios, yaw angles, and blade pitch angles inside a large wind generation facility. The TEF was tested at two different spanwise locations and 0.82. The instrumented blade was capable of measuring rotor torque, flapwise/edgewise blade root bending moment, and normal force coefficient at two different spanwise locations and 0.82. The experimental results show that the use of a TEF was capable of manipulating the normal force coefficient by 40\% and the flapwise bending moment by 20\%. The relationship between the TEF angle and both blade bending moment and normal force coefficient was linear for all the cases tested. The results also show that when the TEF was centered at it could control the turbine loading more effectively. The results presented here prove that the TEF is capable of reducing cyclic loading on wind turbine blades.},

The main aim is to improve the accuracy of kriging when gradient information is available via the adjoint method. In contrast to the standard gradient-enhanced kriging (GEK), the gradient information is used to enrich both the trend function and the stochastic part, using the polynomial-chaos expansion (PCE) as the trend function. The optimal polynomial terms are selected by scanning through various polynomial orders in which the coefficients are calculated by means of the generalized least squares or the least angle regression algorithm. The performance of the gradient-enhanced PCK (GEPCK) was compared with GEK, gradient-enhanced PCE (GEPCE), and their nongradient counterparts on a set of analytical and a suite of aerodynamic problems consisting of aerodynamic design exploration of a blended-wing–body configuration, an inviscid transonic flow over an airfoil, and a low-fidelity aerostructural wing design. The results show notable improvements obtained by GEPCK in terms of performance and robustness compared with other gradient-enhanced surrogate models. Based on these results, it can be concluded that enhancing the trend part with gradient is highly beneficial in improving the accuracy of the kriging surrogate model.},

The model is designed for simulation of rotors in complex operating environments, and it advances a recently developed actuator surface model through the addition of two new elements: a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-convected wake model, and an improved coupling algorithm. The wake model uses Lagrangian particle tracking to determine the geometry of the rotor wake from the CFD solution. Prior study of the influence of the maximum wake age in the model led to the conclusion that only 45 deg of wake is required for accurate resolution of air loads. The S-76 rotor in hover and the UH-60A rotor in forward flight are used for validation. Thrust coefficients, torque coefficients, and figures of merit over a range of collective settings agree well with experimental data for the S-76 rotor. Sectional normal force coefficients in forward flight are compared with experimental data, results from resolved-blade simulations, and other rotor models: again showing good agreement. These results suggest the new actuator surface model can predict time-accurate rotor loads where accurate resolution of the near-blade flowfield and high-frequency loads, such as blade–vortex interactions, are not critical.},

The two specialized methods are orchestrated by an unsteady coupling algorithm that represents our main research contribution. The paper gives the formulation and algorithmic implementation. FALCon is demonstrated on three test cases of increasing complexity in flow physics, up to flow conditions well outside its validity range. On average, FALCon achieves a computational speed-up of a factor of about 50, compared with a full Navier–Stokes run, while capturing relevant flow physics: three-dimensional, viscous, compressible, and unsteady phenomena.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we perform direct numerical simulations of leading-edge momentum injection of a NACA0009 airfoil at poststall angles of attack. It is found that the lift response is highly dependent upon the instantaneous state of the wake at the time of actuation, which is characterized by the phase of the vortex-shedding limit cycle present in the unactuated system. In particular, we find that actuating at a phase of the limit cycle corresponding to the maximum lift gives the largest maximum in transient lift response, whereas actuating near the lift minimum gives a smaller initial transient lift enhancement and can lead to a significant reduction in the amplitude of the limit cycle. As well as characterizing this phase dependency, we develop a reduced-order model that can capture this behavior. This is achieved by applying dynamic mode decomposition with control to a concatenation of velocity and lift measurements from several training datasets. The resulting models can accurately capture the dynamics of the training datasets as well as for phases not included in the training data. We show that for this method of actuation, multiple control objectives with the same actuator can be achieved.},

The actuators were located at three streamwise locations on the airfoil’s suction side. The upstream actuator introduced a disturbance to the flow, which phase locked the Tollmien–Schlichting waves. The downstream actuators were used to mitigate the induced Tollmien–Schlichting waves by introducing an antiphase disturbance with the proper amplitude. The disturbances included either a single-frequency or multiple-frequency input signals. The Tollmien–Schlichting waves were mitigated in both open- and closed-loop control schemes. In open-loop control, the results demonstrated that dynamic surface modification can be used to mitigate the waves, even in the presence of a large adverse gradient for varying frequency bandwidths. In addition, the closed-loop scheme, using an iterative learning control algorithm, succeeded in reducing the induced disturbance amplitudes to 11\%. In addition, the experiments demonstrated the ability to not only mitigate the wave but also amplify it if transition to turbulence is desired.},

This paper proposes a new flow parameter called the nondimensionalized crossflow pressure gradient (CFPG) to combine the effects of both wing sweep and pressure distribution on crossflow, which enables an alternative interpretation of the mechanism for CFI suppression. At first, a self-contained derivation of nondimensional form of CFPG is presented, and the Falkner–Skan–Cooke boundary layers are employed to theoretically show that the nondimensionalized CFPG does relate to wing sweep and pressure gradients. Besides, infinite obliquely placed NLF wings with different sweep angles or pressure distributions are used to numerically validate our hypothesis. Second, examples of nontapered finite-span wings are used to demonstrate the advantage of using nondimensionalized CFPG. Finally, nondimensionalized CFPG is applied to analyze the crossflow on tapered NLF forward-swept wing (FSW) and backward-swept wing (BSW) configured with the same airfoil, and the underlying flow mechanism is exposed from a new perspective. It is observed by this paper that nondimensionalized CFPG can take into account the effects of both wing sweep and pressure distribution, which leads to a different perspective to analyze the crossflow on FSW as well as BSW.},

  abstract     = {This experimental study considers the development of a laminar separation bubble formed over a finite wing and contrasts it with the flow evolution over a two-dimensional airfoil. The experiments were performed on a reference NACA 0018 airfoil model and a finite wing with an aspect ratio of 2.5 at a Reynolds number of 125,000 involving surface pressure and particle image velocimetry measurements. For equivalent effective angles of attack, the results reveal significant differences between the two- and three-dimensional configurations. Specifically, increasing the effective angle of attack causes the separation bubble to shift upstream on the two-dimensional airfoil, whereas its mean position and streamwise extent remain invariant to spanwise changes in the effective angle on the finite wing. Similarly, the dominant shear layer frequency and characteristics of shear layer rollers do not vary appreciably over the wingspan. This suggests that the sectional analogy between the local effective angle on the wing and that on the airfoil is not universally applicable to the wing sections subjected to the formation of laminar separation bubbles. Instead, the spanwise characteristics of the bubble on the wing are well approximated by those obtained on the airfoil at the angle of attack matching the effective angle of the wing root. It should be noted, however, that these findings are exclusive of the regions in the immediate vicinity of the wing tip and/or root, which were not considered in the present investigations.},

The formulation is based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations and differs from earlier studies on fully turbulent flows in the activation of the trip term in the Spalart–Allmaras eddy-viscosity transport equation. The trip term ensures a rapid transition to turbulence at an arbitrary-specified location on the wing surface, analogous a trip strip in an experiment. A parametric study is conducted for the ONERA OAT15A extruded airfoil, as an example. Results show that an extended region of laminar flow leads to a reduction in the critical angle of attack for the buffet onset, as compared with the fully turbulent conditions. All modes of instability show enhanced growth as a result of the laminar flow. However, increased lift (at fixed angle of attack) associated with an extended region of laminar flow results in a higher lift coefficient at buffet onset as compared with the fully turbulent case. Results show that the laminar flow effects on the buffet onset are linked to the suction-side laminar flow and are largely independent of the boundary-layer state on the pressure side of the wing.},

The number of the parameters that depends on experiments is reduced in this numerical method to save costs. The semianalytical damaged constitutive model of cracked plies, the crack density estimation method, the crack opening displacement estimation, and the effective leakage conductance calculation are improved by involving the temperature or thermal strain. Stiffness degradation of a carbon fiber reinforced plastic lamina with different thicknesses and temperatures is obtained by the proposed constitutive model to validate the effect of temperature; and the degradation of the transverse modulus is found to subside with the increasing temperature when the crack densities are the same. The effective leakage conductance of cross-ply laminates, under biaxial loading, is estimated at cryogenic and room temperatures by using three different average methods. The estimation results agree well with the available experiments in the specimens with a uniform thickness of cracked plies. The simulation results indicate that the easier occurrence of leakage at the cryogenic temperature is owing to the significant degradation of the stiffness at cryogenic temperature instead of the thermal strains.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a unified solution for in-plane vibration analysis of laminated arbitrary polygonal plates based on the Chebyshev polynomial method. As an innovative point of present work, the arbitrarily shaped polygonal plate is composed of two arbitrarily shaped quadrilateral plates rigidly coupled for simulation. The quadrilateral plate is uniformly mapped into a unit square plate through the four-node coordinate transformation. In the present approach, whatever the shape of the plate and the type of boundary conditions, the in-plane displacement components of the plate after transformation are expanded as Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind. The artificial spring technique is adopted here to simulate the general boundary restraints and the rigid coupling of coupled plates. Based on the Rayleigh–Ritz method, the accurate solution can be obtained through the energy function of the laminated polygonal plate. The in-plane vibration characteristics including the natural frequency and the corresponding mode shapes of the polygonal plate can be easily obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem. A large number of numerical results of the laminated polygonal plate with different shapes and boundary conditions are presented, it is found the present method shows rapid convergence, high computing efficiency, and high accuracy by comparing with those solutions calculated from the finite element method and the results in the experimentation. Besides, comprehensive studies on the effects of geometrical properties and material parameters of rhombic plates, pentagonal plates, and hexagonal plates on their in-plane vibration characteristics are also presented.},

These measurements, combined with traditional sensors, were used to characterize the loading conditions and the structural response. The thermally buckled panel experienced bistable, cross-well oscillations with cavity pressure modulation for turbulent flow conditions. This response was characterized as chaotic using several conventional criteria. As the temperature differential between the frame and panel decreased, the panel response transitioned to periodic. For the first time, shock-induced limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) were also measured using DIC. In the presence of an attached SBLI, the dynamic response was centered about the three-quarter chord. As the strength of the SBLI increased, the LCO initially subsided and then reappeared near the midchord for the strongest shock considered.},

  abstract     = {A recent structural model of a plate is extended to include a nonuniform temperature differential that varies in time using a modal expansion. The nonlinear structural plate model with first-order piston theory aerodynamics and cavity dynamics is coupled with the heat equation to form a single system of dynamical equations for the fluid-structural-thermal system. The heat flux from the boundary layer to the plate is modeled using the temperature reference method. A computational scheme is formulated by linearizing the heat flux in terms of two variables: the local aerodynamic downwash due to plate motion and the local wall temperature. The proposed linearization produces a local force equivalent for the pointwise heat flux and substantially simplifies the time-marching scheme of the coupled equations. The model is correlated with results from a recent supersonic wind-tunnel experiment conducted at Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). It is found that when a nonlinear response is expected in an experiment (for example, flutter that reaches limit cycle oscillation or a large static buckled deformation), the in-plane boundary stiffness should be measured before the wind-tunnel experiment to fully characterize the experimental model. The heat flux linearization error is quantified, and the modal convergence of the temperature differential is investigated.},

Several filling patterns with different boundary conditions are studied, and their governing equations are derived by presenting the exact displacements and stresses for both solid and fluid fields. The models are validated by comparing with available literature and simulation results. The numerical results show the influences of porous materials, their structure on the STL, and their mutual inhibitions. In addition, it is found that different parameters dominate in different configurations and frequency ranges. These results reveal the interrestricted relationship between the STL and its bearing capacity. Moreover, the external mean flow condition inspired by real-life situations is studied to analyze its effects on sound transmission. These results show that the STL depends on the flow directions, and a critical value of the Mach number exists in the upstream situation.},

Construction of a nonlinear modal-based reduced-order model of the aeroelastic system, employing a state-space realization of the linearized aerodynamics around an arbitrary reference point, allows us to capture the main nonlinear geometrical couplings at a very low computational cost. Embedding this model in both MHE and MPC strategies, which solve the system continuous-time adjoints efficiently to compute sensitivities, lays the foundations for real-time estimation and control of highly flexible aeroelastic systems. Finally, the performance and versatility of the framework operating in the nonlinear regime are demonstrated on two very flexible-wing models, with notably different dynamics, and on two different control setups: a gust-load alleviation problem on a very high-aspect-ratio wing with slower dynamics, which involves substantial deflections; and flutter suppression on a flexible wing with significantly faster dynamics, where an unconventional nonlinear stabilization mechanism is unveiled.},

  abstract     = {A data-driven approach to predict dynamic responses of mistuned cyclic dynamic structures is presented. Nominally cyclic structures such as turbomachinery bladed disks, or blisks, contain deviations from perfect symmetry, called mistuning, which can significantly increase the forced response of the structure subject to periodic excitations. The ability to accurately model the response is crucial for understanding a structure’s dynamics during operation, and thus many reduced-order models have been developed. Data-driven approaches, however, are largely unexplored for predicting physical responses of cyclic structures, and are desirable due to their ability to leverage both computational and experimental data. In this paper, two feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are trained using physical responses and parameters from an individual sector of the cyclic structure. The desired physical responses of all sectors are predicted via a cyclic coupling procedure. By only using sector-level data, the number of simulations and/or experiments required to generate training data is substantially reduced, and the approach is not restricted to a specific projection basis unlike previous physics-based methods. A lumped mass model (LMM) of a blisk with stiffness mistuning is used to generate computational surrogate data for training and validation. Both FFNNs achieve high prediction accuracy on both training data and unseen test data. For a test case with an unseen mistuning pattern, this approach shows strong agreement with known actual responses. For this test case, prediction errors in the LMM blade tip amplitudes across all sectors are less than 2\%, and the amplification factor error is less than 0.2\%.},

This paper presents a model order reduction framework as a step toward flutter-constrained aircraft optimization. The Euler equations linearized about a steady-state solution of the nonlinear Euler equations are used as the governing unsteady flow equations. Using a proper orthogonal decomposition approach, a reduced basis is constructed onto which the governing equations are projected. The result is a linear reduced-order model (ROM) with significantly fewer degrees of freedom capable of rapidly approximating aerodynamic forces. This ROM is coupled to a linear structural model to create a single monolithic aeroelastic system. The eigenvalues of the resulting system are analyzed for various flow conditions to determine the onset of flutter in the system. To ensure the stability of the ROM, the use of a stabilizing inner product is demonstrated. The flutter boundaries obtained for both a two-degree-of-freedom airfoil structure and the AGARD 445.6 wing model show good agreement with the full-order model and with the literature.},

  abstract     = {The variation in the flutter boundary of the AGARD 445.6 wing in transonic and low supersonic states is an unresolved issue in the field of aeroelasticity. This well-known variation phenomenon is mainly reflected in three aspects: 1) the discrepancy between the computational and the experimental results; 2) the large dispersion of the computational results between different solvers; 3) the sensitivity of calculated flutter boundary to many factors, such as computational fluid dynamics discretization scheme and spatial resolution. However, the root cause of this phenomenon is not clear yet. In this paper, the physical mechanism of the dispersion phenomenon is investigated in the case of using the reduced-order model (ROM)–based aeroelastic analysis model. A dominant least stable flow mode, which has an important effect on the flutter characteristic, is captured by the ROM. The variation in the damping of this dominant flow mode significantly affects the flutter boundary or even changes the instability branch of the structural mode. By adjusting the aerodynamic damping of the dominant flow mode, the flutter boundary curve under the aerodynamic damping variation is predicted. When comparing with the available literature results, the scattered literature data fall around the predicted curve, which indicates that the sensitivity of the damping of the dominant flow mode is the root cause for the dispersion phenomenon of the flutter boundary.},

  abstract     = {As a typical morphing wing, a folding wing with structural nonlinearities may encounter complex nonlinear aeroelastic effects during the in-flight morphing process. This paper presents a novel parameterized modeling methodology for efficient modal and nonlinear aeroelastic analysis of a folding wing with bilinear hinge stiffness and the variation of the folding angle. The most attractive feature of the present modeling methodology is that the nonlinear structural dynamics of the folding wing at different folding angles can be efficiently represented via a parameterized fictitious mode. To demonstrate the accuracy of the present method in representing the nonlinear dynamics of the morphing wing, a folding wing with bilinear stiffness in both fuselage–inboard and inboard–outboard hinges was selected as a numerical example. The nonlinear dynamic model of the selected example can be divided into nine subsystems according to different combinations of fuselage–inboard and inboard–outboard hinge stiffness. This paper focuses on the efficient investigation of structural modes, flutter stability, and nonlinear aeroelastic behaviors of the folding wing at the complete morphing parameter space. Besides, the numerical results computed via the present parameterized fictitious mode method were also compared with the direct commercial software. The comparison shows that the nonlinear dynamics of the morphing wing with bilinear hinge stiffness can be investigated efficiently via the present parameterized modeling method.},

  abstract     = {Unlike hinged flaps (for example, ailerons, elevators, and rudders), camber morphing devices vary camber distribution in a smooth and continuous way, resulting in aerodynamic efficiency improvements due to the absence of sharp changes in airfoil camber. One such camber morphing concept, the Fish Bone Active Camber (FishBAC) device, has shown significant aerodynamic benefits when compared to a flap. In this work, a quasi-two-dimensional wind-tunnel test was performed to investigate the aerodynamic performance of a FishBAC device and compare it to a trailing-edge plain flap. A combination of quasi-steady force balance and wake rake pressure measurements was used to determine aerodynamic force coefficients. These measurements are complemented by a flow visualization study performed using particle image velocimetry, allowing for comparison of the near-field wakes in terms of size and vortical structure. Additionally, displacement measurements were performed on the FishBAC to track deformed shapes under aerodynamic loads. Results show that the FishBAC achieves greater than a 50\% improvement in lift-to-drag ratio for moderate to high lift coefficients where the device is significantly deflected and an at least 16\% higher lift-to-drag ratio at all lift coefficients, even when the device deflections are low.},

  abstract     = {The effective angle of attack of an airfoil is a composite mathematical expression from quasi-steady thin-airfoil theory that combines the geometric contribution to the angle of attack with pitching and plunging effects. For a maneuvering airfoil, the instantaneous effective angle of attack is a virtual angle that corresponds to the equivalent lift based on a steady, lift versus angle-of-attack curve. The existing expression for effective angle of attack depends on attached-flow, thin-airfoil, small-angle, and small-camber-slope assumptions. This paper derives a new expression for and effective angle of attack that relaxes the small-angle and small-camber-slope assumptions. The new expression includes effects from pitching, plunging, and surging motions, as well as spatial nonuniformity of the flow. The proposed expression simplifies to the existing quasi-steady expression by invoking the appropriate assumptions. Furthermore, the proposed expression leads to a replacement for the classic zero-lift angle-of-attack equation for steady flow past a thin airfoil, which is compared to experimental values for cambered NACA four-digit airfoils. The new expression is also used for lift-equivalent motion design for a maneuvering airfoil to emulate the effective angle of attack of a nonmaneuvering airfoil encountering a transverse gust under a quasi-steady assumption. Computational fluid dynamics simulations support the use of the proposed effective angle-of-attack expression for lift-equivalent motion design, subject to an attached-flow assumption.},

The principle of these systems is to apply vibrations or ultrasonic waves onto the structure that create high-level stresses greater than those required to crack and delaminate to remove the ice accumulated on the structure. The computation of the indicators requires two values: the ice adhesion strength and the critical strain energy release rate. Computations are performed assuming three stages of a de-icing mechanism: first, an initiation of cohesive fractures by tensile stress at the top surface of the ice layer; second, a propagation of cohesive fractures within the ice; and, third, a propagation of adhesive fractures at the ice/substrate interface starting from the base of the cohesive fractures previously created. The proposed key performance indicators provide guidance on the use of flexural and extensional modes in resonant ice protection systems and on the frequency range to favor when looking at fractures initiation and propagation. Calculations based on the key performance indicators show a potential power reduction by 10 with resonant electromechanical de-icing systems compared to electrothermal systems.},

Measurements were taken with an inlet mode detection ring upstream of the rotor and with far-field microphones for configurations with subsonic and with supersonic fan blade tip speeds. The ICD reduces the fluctuating component and stabilizes the rotor-locked component of the frequency spectrum at the blade passing frequency and its harmonics in the way that the mode amplitudes of the Tyler–Sofrin modes increase, whereas neighboring mode orders are suppressed. The mode distribution and intermode coherence in the inlet are also changed, which changes the far-field directivity when an ICD is installed. It is demonstrated that cyclostationary analysis is a powerful tool to investigate the acoustic effect of an ICD on turbofan noise, revealing more details about the temporal and spatial structures of the generated sound field than a classical spectral analysis.},

The impact of serrations is investigated across different airfoil angles of attack and serration flap angles. The natural boundary-layer transition cases 6 and 7 of the AIAA Benchmark Problems for Airframe Noise Computations V Workshop Category 1 are considered as benchmark for the straight edge cases. The numerical simulations are performed using the fully explicit, transient, and compressible lattice Boltzmann equation implemented in the computational fluid dynamics/computational aero-acoustics (CFD/CAA) solver SIMULIA PowerFLOW®. The acoustic far field is obtained by using the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings integral solution applied to the airfoil surface. A mesh resolution study is performed on the straight trailing-edge cases to demonstrate the grid independence of the numerical solution. The numerical results compare favorably against the experimental data. The impact of the serration flap angle on the effectiveness of sawtooth serrations in reducing noise is investigated by considering three different serration flap angles. It is found that the serration flap angle primarily affects the trailing-edge noise reduction through a modification of 1) the effective angle at which the turbulent structures are convected over the serrated edge; 2) the convection velocity and spanwise coherence length along the serration; and 3) the intensity of the hydrodynamic wall-pressure fluctuations that are scattered along the serrated edge. The first and last phenomena are expected to play the most important role on the far-field noise reduction.},

The Reynolds number based on the chord is 960,000 and the Mach number is 0.2. The aerodynamic results from the simulation show the formation of the tip-leakage vortex and the interaction of the turbulent structures that exit the gap with the external flow near the trailing edge. Then, a Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings analogy is used to compute the far-field noise levels and an acoustic decomposition is performed to highlight the main surface contributions to the tip-leakage noise. The numerical simulation shows very good agreement compared with experiments and allows identification of the main noise source in the tip gap. The main noise source results from the interaction of the turbulent structures created in the tip gap close to the pressure side corner with the suction side tip edge. The scraping of turbulent structures along the tip edge is shown to be an efficient noise mechanism.},

For both discretizations, a series of increasingly refined adapted meshes are generated using the metric optimization via error sampling and synthesis algorithm. The convergence of aerodynamic coefficients, surface pressure, and skin friction on these meshes is studied in order to evaluate the accuracy and cost of the solution. This study is done for several discretization orders, as well as for both linear and curved meshes. In addition, the characteristics of the adapted meshes for different discretization orders are investigated at a prescribed error level. This analysis provides insight into how the discretization order affects the mesh, along with the resulting solution accuracy and cost. The conclusions of this study indicate that higher-order methods (in particular, the and continuous Galerkin variational multiscale with discontinuous subscales discretizations) provide accurate outputs with an order of magnitude less computational time than methods.},

Hence, the resulting output functions acting as objective or constraint functions of the optimization are themselves periodic with unknown period length, which may depend on the design parameter of said optimization. Sensitivity analysis on the time average of a function with these properties turns out to be difficult. Therefore, we explore methods to regularize the time average of such a function with the so-called windowing approach. Furthermore, we embed these regularizers into the discrete adjoint solver for the URANS equations of the multiphysics and optimization software SU2. Finally, we exhibit a comparison study between the classical nonregularized optimization procedure and the ones enhanced with regularizers of different smoothness, and we show that the latter result in a more robust optimization.},

Birds offer inspiration regarding how to fly in these environments and how to exploit complex wind flows as an energy source. On a broad scale, migrating birds adjust airspeed to minimize cost of transport (COT) in response to wind conditions, but it is unknown whether birds implement these strategies in fine-scale, complex environments. GPS backpacks were used to track 11 urban nesting gulls and found they soared extensively during daily commutes, using thermal and orographic updrafts. This paper outlines COT theory and proposes a model for optimizing airspeed for wind while maintaining flight trajectory. The gull flight paths were tested for COT adjustments, considering their flapping and soaring strategies, and it was found that the birds were able to make energy savings of 31\% based on having a best glide speed when soaring that was similar to their minimum power speed when flapping. These models calculated optimum airspeeds based on wind speed and direction and could be implemented on SUAV platforms with wind sensing capabilities. This approach could significantly reduce energy requirements for SUAVs flying in urban environments.},

  abstract     = {Sonic boom prediction around buildings has previously been conducted under the assumption of linear wave propagation. In this work, a more detailed analysis considering the nonlinear effect is achieved by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The two-dimensional Euler equations are solved by employing a level set method for tracking a moving supersonic body, a ghost fluid method for applying the immersed boundary condition at the surface of the body, and an adaptive mesh refinement method. Simulations are made under the frame of reference of a flight object moving at Mach 1.6. Incident waves are composed of a single oblique shock wave, as well as N, flat-top, and ramp waves. The computational results clarify the complex flow behaviors around a building, involving the incident, reflected, and diffracted waves. At the bottom-front edge of a building, the waveform behind the shock waves is spiked, and the pressure rise is amplified due to double reflections. The diffracted waves are repeatedly reflected at the top corners of a building, resulting in amplification of the perceived level over a wide range.

  abstract     = {The mechanism of the supersonic round jet mixing enhancement by a pulsed energy deposition is studied numerically by solving the three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with the second-order scheme in space and time. A round jet at different Mach numbers (, 1.76, 3.00) is parallelly injected into a coflowing air stream of Mach number 2.5, interacting with the oblique shock generated by a compression ramp of 20°. The density ratio between the jet and external flow is 0.5. The laser pulse with at 20 kHz is modeled as an ellipsoid for the energy addition, and proposed to put above or inside the jet for jet mixing control. It is found that the energy deposition inside the jet is much more effective for the jet mixing amplification compared with that above the jet. The jet mixing enhancement is achieved through the large-scale vortices, initiated by the energy deposition zone interacting with the oblique shock wave. It is shown that the jet cross-sectional area is doubled, and the turbulent kinetic energy is increased, even reaching 10 times the original level at the downstream location. However, a slight decrease about 0.3\% of the total pressure recovery coefficient is observed far downstream.},

  abstract     = {Rotating detonation combustors (RDCs) are studied with significant interest in recent years, due to their promulgated benefits over other pressure gain combustion systems. Although notable strides have been made, the fundamental understanding of rotating detonation wave dynamics is still nascent. Toward this end, high-speed chemiluminescence imaging is used to spatiotemporally track the detonation wave as it propagates through annular RDCs of three different channel widths at varied flow rates and equivalence ratios. Several algorithms are used to attain quantitative metrics on the observed rotating detonations, namely, speed, strength, height, and stability. It is shown that higher flow rates of 0.4 and (and hence higher fresh mixture fill height due to increased mass flux) produce small wave speed deficits, more consistency in wave propagation denoted by less variance in structure from lap to lap, as well as higher luminosity (proportional to combustion strength). It is also shown that at these high flow rates before wave bifurcation, rotating detonation waves exhibit the canonical diamond-shaped cellular pattern composed of the triple point interactions seen in planar detonations, but with cell widths bigger by an order of magnitude due to the streamtube effect. The experimentally gathered visualization data are used to formulate empirical guidelines that can help predict rotating detonation waves’ velocity deficit, height, and combustion strength for a given mass flux through the combustor. It is shown that velocity deficits in rotating detonations are a linear function of the effective perimeter inscribed by the wave, where the lowest deficits of 10\% are seen at the highest perimeters, which in turn only manifests at the highest tested flow rates. This finding is linked to similar observations seen in planar detonations in tubes, where two distinct, perimeter-predicated loss mechanisms (one due to heat and momentum losses and the other due to streamtube effect) cause velocity deficits at near-limits conditions.},

  abstract     = {Hydrocarbon fuels offer optimal high energy per volume for scramjet applications for sustained hypersonic flight but require additional residence time due to slower ignition delays (compared with hydrogen fuel). The injection of ethylene at the start of the isolator of a dual-mode scramjet combustor, operating in ramjet mode, allows sufficient mixing to achieve efficient premixed turbulent combustion. A cavity flameholder anchors the flame, supplying sufficient radicals to sustain a stable flame in the high-speed environment. This work investigates flame structure and stabilization limits of a new configuration with a scaled-down cavity embedded in the flow path of the combustor with a strut and insert. The cavity is reduced in size by one-third to enable eventual direct numerical simulations of the flame stabilization process. This work, however, focuses on modeling the full isolator/combustor geometry using a hybrid large eddy simulation/Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation strategy. Particle image velocimetry, planar laser-induced fluorescence, coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy, and pressure measurements are compared with numerical predictions to analyze and characterize the conditions within the combustor, including flame structure, flow velocities, species composition, and wall pressure. An adjustable air throttle in the extender is able to control the placement of the shock train in the isolator and maintain a stable flame at various equivalence ratios. The simulations show reasonably good agreement with the experimental scalar and velocity data and predict a flame angle consistent with premixed turbulent flame-speed correlations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the restart processes of two generic rectangular hypersonic inlets with different internal contraction ratios have been experimentally studied under a freestream Mach number of 5.0. The experimental results show that without downstream throttling, both inlets start successfully after the flowfield establishment of the wind tunnel. To obtain the restart processes of the two inlets, they are initially set at an unstarted state by a large downstream throttling ratio. Then, the throttling ratio is continuously decreased. For the inlet with a small internal contraction ratio, the restart process undergoes four stages: stable buzz, intermittent buzz, reestablishment of wave system in the inlet, and unthrottled flow; whereas for the inlet with a large contraction ratio, the internal flow cannot be normally reestablished after the intermittent buzz stage because a large-scale separation bubble consistently stands ahead of the inlet. That is, it cannot be restarted. In the stage of the intermittent buzz, there is a probability of the appearance of a quasi-steady flowfield when the pressure in the inlet reaches its maximum value, and the separation shock almost impinges on the cowl lip. For both inlets, the probability of buzz decreases continuously with time, and then it suddenly disappears. Furthermore, for the inlet with a large contraction ratio, two kinds of flowfields (that is, started or unstarted) occur at the same downstream throttling ratio and upstream flow conditions, which indicates that the inlet operates in the dual-solution region and the actual operating state of the inlet significantly depends on the historical flow. Therefore, the evaluation of hypersonic inlet starting capability must be examined carefully.},

Instabilities included in the analysis are of the Tollmien–Schlichting and crossflow nature relevant to high-Reynolds-number flows in low turbulence environments. The coupling is fully automated and can therefore be used efficiently in the analysis and design of geometries with external flows.

  abstract     = {Surface roughness elements are often used to force laminar to turbulent transition in aerodynamic and aeroacoustic wind-tunnel experiments. The statistical features and spectral content of the pressure fluctuations in the resulting turbulent boundary layer at the trailing edge can affect far-field noise. To elucidate this dependence, boundary-layer transition induced by randomly distributed roughness elements and a zigzag strip of the same height over a NACA 0012 airfoil is investigated experimentally. The effects of roughness geometry on the near-field flow topology, transition location, and far-field noise are addressed in the common experimental setting for the first time. For a fixed roughness height, distributed roughness elements are less effective in forcing transition than the zigzag strip at low freestream velocity . As increases, the transition front for the distributed roughness elements moves closer to the roughness location, reaching the same or even further upstream locations compared to the transition onset in the presence of the zigzag strip. The far-field noise depends on the transition location. For , a higher noise level is measured for the distributed roughness elements with respect to the zigzag strip. In contrast, for , the earlier onset of transition with the distributed surface roughness leads to a lower noise level than that with the zigzag strip. The data confirm that an adequate characterization of the boundary-layer transition is necessary when measuring the far-field noise during wind-tunnel experiments.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the stability of Mach 20 flows past a 6 deg wedge in thermal–chemical nonequilibrium (TCNE) is studied by means of linear parabolized stability equations (PSEs) in combination with advanced thermodynamic and transport models. First, verifications are performed against existing numerical results in the literature. Good agreement is achieved in two benchmark cases. The present PSE results match the direct numerical simulation data from the literature fairly well, especially for the growth-rate oscillation behavior of the supersonic mode disturbance. Then, we investigate the TCNE effects on the supersonic mode instabilities over the 6 deg wedge. It is found that the flow stability is affected mainly by the TCNE effect on mean flows rather than that on disturbances. Subsequently, more PSE calculations are carried out with a variation of wall temperatures and disturbance frequencies. With the wall temperature beyond 30\% of the adiabatic one, the unstable supersonic mode is found to return to the subsonic one. Downstream of this turning point, the disturbance growth-rate oscillation dramatically decays. With the increase of the disturbance frequency, a similar trend to wall heating is observed in the growth-rate and phase velocity curves.},

For an oncoming Mach number of 6 and a rectangular indentation, two relevant scattering mechanisms, namely, the local scattering of oncoming Mack modes and the local receptivity to freestream acoustic waves, are studied by direct numerical simulations. A transmission coefficient and a receptivity coefficient are introduced to quantify the two mechanisms, and their dependence on the indentation depths and the oncoming-perturbation frequencies is investigated systematically. Numerical results reveal that both the local scattering and receptivity effects increase with the indentation depth when the latter is shallow, but the opposite is true for deep indentations. Such a phenomenon is found to be related to the topological structure of the base flow inside the indentations, namely, two independent separation bubbles for shallow configurations and one large-scale separation bubble occupying the whole indentation for deep configurations.},

Driving mechanisms such as pumping, flapping, or swinging were found to excite oscillations in the base region. Despite this finding, the question of why the pressure fluctuations and base flow excitations are especially pronounced in the subsonic to transonic flow regime remained unclear. This question is addressed in the study at hand. Results from the literature are combined with recent wind-tunnel measurements on the base model of a space transportation system. The measurement data were acquired by means of particle image velocimetry, pressure transducers, and high-speed schlieren imaging. The results suggest that an aeroacoustic coupling takes place between a jet noise generation mechanism called screeching and the near-wake dynamics. Due to the nature of both effects, they are likely to reach a resonating frequency during the ascent. The resonant frequency appears to increase unfavorable fluctuations in the base region, which are held responsible for the amplified unsteady loads. A schematic model concept is proposed, which describes the underlying governing mechanism. It provides an explanation for question why buffeting effects are especially amplified in the high subsonic ambient flow regime.},

The engine startup and shutdown processes of the Korean Space Launch Vehicle II third-stage rocket engine combustor are examined using three-dimensional time-accurate computations. The generation of side loads is closely related to the transition of the separation pattern due to the nozzle shape. However, the results also show that the side loads are significantly affected by the unique flow features of high-altitude testing, such as the flow entering through the gap between the nozzle and the diffuser, as well as the pressure waves produced by the impact of the diffuser flow breakdown. During the engine startup process, the interaction between the nozzle flow and the entrained flow produces unexpected side loads before the transition of the separation pattern. The first transition process generates two side-load peaks. The second transition does not produce any side loads owing to the smooth transition process, which is caused by the entrained flow acting like a nozzle extension. During the engine shutdown process, the initial pressure wave from the diffuser causes fluctuating side loads. The second pressure wave leads to the transition of the separation pattern, which temporarily increases the magnitude of the side loads.},

However, the flowfield characteristics of two such jets operating in tandem, where properties are influenced by jet–jet interaction and coupling, are relatively unknown. The present study reports on the experimental investigation of the flowfield associated with two underexpanded, impinging jets operating at a nozzle pressure ratio of 2.65 and discharged from identical converging nozzles with exit diameters of 25.4 mm. Comparisons with a single-impinging jet operating at the same conditions are provided through flow visualizations, near-field acoustics, and surface pressure measurements. Fountain flow produced by the interaction of wall jets (a unique feature of dual-impinging jets) is found to be relatively strong at short impingement heights and contributes to additional loads on the ground surface. Unsteadiness in dual jets is weaker than that in a single jet at conditions involving resonance, and the fountain upwash plays an important role in the process. Although the feedback mechanism that drives the resonance in both impinging jet configurations is similar and the corresponding instability mode shapes are retained, there are differences in the strengths of the instability modes between the two configurations.},

The breakup process as well as the primary breakup length are compared with the aid of the high-magnification shadow imaging technique. The droplet size distributions are obtained by the use of the particle/droplet image analyses technique at the same plane of measurement to compare the atomization quality in radial and radial–tangential discharge channels. The results reveal that the breakup process of the injected liquid stream is extensively affected by the tangential orientation of discharge channels of the atomizer disk. The atomization process is improved in the radial–tangential case as a result of the enhancement of aerodynamic forces acting on the exposed surface of the liquid stream. The droplet sizing indicates that the Sauter mean diameter values are decreased by the application of radial–tangential injection in all considered operating conditions.},

This study investigates the apparent source locations of the steepest shocklike events in the noise field of a high-performance military jet aircraft using an event-based time-domain beamforming method. This method uses the cross correlation between adjacent microphones to determine the angle of propagation of an ensemble of shock-related events within the time waveform. This angle of propagation is then traced back toward the source to find the apparent source location. Based on the propagation angle, derivative skewness, and overall sound pressure level, the microphone positions along the array are sorted into six groups. Shock events from groups related to crackle perception in the near field originate anywhere from 2 to 14.5 m downstream along the nozzle lip line, with distributions that shift downstream and broaden with increasing engine power. The crackle-related events appear to be generated by Mach wave radiation and large-scale turbulence structure noise.},

Conventional wing spars and ribs are replaced by CFRP rods, which are arranged with varying orientation and distribution within a load-carrying wing skin. A new structural parametrization is introduced to define the internal lattice structure. By adapting the orientation and distribution of the rods, the aeroelastic behavior of the wing is tailored. The material of the structure is thereby arranged in a structurally efficient manner, removing any excess material and reducing the mass of the wing. Furthermore, the arrangement of the rods promotes shape morphing, which is used for active flight control obtained with an integrated actuation mechanism. A demonstrator was fabricated to evaluate the actuation integration and morphing performance. To assess the lightweight and morphing potential of the wing, an optimization considering the fluid–structure interaction of the wing is carried out. For the investigated wing, the parameters describing the rod arrangement, the skin layup, and the actuation are optimized. A lightweight lattice morphing wing with high load-carrying capabilities and sufficient rolling moment coefficient compared to existing morphing wings was achieved.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, for the first time, two-term deflection is suggested for nonlinear analysis of shear deformable cylindrical shells and, to the authors’ knowledge, a first investigation on thermal nonlinear buckling behavior of functionally graded material (FGM) cylindrical shells including porosities is presented. Material properties are assumed to be temperature dependent, volume fractions of constituents are graded in the thickness direction according to a power law, and effective properties of porous FGM are estimated according to a modified rule of mixture. Porosities are evenly or unevenly distributed within the shell. Mathematical formulations are based on a first-order shear deformation theory taking into account geometrical nonlinearity and elasticity of in-plane restraints of edges. Two-term deflection and a multiterm stress function are assumed to satisfy simply supported boundary conditions. The Galerkin method and an iteration procedure are employed to evaluate critical buckling temperatures and trace temperature-deflection paths in the postbuckling region. The two-term solution of deflection is a significant suggestion for nonlinear buckling analysis of shear deformable cylindrical shells in general and thermal postbuckling analysis of porous FGM cylindrical shells in particular. This two-term solution includes inherent uniform deflection at the prebuckling state and overcomes mathematically tremendous difficulty in using three-term deflection for shear deformable cylindrical shells. Besides this innovative approach, the obtained results are of great interest for many engineering applications. Unlike the case of mechanical loads, porosities have beneficial influences on the stability of thermally loaded FGM cylindrical shells.},

  abstract     = {Flutter and limit cycle oscillation (LCO) are important phenomena that need to be considered in aircraft design. Previous harmonic-balance-based flutter and LCO prediction methods either have low linear convergence rates or require expensive Newton steps to achieve quadratic convergence. In this paper, we propose a preconditioned, Jacobian-free, coupled Newton–Krylov (CNK) method for the time-spectral aeroelastic equations. By solving the coupled system directly, the method reduces the computational cost of each Newton step, making quadratic convergence affordable. The proposed Jacobian-free method is easier to implement and requires less memory relative to previous methods. We demonstrate the capability of the CNK solver by verifying the results against a time-accurate solver and by comparing them to other harmonic-balance-based results reported in the literature. We observe that the proposed method is more efficient than the time-accurate method in LCO response simulations. And the LCO velocities and frequencies predicted by the proposed method and the time-accurate method are within 1\% of relative difference when the same mesh is used. This method can be potentially used in aircraft design.},

The smart solar array consisted of two deployable solar panels, which were locked by one shape-memory alloy and two SMPC releasing mechanisms, and could be released by low shocking through electrical heating. The smart solar array was actuated and deployed using two groups of SMPC hinges. A series of tests was conducted to evaluate the main performance of the smart solar array. The tests included structural dynamics (folded state: sinusoidal sweep vibration, shocking, acceleration, and noise; and deployed state: mode, sinusoidal sweep vibration, and flexibility), thermal design, locking and releasing, and deployment. This smart solar array satisfied the design requirements, including the fundamental natural frequency in a folded state at 80 Hz, maximum the locking force at 2000 N.

The experimental dataset was found to be free of major errors and is very suitable for validation of propeller models. Furthermore, aerodynamic interaction with an upstream wing was tested with the propeller and wing normal to the flow, to represent the interaction occurring with a time-averaged main rotor slipstream on a compound helicopter. From numerical investigation it was concluded that the results are qualitatively representative of this interaction. The experimental data showed that addition of the wing results in a net reduction of all propeller performance quantities, with thrust reducing up to 20\%. Thrust decreasing and thrust increasing mechanisms were found numerically. For most tested operating conditions, the wing resulted in a small decrease of propeller thrust-over-power ratio. Decreasing propeller advance ratio, increasing wing distance, and increasing flap deflection generally decreased the effect of the wing on thrust and power; however, the influence of flap deflection was found to be small.},

  abstract     = {This experimental study focuses on the aerodynamic interaction between an over-the-wing (OTW) propeller and a wing boundary layer. An OTW propeller is positioned above the hinge line of a wing with a trailing-edge flap. Measurements are carried out with and without axial pressure gradients by deflecting the flap and by extending the flat upper surface of the wing in the streamwise direction, respectively. Surface-pressure taps, microphones, and particle image velocimetry are combined to quantify both the time-averaged and unsteady interaction effects. Results show that the propeller generates an adverse pressure gradient on the wing surface that scales linearly with thrust and decreases with increasing blade-tip clearance. The pressure gradient is partially caused by slipstream contraction, which decelerates the flow near the wall. Additionally, the surface-pressure fluctuations generated beneath the propeller blades and slipstream are stronger than the time-averaged pressure increase due to flow deceleration. Consequently, the propeller triggers flow separation over the hinge line when the flap is deflected. A parametric study of different propeller locations indicates that increasing the tip clearance is not an effective way to mitigate flow separation. However, displacing the propeller half a radius upstream of the hinge line creates a Coandă effect, which allows the flow to remain attached.},

  abstract     = {The subject of turbulent and nonturbulent interfaces (TNTIs) has been extensively studied using idealized free-shear flows and zero-pressure-gradient flat-plate boundary layers. However, it remains to be addressed whether a TNTI can be quantitively identified in complex aerodynamic flows where separation bubbles, transition, turbulent boundary-layer separation and an asymmetric wake coexist in a complex spatially developing fashion. Here, we report a direct numerical simulation study at and at a low Reynolds number past a NACA-0012 airfoil at a angle of attack. The threshold-free fuzzy cluster method is used for TNTI identification, and it is corroborated by a joint probability density function-based method. The TNTIs detected are confirmed to be physical a posteriori by the distinctive quasi-step jump behavior in conditionally averaged statistics along traverses normal to the interfaces. The possible connection between the TNTI curvature and local entrainment is also investigated. Airfoil TNTI curvature parameters are found to be noticeably affected by the transitional state of the flow; at the same time, there are only minor differences between the TNTIs in the boundary-layer region and in the wake region. Conditionally sampled results suggest that there is little propensity for local entrainment to occur on either the leading or trailing edge of the TNTIs. Downstream of transition, local entrainment is more pronounced on relatively flat TNTI surfaces for both the airfoil wake and boundary layer.},

  abstract     = {A novel model is proposed to estimate the optimal propulsive efficiency and the optimal dimensionless heaving velocity of a flapping foil based on a lift–drag ratio under the assumption of negligible pitching power. The optimal efficiency increases with the lift–drag ratio. The optimal Strouhal number of sinusoidal heaving motion approaches 0.318, within the range of 0.25–0.35 for optimal efficiency. In addition, the thrust generation of a foil requires that the product of the lift–drag ratio and the dimensionless heaving velocity must be greater than unity. To demonstrate how to use the new model to estimate the optimal propulsive efficiency and the optimal dimensionless heaving velocity, the lift–drag ratio is estimated using static tests of an impulsively started uniform flow over an infinitely thin flat plate for a range of angle of attack. To illustrate how to design kinematics to achieve the estimated optimal efficiency, two examples of flapping motions of a flat plate at a Reynolds number of 2000 are considered: sinusoidal and nonsinusoidal. Results show that the efficiency of nonsinusoidal flapping motion approaches the optimal efficiency using the lift–drag ratio estimated from static tests over the effective angle of attack of 6–30°.},

The flowfield around the discontinuities is represented on fine grids that move with the frames attached to the waves. These moving grids are overset upon a coarse background grid of the entire facility, allowing efficient computation of the main discontinuities as they traverse the tube. Focus is placed upon accurate capture of the influence of wave speeds and viscous effects upon the shock and contact discontinuity as they traverse the tube. The code is extensively validated against experiments ranging from Mach 1.6 to 2.7 in a 26.8-mm-diameter shock tube with argon driver/driven gases and an initial pressure of 66.66 Pa. Agreement within 2\% is seen in velocity throughout the tube’s length. Test times are predicted to within 6\% across a broad range of test conditions.

An explicit mapping is used as the primary mesh deformation algorithm. High-order time-integration schemes are used by the coupled solver to march forward in time, and the space-time mesh of the fluid subsystem is adapted using output-based methods. The error estimates for the unsteady outputs are evaluated by calculating the uncoupled, unsteady adjoint of the fluid subsystem. Adaptive meshing is used to demonstrate the importance of mesh-motion errors on output convergence, and a comprehensive analysis is conducted to control such errors arising from the mesh deformation algorithm. The benefits of adaptive meshing are demonstrated on a cantilevered Euler–Bernoulli beam placed in a low-Reynolds number flow and on a two-dimensional pitching–plunging airfoil in a high-Reynolds number flow.},

The formulation proposes the use of constraint type elements, commonly used in finite element analysis, to establish the projection matrix. Through a series of verification studies, the proposed method is demonstrated to apply to any underlying finite element type and yields increased accuracy in projecting field values when compared with conventional mathematical-based interpolation approaches, such as radial basis functions (RBFs). The sensitivity of the approach to the number of connection points and the resolution of a computational structural dynamics grid are investigated, and optimal parameters are presented. The framework is demonstrated to be feasible for complex aeroelastic system configurations by using a representative F/A-18 Super Hornet dynamic beam-rod model. The proposed framework suggests a more physically viable transformation of the mode shapes as compared with RBFs without any additional preprocessing that would otherwise be necessary. Investigations of the forced harmonic response of the F/A-18 Super Hornet aeroelastic system showed significant differences in the dynamic response. Flutter results for the scaled model using the proposed approach accurately estimated the altitude. At the same time, RBFs showed a large discrepancy, highlighting the importance of the interfacial treatment for investigations of aeroelastic responses, as well as the assessment of critical dynamic loads.},

The results show that the Mach number has significant effects on the normalized mean temperature profile, even below the often-quoted low-Mach-number limit of , due to the associated viscous heating. In addition, we compare the first-grid point implementation (FGI) and the third-grid point implementation (TGI) of the equilibrium wall model. We show that, by placing the large-eddy-simulation/wall-model matching location away from the wall, TGI practically reduces the near-wall resolution seen by the wall model, which in turn leads to underperformance of the wall model. By considering three types of flows with increasing levels of complexities, the objective of this study is to systematically assess WMLES in terms of its ability to predict heat transfer for low-speed flows. For the flows considered here (that is, plane channel, ribbed duct, and film cooling), we show that WMLES with FGI is able to accurately model heat transfer at a much more reduced cost than WRLES and DNS.},

Like any other homogenization approach, it eliminates the need for pore-resolved fluid meshes, and therefore enables practical flow simulations in computational fluid domains with porous wall boundaries. Unlike alternative approaches, however, it does not require prescribing a mass flow rate and does not introduce in the computational model a heuristic discharge coefficient. Instead, it models the inviscid flux through a porous wall surrounded by the flow as a weighted average of the inviscid flux at an impermeable surface and that through pores. It also introduces a body force term in the governing equations to account for friction loss along the pore boundaries. The source term depends on the thickness of the porous wall and the concept of an equivalent single pore. The feasibility of the latter concept is demonstrated using low-speed permeability test data for the fabric of the Mars Science Laboratory parachute canopy. The overall homogenization approach is illustrated with a series of supersonic flow computations through the same fabric and verified using supersonic pore-resolved numerical simulations.},

The carefully chosen verification and validation benchmarks confirm the accuracy, effectiveness, and superiority of the current method. Results indicate that the introduced design method has comprehensive advantages over the traditional approach under design/off-design conditions. Specifically, the maximum increase in axial thrust reaches 6.38\%, and the maximum increase in lift exceeds 180\%. Necessary conditions of the thrust-optimized nozzle design are deduced combining Prandtl–Meyer relation and corner conditions, which provides a direct judgment criterion for the rationality of initial design conditions, and leads to a concise dimension estimation method. Relative errors of no more than 5\% demonstrate the credibility of this approach through a comparison with the theoretical solutions.

This work proposes an adjoint-free optimization method using deep-learning techniques to address the issue. A deep-learning-based optimal sampling method is developed to generate various wing shapes subject to both geometric validity and feasibility constraints. To address the curse of dimensionality in adjoint-free optimization, a compact wing shape parameterization method is presented by deriving global wing mode shapes from the sample wings. The proposed method is compared with the adjoint-based optimization method in both single-point and multipoint design of the Common Research Model wing. The proposed adjoint-free optimization method converges within 1000 objective function evaluations. The optimized shapes are close to those obtained by the adjoint-based optimization, and the differences in are all within 0.5 counts. The results show that the proposed adjoint-free optimization method has almost the same efficiency and effectiveness as the adjoint-based optimization method in high-dimensional wing shape design.},

  abstract     = {Airfoil design generally involves high dimensionality and nonlinear mappings, leaving the preferred infill sampling strategies in the framework of Bayesian optimization uncertain across instances and changeable in the sequential optimization stages. Knottily, no single-infill sampler guarantees the optimal results for airfoil design for its changeless intrinsic selection mechanism, whereas parallel strategies consume multifold computing resources for high-fidelity simulations. Therefore, this paper proposes an airfoil optimization framework using portfolios that integrates several single-infill samplers and assimilates a suggestion from them under the instruction of a meta-criterion. Two entropy-based portfolios, entropy search portfolio and max-value entropy search portfolio, are used as illustration for alternative scenarios. Comparative results between the proposed framework and frameworks using individual constituent samplers of the portfolios on both aerodynamic design and aerodynamic-stealth design show that the portfolio-based framework automatically authorizes the most suitable constituent at each iteration and guides fast convergences to optimal airfoils of high confidence without being influenced by underperforming constituents across instances of different complexity. It is demonstrated that the proposed portfolio-based airfoil optimization framework is robust and reliable for airfoil design instances without priors for options.},

  abstract     = {Multiobjective optimization is often a difficult task owing to the need to balance competing objectives. A typical approach to handling this is to estimate a Pareto frontier in objective space by identifying nondominated points. This task is typically computationally demanding owing to the need to incorporate information of high enough fidelity to be trusted in design and decision-making processes. In this work, we present a multi-information source framework for enabling efficient multiobjective optimization. The framework allows for the exploitation of all available information and considers both potential improvement and cost. The framework includes ingredients of model fusion, expected hypervolume improvement, and intermediate Gaussian process surrogates. The approach is demonstrated on a test problem and an aerostructural wing design problem.},

  abstract     = {Large-scale system design optimization is a numerical technique used in solving system design problems that involve a large number of design variables. These systems are often multidisciplinary, with many disciplines interacting with each other. The scale of these problems demands a gradient-based approach for efficient solutions, and it is often implemented by coupling an engineering model with an optimizer. A recently developed theory on multidisciplinary derivative computation has made it feasible to solve large-scale system design optimization problems in only hundreds of model evaluations. This has led to an increase in the number of applications for large-scale system design optimization with new applications still emerging. This paper presents a new optimization formulation that can further reduce the required number of model evaluations by unifying two widely used optimization architectures, namely, multidisciplinary feasible, and simultaneous analysis and design. Complex engineering systems that require solutions of large nonlinear systems can potentially benefit from this new formulation, and the optimized solutions can be reached in just tens of equivalent model evaluations. We demonstrate this order of magnitude improvement using a bar design problem. The paper also provides details on the practical implementation of this new formulation in an equality-constrained optimization setting.},

The cone geometries and the flow conditions of the simulations are chosen to closely match those of the experiments conducted at the Boeing/AFOSR Mach 6 Quiet Tunnel (BAM6QT) at Purdue University. In the linear (primary) instability regime the flared cone resulted in larger integrated growth rates ( factors) and a higher dominant second mode frequency. Investigations of the secondary instability regime revealed that the flared cone also leads to a stronger fundamental resonance, characterized by larger integrated growth rates of the secondary instability waves after resonance onset. For both cases, the so-called controlled fundamental breakdown simulations were carried out, which showed the development of similar patterns of streamwise hot streaks on the surface of the cones. Streamwise streaks were also observed in the Purdue experiments (for the flared cone only) using temperature-sensitive paint. A detailed comparison of the results obtained for both geometries indicated that the streak development is caused by the same nonlinear mechanisms.},

Two staggered rows of microramps were installed upstream of a 33 deg compression-corner interaction with large-scale separation at Mach 7.2, and the influence of these devices on the mean and turbulent flowfield, and the separation region in particular, was studied with particle image velocimetry. The microramps strongly altered the mean flow topology: The previously two-dimensional interaction region with a large separated zone in the vicinity of the ramp corner is broken up into a three-dimensional interaction, where the mean velocity at the spanwise locations downstream of the microramp centerlines is decreased, whereas it is increased at the spanwise locations in between the microramp vertices. The mean overall separation length is reduced, most strongly at spanwise locations in between microramps. A narrow local increase occurs directly downstream of the device vertices. The turbulence behavior across the interaction is not fundamentally altered under the influence of vortex-generator control, but a superposition of effects is observed. The microramp-induced longitudinal vortex pairs increase turbulent mixing and, by adding momentum into the near-wall region, support a faster decrease of turbulence intensity and return to equilibrium conditions downstream of the interaction.},

High-speed flight in the atmosphere when volcanic ash and other meteorological particles are present can cause damage to these vehicle surfaces, impairing heat transfer and damaging sensitive components, leading to failure. Upon surveying typical conditions for solid particles that might be encountered, it was determined that A2 test dust is a reasonable representation in terms of particle density, shape, and size distribution. A set of high-fidelity simulations was conducted with a hypersonic forebody to improve our understanding of the particle trajectories and impact energies as a function of particle size at relevant flight conditions. The results indicate that particle sizes between 4 and are responsible for the majority of the net surface-impact energy. It was also found that effects of compressibility and shape on particle drag can be significant within the boundary layer.},

Impulse facilities can simulate aspects of hypervelocity reentry flows, but cannot duplicate the extended-duration thermal environments. To address such deficiencies in short-duration testing environments, a novel plasma technique for preheating axisymmetric samples of heat-shield materials has been developed. The heating technique has been demonstrated using a short-duration blow-down arrangement at the University of Southern Queensland. A 50-mm-diameter graphite disk sample with a uniform thickness of 2 mm was heated from the downstream side with plasma to approximately 2500 K, and then it was exposed to a cold Mach 4.5 flow. The disk was mounted on an experimental probe that was very similar to the European standard probe, normal to the flow. Future applications for the technique are expected to be found in expansion tube facilities that can simulate the true flow energy under reentry conditions.},

Based on the generalized Snell’s law, this work proposes a reflection-controlled metasurface that can restrain the Mack second mode instability by controlling the reflection directions of disturbance waves and consequently stabilize hypersonic boundary-layer flow. The metasurface is periodically corrugated with subwavelength groove groups: each of which is composed of several grooves with different depths. The direct numerical simulation results of a Mach 6 flat-plate boundary layer indicate that the reflection-controlled metasurfaces divide the “two-cell” structure of the Mack second mode into several small parts, and that largely inhibits the growth of the Mack second mode.},

  abstract     = {A nonlinear model is developed to investigate the blade vibration-induced acoustic resonance in a linear cascade. The Euler equations are solved by using high-order computational aeroacoustics techniques. To satisfy no-penetration wall boundary conditions for vibrating blades, a semi-implicit time-accurate body force model is developed. Leading-edge singularity at resonance is remarkably strong, and so the balance of globally high-order quality (less dissipation) and numerical stability is significant. The adaptive discontinuity-capturing filtering is introduced as a local operation to achieve the good balance. To validate our model, the benchmark case of the Parker acoustic resonance induced by the vibrating cascade of flat plates is revisited. Compared to the linearized theory and viscous flow solution, our inviscid model economically achieves a good prediction both for the unsteady loading and the near-field sound pressure for the small blade vibration amplitude of . When it comes to a larger vibration amplitude of , nonlinearity on the unsteady lift and sound pressure appears in our results, and it cannot be considered in the linearized theory. The results, to some extent, are also consistent with the viscous flow solution. The study well verifies the capability of our nonlinear model in predicting this category of linear and nonlinear sound-vortex/structure interaction problems.},

  abstract     = {In aeroengine titanium alloy components, hard alpha (HA) inclusions strongly affect material performance, especially in terms of fatigue properties. Residual stresses caused by thermal expansion mismatch during the cooling process affect the fatigue life of metal components. This study proposes a method of probabilistic risk assessment for aeroengine disks considering the residual stresses of HA inclusions. Specifically, numerical procedures are adopted to investigate the residual stresses of an inclusion under surface effects, and a functional relationship model of residual stresses under surface effects is proposed. To deal with the randomness of inclusion size and position, a calculation criterion for the residual stresses of an inclusion is established. Analysis of an aeroengine compressor disk shows that the expected decline in the failure risk of the disk is approximately 27\% under the consideration of residual stresses. The proposed method predicts the failure risk more accurately, and is thus valuable for the safety assessment of an aeroengine titanium disk.},

The experiments were conducted at various equivalence ratios from to and at three testing mass flow rates of , and . Fast-response wall pressure measurements, high-speed gas luminosity imaging, and heat flux measurements were employed simultaneously to evaluate the dynamics of the detonation waves among various testing conditions. Wave mode transition from two pairs of counter-rotating waves at fuel lean conditions to a single dominant wave at fuel-rich conditions has been observed. Four different wave modes in this transition are identified and discussed in the views of the wave dynamics, the pressure rise magnitude, and the thermal effect. Spectral analyses on the combustor pressure and the flame intensity present good consistency, showing the dynamics of the multiple detonation wave components from two different measuring techniques. The results suggest multiple wave components (namely, a single wave component, a primary wave pair, and a secondary wave pair) can coexist in the current rotating detonation combustor. The wave dynamics at different equivalence ratios follow the tendency of the wave evolution at ideal Chapman–Jouguet conditions. The wave mode transition is found to be a fact of the change of the dominant wave component in the combustor. The sudden growth of the single wave component is observed in the wave mode transition, which greatly changes the combustor environment. The wave mode is inferred to be correlated to the fuel–oxidant mixing configuration, suggesting the fuel–oxidant blowing ratio and the combustor geometry could be significant parameters in the formation of the wave mode.},

  abstract     = {The active subspace method is applied to Burrows–Kurkov supersonic wall-jet flame to quantify modeling uncertainties associated with chemical kinetics, turbulence combustion models, and boundary conditions, as well as to investigate the evolution of key physiochemical process throughout the supersonic flame. One-dimensional active subspaces of the uncertain parameter space are identified for both flame liftoff length and flame–wall distance. Through the analyses of active subspaces, it shows that chemical kinetics plays a dominant role for flame initialization and early development, whereas turbulent transport becomes more important as the flame develops. The univariate response surfaces constructed in the active subspaces are then used to perform uncertainty quantification. For the flame liftoff length, the uncertainty introduced by chemical kinetics is slightly larger than that introduced by turbulence combustion models and significantly larger than boundary induced uncertainty; whereas the uncertainty in the predicted flame–wall distance is dominated by turbulence combustion modeling, and the contribution from boundary and chemical kinetics is trivial. Further comparison between two turbulence models with structural compressibility correction shows that the active subspace is insensitive to turbulence models at the same level of closure. The corrected shear stress tensor and corrected standard yield the same key physiochemical process and similar uncertainties in the predictions.},

  abstract     = {Aircraft design benefits from optimization under uncertainty since design feasibility and performance can have large sensitivities to uncertain parameters. Legacy methods of uncertainty protection do not adequately explain the tradeoffs between feasibility and optimality, and they require prior engineering knowledge that may not be available for new system concepts. Furthermore, stochastic optimization over parameter distributions is computationally intractable for solving high-dimensional nonlinear design optimization problems. This paper proposes an efficient solution method for engineering design optimization problems under uncertainty using robust signomial programs (RSPs). Signomial programs (SPs) have demonstrated potential in solving multidisciplinary optimization problems, and the formulation of RSPs enables conceptual design that captures parametric uncertainty with probabilistic guarantees of constraint satisfaction. The proposed method transforms stochastic optimization problems to deterministic problems by considering the worst-case robust counterpart of each design constraint over a parameter uncertainty set, provided that each constraint is SP representable. The RSP formulation extends an existing robust geometric program (RGP) formulation by allowing difference-of-log-convex constraints that appear in many design problems. The RSP is solved efficiently and deterministically using a sequence of local RGP approximations. RSPs are then applied to unmanned aircraft design, and they are used to rigorously explore the tradeoff between robustness and optimality in design decisions.},

The usual design strategy employed for compliance with the regulations is the use of allowable values. However, allowables are not guaranteed to satisfy the regulations as written. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the use of allowables via a formal reliability analysis using quantile evaluation. We find that allowables are provably conservative for simple settings but admit anticonservative structural analysis under nonmonotone structural response, strongly nonnormal distributions, correlated material properties, and high-dimensional material property spaces such as those arising in laminate composites. This analysis develops intuition for when allowables are a conservative approximation of a true reliability analysis. We introduce an inexpensive procedure to detect analysis pathologies and illustrate its use on a set of aerospace-relevant structural analysis problems.},

Hence, understanding the model form error is essential to improve the prediction capability. Often, a model by itself consists of several submodels where each submodel is subject to potential error. The potential errors can superimpose or compensate for each other over time, which makes it difficult to find a possible source of model form error. This study aims to quantify, rank, and isolate the contribution of error in each submodel to the error in the model prediction. The concept of global sensitivity analysis is extended by using it as a tool to isolate the most influential potential error in drag force submodels of a transient multiphase dispersed flow on particle cloud position. The possible errors of the submodels are modeled as uniformly distributed epistemic uncertainty, and their contributions to the quantity of interest are calculated in terms of sensitivity indices. We found that the most influential potential submodel error depends on time and the characteristic of the particle cloud.},

  abstract     = {When dealing with flows at moderate Reynolds numbers, the laminar and transition regions are a key component of the flow solution. In applications such as wind turbines and unmanned aerial vehicles, an accurate prediction of the aerodynamic forces requires accounting for these effects. In Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations, this is done by incorporating transition models because commonly used turbulence models are unable to predict a significant extent of laminar flow. In this paper, we present and study the coupling of the local correlation-based and transition models with the (KSKL) turbulence model, and we compare it to the original formulation using the shear-stress transport (SST) turbulence model. The coupling of the models is calibrated for the flow over a flat plate and subsequently tested for the flow around the S809 and NLF(1)-0416 airfoils, as well as around a 6:1 prolate spheroid. The results show that the combination of the transition model with the KSKL turbulence model leads to a reduction of the numerical uncertainty (discretization errors) when compared to its application with the SST model. On the other hand, the combination of the KSKL model with the transition model leads to the sharpest transition of the four combinations tested.},

The analysis is performed for an ordinary-differential-equation-based equilibrium wall model due to its widespread use and ease of implementation. Two test cases are considered for this purpose: a spatially developing TBL in a square duct with a 30 deg bend, and the flow behind a wall-mounted skewed bump with a three-dimensional separation bubble. In the duct simulation, WMLES is capable of predicting mean-velocity profiles and crossflow angles in the outer region of the flow to within 1–5\% error using 10 points per boundary-layer thickness. The largest disagreement (20\% error) is observed in the crossflow angles in the bend region, where three-dimensional effects are the most significant. In the skewed bump simulation, it is shown that the present equilibrium wall model with a grid resolution of about 40 points across the three-dimensional separation region predicts mean-velocity profiles and separation location to within 1–3\% error. The bubble size and vortex structures in the bump wake are also correctly represented. It is demonstrated that WMLES is capable of achieving accurate results in the separated region and its vicinity, provided that the strong shear layer generated at the apex of the bump is well resolved.},

The new transition model is first tested against two axisymmetric cones to verify that the first and second modes are well modeled and not influenced by the newly established formulations for crossflow instability. Then, the HIFiRE-5 cases in quiet and noisy conditions and a circular cone at an angle of attack of 3 deg are selected to assess the performance of the present model for crossflow-induced transition. The numerical results show that the transition onset locations predicted by the present transition model are quite consistent with the experimental results, which indicates that the present transition model is capable of predicting crossflow-induced transition with a reasonable degree of accuracy and good compatibility with modern parallel CFD codes using local variables.},

Conditional averages triggered by the detection of high-intensity pressure peaks on a conical surface near the jet flow are computed. Averages obtained for peaks of different intensities are presented to identify the factors favoring the steepened aspect of the waves, which are not likely due to nonlinear propagation effects given the surface radial position. The Mach waves just outside the jet are shown to be correlated with coherent structures in the supersonic side of the mixing layers. Their steepened aspect is found to increase with their intensity. The variations of the wave properties with the convection speed, strength, and geometrical shape of the mixing layer structures are then discussed. These properties do not depend much on the convection speed but are closely related to the two other parameters. The wave intensity and steepened aspect increase because the shear-layer structures are stronger, but also because they are more inclined relative to the jet direction. In the latter case, the asymmetric shape of the structure appears to promote the formation of positively skewed Mach waves.},

  abstract     = {At a transonic condition, the design of a natural laminar flow (NLF) wing is challenging because the extension of the laminar flow needs to be finely balanced with the potential wave drag increase. To achieve this balance, it is proposed to unlock the wing sweep and introduce a three-dimensional (3-D) contour shock-control bump (SCB) in the optimization of the NLF infinite swept wing aiming at total drag reduction. A 3-D Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes flow solver is extended to incorporate laminar–turbulent transition prediction due to streamwise and crossflow instabilities. The flow solver is integrated in a gradient-based optimization framework. The transition criteria including streamwise and crossflow instabilities are coupled in the sensitivity calculation using a discrete-adjoint solver. Transonic design optimization of the sectional profile and wing sweep angle is first conducted at a Mach number of 0.78. The optimization managed to alleviate the shock wave, reducing the pressure drag while it failed to extend the laminar flow. Furthermore, a combined optimization of the wing with a parameterized SCB at the same condition is carried out. The optimized wing with the SCB features a long favorable pressure gradient region and a low-sweep angle, which allows for a large proportion of laminar flow without significant pressure drag. The shock wave is controlled by the 3-D bump, and the SCB has little effect on the upstream flow.},

  abstract     = {We carry out a parametric study of conical shock-wave/turbulent boundary-layer interactions by means of numerical simulation of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations, with the eventual goal of establishing the predictive capabilities of standard turbulence models. Preliminary assessment of several linear-eddy-viscosity models for the case of planar interactions shows that the model and its variants as well as the Spalart–Allmaras model yield accurate prediction of the typical interaction length scale. Numerical simulations of conical interactions at high Reynolds numbers under attached and separated flow conditions generally support good capability of RANS to predict the gross flow features, including conditions of incipiently and fully separated flow. Comparison with direct numerical simulation data at low Reynolds numbers suggests that caution should be made because certain turbulence models may yield unrealistic incoming velocity profiles. With this caveat, we again find that RANS models yield satisfactory prediction of the three-dimensional flow organization and associated length scales. The -wave mean wall pressure signature is quantitatively predicted, and accurate information about the fluctuating pressure variance can be obtained from RANS data in a postprocessing stage by extension of correlations developed for low-speed separation bubbles.},

A new semi-analytical three-dimensional model of the tip vortex flow, calibrated using data extracted from a RANS mixing plane simulation, is coupled with an existing RANS-informed model of the rotor viscous wake and potential flow perturbations. This provides a more general and accurate procedure for the reconstruction of the flow velocity perturbations at the rear rotor inlet. These perturbations are used to compute the unsteady blade loads and the interaction noise tones by means of analytical models from literature. The method is tested on the Open Rotor UDF F7/A7 and validated against unsteady RANS (URANS)-based results. It is found that the tip vortex model significantly improves the reconstruction of the velocity perturbations. The noise emissions computed analytically from reconstructed and URANS velocity perturbations agree remarkably better when the contribution of the tip vortices is modeled properly. A comparison with the results of the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings acoustic analogy shows some inaccuracies that are mainly ascribed to inherent limitations of the adopted analytical blade response and noise propagation models.},

Two groups of endplates are tested. The first group has three different fractal patterns applied along the top edge of the endplate, while the second group has three different two-scale patterns applied to its outboard surface. It is experimentally shown that both geometry modifications produce a weaker and less coherent vortex. Moreover, while a peak in the power spectral density of the fluctuating axial velocity at the vortex core at Strouhal numbers between 3 and 10 is observed for the plain endplates of both groups, it vanishes for the multiscale endplates. This suggests that the multiscale endplates act on the vortex structure, making it less coherent through the production of smaller eddies as evidenced by the velocity spectra. The multiscale endplates also show potential improvements in terms of the wing aerodynamic efficiency, with the maximum being up to 11.1\% larger than for the corresponding plain endplate.},

Sensitivity studies were done on the undulation wavelength along the span (, 0.21, and 0.15) and undulation placement (leading edge, trailing edge, and both leading and trailing edges). The leading-edge undulations delayed stall until higher angles of attack; however, the maximum aerodynamic efficiency was reduced. The trailing-edge undulated wing, on the other hand, increased the maximum aerodynamic efficiency but was not successful in stall mitigation. Wings with both leading- and trailing-edge undulations showed improvement in aerodynamic efficiency as well as delayed stall. The effect of the undulations on the wingtip vortex was also investigated through Particle Image Velocimetry. For the same coefficient of lift, the undulated wing cases reduced the wingtip vortex circulation by 25\%. Investigations into the wingtip vortex core RMS and aerodynamic efficiency revealed a direct relationship where a higher vortex core rms resulted in a higher aerodynamic efficiency, and vice versa.},

Based on the data of the tests on thick specimens, interesting hydrodynamics aspects as well as the role played by the impact conditions on pressure, loads, and strains are identified. Ventilation and/or cavitation conditions are found in some specific conditions during the impact of double-curvature specimens.

The cylinder was exposed to an impulsive force associated with the incident shock followed by transverse loading imposed by vortex shedding. Experimentally, aerodynamic loading was characterized with high-speed pressure sensitive paint (PSP). Digital image correlation concurrently measured the structural response. Maximum displacement occurred when the vortex shedding frequency most closely matched the structural mode of the beam associated with a rocking motion at the joint. A finite element model was developed using Abaqus, where Coulomb friction modeled the nonlinear contact in the joint. The PSP data supplied the input load to the model as a one-way-coupled interaction. The simulations matched well the trends observed in the experiment. Overall, the root-mean-square values of the transverse displacement agreed to within 24\% of the experiment. The modeling showed rocking about the joint during vortex shedding was critical to the nonlinear damping and energy dissipation observed in the structure.

  abstract     = {Traditional lag dampers used in rotorcraft applications are unable to produce adequate levels of damping for high-speed coaxial compound rotorcraft that use rigid, hingeless blades. The current paper shows the possibility of having an intrinsic passive damping solution through the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) embedded in the interlayer region of a carbon-fiber-reinforced epoxy composite laminate. The CNTs are assumed to have a reversible stick–slip damping mechanism in the composite. The dissipation caused by the slip between the CNTs and the epoxy matrix is proportional to the slippage length of the CNTs. A laminated composite model is used to simulate a spar with alternating plies and CNT interlayers. The model is used to predict the stresses, strains, and damping associated with the plies and interlayers. The laminated composite damping model is validated by comparing the predictions with experimental results from the literature. The model is used to demonstrate the effect of the CNT interlayers on the damping of the composite blade. The effects of blade rotational speed and key CNT parameters (such as aspect ratio and critical shear stress on the damping of the blade) are also investigated. Loss factors of over 8 and 6\% were observed with optimally configured parameters for soft and stiff in-plane rotors, respectively (0.138\% for the baseline blade). Overall, the results suggest significant damping augmentation is achievable from the use of CNT interlayers in carbon/epoxy blades.},

To improve the computational efficiency in estimating TDFP, an adaptive kriging model is developed in this paper. In the proposed method, TDFP is first represented as a bilevel problem, where the outer level is a one-dimensional rooting problem with respect to the membership level of fuzzy variables and the inner level is a minimum optimization of the model response function where the interval parameters and time are regarded as the same level. Second, the dichotomy instead of the interpolation technique is employed to solve the one-dimensional rooting problem. Third, the numerical simulation replacing the optimization technique is used to settle the optimization problem. Finally, to greatly reduce the computational cost in estimating the TDFP especially involved in numerical simulations, an adaptive kriging model is proposed for TDFP analysis. Additionally, the proposed kriging model can be used to estimate the safety life based on the TDFP constraint. The results of a mathematical example and two aerospace engineering examples show that the proposed method significantly improves the efficiency in estimating the TDFP and the TDFP-based safety life with acceptable precision.},

  abstract     = {Cable slacking may be frequently encountered in mechanical analysis of tensegrity structures. Traditional nonlinear finite element analysis in handling this issue may lead to numerical difficulty due to the dramatic changes of the stiffness matrix induced by cables switching between taut and slack states. To deal with the nonsmooth nature induced by cable slacking, we propose in this paper a novel nonlinear complementarity function-based framework for mechanical analysis of tensegrity structures. The core idea is that the constitutive relation of cables is reformulated as a set of equality equations. This is done by first introducing a parametric variable and expressing the constitutive relation with a complementarity condition, and then using the modified Fischer–Burmeister complementarity function. By considering the introduced parametric variables as additional degrees of freedom in the finite element model, it becomes possible to get rid of the nonsmooth nature, as well as to solve a continuous, smooth, differentiable problem by using the classical Newton–Raphson method. The proposed framework is first developed for static analysis and then extended to dynamic analysis, both under large displacement. The closed-form expressions of the Jacobian matrix are analytically derived. Multiple examples are presented to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional transient dynamics of a towed system is investigated in this paper. The tow cable is modeled as a geometrically exact (GE) beam, and the payload is a rigid body. The GE beam model incorporates large displacements and rotations of the cable, including cross-sectional shear, which is impossible in current models. Time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) systems, used in mineral surveying, are selected as a specific application, and so the payload is taken as a rigid ring attached to the cable through rigid, massless links. Aerodynamic loads, including von Kármán forces, are computed by adding loads experienced by small cylindrical elements constituting the cable and the payload. The heavy aircraft remains unaffected by the underslung system’s motion. The governing equations are derived and solved using a nonlinear finite element method, which requires computationally coupling the GE beam (cable) with the rigid payload. The dynamics of a model TDEM system under several flight conditions is then simulated to investigate 1) transient oscillations driven by von Kármán effect, 2) steady-state payload configurations, and 3) von Mises stress in the cable at its point of attachment to the aircraft. Our general formulation, with straightforward modifications of the payload model, will also be useful for other such cable-towed systems.},

  abstract     = {A large space antenna structure will inevitably vibrate due to the space thermal environment and maneuver actions of the satellite. Such vibration will last continuously and affect normal function of the antenna. Therefore, a proper vibration control method is vital to keep the shape accuracy of the structure within an acceptable range. The research object of this paper is a large deployable planar phased array antenna that uses cables as active actuators. Research contents include the optimization of actuator position and the design of control law: both of which have considered the unilateral and saturated constraints of the cable actuator. First, the finite element method is used to obtain the modal information of the structure. Then the actuator position optimization method is established by using the controllability principle and the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Second, a piecewise cost function is adopted to design the control law by combining a linear quadratic regulator with a bang–bang regulator. In the numerical simulation, the vibration control process of an antenna structure consisting of 18 lattices is simulated and analyzed. The results prove that the proposed actuator position optimization method and the control law could effectively suppress the vibration and maintain the shape accuracy of the antenna structure.},

To this end, a new method, namely, the minimum residual nodal displacement method, for optimal shape adjustment of large high-precision cable network structures is developed. The new shape adjustment method can significantly reduce shape distortion of a cable network structure by automatically placing a small number of actuators at optimal locations. This new method is applicable to cable network structures under both predictable and unpredictable shape distortions, and can determine the minimum number of actuators needed to satisfy prescribed design requirement for surface accuracy. In this method, a simple linear relationship between nodal displacements, external loads, and undeformed member lengths of a cable network structure is established, and residual nodal displacement of the structure is minimized. The effectiveness of this new method is proved in numerical simulation results, where a planar cable network structure and a reconfigurable deployable mesh reflector are investigated.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, the flutter performance of a composite thin-walled beam wing–engine system is optimized by implementing two different control approaches: 1) passive open-loop and 2) active closed-loop control. Sequential quadratic programming and genetic algorithm methods are applied in the optimization process. In the passive control method, variable stiffness is acquired by constructing laminates of thin-walled beam with curvilinear fibers having prescribed paths. The goal is to exploit the desirable fiber paths with improved flutter performance to determine an optimized wing–engine aeroelastic configuration. In the active control strategy, piezo-composite actuators and the linear quadratic Gaussian algorithm are used to improve the flutter characteristics. A novel optimization strategy based on the total energy of the aeroelastic system is introduced and applied in both passive and active control strategies. The minimum total aeroelastic energy is an indication of ideal optimization variables, which leads to optimum flutter performance. The governing equations are formulated based on Librescu’s thin-walled beam theory and Hamilton’s principle. An unsteady aerodynamic model based on incompressible indicial aerodynamics is applied. The governing equations of motion are solved using a Ritz-based solution methodology. Numerical results demonstrate a 16 and 46\% improvement in the flutter speed of the wing–engine system using the proposed passive and active control approaches, respectively. The presented results provide valuable information concerning the design of advanced lightweight and high-aspect-ratio aircraft wings with mounted engines in terms of favorable aeroelastic performance characteristics.},

The displacement field approximation, which is initially layer based, has been made layer independent by using continuity conditions on displacements and transverse shear stresses as well as zero traction conditions on top and bottom surfaces. Material properties in FGM layers vary continuously in the thickness direction. Piezoelectric layers have constant property across their thickness. Extended Hamilton’s principle for piezoelectric continuum has been used in deriving governing equations of motion and boundary conditions. An analytical solution is obtained for elastic as well as piezoelectric layer bonded FGM plates. Static and free vibration responses have been obtained in a number of FGM plates, with each plate considered to contain a number of FGM layers with discontinuity or continuity in material properties at the interfaces. Wherever available, present responses have been compared with three-dimensional exact solutions and other shear deformation theories. The effects of the aspect ratio, length-to-width ratio, and different schemes for effective material property calculation have been illustrated.},

  abstract     = {The growth of the micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) industry is outpacing our understanding of how MAVs behave in cluttered environments. Search and rescue and product delivery (two key MAV applications) occur in tight, confined spaces filled with complex obstacles. Our current understanding of how micro-quadrotors interact with boundaries is based primarily on helicopter models, which were designed for high-Reynolds-number single-rotor flows. To test how well existing near-boundary models apply to micro-quadrotors, the thrust forces and wakes of a micro-quadrotor near a ground, ceiling, and sidewall were measured. It is found that micro-quadrotors (like their larger counterparts) experience a large boost in lift near the ground/ceiling and a slight drop in lift near the sidewall. Particle image velocimetry is used to quantify the velocity around the rotors and evaluate the assumptions made by existing ground and ceiling models. Complex boundary-layer interactions were observed at low altitudes, especially when the quadrotor was tilted relative to the ground. Reduced-order modeling was also used to explore the safety implications of near ground/ceiling flight. Tradeoffs between safety and efficiency that are sensitive to the ground/ceiling models were discovered, highlighting the need for precise near-boundary models. The results of this study therefore offer guidance for near-boundary model-driven controllers that could improve situational awareness and sensorless landings.},

Typically, the helicopter operations on frigates are located at the stern. That is, after the superstructure of the ship and just behind the hangar where the helicopter can be hosted. Using a simplified frigate shape model, tests have been carried out at the National Institute of Aerospace Technology’s low-speed wind tunnel by modifying the hangar geometry in a bubble-shaped way to optimize it aerodynamically and improve the flow over the frigate aftdeck. Roof and side walls have been modified by linear , circular , and elliptical geometries. A particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique has been used for obtaining the flow velocity field above and behind the hangars proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of each geometry modification proposed. Finally, a numerical comparison with the PIV results and parameters such as the storage capacity reduction of the hangar due to its geometry change has been carried out.},

Simulations were carried out for a wing section with an airfoil from the X-56A with a chord-based Reynolds number of and 12 and 15 deg angles of attack. Results for 12 deg angle of attack show that for a wing section with low inertia and highly flexible support, the amplitude of the structural motion of the wing section motion is relatively weak. For a wing section with higher inertia and stiffer support, the structural response matches the natural eigenfrequency. For both cases, compared with results for the rigid (nonmoving) wing section, the frequency content of the aerodynamic loads is noticeably reduced near the structural eigenfrequency. For the wing section with stiffer support at 15 deg angle of attack, a laminar separation bubble is repeatedly bursting and reestablishing itself at a relatively low frequency. When the stiffness of the support is reduced so that the low-frequency of the bubble bursting couples with the structural eigenfrequency, the amplitude of the unsteady aerodynamic forces is doubled and the amplitude of the structural motion increases nearly 30 times compared with the stiffer support.},

Naturally, the way in which mode I stress-intensity factors are influenced by torsion is of interest. The influence of parameters such as crack length, crack angle, width and depth of beam, wall thickness, and stiffener size on mode I and mode II stress-intensity factors has been studied using the finite element method and represented the data in a surrogate model using two approaches: 1) a Fourier-series-based correction factor, and 2) an artificial neural network.

  abstract     = {A full-scale wind-tunnel test of a replica of Otto Lilienthal’s Normalsegelapparat from 1893 was conducted in a closed low-speed wind tunnel. The goal was to determine the flight performance and characteristics of this glider for the first time. It is of particular interest to this investigation to resolve the open question about the design’s static stability and to clear up whether Lilienthal treated the cloth covering the wings. Therefore, tests were performed both with an impermeable, sealed cloth as well as with untreated, permeable wings. Forces and moments were measured at freestream velocities between 5 and at angles of attack from the linear lift interval up to fully stalled conditions. The recorded data are used to investigate the flight performance and characteristics of the glider with an emphasis on its static stability. The impact of the permeability of the cloth in comparison to the impermeable configuration is discussed.},

Numerical calculations are presented to demonstrate the existence of viable operating conditions to study magnetohydrodynamics. Argon is selected as the test gas due to its simple chemistry and low ionization enthalpy. A candidate flow condition is selected for detailed analysis and experimental validation. Finite-rate reacting argon numerical simulations indicate that relatively short shock-layer length scales for the models tested in X2 limit the degree of argon ionization that is generated. However, a strong interaction remains available, and use of a larger facility can fully mitigate this issue. It is shown that expansion tubes are capable of generating the required flowfield for these experiments, and important considerations for design of suitable test flows are identified.},

Discharge plasma behavior is numerically simulated based on a three-fluid plasma model. Regarding the induced jet structure, although the simulation tends to underestimate the jet thickness and overestimate the maximum velocity, the discrepancies are small considering the quite simple modeling. In addition, the values of thrust force in the simulation are consistent with those in the experiment only within 10–20\%. On the other hand, the simulation underestimates the power consumption by 40–50\% mainly due to the assumption of two-dimensionality. Furthermore, the thrust force and power consumption are investigated from the viewpoint of characteristics for voltage amplitude, voltage waveform, and dielectric material. As a result, the discharge mode in the simulation, which strongly affects the electrohydrodynamic force generation characteristics, needs to be consistent with that in the experiment to reproduce the voltage waveform characteristics of thrust force. In addition, to reproduce the dielectric material characteristics of thrust force, not only permittivity but also secondary electron emission coefficient needs to be set to appropriate values for each material.},

  abstract     = {High-speed aerospace engineering applications rely heavily on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models for design and analysis. This reliance on CFD models necessitates performing accurate and reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) of the CFD models, which can be very expensive for hypersonic flows. Additionally, UQ approaches are many-query problems requiring many runs with a wide range of input parameters. One way to enable computationally expensive models to be used in such many-query problems is to employ projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) in lieu of the (high-fidelity) full-order model (FOM). In particular, the least-squares Petrov–Galerkin (LSPG) ROM (equipped with hyper-reduction) has demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce simulation costs while retaining high levels of accuracy on a range of problems, including subsonic CFD applications. This allows LSPG ROM simulations to replace the FOM simulations in UQ studies, making UQ tractable even for large-scale CFD models. This work presents the first application of LSPG to a hypersonic CFD application, the Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation 1 (HIFiRE-1) in a three-dimensional, turbulent Mach 7.1 flow. This paper shows the ability of the ROM to significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining high levels of accuracy in computed quantities of interest.},

  abstract     = {Super-cooled large droplets (SLDs) present a unique experimental challenge for conventional horizontal spray icing wind tunnels due to gravity effects on the droplets and coalescence between the particles. Limited ice accretion shapes in this regime exist, making the verification of modeling tools and the validation of the applicability of scaling methods difficult. Furthermore, SLD accretions often occur in nature in a bimodal icing cloud, providing an additional facility challenge related to the reproduction of such clouds. The objective of this research effort is to expand the available SLD dataset to assess the capability of an existent ice accretion tool (LEWICE 2D) to predict such ice shapes. The effort also attempts to further verify the applicability of ice shape scaling methods in the SLD regime. Finally, bimodal SLD cloud reproduction and ice shape prediction is investigated. The Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand (AERTS) at Penn State was assessed as an alternative facility to icing wind tunnels for ice accretion testing in the SLD regime. Laser diffraction measurement data analysis demonstrated that the icing nozzles used in the facility can produce an SLD within of requested values. Techniques to measure liquid water content (LWC) in the facility are also presented. LWC was controllable within . LEWICE ice shapes predicted were obtained using legacy empirical heat transfer models as well as an updated empirical heat transfer function developed at Penn State. When comparing modeling results to experimental shapes from the literature and the AERTS, LEWICE with the updated heat transfer function provided stagnation thicknesses within 5.6\% of experimental values and horn protrusion within 16\%. The modified Ruff scaling ice shape method was effective in the SLD regime, providing a mean deviations of 2.5\% between reference and scaled ice shape characteristics. Finally, characteristics of a bimodal ice shapes were predicted by LEWICE. When comparing modeling results to experimental shapes, LEWICE with the updated heat transfer function provided predictions within 10.3\% of the experimental stagnation thickness measured. It also provided horn angles with discrepancies of less than 12\%. Icing limits of a bimodal icing cloud were observed to be that of a single mode SLD cloud of the same MVD, with an overall deviation of when comparing the experimental database to LEWICE.},

  abstract     = {Indirect noise due to the interaction of flow inhomogeneities with a choked nozzle is an important cause of combustion instability in solid rocket motors and is believed to be important in aircraft engines. A previously published experiment (Kings, N., and Bake, F., “Indirect Combustion Noise: Noise Generation by Accelerated Vorticity in a Nozzle Flow,” International Journal of Spray and Combustion Dynamics, Vol. 2, No. 3, 2010, pp. 253–266.) demonstrated that interaction of a nozzle with time-dependent axial swirl can also be a source of sound. This axial swirl was generated by intermittent tangential mass injection upstream from a choked nozzle in a so-called vortex wave generator. The present work discusses the impact of swirl–nozzle interaction in this experiment on the acoustic waves detected downstream of the nozzle. The main source of sound appears to be the reduction in mass flux through the choked nozzle, which depends quadratically on the swirl number. This effect is quantitatively predicted by a quasi-steady and quasi-cylindrical analytical model. The model, combined with empirical data for the decay of axial swirl in pipe flows, predicts the observed influence of the distance between the vortex wave generator and the nozzle. The findings presented here contradict the hypothesis found in the literature, which presumes that sound production in the aforementioned experiment is due to the acceleration of vorticity waves through the nozzle.},

The modeling and optimization framework allows concurrent aerostructural design and flight trajectory optimization of morphing wings considering complete flight missions. The approach is demonstrated on a camber-morphing wing airborne wind energy (AWE) system. The system’s power production capability is improved by enabling wing shape changes, and thus adaptation of the aerodynamic properties through morphing at different flight conditions and operating modes. The results of this study highlight the potential of the proposed modeling and optimization approach: 1) the power production capability of the investigated AWE system is improved by 46.0\% compared to a sequentially optimized wing design; and 2) by exploiting camber morphing to adapt the aerodynamic properties of the wing at different flight conditions, the power production is further increased by 7.8\%.},

The literature suggests that the bimodal behavior may be correlated with upstream boundary-layer events. To test this hypothesis, large-eddy simulations of a generic junction flow with Rood wing geometry were performed for a Reynolds number of 7000 based on airfoil thickness and approach flow velocity. Pulsed disturbances were deliberately introduced upstream of the junction to generate deterministic boundary-layer events. The variable-interval time-averaging method was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the forcing and track the downstream development of the boundary-layer events. Cross correlations of this quantity with the circulation of the junction flow horseshoe vortex were computed to quantify the dependence of the bimodal behavior on the upstream disturbances. Several of the observed boundary-layer events led to a loss of coherence of the horseshoe vortex. Overall, the present results provide support for the hypothesis that the bimodal behavior is related to upstream boundary-layer events.},

  abstract     = {The aerodynamics of aircraft high-lift devices at near-stall conditions is particularly difficult to predict numerically. The computational requirements for accurate wall-resolved large-eddy simulations are currently prohibitive, whereas Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) models are generally reliable only for low angles of attack with fully attached boundary layers. Methods such as detached-eddy simulation resolve unsteadiness of the outer boundary layer and can predict separation, but they rely upon a thick RANS layer and highly stretched cells that damp the resolved turbulent fluctuations near the wall. An alternative approach, adopted here, is to extend the LES down to the wall, employing a relatively large near-wall normal grid spacing and avoiding grid stretching and high aspect ratios near the wall. A boundary condition then applies the correct wall shear stress as provided by a semiempirical wall model. An adaptive formulation of this wall-modeled large-eddy simulation is presented here and validated using realistic test cases. Validation using a channel flow case at a range of Reynolds numbers demonstrates accurate results with a seamless transition between fully resolved and wall resolved . Predictions of the MD-30P/30N airfoil using a modest grid with give excellent agreement with experiments and correctly predict . Finally, the method is demonstrated for the NASA High-Lift Common Research Model providing surface pressure coefficients and velocity profiles. The predictions using a 50-million-cell mesh (for a full aircraft half-model) are in good agreement with considerably finer-grid RANS solutions. The presented method has considerable potential because it can produce accurate solutions to challenging engineering problems involving separation with modest grid and computational requirements while being robust to variations in near-wall grid spacing.},

  abstract     = {We present applications of laser-energy deposition for drag reduction in supersonic flow. The system of chemically reactive Navier–Stokes equations describes the hydrodynamics where nonequilibrium effects are accounted for by means of a two-temperature model. The propagation and attenuation of the laser beam are modeled based on a kinetic approach for photons (radiative transfer equation). Multiphoton ionization, inverse bremsstrahlung (free-free radiation), cascade ionization, and shock hydrodynamics are coupled self-consistently without imposing an initial plasma seed to initiate the breakdown, as is often done in the literature. Simulations are conducted in supersonic airflow over a spherical blunt body to study the control of aerodynamic forces. Results confirm that the laser-induced thermal spot can be effectively used to control the shock structures with beneficial effects in terms of aerodynamic loads. As a matter of fact, the interaction of the downstream advected hot spot with the bow shock distorts the latter (the lensing effect) and leads to toroidal vortices due to baroclinic torque. Drag is momentarily decreased due to the formation of an expansion fan (related to the upstream movement of the bow shock) that generates a load reduction on the wall, as well as to the advection of the vortex region that remains attached to the wall. The results also demonstrate that the self-consistent computational framework is able to handle complex multiscale multiphysics flow control problems for predictive applications without the assistance of tuning parameters and/or simplifying assumptions inferred from the experiments.},

To efficiently simulate the particulate–flow interactions, an adaptive mesh refinement approach is used to capture the wide range of temporal and spatial scales present in the laminar–turbulent transition process. The particulate impingement simulations for a flow over a 14 deg wedge and two different particulate impingement locations employing the newly developed numerical approach are compared against simulations using a conventional static-mesh approach. For the flow conditions considered, oblique first-mode instability waves dominate the early stage of the transition process. In the second part of this paper, the differences between pulse and particulate impingement simulations are investigated in two and three dimensions for a flat-plate boundary-layer flow where two-dimensional second-mode instability waves are most amplified in the primary instability regime.},

First, the nonlinear vortex-lattice method is described, augmented with a Prandtl–Glauert compressibility correction and regularized so that poststall solutions can be recovered. The linearization of the coupled system of equations is formulated using a Newton method, and the adjoint state is obtained for lift, drag, and inverse design functionals. Numerical results show that the aerodynamic model approximates well the forces predicted by three-dimensional (3D) RANS simulations for the Common Research Model wing, and that the adjoint-state gradients agree well with finite difference tests for a plethora of test cases. More interesting examples are shown, ranging from the optimal unstalling of wings to the assimilation of 3D RANS data into the present model, as well as its ability to extrapolate.},

  abstract     = {A sharp-interface immersed-boundary method that does not smear the boundaries, is easy to implement, and is straightforward in handling the Neumann condition as compared to previous methods is developed for compressible flows to simulate the interaction of solid particles with shocks. The inviscid and viscous fluxes of compressible flow equations in curvilinear coordinates are discretized with a third-order weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) scheme and a central scheme, respectively. The equations are advanced in time using a third-order Runge–Kutta method. The sharp interface at the immersed boundaries is maintained by reconstructing the flow variables along the normal direction to the boundary. The WENO discretization is reverted to a biased essentially nonoscillatory scheme near the immersed boundaries to avoid using the nodes that are inside the immersed boundary. The method is validated against experimental measurements and shown to be between second- and third-order-accurate in the presence of immersed boundaries. The method is applied to simulate shock-tube experiments involving the interaction of a moving normal shock with a stationary cylinder as well as a cylindrical and a spherical particle accelerating by a shock. The numerical results capture all of the shock features observed in the experiments and show great agreement with the measurements and previous benchmark solutions. The results show that the acceleration of a sphere due to an incident shock highly depends on the density ratio of the sphere to the incoming fluid.},

  abstract     = {Mesh generation and deformation are critical elements in gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO). Improperly generated or deformed meshes may contain bad-quality cells that degrade the accuracy of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers. Moreover, an inefficient mesh deformation method can become the bottleneck for the entire ASO process. To perform practical ASO, mesh generation and deformation methods need to be automated, scalable, robust, and computationally efficient. This paper tackles these challenges by developing an efficient approach for generating high-quality structured meshes in a semi-automatic manner. An automatic mesh generation approach is also proposed to handle intersections of multiple structured meshes with the overset mesh approach. In addition to mesh generation, a flexible mesh deformation method is developed, along with an efficient approach for computing mesh deformation derivatives using automatic differentiation. Finally, the performance of the proposed approaches is evaluated in terms of speed, scalability, and robustness. The mesh generation approach scales up to 100 million cells and 256 CPU cores. In addition, the robust mesh deformation approach enables a large range of valid mesh deformations, which gives more freedom to explore the design space in ASO. Moreover, the mesh deformation and the computation of its derivatives require only 0.1\% of the CFD runtime. The mesh generation and deformation approaches have been implemented in the pyHyp and IDWarp software packages, which are publicly available under open-source licenses. The proposed approaches are useful tools to handle general ASO problems for aircraft, turbomachinery, and ground vehicles.},

  abstract     = {A novel configuration of focused laser differential interferometry (FLDI) was developed, simulated, and tested. The new configuration is referred to as cylindrical FLDI or CFLDI. Using cylindrical lenses in place of standard lenses changes the three-dimensional shape of the focusing beam from a cone shape for FLDI to a triangular sheet for CFLDI, allowing for probing of flat-plate boundary layers closer to the wall. The beam propagation and interference pattern were modeled to determine the transfer functions for one-dimensional sinusoidal disturbances of varying wavelength and varying spanwise thickness of the tested area. CFLDI was employed to measure the density perturbations in supersonic blowdown wind tunnel SBR-50 at the University of Notre Dame with the test section width of 0.076.2 m. It was determined that the CFLDI system sufficiently filtered the sidewall boundary layers to measure the spectra of density fluctuations in a plane wall boundary layer. However, accurate measurements of the density disturbances in the freestream flow must account for the contribution of the sidewall boundary layers. This serves as an initial validation of the CFLDI maintaining spatial filtering similar to a regular FLDI.},

Specifically, we examine whether an array of isotropic sensors, which are unable to detect the direction of an incident flow when operating in isolation, can together sense not only the magnitude but also the orientation of a freestream flow passing over and through them. To conduct our inquiry, we consider a fundamental scenario involving a boundary-layer flow past a flat plate decorated with a array of sensors. Numerical modeling is used to simulate the interaction between the fluid flow and flexible hair sensors. We find that, indeed, it is feasible to achieve collective directional sensitivity by engineering the arrangement of the sensors. We also propose a supervised machine learning approach capable of deducing the direction of the freestream flow from the deformation signals outputted by individual sensors in the array.},

Wind-tunnel tests during accurate pitch oscillations were conducted, and the dynamic longitudinal forces and moment data were obtained. We proposed a method to accurately identify the dynamic pitching moment during pitch motions from our data using a dynamic derivative model. In our model, the dynamic derivative due to the pitch rate and pitch acceleration were considered, and these dynamic derivatives were treated as linear functions of angle of attack. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify the coefficients in the model. Our model can separately describe the static and dynamic part of the total pitching moment. The dynamic pitching moment coefficients were precisely identified by our dynamic derivative model with consideration of the acceleration term for low angles of attack. In addition, the pitch acceleration term could be considered to have the same effect as virtually changing the moment of inertia of the delta-wing model.},

These features are studied using Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations in combination with wind-tunnel experiments. The structures are identified as regions of streamwise vorticity embedded in the sidewall boundary layers. These vortices locally perturb the sidewall boundary layers, and they can increase their thickness by as much as 37\%. The vortices are caused by a region of separation upstream of the nozzle where there is a sharp geometry change, which is typical in supersonic wind tunnels with interchangeable nozzle blocks. Despite originating in the corners, the vortices are transported by secondary flows in the sidewall boundary layers so they end up near the tunnel center height, well away from any corners. The successful elimination of these sidewall vortices from the flow is achieved by replacing the sharp corner with a more rounded geometry so that the flow here remains attached.},

The on-orbit photographs of IKAROS revealed that the sail membrane was deformed toward the sun and the membrane maintained its deployed shape during very low-spin-rate operations. To clarify the mechanism of the deformation and high stiffness, the authors of the present study previously performed deployed shape analyses of one-quarter of one square sail by employing Abaqus and reported that the phenomenon was probably caused by curvatures of thin-film devices attached to the membrane. In this study, a finite element model of the entire square sail of IKAROS was created. Furthermore, deployed shape analysis under several combinations of curvatures and spin rates was conducted by employing the dynamic solver “Abaqus/Explicit.” The results indicated that the sail deformations were induced by the curvatures of thin-film devices and that umbrella and saddle shapes appeared owing to the curvatures. The results also indicated that the electric harnesses between the sail and spacecraft supported the sail shape when the spin rate was low.},

To validate these physical assumptions, six different computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis cases are considered under various energy conditions and taper angles. After validating the assumptions, the accuracy of the FLM is highly secured when compared to CFD. The flow variables (such as the orifice velocity) and performance variables (such as thrust and impulse) are presented as the result of the FLM, which agree well with the result of the CFD analysis. With respect to the impulse, which is regarded as a key parameter of SparkJet actuators, less than approximately 0.1 and 0.51\% errors occurred under various energy conditions and taper angles, respectively.},

Both components share a common induced speed . This is done by considering an enhanced disk area for momentum balance, to match Glauert’s hypothesis mass flowrate. To shed light on the theoretical developments, wind tunnel tests were conducted on a two-bladed propeller at angles of incidence ranging from 0 to 90 deg. The wing component is shown to increase with airflow velocity and angle of incidence. The axial component decreases with , for all angles. The generally observed thrust increase with angle of incidence is explained, by the theory, to be mostly due to the wing component contribution. The theory also explains why at angles of incidence above 60 deg propellers inherently behave differently than at lower angles. While thrust decreases with at lower angles, it grows with airspeed at an angle of incidence of approximately 60 deg or higher. This behavioral inversion happens as the wing component positive sensitivity to overcomes the negative sensitivity of the axial component. A simplified formula is presented for predicting thrust at a given angle, based only on propellers data at an angle of incidence of 0, regardless of blade geometry.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the theoretical–numerical study of integral formulations for the prediction of noise scattered by moving bodies, through the velocity-potential description of flow disturbance. Specifically, three potential-flow acoustic scattering integral formulations are examined: a linearized boundary-field integral formulation, recently introduced by the authors, is compared with two widely applied boundary integral approaches based on Taylor and Taylor–Lorentz transformations. The objective of this work is to provide a detailed analysis of the theoretical differences among these formulations and corresponding limits of applicability, followed by the assessment of their capability of capturing the influence of nonuniform mean flow around moving sound scatterers. This is accomplished by a numerical investigation that concerns a rigid, rectangular, nonlifting wing in uniform rectilinear translation impinged by sound waves emitted by a comoving pulsating point source.},

Such devices are indeed of growing interest for practical applications because they potentially lead to significant noise-reduction effects. Numerical simulations including wire mesh screens are therefore of major interest to optimize their possible location and properties, as well as to get a better understanding of the involved physical phenomena. On the basis of several finely resolved unsteady simulations (direct numerical simulation and large-eddy simulation) of the flow through an isolated wire mesh sample, a numerical wire mesh screen model is proposed and calibrated. An application of the method to the tandem cylinder test case is then performed for different screen locations and porosities. The introduction of wire mesh screens in the flow is observed to lead in some cases to a significant reduction of the radiated noise, by up to 8 dB.},

Results from the schlieren images exhibit the spatial distribution of the power spectrum of the shock oscillation during the process of passing through the SWBLI region. This distribution indicates that the downstream region of the SWBLI tends to excite the oscillation with a higher power and longer duration. In the periodic motion, the relationship between the velocity of the first separation shock and the varying rate of the downstream pressure shows that the downstream region of the SWBLI has slight retardation on the movement of the separation shock. The analysis based on the dynamic model indicates that the hysteresis of the separation shock in this situation is caused by the nonlinear relationship between the length of the shock system and the flow condition, which forms a dual solution in the pressure distribution within the shock system. When the flap varying rate is below a certain value, the width of the hysteresis loop maintains as the same, which is determined by the distributions of the flow parameters; whereas with a larger varying rate, the dynamic feature of the separation shock should be considered.},

  abstract     = {This work discusses the design, measurement, and simulation of an oscillating shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction on a flat plate at Mach 5.8 and . The shock generator is free to pitch and oscillates with a frequency of 42 Hz, resulting in a shock that varies in intensity and impingement point, with a maximum flow-deflection angle of approximately 10 deg. Transition appears to take place downstream of the separated region for both static (with a fixed flow-deflection angle) and dynamic experiments; however, heat-flux values are typically between laminar and turbulent solutions, thus suggesting that a complete transition to a fully turbulent boundary layer is delayed because of the favorable pressure gradient induced by the impinging expansion wave originating from trailing edge of the shock generator. Peak pressure is typically overpredicted by laminar simulations for large deflection angles. Starting from the reattachment point, heat-flux measurements show that the boundary layer gradually deviates from the laminar solution towards a fully turbulent boundary layer. Vortices are observed in the reattachment region, and their distribution is solely a function of the boundary-layer properties at the separation point. Transient effects induced by the shock motion result in a maximum bubble length variation of 30\%. For the static cases, the separated region amplified disturbances with a frequency of approximately 200 Hz. In the dynamic experiment, harmonics induced by the pseudosinusoidal motion of the shock generator were measured everywhere on the plate.},

This case was analyzed in more detail using particle image velocimetry. The results reveal a strong corrugation of the separation zone due to the injection of the jets with a substantial reduction in its area along the entire spanwise extent of the air-jet array, compared with the uncontrolled case. Measurements of velocity fluctuations along the interaction region also show that the jet injection results in a reduction in turbulent intensity after reattachment, contributing to an overall reduction in amplification factor across the interaction region. The expected increase in turbulent mixing, which is essentially responsible for the control effect, was confirmed in the region in-between jet injection and separation shock. Farther away from the surface, the flow is not affected, which reduces potential drag penalties.},

High-fidelity large-eddy simulations are employed to examine surface morphing as a way to reduce the size of the separation region, and thus favorably alter the unsteadiness characteristics. The configuration considers a turbulent Mach 2.7 flow at a Reynolds number of subjected to an impinging shock system with a pressure ratio of , which results in separation and the presence of structurally relevant low-frequency unsteadiness. The control surface, centered about the shock impingement location and extending over the separation region, is allowed to deform under material property-based realizability constraints until an asymptotic state is achieved. The criterion for deformation uses a measure proportional to the directional surface shear stress. At an asymptotic state, the deformed surface reveals a shape consistent with aerostructural optimization and a maximum height of . Control mitigates the sharp initial pressure gradient of the uncontrolled flow to delay and reduce separation extent (by 50\%) with diminution of low-frequency content and turbulent kinetic energy. Modal decomposition highlights these effects in the energy content of the prominent modes. Morphing may thus provide a means to adjust the local surface deflection in a manner that reduces some of the problems associated with turbulent separation.},

  abstract     = {The demand for large-scale design optimization and probability-based analysis is constantly increasing. In design optimization and stochastic analysis, repeated analyses are required, which impede computational efficiency. Several effective reanalysis techniques using the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury (SMW) formula have been formulated for application to static analysis. However, it is difficult to directly apply the SMW formula for dynamic reanalysis, and, consequently, substructuring techniques are frequently employed for the dynamic reanalysis. The existing dynamic substructuring finite element techniques require recalculations for all the substructures, including changed elements, even when only a single element is changed; thus, the accuracy is reduced owing to the interface assumption. Therefore, to apply the SMW formula to the dynamic reanalysis, an approach is employed in which, using dynamic condensation, the dynamic problem is transformed into a problem where the SMW formula can be employed. Furthermore, to improve the speed of convergence in the condensation method, the proposed method reuses the condensed matrices calculated in the previous analysis. Thus, the proposed method precisely updates and recalculates only the elements of interest, thus increasing the computation efficiency and accuracy. Several numerical examples are presented to verify the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.},

Among them, the finite difference method is an approximate method; the direct differentiation method and the adjoint variable method are analytical methods. Based on the dynamic problems of the multibody system in the form of differential–algebraic equations, the semi-analytical sensitivity analysis method for multibody system dynamics is proposed in this paper, which combines the simplicity of the finite difference method with the accuracy of the analytical methods. It includes the local semi-analytical method based on the element level and the global semi-analytical method based on the system level, of which the latter has higher computational efficiency. Through two numerical examples, the effectiveness and numerical stability of the method are verified. This method not only retains the accuracy and efficiency of the analytical methods, but also simplifies the derivation and coding of analytical formulas by combining with the existing programs. It has stronger versatility and is beneficial to the sensitivity calculation of large-scale complex multibody systems.},

  abstract     = {Bioinspired surface riblets have been known to improve drag performance by altering the near-wall flow structures, especially in the transitional flow regime. Unlike conventional riblet geometries (for example, sawtooth and scalloped shapes) overlaid on flat plates, the use of a new Gaussian-shaped abstraction overlaid on three-dimensional (3-D) airfoil surfaces is conceived in this paper. Given the prohibitive computational burden of simulating the surface flow at high fidelity around the submillimeter-scale riblets, an adaptive-fidelity design approach (namely, surrogate-based optimization with adaptive in situ model refinement) is adopted to enable tractable exploration of the hypothesized benefits of the new riblet concept. The optimization process is integrated with open-source computer-aided design modeling, computational fluid dynamics, and postprocessing tools, with the provision for distributed batch processing, leading to a fully automated bioinspired design framework with potential for wider adoption. Substantial drag reduction of up to 17.2\%, compared to the bare 3-D airfoil (without riblets), is achieved. The drag coefficient of ribleted airfoils is found to be mostly distributed around that of the bare airfoil, with the optimum being a favorable extreme point, thereby demonstrating the important role that adaptive-fidelity optimization plays in quickly identifying the (narrow) beneficial range of abstracted shape parameters. Further insights are derived into the flow physics driving the aerodynamic efficiency benefits of smooth riblets, with riblets of height-to-spacing ratios of 0.5–0.8 identified as particularly promising in the case studies.},

The surrogate modeling method is specifically designed to tackle the fluid systems involving distributed aerodynamic structures, and its performance is illustrated by the application on the wake flow around wind turbine arrays in an atmospheric boundary layer. The main idea is to first decompose the whole fluid domain into subdomains, then carry out surrogate modeling for each subdomain by treating both the boundary information and the distributed flow parameters as the input parameters, and finally obtain the whole flowfield by combining the flowfield of each subdomain with the consideration of the matching condition at the subdomain interface. The proposed surrogate modeling method is applied to two test cases: a one-dimensional Poisson equation and a high-fidelity wind farm wake model. The results demonstrate the great efficiency and accuracy of the surrogate model and its excellent scalability to distributed systems of different scales.},

These techniques minimize the least-squares difference between an experimentally measured mean flow quantity and the corresponding quantity as computed by the FANS code. The two DA methods differ from each other in the choice of the control parameters: one perturbs the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a baseline Reynolds stress, whereas the other perturbs the components of a baseline realizable Reynolds stress such that the perturbed result is still realizable. For the optimization procedure, a gradient-based algorithm is used in combination with a discrete adjoint methodology. The DA methods are applied to high-Reynolds-number problems, and their results compared with a reference technique. The results show that the approaches developed in this work are more effective at reconstructing the turbulent flowfield than standard techniques, but are more computationally expensive due to the high dimensionality of the optimization problem. Furthermore, it appears that only small perturbations to the control parameters are necessary to obtain significant improvements over the baseline results.},

This required the determination of turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent eddy viscosity, and turbulent energy dissipation rate. Image interrogation was optimized, with different procedures used for mean strain rates and Reynolds stresses, to produce useful turbulent eddy viscosity fields. The eddy viscosity was calculated by a least-squares fit to all components of the three-dimensional strain-rate tensor that were available from the PIV data. This eliminated artifacts and noise observed when using a single strain component. Local dissipation rates were determined via Kolmogorov’s similarity hypotheses and the second-order structure function. The eddy viscosity and dissipation rates were then combined to determine . Considerable spatial variation was observed in , with the highest values found in regions where turbulent kinetic energy was relatively low but where turbulent mixing was important, e.g., along the high-strain jet edges and in the wake region. This suggests that use of a constant in modeling may lead to poor Reynolds stress predictions at mixing interfaces. A data-driven modeling approach that can predict this spatial variation of based on known state variables may lead to improved simulation results without the need for calibration.},

  abstract     = {The computational cost associated with simulating fluid flows can make it infeasible to run many simulations across multiple flow conditions. Building upon concepts from generative modeling, we introduce a new method for learning neural network models capable of performing efficient parameterized simulations of fluid flows. Evaluated on their ability to simulate both two-dimensional and three-dimensional fluid flows, trained models are shown to capture local and global properties of the flowfields at a wide array of flow conditions. Furthermore, flow simulations generated by the trained models are shown to be orders of magnitude faster than the corresponding computational fluid dynamics simulations.},

  abstract     = {Straight-bladed crossflow turbines are computationally explored for harvesting energy in wind and water currents. One challenge for crossflow turbines is the transient occurrence of high apparent angles of attack on the blades that reduces efficiency due to flow separation. This paper explores kinematic manipulation of the apparent angle of attack through intracycle control of the angular velocity. Using an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model at moderate Reynolds numbers, the kinematics and associated flow physics are explored for confined and unconfined configurations. The computations demonstrate an increase in turbine efficiency up to 54\%, very closely matching the benefits shown by previous intracycle control experiments. Simulations display the time evolution of angle of attack and flow velocity relative to the blade, which are modified with sinusoidal angular velocity such that the peak torque generation aligns with the peak angular velocity. With optimal kinematics in a confined flow there is minimal flow separation during peak power generation; however, there is a large trailing edge vortex shed as the torque decreases. The unconfined configuration has more prominent flow separation and is more susceptible to Reynolds number, resulting in a 41\% increase in power generation under the same kinematic conditions as the confined flow.},

Force measurements are done on a low-aspect-ratio high-angle-of-attack translating wing having a rectangular planform that incorporates a moving tip with in-plane rotation and sweep. To create streamwise gusts, the wing is towed in a water tank from constant motion to a new velocity that is 50\% higher (“step-up”) or lower (“step-down”) through ramp distances of 1, 3, and 6 chords traveled. The tip panel is rotated inward for the step-up cases to lower the gust lift peaks and outward for step-down gusts to mitigate the lift lost. The actuation cases are compared using the unsteady with two reference geometries (pre- or post-gust wing shapes). In most cases, actuation yields better gust-force change for = 2 than = 4, due to the greater change in wing planform. The actuation timing also alters the details of the force recovery. Furthermore, an impulse metric shows that inward tip actuation can mitigate the gust-impulse change by as much as 38\% and outward tip actuation by 84\%. A superposition of the individual effects of the actuation and gust is tested against the cases of actuation during gusts.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to study the lift response of transverse and vortex gust encounters. A sine-squared transverse gust was created in a water towing tank using a water jet, whereas a vortex gust was created in a water channel by clockwise half-rotation of an upstream gust generator plate. Forces and flowfields were acquired for both gust types. The effects of the gust ratio and vertical positioning of the gust generator plate were investigated for the transverse gust and the vortex gust encounters, respectively. For a flat plate at a 0 deg angle of attack, changing the gust ratio for the transverse gust was found to have a major effect on the peak lift and a minor effect on the recovery phase; whereas changing the vertical positioning of the gust generator plate for the vortex gust was found to cause relatively minor effects at almost every point in the lift response. Both gust encounters resulted in large transients in the lift force, and the unsteady forcing was found to depend on the circulation shed from the leading edge of the wing. The lift force experienced and the circulation shed showed a steeper increase for the transverse gust encounters despite the same gust ratio of one. Average velocity variations in time were obtained from the flowfield measurements along an upstream line for both gust types, and variations in the gust-induced angle of attack were computed. The Helmbold equation was then used to predict the lift coefficients based on the calculated gust-induced angle of attack. The trends in the measured and predicted lift coefficients were found to compare well with each other, but the values were found to agree well only when the gust-induced angle of attack was low.},

  abstract     = {The unsteady load response of an airfoil encountering a gust is often modeled using analytical transfer functions, which assume idealized behavior of both the flow and the airfoil. One such transfer function is the Sears function, which models a pure transverse gust interacting with a flat-plate airfoil at zero mean incidence. The function was extended by Goldstein and Atassi (“A Complete Second-Order Theory for the Unsteady Flow About an Airfoil due to a Periodic Gust,” Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 74, No. 4, 1976, pp. 741–765) to account for camber and incidence, as well as the presence of a streamwise gust component. Atassi (“The Sears Problem for a Lifting Airfoil Revisited-New Results,” Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 141, April 1984, pp. 109–122) showed that the effects of camber and incidence (that is, nonzero mean airfoil loading) are not negligible when there is a streamwise gust component. In this work, new experimental data are shown for an airfoil with nonzero loading encountering a gust with both streamwise and transverse components. As well as giving validation to the Atassi model, the flow physics behind the model is shown, including the superposition of the gust onto the airfoil potential field and the propagation of the gust along the airfoil surface.},

  abstract     = {Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators were implemented on the leading edges of Wells turbine impeller blades for the purpose of controlling leading-edge separation, and the turbine performance was recorded. Pulse-modulated perturbations at dimensionless frequencies near unity produced remarkable increases in performance. Under massively stalled conditions, with upstream angles of attack exceeding 50°, perturbations produced spin-up and acceleration of the impeller, whereas termination of the pulsations caused the impeller to spin down to uncontrolled conditions. With pulsations active, the impeller was then allowed to accelerate and was subsequently slowed by loading the shaft. Under these loaded conditions the turbine power output exceeded that of the plasma power input by a factor of nearly 30. Given the large changes in angle of attack and reduced frequency across the span of the blades, it is astonishing that plasma actuators produce such a positive net effect. It was hypothesized that the excitation mechanism of separation control observed on airfoils and wings is also active on the rotating impeller blades. Technical challenges associated with the implementation can be overcome, rendering pulsed DBD plasma actuators a potentially game-changing technology.},

A good qualitative agreement is found between experiments and simulations, with small discrepancies in the maximum and minimum lift coefficients observed during the maneuvers and somewhat larger discrepancies during the postmaneuver phase. It is found that the airfoil shape has a small effect on the lift coefficient but a somewhat larger effect on the drag coefficient.

This paper investigates the effects of 3-D geometry features (such as finite span, taper, sweep, and rotation) on the unsteady lift response to gusts and the flow-physical differences between 2-D and 3-D geometries in unsteady flow. A frequency-domain inviscid vortex lattice model is validated and used for the 3-D analysis. The results are compared to unsteady transfer functions from 2-D linear analytic theory (for example, Theodorsen and Sears functions). The study agrees with previous research findings that 3-D effects are most significant at low reduced frequencies and low aspect ratios, as well as near the wing tips. The driving cause of 3-D response is shown to be the wake vorticity: both streamwise and spanwise components of unsteady wake vorticity must be modeled. The study concludes by investigating whether unsteady response of more complex 3-D wing and rotor geometries can be represented by the response of a rectangular wing. The results indicate that this is possible for tapered wings and rotating blades, but not for swept wings.},

Although the vortex sheet distribution, which represents the boundary-layer vorticity, agrees with that calculated following Küssner’s potential flow approach for a sharp-edged transverse gust, it was found that the sheet can also be determined from the vorticity distribution in the shear layers forming the gust edges. Furthermore, it is found that the noncirculatory force calculated using Küssner’s model is an overestimate because the implicit assumption of rigid gust shear layers leads to an unphysical additional momentum change as a body of volume enters the gust regime. A volume correction is therefore proposed. In addition, it is found that the gust shear layer width and deformation have a noticeable effect on the unsteady noncirculatory force development, which reduces the applicability of Küssner’s method for large gust ratios and objects with considerable volume.},

  abstract     = {The development of space mission requires the lightweight, large deploying-to-folding ratios and high-precision deployable structures. The tape-spring hinge can achieve a deflection of 180 deg within a 5\% elastic deformation range. For one triangular prism mast (TPM) with the tape-spring hinges, the equivalent beam model for the TPM is derived using an energy equivalence method. The node deflections’, geometrical parameters’, and material properties’ relationship between the TPM and equivalent model are built based on the structural features. The strain and kinematic energy equations of the key points are derived by the equivalent model. The stiffness and mass matrices of the equivalent model are obtained. In addition, the modal of the TPM in free vibration modes is analyzed based on the Timoshenko continuum beam theory, and natural frequencies are solved. Two TPM units are developed to validate the precision of the continuum beam equivalent model. A model test is conducted at the cantilever position, and the finite element (FE) model of the two TPM units is modified. Subsequently, the modeling approach of the two TPM units is applied to establish the FE model of the 10 TPM units. Moreover, the accuracy of the continuum beam equivalent theoretical model is verified.},

The effects induced by rotation (for example, dynamic stiffening, tennis-racket effects, etc.) are highlighted. The geometrical pretwist effect-induced additional inertial and elastic couplings are specifically discussed. A better idea of the relationship between control effectiveness and the synergistic effect devoted by elastic, inertial, and actuation couplings is obtained based on the linear quadratic regulator control strategy. It can be found that elastic couplings have a significant effect on control effectiveness of the system (especially on that controlled by the piezoelectrically induced transverse shear), whereas the influence of the rotation-induced centrifugal effects on control effectiveness is weaker. On the other hand, elastic couplings will reduce the sensitivity of the control authority to the piezoelectrically induced actuation couplings. And, the geometrical pretwist effect will further reduce this sensitivity since it will introduce more elastic couplings to the system.},

This is true for any static or dynamic loading, and especially for aerodynamic loads that may lead to a dynamic instability and limit cycle oscillations. In the present paper, a mathematical and computational model for the general case has been created to allow for the full range of in-plane boundary constraints to be considered. This is of fundamental interest but is also of considerable practical interest, in that physical structures usually fall somewhere between the two limiting cases. Moreover, it is shown that prior models of even the limiting cases are, at best, approximations of these special cases; and comparisons between the present model and prior models provide new insights into these issues. The model is also correlated with a recent hypersonic wind-tunnel experiment. The effect of in-plane constraints is investigated on buckling, vibration about a nonlinear deformed state due to static pressure differential, flutter onset, and postflutter limit cycle oscillation.},

This represents a formal extension of the linearized frequency-domain (LFD) methods to a nonlinear framework, leading to a so-called LFD method for a second-order functional series expansion method. The method allows for the representation of weak nonlinearities by solving two input-independent linear algebraic systems of equations in the frequency domain, and thus circumvents the solution of the nonlinear PDE by numerical integration for each different input, representing a nonlinear reduced-order model (ROM) for the physical phenomena. The general form of the equations is derived, and several applications are discussed. The proposed method overcomes two constraints present in other methods for the solution of nonlinear PDEs, namely, the consideration of exclusively periodic solutions as in the harmonic balance method and the dependency of the kernels with the input signal as in the Volterra kernel identification methods.},

However, existing approaches have relied on the major species of air as the gain medium. This work presents the first experimental demonstration of an air laser based on water vapor, a minor constituent of air. The approach relies on photodissociation of water vapor molecules followed by two-photon pumping of the constituent hydrogen atoms to produce lasing on the well-known Balmer-alpha line. This hydrogen laser is characterized in both the forward as well as return direction, and this paper discusses the effect of some parameters, including the presence and type of buffer gas, as well as the pump beam focusing. It is found that most of these results can be explained in terms of their influence on the gain of the stimulated emission process. This method can be potentially applied to other hydrogen-containing molecules and offers a promising approach for standoff detection of trace species.},

  abstract     = {Total-pressure losses and distortion in an aggressive offset diffuser, induced by secondary-flow vortices and boundary-layer separation, are mitigated using fluidic actuation for the aerodynamic interface plane Mach number up to 0.57. Although total-pressure recovery is primarily impacted by separation in each of the diffuser’s turns, distortion is governed by counter-rotating streamwise vortices that advect low-momentum fluid from the wall region into the core flow. The present investigations have shown that secondary-flow vortices couple to the outboard segments of the separated-flow domains. Therefore, fluidic control of the scale and topology of the trapped vorticity within the internally separated flow can be leveraged to control the structure and strength of the ensuing secondary vortices, and thereby significantly reduce flow distortion and losses. In the present investigations, fluidic control is effected by a spanwise array of oscillating jets that are placed just upstream of the second-turn separation domain. Actuation directly affects the local flow separation, but it also alters the spacing and diminishes the strength of the base-flow streamwise vortices by forming and adjoining streamwise-vorticity concentrations of opposite sense. Additionally, the spanwise distribution of the actuator array was optimized to reduce circumferential distortion by 60\% at actuation to a diffuser mass-flow-rate ratio lower than 0.5\%.},

The aim is to exploit the high-fidelity experimental data to correct turbulence-modeling errors in the FANS simulations, as well as to use the accurate angle of attack and Mach number from the FANS simulations to correct the in-tunnel flow conditions. The optimization is carried out directly in free air, thus avoiding the requirement to mesh the wind-tunnel walls and/or to model the ventilated-wall boundary condition. A byproduct of this method is the availability of flow information everywhere around the test object, which augments and complements the experimental data. The methodology is tested on two-dimensional and three-dimensional flow cases, demonstrating a significant improvement in the agreement between experimental and numerical data.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an efficient adjoint-based shape optimization framework for airframe noise reduction in which algorithmic differentiation (AD) is applied to the open-source multiphysics solver SU2 to obtain design sensitivities. An AD-based consistent discrete adjoint solver is developed that directly inherits the convergence properties of the primal flow solver due to the differentiation of the entire nonlinear fixed-point iterator. In addition, a 2D and 3D far-field noise prediction framework coupling the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA) using a permeable surface Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FWH) approach in the time domain is also developed. The resultant AD-based discrete adjoint solver is applied to the reduction of noise radiation from 2D and 3D rod–airfoil configurations. The results suggest that the unsteady adjoint information provided by this AD-based discrete adjoint framework is accurate and robust, due to the AD of the entire design chain including the dynamic mesh movement routine and various turbulence models, as well as the hybrid CFD-CAA model. This framework is shown to be highly effective in reducing the tonal noise component due to the turbulent wake impingement on the airfoil leading edge. This study also compares the optimization results obtained on the basis of 3D unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation simulations and analyzes them using scale-resolving simulations of higher fidelity.},

Four jets at a Mach number of 0.9 and a Reynolds number of , one with a nonlaminar boundary-layer profile and three others with laminar profiles, are considered for exit peak turbulence intensities equal to 6\% in the nonlaminar case and to 9\% in the laminar ones. The jets with laminar boundary-layer profiles all radiate greater sound pressure levels than the jet with a nonlaminar profile but weaker initial disturbances. This particularly appears at high frequencies for the jets with a thinner boundary layer compared with the nonlaminar case. These results are shown to be related to the dependence on the shape of the boundary-layer profile of the most unstable frequencies downstream of the nozzle. For a laminar profile, these frequencies are similar to those obtained downstream in the mixing-layer profiles, whereas they are higher for a nonlaminar profile. Despite larger nozzle-exit flow disturbances, this leads to longer-term persistence of coherent large-scale structures in the shear layers, hence stronger velocity fluctuations and noise levels, for the present initially nominally laminar jets than for the other one.},

We systematically determine the free amplitude as a function of frequency and azimuthal wave number by comparing the fluctuation fields retrieved from PSEs with coherent structures educed from large-eddy simulation data using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition. The wave-packet amplitude is shown to decay exponentially with the Strouhal number for axisymmetric and helical modes at both Mach numbers considered in the study: 0.4 and 0.9. Analytical fit functions are proposed, and the scaled wave packets provide reasonable reconstructions of pressure and velocity spectra on the jet centerline and lip line over a range of streamwise positions.},

Recent advances in computational power have made implicit large-eddy simulation and direct numerical simulation feasible tools for investigating the underlying physical mechanisms involved. However, numerical methods for shock capturing introduce high levels of numerical dissipation to the whole flowfield, making them a poor choice for resolving the small scales of turbulence. In this work, the efficacy of a selection of low-dissipative and hybrid weighted and targeted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO/TENO) shock-capturing methods is assessed. An extension of the classic subsonic Taylor–Green vortex problem is presented up to Mach 1.25, where compressibility and dilatational dissipation become important. The presence of strong shock waves is demonstrated, and the shock waves merge and interact with one another to form complex shock systems. A supersonic test case is then specified, using a Reynolds number of 1600 to ensure a wide range of scales is present to test the numerical schemes. Low-dissipative TENO schemes are found to offer substantial improvements in resolution over established WENO methods for a comparable computational cost.},

Simplified Favre-averaged Navier–Stokes equations are reformulated and combined with the Rankine–Hugoniot relations to obtain an equation that relates the shock structure and its characteristic thickness to the upstream turbulent and mean flow quantities. The only mean flow and turbulence quantities needed to compute the shock thickness or velocity profile through the shock are upstream Mach number , turbulent Mach number , and the Taylor-based Reynolds number . The accuracy of method for the shock structure is validated against direct numerical simulations of shock–turbulence interaction and shows a very good agreement over a wide range of Mach, Reynolds, and turbulent Mach numbers. Finally, the obtained ratio of characteristic shock time scale to the upstream turbulence time scale is shown to be proportional to the turbulent kinetic energy amplification through the shock and supported through direct numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Large-eddy simulations of supersonic, turbulent flow in asymmetric and symmetric planar nozzles are carried out using high-order finite difference schemes and a large-eddy simulation approach based on explicit filtering. The inflow to the nozzles is from supersonic, fully developed turbulent channel flows at and 360 with centerline Mach number 1.2. The combined effects of expansion and acceleration of the flow in this geometry result in reductions of mean pressure, density, and temperature as well as a reduction of Reynolds stresses. The asymmetry of the nozzle leads to notable differences in the aforementioned effects near the straight and the curved walls. It is shown that the decay in Reynolds stresses is more near the curved wall than near the straight wall of asymmetric nozzle, and it is nearly the same near both walls of the symmetric nozzle. Effects of longitudinal streamline curvature are found to be localized near the curved wall of the asymmetric nozzle and are quantified. The aforementioned effects of acceleration, expansion, and streamline curvature are found to be similar in the flow cases with two different Reynolds numbers, although with increasing Reynolds number, subtle differences in these effects are found.},

The flow is weakly excited in a spanwise uniform manner at a frequency matching that of the most unstable disturbances in the natural separation bubble, leaving the base flow unmodified while enabling three-dimensional reconstructions of the dominant coherent structures using phase-locked planar particle image velocimetry measurements. Time-averaged flowfield reconstructions show a strongly two-dimensional topology of the separation bubble for both the natural and weakly excited cases. Analysis of the flow development demonstrates that, for both the natural and excited flows, spanwise-oriented and strongly two-dimensional shear-layer vortices form in the separation bubble upstream of the mean maximum height location. Spanwise undulations develop in the vortex filaments that continually intensify with downstream convection as a result of the streamwise forward sections of the filaments lifting away from the surface. This motion reorients the vorticity of the primary structures from the spanwise direction into the streamwise and wall-normal directions, forming hairpinlike structures above the vortex core region. These findings offer new quantitative insight into the vortex dynamics and breakdown process of the shear-layer vortices in two-dimensional, convectively unstable laminar separation bubbles subject to low freestream turbulence levels.},

The LM2015 model with helicity-based crossflow correlations is modified and coupled to the SA turbulence model, designated SA-LM2015. The LM2015 and SA-LM2015 transition models include source terms that contain stiff and nonsmooth functions. Approximations to these functions are introduced to eliminate discontinuities and improve the numerical behavior of the model, with the smooth model designated SA-sLM2015. Deep convergence is achieved using a fully coupled, implicit Newton–Krylov algorithm globalized using an efficient pseudotransient continuation strategy. Modifications to the Newton–Krylov algorithm are introduced, including a source-term time stepping strategy, to address the large sources introduced by the turbulence and transition model equations. Two- and three-dimensional transition test cases demonstrate that both models, SA-LM2015 and SA-sLM2015, are able to predict transition due to a variety of mechanisms accurately, with the smooth variant displaying significantly improved numerical behavior. Several of the strategies presented, including the smoothing techniques and source-term time stepping, could be useful in the context of other transition models as well.},

  abstract     = {The inclusion of transition-to-turbulence effects in computational fluid dynamics simulations is essential to accurately predict drag reduction from the use of laminar flow technologies. The parabolized stability equation (PSE) method takes into account nonlocal and nonparallel effects on boundary-layer dynamics. Its computational cost compares to that of linear stability theory (LST) analysis, which does not account for these effects. However, difficulties related to the robustness of PSE have prevented its application to industrial cases, where the more straightforward LST approach has been adopted because of its relative ease of use. When using PSE with an transition method, it is necessary to determine the stability modes that trigger transition and their neutral points (NPs). A robust PSE-based transition framework is proposed that includes a boundary-layer solver, a database method, and an LST solver that provides the required stability modes and the corresponding NPs so that a robust PSE calculation is automatically performed. The current approach leverages an automatic framework for the application of PSE-based transition prediction to aerodynamic flow analysis.},

The high-frequency surface pressure fluctuations are analyzed using power spectral density analysis, band-pass filtering, and cross-correlation calculation. Quantitative analysis of the NPLS images is carried out based on the grayscale information and time interval. The results demonstrate that the second-mode wave amplitude increases initially and then drops along the streamwise, whereas the characteristic frequency decreases monotonously. However, the second-mode wave amplitude in the 0.4 mm and 0.6 mm forward-facing step models is constantly rising, and the obvious second-mode wave first appears closer to the downstream than the smooth cone, which suggests that the forward-facing steps could suppress the second-mode disturbances and shifts the transition downstream. Nonetheless, there is only a clear promotion effect when the height of the forward-facing step is 1.6 mm . In addition, the backward-facing step could destabilize the boundary layer and shift the transition upstream, and this effect is enhanced by increasing the step height.},

  abstract     = {The stability of a two-dimensional hypersonic flat-plate boundary layer with a shallow cavity is investigated at Mach 6 using direct numerical simulations. The boundary layer is perturbed by a single-frequency wall blowing–suction actuator. The results indicate that the second mode is damped when the cavity is placed slightly downstream of the synchronization point (SP) of mode F and mode S, whereas the effect is reversed if it is located upstream or further downstream. The effect of the cavity depth is also studied. Strong damping of the second-mode disturbance is observed across the cavity. Energy budget analysis reveals that the presence of a shear layer bridging the leading and trailing edges of the cavity significantly reduces the work done by the Reynolds stress on the mean velocity gradient, which derives energy from the base flow and is the major contributor to the second-mode amplification near the flat-plate surface. It is suggested that a boundary layer dominated by second-mode instabilities can be efficiently stabilized by placement of a shallow cavity in the near-downstream region of the SP associated with the most amplified frequency. The damping effect depends on the cavity depth with a trend similar to that for hypersonic boundary layers over ultrasonically absorptive coatings, despite the fact that the flow structures can be very different.},

The modified FLDI uses cylindrical lenses to help shape the beam profile together with the curved windows. The design was informed by a ray-tracing simulation of the apparatus. The spatial sensitivity of the BAM6QT FLDI was tested using density-fluctuation measurements of a small-diameter air jet and compared to a traditional FLDI. To validate the BAM6QT FLDI’s performance with the tunnel, second-mode fluctuation measurements were made on a 7 deg half-angle cone at a 0 deg angle of attack. Both conventional-noise and quiet-flow measurements were made with good peak frequency agreement between the FLDI and associated surface-pressure measurements. The density-fluctuation amplitudes increase to a peak and then decrease with increasing distance from the model surface, agreeing with computational predictions. Cross correlation of the FLDI and surface pressure sensor signals resulted in an estimated disturbance velocity in the downstream direction, as well as the phase shift off the model surface.},

MUPSO is a combination of conventional continuous unified particle swarm optimization (UPSO) and a binary version of UPSO, which is proposed in this paper. The first few modes have been used to detect delamination damages through a two-stage method. In the first stage, rough locations of damages have been determined from a mode-shape curvature-based damage index using the gapped smoothing method. In the second stage, the mixed UPSO approach is used to get an accurate lengthwise location of the delamination along with the delamination interface. While the continuous part of the mixed UPSO has been used to obtain the lengthwise location of the damages, the binary part of the mixed UPSO has been used to determine the interface of the damage. The present method has quantified each damage scenario consisting of single and multiple interface delaminations with acceptable accuracy. The algorithm is also found to be performed satisfactorily under a noisy environment. The results obtained from experimental investigation are also presented. Overall, the present two-stage method has shown very good potential in the field of damage detection of composite structures.},

To date, this approach has demonstrated the ability to design inherent damping capability in LPBF parts that can suppress vibration by 88–95\% compared to fully fused counterparts, and the damping capability is a product of only 1–4\% unfused powder volume. Despite the documented proof that inherent damping with LPBF can be successful, there are a number of additional demonstrations required to improve the applicability of the approach for turbine engines. Of specific interest in this study is the damping performance sustainability at high strains. This study investigates LPBF nickel-based alloy 718 beams with six different internal geometries and assesses the effects of internal features on damping performance and sustainability. First, the initial/inherent damping performances are compared against undamped results; second, damping sustainability is conducted by subjecting the parts to high strain amplitude loading. Results from this study show a trend in the effects of unfused powder volume on inherent damping performance. In addition, subtle changes in damping performance at higher strains indicate that there are specific internal features more preferable for sustainability of inherent damping.},

An exact power series solution using the regression formulas (TRF) is chosen to solve the equations of motion, and then boundary and continuity conditions is utilized to obtain the algebraic equations; therefore the fundamental frequencies are found. The accuracy of the method depends on the number of terms of the solution and the error of the computer. The codes of Wolfram Mathematica and MATLAB software are built to give the optimization of the results of the problem. The obtained results are compared with the previous results for the models including cylindrical shells, conical shells, and conical–cylindrical shells. Furthermore, the obtained results have good agreement with the experimental and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) results. The effects of geometrical parameters and material characteristics are carefully taken into account in the present study. The obtained results can be used as benchmark solutions for serving in further research and have the valuable applications in submarine shell, UAV, shells in the aerospace and civil engineering.},

  abstract     = {Strain-rate-based damping is investigated in the strong form of the intrinsic equations of three-dimensional geometrically exact beams. Kelvin–Voigt damping, often limited in the literature to linear or two-dimensional beam models, is generalized to the three-dimensional case, including rigid-body motions. The result is an elegant infinite-dimensional description of geometrically exact beams that facilitates theoretical analysis and sets the baseline for any chosen numerical implementation. In particular, the dissipation rates and equilibrium points of the system are derived for the most general case and for one in which a first-order approximation of the resulting damping terms is taken. Finally, numerical examples are given that validate the resulting model against a nonlinear damped Euler–Bernoulli beam (where detail is given on how an equivalent description using our intrinsic formulation is obtained) and support the analytical results of energy decay rates and equilibrium solutions caused by damping. Throughout the paper, the relevance of damping higher-order terms, arising from the geometrically exact description, to the accurate prediction of its effect on the dynamics of highly flexible structures is highlighted.},

The evaluations of the existing method (Dual formulation), which is based on dual Craig–Bampton method, show its considerable off-line computational time saving because of no matrix manipulation, whereas the resulting reduced model is less accurate than Rubin’s in approximating the full finite element model. The accuracy of this formulation is significantly improved with a low additional computational cost in the proposed upgraded formulation. That is obtained by consistent projection of all structural matrices on a reduction basis made up of two sets of vectors: free-interface normal modes and residual flexibility attachment modes. Assembly approach can be considered as dual because the interface forces are kept as generalized coordinates in opposition to primal methods, where interface displacements are retained. To reduce the computational cost, the nonlinear governing equations are also solved in frequency domain using the multiharmonic balance method and alternating frequency time method. Contact elements are introduced between adjacent interface nodes to find the nonlinear contact forces. The performance of the new formulation is demonstrated through two numerical models with friction contact.},

  abstract     = {Optimization of complex structures using standard evolutionary algorithms, like genetic algorithm (GA), is known to be computationally expensive, because a very large number of finite element analysis (FEA) must be conducted for each possible structural design during the optimization. In the literature, different pretrained surrogate models have been used to replace the FEA for improving the computational performance of the structural optimization. However, the optimal solution found by the optimizer often depends on the accuracy of the pretrained surrogate model itself. Moreover, large datasets may be needed for getting the required accuracy of the surrogate model. An adaptive machine learning technique called active learning is used in this paper to accelerate the evolutionary optimization of complex structures. An active learner is a machine-learning-based model that can interactively query the outputs of certain data points, whenever the model would be uncertain about those outputs. In the presented approach, the active learner helps the GA by predicting if the possible design is going to be feasible or infeasible, meaning if it satisfies the required constraints or not. If the active learner is uncertain about the output, an actual FEA is conducted, and it improves its own accuracy for future evaluations. The approach does not need a trained surrogate model before the optimization. The active learner adaptively learns about the structure during the optimization to improve the computational performance. The approach is used to optimize the classic 10-bar truss problem, the Hesse function, curvilinearly stiffened panels under buckling and stress constraints, and some benchmark constrained test functions. The results show that the approach has the potential to reduce the total required constraint evaluations by more than 50\%.},

Three types of square membranes subjected to corner tension loads, namely, flat, wrinkled, and composite membranes, were tested. Full-field surface shape measurements via the grating projection method revealed that the point-to-point variation of the spectral values in each frequency has similar distribution when a vibration mode is composed of the repetition of a fundamental mode. Then, the validity of the proposed computational method was validated for the three types of membranes.

  abstract     = {The paper discusses the development of a nonlinear aeroelastic coupled trim model of a twin cyclocopter in forward flight. The twin cyclocopter consists of two cycloidal rotors as main thrusters and a conventional nose rotor for pitch-torque balance. It is shown that five control inputs [mean and differential revolutions per minute (RPM), mean and differential phase offset of cycloidal rotors, RPMs of nose rotor] are needed to balance three moments and two forces on a cyclocopter in forward flight while forces along the lateral direction remain balanced at all stages. Alternatively, the mean and differential pitch amplitude of cycloidal rotors can be used as control inputs while keeping the RPMs of cycloidal rotors constant. In this coupled trim procedure, blade aeroelastic response equations and vehicle trim equations are solved together by simultaneously updating control inputs and blade response. The present model is validated with previously published data by the authors on the performance of a trimmed cycloidal rotor at different forward speeds. Once systematically validated, the model is used to understand the trim behavior of a micro-air-vehicle-scale twin cyclocopter in forward flight. One major conclusion from this study is that the center of gravity of the vehicle is desired to be as close to the cycloidal rotor as possible in order to decrease the required power.},

Second, a rigid–flexible simulation of a leading-edge slat is carried out based on multibody dynamics and finite element analysis; Besides, the dynamic response properties of the leading-edge slat under multifactor coupling working conditions are obtained.

This Paper considers the inverse problem, supersonic stopping flow due to backward step motion of a flat plate, where the plate initially having an angle of attack reduces its angle of attack to a smaller one. The wave structures and their time evolution are clarified numerically, and a theory is built to predict the pressure along the airfoil, various wave speeds and indicial force. It is found that shock and rarefaction waves are produced to replace or complement the initial flow structure and the interaction between two adjacent new waves produces secondary waves with dimple-shape pressure profile. The indicial force first drops from the initial value to a smaller one and then evolves following a three-stage behavior. The force increases or decreases during the first stage where the secondary waves are upstream of the trailing edge, drops monotonically during the second stage where the secondary waves are leaving the trailing edge, and reaches its final steady state value after the secondary waves have left the trailing edge.},

The flow enthalpy of high-temperature gases, which comprised thermal, chemical, kinetic, and pressure components, was reconstructed based on the measured rotational temperature, heat flux, and impact pressure, in addition to the computational science approach. The rotational temperature of nitric oxide molecules was obtained using emission spectroscopic measurements of band spectra in the near-ultraviolet range. A numerical model was developed and validated based on measured data. The results indicated that the model efficiently reproduced the arc discharge behavior in the heating section and the thermochemical nonequilibrium in the expansion section. It was discovered that the dominant components of the arc-heated flow in the test section were the chemical and kinetic components. The flow enthalpy exhibited a nonuniform distribution in the radial direction. The authors conclude that the flow enthalpy of the core is approximately at the nozzle exit.},

To improve shape prediction, this Paper proposes an approach to simulate the roughness distribution and its effect on the transition. The roughness distribution is determined analytically for water beads on the surface, and the roughness amplification parameter is explicitly computed using the turbulence model. The results of simulations of a rough plate and airfoil with leading edge roughness yielded good agreement with experimental data for transition-related behavior. Then, the convective heat transfer coefficient on iced surface and ice shape was predicted and compared with the result of the fully turbulent model and experiments. The proposed method showed better prediction of the ice shape, especially on the suction side of the airfoil for glazed and mixed ice.},

The most energetic patterns of acoustic radiation are extracted using the far-field pressure 2-norm. Specialization of the norm to the far field is accomplished through localized spatial weighting. Radiation patterns to specific jet inlet angles are isolated by further restricting the spatial weighting to small rectangular regions in the far field. The most energetic radiation pattern for all cases and relevant frequencies is a single superdirective acoustic beam in the downstream direction. The source region of these beams is traced back to the end of the potential core for low frequencies and the shear-layer region for higher frequencies. In the sideline direction, to low angles, the acoustic patterns consist of beams that propagate upstream or perpendicular to the jet axis. The sideline radiation patterns are found to originate from the same source locations as the dominant superdirective beams. Inspection of the SPOD modes reveals that sideline radiation is directly linked to directive downstream radiation. Within the restricted radial extent of the computational domain, these results indicate that the sources of sideline and downstream radiation are intimately linked.},

The LES model used is based on an unstructured finite volume discretization of the filtered mass, momentum, species, and energy equations, as well as an explicit flow solver. Three subgrid flow models, three reaction mechanisms, and three LES combustion models are employed to examine the sensitivity to these modeling parameters. The LES predictions are compared with experimental data for velocity, temperature, wall pressure at different cross sections, as well as schlieren and OH chemiluminesence images, showing good agreement for both first- and second-order statistics, as well as the instantaneous flow structures. Furthermore, these LES results are used to illustrate and explain the intrinsic flow, mixing, and combustion features of this combustor.

  abstract     = {In this study, numerical simulations of spatially developing incompressible turbulent boundary layers (SDTBLs) with adverse pressure gradient (APG) over two-dimensional smooth curved ramps have been performed by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. First, it has been verified that the RANS results converge with respect to domain and grid size, and the effects of different inflow conditions have been assessed. Then, the RANS results have been validated by comparing them with the experiments of Song and Eaton (Experiments in Fluids, Vol. 36, No. 2, 2004, pp. 246–258) for the separated turbulent flow over an arc at a reference Reynolds number based on the momentum thickness of . Furthermore, the effects of the ramp’s slope and curvature on the skin-friction and pressure coefficients for polynomial and half-Gaussian ramps at have been investigated. From this investigation, a numerical criterion has been discovered for the inception of flow separation in SDTBL over smooth curved ramps. The criterion relies only on the geometrical parameters of normalized maximum slope magnitude, and height-to-length ratio of the ramp, and on the Reynolds number of the flow based on the ramp length, . Specifically, incipient separation occurs when the magnitude of the normalized maximum slope, reaches a critical value specified as , where , and are constants. Accordingly, the flow separates over a smooth curved ramp for which .},

  abstract     = {It is shown that in self-preserving incompressible free shear flows governed by the boundary-layer equations, a region must exist in which the Reynolds-stress anisotropies are constant. The theoretical result is confirmed by an analysis of well-established experimental data for the plane jet, the axisymmetric jet, and the plane mixing layer. The values of the corresponding Reynolds-stress anisotropies are determined, revealing differences between the corresponding eigensystems of these flows. While the shape of the corresponding tensor surfaces is similar, the corresponding principal axes have varying inclinations with respect to the flow-aligned coordinate system. Hence, the shear-stress anisotropy differs even in the case of almost identical eigenvalues or invariants of the anisotropy tensor. Numerical predictions can be improved by a calibration of the pressure-strain correlation of a Reynolds-stress model using the observed anisotropies in the constant layer. For an industrial application, this will require an automatic adjustment of model coefficients according to the local flow type, although a self-adaptive model that can switch automatically between the respective sets of tailored coefficients for each local flow type is still being sought.},

  abstract     = {Conceptual design of low-boom supersonic aircraft is heavily dictated by aircraft volume and lift distributions. These unique design characteristics make it a challenge to enforce mission requirements (such as static margins and trim requirements) during design optimization. This low-boom design challenge is resolved by using reversed equivalent area targets for low-fidelity low-boom inverse design and a block coordinate optimization (BCO) method for multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO). The corresponding low-boom MDO problem includes aircraft mission constraints on ranges, cruise speeds, trim for low-boom cruise, static margins for takeoff/cruise/landing, takeoff/landing field lengths, approach velocity, and tail rotation angles for trim at takeoff/landing, as well as fuselage volume constraints for passengers and main gear storage. The BCO method is developed to optimally resolve the conflicts between the low-boom inverse design objective and other design constraints. This method is successfully applied to design a low-boom supersonic configuration that carries 40 passengers, flies a low-boom mission with cruise Mach of 1.6 and range of 2500 nm, and cruises overwater at Mach 1.8 with range of 3600 nm. The generated configuration satisfies all specified mission constraints and has the potential to match a reversed equivalent area target with ground noise level below 70 PLdB.},

  abstract     = {A recently developed high-order implicit shock tracking method is novelly applied to a benchmark problem in two-dimensional compressible reactive flow, and results of remarkably high accuracy are achieved relative to competing shock capturing schemes. High-order implicit shock tracking is a discontinuous Galerkin discretization of conservation laws that simultaneously computes an approximate flow solution and aligns faces of the computational mesh with discontinuities in the flow to provide nonlinear stabilization and an improved approximation to the solution. The model problem is chosen such that its exact solution is available in analytic form to facilitate a detailed study of the truncation error of the tracking method relative to a nominally fifth-order weighted essentially nonoscillatory method. We show the implicit tracking method is able to robustly align the mesh with the shock and, particularly for polynomial bases of degree greater than 1, provide a high-quality approximation to the exact solution on meshes far coarser than required by standard methods. Finally, we demonstrate the tracking method obtains near optimal convergence rates in several error metrics for the problem under consideration.},

  abstract     = {An experimental investigation has been conducted on swept impinging oblique shock/boundary-layer interactions at a nominal Mach number of 2.28 with a fully turbulent incoming boundary layer . The swept impinging oblique shock is induced by shock generators with plane deflection angle and various plane sweep angles , 22.5, 30.0, and 40.0 deg. Oil flow visualization, mean pressure measurements, and high-bandwidth pressure transducers are used to provide detailed characterization of the mean and unsteady features of the shock/boundary-layer interactions. Large-scale separation is observed in all cases with spanwise growth especially evident at high shock generator sweep angles. Near the onset of separation in the central region of the tunnel (quasi-infinite span zone), mean pressures are independent of span and scale cylindrically. However, mean pressures at reattachment for higher sweep angles display mild spanwise dependence, suggesting the overall mean flow topology of the shock/boundary-layer interaction is conical. Unsteady pressure measurements beneath the separation shock foot show clear low-frequency unsteadiness, orders of magnitude below that of the incoming boundary layer. As the sweep is increased, the frequency of the separation shock motion is also increased. Specific analysis of the configuration shows spanwise accelerating ripples of relatively constant frequency that propagate along the shock foot, suggesting that the wavelength of these ripples increases with span. Considerable coherence for this rippling motion is observed in the range associated with the low-frequency unsteadiness of the shock foot. Minimal influence of the incoming turbulent boundary layer on the low-frequency unsteadiness is present, suggesting an unsteadiness mechanism within the shock/boundary-layer interaction.},

  abstract     = {To investigate the mechanism of wave trapping, acoustic embedded trapped modes associated with two-resonant-mode interference in two-dimensional duct–cavity structures are calculated by the feedback-loop closure principle, which allows us to analyze the traveling modes that construct the trapped modes. The exact two coexisting resonant modes that underpin an embedded trapped mode in a cavity open to two semi-infinite ducts are numerically demonstrated. At the interface between the cavity segment and a duct, total reflection can occur for a particular combination of two propagative guided waves in the cavity. With a particular cavity length and a particular frequency, total reflection also happens for the two reflected waves at the opposite end of the cavity. In this way, the two coexisting standing waves underpin a trapped mode. It is found that the two standing waves are not two closed-cavity modes. Thus, this work presents a new understanding of such embedded trapped modes as a product of total reflection of two guided waves at the interface between two waveguides, rather than interference between two eigenmodes of a closed cavity. Such total reflection of multiple guide modes is a result of mutual cancellation in transmission to the propagative channel(s) of the ducts. Thus, trapped modes involving more than two standing waves may occur at higher frequencies where more traveling modes in the ducts are propagative. For quasi-trapped modes, the Fano scattering phenomenon owing to the effects of two acoustic channels is also shown.},

Quasi-rectangular synchronization channels were used to connect both feedback channels of each oscillator; thus communication between fluidic oscillators was established.

The oscillation frequencies were varied from 263 to 672 Hz for a Reynolds number range from 5660 to 17,000, respectively. The resultant sweeping jets were also observed through water flow visualizations. Details of the internal flowfield leading to synchronized behavior were extracted employing numerical simulations that were validated with the frequency measurements. It was determined that the feedback flow in feedback channels occurs simultaneously in a periodic manner, and thus jet switching inside each oscillator is synchronized. It was also observed that a pair of strong recirculation zone forms for every period inside both synchronization channels, and this zone plays a major role in balancing the momentum in the feedback channels, thus creating simultaneous feedback flow. The overall switching mechanism of the fluidic oscillators seems to be intact, whereas the pair found to act as a single dynamic system.},

The proposed expression-template-based approach is incorporated in our in-house AD toolbox, which currently is the only Fortran-based tool in the literature that uses a fixed-point-type operator-overloading adjoint sensitivity analysis. The improved version of the fast automatic differentiation using operator-overloading technique toolbox is then coupled with the in-house unstructured parallel compressible (UNPAC) flow solver for a robust design optimization framework (DOF), called UNPAC-DOF.

Aerodynamic shape optimization problems typical of detailed, preliminary, and exploratory design are shown to consistently present design spaces with multiple local optima. In the case of detailed design, the risk of converging to a local optimum with performance significantly inferior to that of the best local optimum found is reduced due to the ability of a well-designed initial geometry, which is often available for such problems, to converge to a well-performing local optimum. In problems permitting increased geometric freedom typical of preliminary design, the risk associated with multimodality is much higher. This risk is further exacerbated in exploratory cases where high geometric freedom is combined with limited knowledge of the design space in question and hence greater differences between available initial geometries and the optimal geometry. Therefore, for preliminary and exploratory design, allocating resources toward addressing multimodality can significantly reduce the risk of overlooking a superior optimum.},

The amplitude of the main peak increases linearly with , with limited effect of the Reynolds number and a negligible effect of the three-dimensionality of the flow.

The gust is modeled by a “sine-squared” velocity profile with maximum magnitude equal to 80\% of the freestream velocity. During the gust encounter, the flat plate experiences large unsteady forces associated with formation of a leading-edge vortex and massive vorticity shedding upon exiting of the gust. This study aims to investigate the effect of gust width on a flat-plate gust response at two angles of incidence: 0 and 45 deg. Computations show that the maximum lift peak increases logarithmically with increasing gust width, asymptotically reaching a fixed value. For a flat plate at 0 deg, the lift history during the incremental lift phase (initial response) agrees with the analytical solution based on Küssner’s function up to gust width of four chords. For a wider gust, the maximum incremental lift is lower than the analytical estimated lift. For a flat plate at 45 deg, in wide gusts, the wake is nonlinear. Decremental lift below the steady-state value is observed upon gust exit, and it is followed by a secondary lift enhancement.},

However, the Lamb vector formulation involves moment transformations, and the associated force breakdown may depend on the reference point adopted for their computation. Yet, the force acting on an airplane cannot be dependent on this point. Thus, a systematic method based on the far-field flow symmetries is here proposed to eliminate this dependence. Those symmetries also allow for a better understanding of the progressive invariance of the drag decomposition with respect to the size of the integration domain.

  abstract     = {The vortex force map (VFM) method is a promising low-cost technique for predicting unsteady aerodynamic load from the vorticity field. Developed under potential flow assumption and applied to high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data, the original VFM method needs to be further explored for viscous flows, especially at low Reynolds numbers and with incomplete knowledge of the flow data. In this paper, the VFM method is extended to general viscous flows, with both forces contributed from vorticity in the flowfield and on the body surface considered. We find that viscosity contributes to not only the skin-friction force but also a pressure force term. We also show that the extended vortex pressure force maps for general flow problems without the potential flow assumption lead to vanishing contributions from the far-field. The extended VFM method is applied to CFD flowfields for the starting flow of a cylinder and a NACA0012 airfoil, and it is used to analyze the force contribution effect of a given vortex. Moreover, acceptable accuracy of the method on truncated domains and under coarse sampling of typical particle image velocimetry measurement size is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes the development and use of background-oriented schlieren imaging of a full-scale supersonic jet in flight. A series of flight tests was performed in April 2011, October 2014, February 2015, and December 2018 using the flora of the desert floor in the supersonic flight corridor near the Edwards Air Force Base as a background. Flight planning was designed based on the camera resolution, the mean size and color of the predominant plants, and coordination of several aircraft. Image processing was done with both cross correlation and optical flow algorithms. The planning proved to be effective, and the vast majority of the passes of the target aircraft were successfully recorded. Results were obtained that are the most detailed schlieren imagery of an aircraft in flight to date.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a framework on which to evaluate the quasi-static structural response of air-stiffened envelopes subjected to pressure loading, and it discusses the numerical response of the toroidal sphere air-stiffened envelope design. The air-stiffened design generalization is first introduced along with a discussion of the simulation components used to develop structural solutions using SIMULIATM Abaqus. Components include a hydrostatic formulation of the air–membrane interactions, contact, and geometric nonlinearity. The toroidal sphere design is then presented, along with a quasi-static solution developed under this framework. Discussions center around the role fluid–structure interactions have on structural collapse, and how fluid states serve as collapse indicators.},
