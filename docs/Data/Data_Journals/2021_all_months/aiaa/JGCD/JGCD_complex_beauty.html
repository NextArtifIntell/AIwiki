  abstract     = {Approach and landing accidents have resulted in a significant number of hull losses worldwide. Technologies (e.g., instrument landing system) and procedures (e.g., stabilized approach criteria) have been developed to reduce the risks. This paper proposes a data-driven method to learn and interpret flight’s approach and landing parameters to facilitate comprehensible and actionable insights into flight dynamics. Specifically, two variants of tunnel Gaussian process (TGP) models are developed to elucidate aircraft’s approach and landing dynamics using advanced surface movement guidance and control system (A-SMGCS) data, which then indicates the stability of flight. TGP hybridizes the strengths of sparse variational Gaussian process and polar Gaussian process to learn from a large amount of data in cylindrical coordinates. This paper examines TGP qualitatively and quantitatively by synthesizing three complex trajectory datasets and compared TGP against existing methods on trajectory learning. Empirically, TGP demonstrates superior modeling performance. When applied to operational A-SMGCS data, TGP provides the generative probabilistic description of landing dynamics and interpretable tunnel views of approach and landing parameters. These probabilistic tunnel models can facilitate the analysis of procedure adherence and augment existing aircrew and air traffic controller’ displays during the approach and landing procedures, enabling necessary corrective actions.},

  abstract     = {There are many challenges related to the design and operation of flexible aircraft. Flight control law design for improving handling qualities is one of them because the major problem in the design of controllers then concerns aeroservoelastic stability. To deal with this difficulty, methodologies for flight control law design considering the aeroelastic dynamics of the aircraft are being pursued. In this paper, a static output-feedback-based stability augmentation system is proposed and designed to improve the handling qualities and the structural dynamics decoupling of a flexible aircraft. The design is based on the projective control technique, which allows preserving in the closed-loop system the eigenstructure of certain modes of interest whose dynamic characteristics stem from an optimal state feedback solution. An experimental prototype of a flexible aircraft that mimics a high-altitude long-endurance airplane, called X-HALE, is considered in the case studies. Robustness analysis based on classical and disk-based stability margins, and nonlinear simulations of gusts and turbulent flight conditions evaluated and confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {In a fuel-efficient extended formation flight of commercial airplanes, the aerodynamic benefits depend on one’s ability to surf wake vortices. This paper presents a wake vortex detection scheme based on the exploitation of the aircraft flight dynamics measurements that effectively enables wake surfing. The study focuses on a two-aircraft formation where the follower senses, successfully locates, and tracks the wake produced by the leader over time. The proposed approach relies on an ensemble Kalman filter that propagates a surrogate model of the formation. The model output is here corrected within the estimator through a comparison with measurements of the full six-degree-of-freedom dynamics of the follower, as well as geometric characteristics of the leader. This essentially waives the need for dedicated hardware devices and only requires episodic communication between the leader and the follower. The efficiency of the novel detection strategy is demonstrated using reference data obtained from large-eddy simulations. It is found that the chosen combination of estimator and dynamics measurements is sufficient to detect the position of the impacting wake as long as the dynamics are accurately reproduced by the surrogate model. Additionally, it is shown that a lack of observability hinders the concurrent estimation of the wake position and strength in the presence of uncertainty. Finally, a simulation case evaluates the fuel savings that an active tracking strategy of the optimal relative positioning provides compared with a wake-independent positioning.},

First, the constraints of the space environment forces are illustrated for circular orbits, and the integration of space environment forces for achieving full controllability is considered. Two approaches are used to estimate the controllability of various configurations of space environment forces. The first approach relies on controllability theory for linear continuous and discrete systems, including a derivation of a new linear formulation for solar radiation pressure with lower constraints. The second approach exploits extensive numerical simulations for controllability analyses of nonlinear dynamics models. The linear quadratic regulator is designed for different dynamics models of the space environment forces and implemented numerically for nonlinear dynamics using an anti-windup scheme with bounded control inputs. The numerical simulations demonstrate that the Lorentz forces and the differential atmospheric drag are more effective control forces in the low Earth orbits than the solar radiation pressure.},

An innovative method of using only the yaw angle deviation, instead of the three-axis attitude rotation, is proposed to simultaneously control the in-plane and out-of-plane relative motions. This method can be used for the formation control of the Earth-pointing satellite. A control scheme consisting of four steps is designed considering complex input constraints. In this scheme, two control inputs are defined based on the predicted atmospheric density, and the explicit expressions of their time-varying feasible regions are analyzed. To obtain the yaw angle of each nanosatellite, a yaw angle solution algorithm based on the grid interpolation method is designed with online solving nonlinear optimization avoided. A dynamic surface control algorithm based on the hyperbolic tangent function and a linear model predictive control algorithm are, respectively, used to limit two control inputs within their feasible regions. In addition, a nonlinear finite-time disturbance observer is used to track the total system disturbance. Numerical simulations are carried out for along-track and circular formations, in which the uncertainties of aerodynamic forces, the attitude dynamics, and the unknown perturbation are taken into account.},

The use of the new filter is demonstrated with three dynamic systems (an aircraft coordinated turn model, a rotating rigid body, and a projectile with drag), and filter performance is compared with that of the conventional unscented Kalman filter and conjugate unscented transform filters. The new filter is found to be more robust in most cases where the initial distribution, process noise, and measurement noise have a high kurtosis, in that it does not generate extreme outliers in the estimation error. Also, execution times for the new filter are found to be only slightly longer than for the conventional unscented Kalman filter and significantly shorter than for the conjugate unscented transform filters.},

This work investigates an alternative approach, where sensor returns classified as faulty are not simply rejected, but are accounted for within the measurement model of the sensor, ultimately leading to a filter with intrinsic fault resistance in lieu of supplementary extensions like residual editing. Several different faulty measurement models are examined by comparing the proposed filter to a baseline filter outfitted with residual editing, where analysis is performed to test relative performance, robustness, and approximation ability of the proposed filter. The proposed approach not only outperforms residual editing, but is also found to be exceptionally robust to both unknown and approximated faulty measurement distributions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new family of solar-sail periodic orbits with adequate properties for polar observation of the Earth and moon is developed under the simplified but nonautonomous dynamics of the solar-sail augmented Earth–moon circular restricted three-body problem. The novel orbits, termed “distant-circular orbits,” are found through differential correction and continuation and employ a simple sun-facing steering law for the solar sail. A basic coverage analysis shows that one of the distant-circular orbits is capable of providing continuous coverage of both the Earth’s and lunar north (or south) poles with just a single sailcraft at a minimum elevation angle of 14 deg and an average range of six Earth–moon distances. Moreover, simple transfer trajectories between orbits of the family are found, so that the sailcraft can switch between observing the northern and southern latitudes of the Earth and moon during a single mission. Subsequently, using multiple-shooting differential correction, all results are migrated to a higher-fidelity dynamic framework that considers, among others, the eccentricity of the moon’s orbit. The perturbations cause the periodicity of the orbits to break, turning them into seemingly quasi-periodic orbits, but it is shown that the coverage capabilities are maintained. Finally, an active control strategy is developed to counteract part of the perturbing effects such that, by appropriately steering the sail, the apparent quasi-periodicity of the orbits is enhanced and the deviation from the unperturbed orbits is reduced.},

  abstract     = {Observations indicate that the spin states of retired and otherwise defunct satellites are diverse and can change significantly over time. Understanding defunct satellite spin state evolution is important for solar radiation pressure modeling, active debris removal, satellite servicing, and space situational awareness. Research has shown that many defunct satellites in geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) are primarily driven by solar radiation torques via the Yarkovsky–O’Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack (YORP) effect. Recent exploration of YORP-driven nonprincipal axis tumbling has uncovered rich dynamic behavior, including tumbling cycles, spin–orbit coupling, and tumbling period resonances. Radar and optical observations of the defunct Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) 8 strongly suggest that it has been captured in a tumbling resonance at least once since 2018. Motivated by these findings, we develop a numerical resonance-averaged dynamic model to understand YORP-driven resonance capture, building on our earlier nonresonant averaging framework. This resonance-averaged model illuminates resonance capture mechanisms. Also, by averaging over the satellite’s rotation, this model is roughly 20 times faster to propagate than the full (Euler) dynamics. Overall, this allows for rapid, broad exploration to determine resonance capture durations, spin states changes, and the influence of initial spin rate and resonance order on resonance strength. This resonance-averaged model can be easily applied to other environmental perturbations.},

  abstract     = {Low-thrust orbit control has been widely studied, mostly by using direct or indirect optimization to detect time-optimal and fuel-optimal orbit transfers. This paper proposes an alternative approach for designing efficient low-thrust orbit transfers. The main idea is to create an artificial resonance between the period of the control accelerations and a characteristic period of the orbital dynamics. To that end, Gauss’s variational equations are written using a Fourier series expansion in the mean anomaly. The secular changes of the orbital elements are determined based on averaging theory. It is shown that an artificially created low-thrust resonance can save fuel compared with piecewise-constant thrust. A general resonant-control candidate for changing all mean orbital elements efficiently is proposed. Four simple decoupling control laws are designed for changing the semimajor axis, eccentricity, inclination, and right ascension of the ascending node separately. In addition, periodic corrections transforming between mean elements and osculating elements are derived. The proposed decoupling control laws are applied to a formation-keeping problem, illustrating the potential merit of the new control law compared with a fixed-thrust-magnitude feedback control.},

A brief review of aircraft trajectory planning and conflict resolution methods is given first. Next, a new method is proposed that is based on a probabilistic conflict risk map using the predicted probability of conflict with the intention information of the intruders. The risk-map-based method allows the path planning algorithm to simultaneously account for many uncertainties affecting safety, such as positioning error, wind variability, and human errors. Following this, A* algorithm is used to find the cost-minimized trajectory for a single aircraft by considering all other aircraft as intruders. Search heuristic method is implemented to iterate the A* algorithm for all aircraft to optimize the trajectory planning. Convergence and computation efficiency of the proposed method are investigated in detail. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method under several important scenarios for air traffic control, such as wind effects, non-cooperative aircraft, minimum disturbance of pilots, and deconflict with flight intent information. Several conclusions are drawn based on the proposed method.},

As a stepping stone, the line-of-sight (LOS) tracking error dynamics is employed for the 3D guidance law design. A sliding variable is constructed such that its first-order derivative excludes the relative range in the perturbation, which avoids the unboundedness of system perturbation induced by target maneuvers near collision. A time-varying version of the sliding variable is designed to accelerate convergence of the LOS tracking errors and avoid large initial sliding variables. Then, two guidance laws are derived as a benchmark via the nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI)-based sliding mode control (NDI-SMC) and NDI-based time-varying sliding mode control (NDI-TVSMC), respectively. To further improve guidance robustness with reduced system perturbation, the sensor-based incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) control is used to design the INDI-SMC-based and INDI-TVSMC-based guidance laws. The sensor-based guidance laws exploit the LOS angular acceleration and guidance command output at the latest step, which result in smaller guidance gains to reject the perturbation than the NDI guidance laws. Numerical simulations in various cases and comparison studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.},

The PNG is augmented by a cooperative guidance term to ensure that times-to-go of the missile group reach consensus in a fixed time before interception. Two auxiliary functions are included into the biased guidance term to guarantee nonsingularity of the guidance law and meet the FOV constraints. The proposed design does not require guidance law switching that is used in some existing biased or multistage guidance designs, which allows for a smooth guidance command. A feasible impact time set is given for the cooperative mission when applying the proposed guidance law. The nonsingularity, FOV constraint satisfaction, and closed-loop stability of the proposed guidance law are theoretically analyzed and proved. Moreover, the criteria for selecting all guidance parameters are provided to facilitate the guidance design.

However, such controllers have difficulty responding to transients both planned and unexpected. This paper introduces a novel method of controller re-initialization to counteract a transient in progress. This method, the eigenmode initialization, pursues time-optimal performance for a given controller and plant by attempting to suppress the slow eigenmodes of the closed-loop system; the dynamics that remain are a function of the remaining eigenmodes. The derivation of this method from first principles is presented alongside analytical solutions for the ideal response and specific examples for which postinitialization transients decay 5, 7, and 30 times faster than their uninitialized counterparts. The method is extended to account for actuator bias and bound the actual response in the presence of estimation error. Finally, the method is validated through the high-fidelity simulation of a critical mode transition within the attitude control system of a legacy Airbus satellite, demonstrating the eigenmode initialization’s simple and effective implementation despite considerable nonlinearities in the sensor and actuator models employed.},

The proposed methodology generates end-to-end, eclipse-conscious, fuel-optimal transfers in an ephemeris model using an indirect formulation of optimal control theory. The end-to-end trajectories are achieved by patching Earth-escape spirals to a judiciously chosen set of states on precomputed manifolds. The results elucidate the efficacy of employing such a hybrid optimization algorithm for solving end-to-end analogous fuel-optimal problems using indirect methods and leveraging a composite smooth control construct. Multiple representative cargo resupply trajectories are generated for the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway. A novel process is introduced to incorporate eclipse-induced coast arcs and their impact within optimization. The results quantify accurate costs required for achieving efficient eclipse-conscious transfers for several launch opportunities in 2025 and are anticipated to find applications for analogous uncrewed missions.},

Reachable sets in semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination space are generated using time-free two-impulse transfers and set intersections are used as a basis for understanding optimal pursuit and evasion strategies. The evading spacecraft attempts to exit the reachable set of the pursuing spacecraft for a conservative guarantee that capture cannot occur. For cases where an evading spacecraft does not know the extent of the pursuing spacecraft’s reachable set, optimal evasion strategies are found. Nonlinear analysis is also performed to find any evasion orbits that are advantageous for the evading spacecraft to escape to. Finally, endgame strategies are briefly explored as well to understand the applicability of this analysis as the distance between the spacecraft decreases.},

  abstract     = {The use of monocular sequential images for relative navigation provides an efficient method for estimating the relative state of space non-cooperative targets, where the estimation accuracy is important to the relative navigation mission. A one-step optimal maneuver solution method is proposed that improves the state estimation accuracy. To determine the optimal maneuver and realize high-accuracy relative navigation, the relationship between the entire process of state estimation accuracy and the one-step maneuver is derived as an analytical model through the Fisher information matrix. An optimization problem is constructed and the one-step optimal maneuver is obtained in consideration of fuel constraints, the position constraints, the anticollision conditions and the observability conditions based on the state estimation accuracy analytical model combined with practical engineering requirements. The simulation results indicate that optimal maneuvering can effectively improve the state estimation accuracy, and they illustrate that the fuel constraint is a significant factor. Thus, the fuel constraint can be modified to produce better system state estimation accuracy with a certain range. When the fuel constraint reaches a certain level, the state estimation accuracy attains a stable value.},

  abstract     = {The orbital motion of spacecraft around asteroids is strongly disturbed primarily because of solar radiation pressure (SRP) and higher-order gravitational forces. To achieve stable orbits in such an environment, the implementation of frozen orbits is a promising approach. This research derives semi-analytical solutions of frozen orbits subject to SRP and zonal gravity up to the fourth order based on singly averaged Lagrange planetary equations. Moreover, the stability of frozen orbits is characterized analytically by introducing linearized variational equations, revealing the complex eigenstructures of the proposed frozen orbits. These analytical theories identify several different types of stable frozen orbits, which are further validated via high-fidelity numerical simulations. Consequently, this paper demonstrates the feasibility and intriguing dynamic characteristics of frozen orbits around asteroids.},

  abstract     = {Transition maneuvers are inherent challenges for tail-sitters because of the widely varying flight speed and pitch attitude. This paper investigates the dynamic model, the transition corridors, and the control strategy of a rotor-blown-wing (RBW) tail-sitter. Because the existing equilibrium transition corridor (ETC) cannot reflect system evolution trends of transition flights, a novel dynamic front transition corridor (DFTC) and a novel dynamic back transition corridor (DBTC) are developed. Compared with the ETC, the DFTC and DBTC are governed by dynamic nonequilibrium rules, thus covering transition trajectories more completely. Because excessive large altitude climb should be avoided in transition flights, the developed corridors are then enhanced by a climb velocity constraint. The effects of model mismatches on the enhanced DFTC and DBTC are analyzed. Based on the enhanced DFTC and DBTC, the transition strategy and controller are constructed by extracting typical features of the optimal transition trajectories. The transition robustness is increased by keeping the transition trajectory in the middle of the enhanced DFTC/DBTC. Numerical results indicate that the derived small altitude climb transition is more robust and natural than the constant altitude transition and the large altitude climb transition. Flight test results demonstrate the design principles of the RBW tail-sitter, the transition strategy, and the controller.},

  abstract     = {Near-optimal evasion strategies, from pursuers that employ modern linear guidance laws, are proposed. Most modern guidance laws rely on the evader’s acceleration to minimize miss distance. However, the evader’s acceleration cannot be directly measured and needs to be estimated. The key idea underlying the proposed approach is to exploit the inherent time delay associated with the pursuer’s estimate of the evader’s acceleration to maximize the miss distance. This problem is posed in a bounded target acceleration optimal-control framework with linear pursuer and evader dynamics of arbitrary order. The evader is assumed to have perfect information on the pursuer’s states, parameters, and guidance law. The pursuer is assumed to have perfect information on the evader’s parameters and states; however, the pursuer’s estimate of the evader’s acceleration is assumed to have a pure delay. The optimal evasion strategies are derived, analytically studied, and extensively evaluated in linear, deterministic and nonlinear, stochastic Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed evasion strategies against this class of pursuers substantially increase the miss distance when compared with strategies that do not exploit estimation delay.},

The main challenge is to determine the rendezvous sequences of the targets considering the perturbation, which is a large-scale dynamic combinatorial optimization problem. A framework to solve this problem is presented. First, a semi-analytical method of fast estimation for characteristic velocity is proposed to help construct the sequences. The -medoid method is applied to distribute all the targets to multiple spacecraft so that each spacecraft can remove as many targets as possible with limited propellant. Given a distribution of targets, the sequences for each spacecraft are searched separately; thus the original combinatorial optimization problem is split into multiple small-scale ones that can be efficiently solved by tree search algorithms. An evolutionary algorithm nested with a tree search algorithm is proposed to improve the distribution of the targets, so that the spacecraft can remove all the targets with a low cost. Then optimal sequences are further searched using an ant colony optimization algorithm, and the rendezvous epochs are refined by a nonlinear programming algorithm. The efficiency of these methods is demonstrated by two scenarios of active debris removal.},

The event-based controller relies on trigger rules deciding when a suitable control law is applied. The local control law consists on a single impulse; therefore the trigger rules design is based on the instantaneous reachability to the admissible set. The final outcome is a very efficient algorithm from both computational burden and footprint perspectives. Because the proposed methodology is based on a single impulse control, the controller invariance is local and assessed through impulsive systems theory.

One of these is to robustly predict the satellite’s tumbling motion in view of measurement errors and of unfavorable free-body dynamic effects. A comparative study of solutions proposed in the literature is presented, considering tumbling scenarios that might offer low observability of the related parameters. To this end, this paper extends and compares nonlinear and linear least-squares batch techniques with an extended Kalman filter recursive technique to identify the necessary state and inertial parameters of a satellite for the purpose of motion prediction. These estimation methods are fed with attitude measurements generated by a model-based image-processing algorithm, which is applied to images produced on ground with two dedicated experimental facilities. It is shown that the attitude measurements present a non-Gaussian error distribution. Through experimental validation, the nonlinear least-squares method is shown to be the most robust for five representative tumbling states of the target satellite. The output of a statistical identification procedure provides an estimate of the motion prediction dispersion for long prediction times, which is a key input in robust tracking control methods.},

Eighteen pilots performed the experiment in the Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) at NASA Ames Research Center and 20 pilots in the SIMONA Research Simulator at Delft University of Technology. The experiment used a full-factorial design with three motion filter orders (first-, second-, and third-order) and two filter break frequencies (0.5 and ), in addition to reference no-motion and full-motion conditions. Key task variables, such as the quality of the motion and visual cues and the characteristics of the sidestick, were matched across both simulators. Overall, the expected effects of filter order and break frequency variations were found, with both increasing order and increasing break frequency causing pilots to use less motion feedback in their control strategy, resulting in lower tracking performance. Furthermore, across the wide range of filter orders tested in the experiment, the existing Sinacori–Schroeder motion fidelity criterion was found to be a good predictor of the interaction effects of both filter settings on pilot control behavior. For the same motion condition, there was a consistent offset in the results between simulators, due to the more high-gain control strategy adopted by a number of the VMS pilots. Still, the observed relative trends in pilot control behavior and performance between motion conditions were equivalent in both simulators and thus accurately replicated.},

The combination of RCAC and RLS-VRF constitutes data-driven RCAC (DDRCAC), where the online system identification is used to construct the target model, which defines the retrospective performance variable. This paper investigates the ability of RLS-VRF to provide the modeling information needed for the target model, especially non-minimum-phase (NMP) zeros. DDRCAC is applied to single-input, single-output and multiple-input, multiple-output numerical examples with unknown NMP zeros, as well as several flight control problems, namely, unknown transition from minimum phase to NMP lateral dynamics, flexible modes, flutter, and nonlinear planar missile dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Extensive effort in controller design of aircraft systems is invested ensuring safe, stable behavior in spite of large parametric uncertainties. Particular attention is placed on anomalous flight conditions harbored by the atmosphere, especially icing. This paper presents a regulation trigger-based adaptive controller to cope with the impact of ice on the aircraft equations of motion and to control the aircraft pitch to the commanded angle. For a pitch model of an aircraft system with the impact of icing, the design of a stabilizing certainty-equivalence controller using backstepping is first given, and it is succeeded by the introduction of a regulation-triggered batch least-squares identifier. A theorem is incorporated that guarantees that 1) pitch angle and pitch rate converge to the setpoint asymptotically, and 2) parameter estimates end after a finite number of switches. Finally, simulation results of an aircraft experiencing icing demonstrate the effectiveness of the identifier, with the trajectory of the iced system using the proposed identifier closely following that of the nominal system.},

Based on optimal control theory and optimal error dynamics, the proposed guidance law is derived analytically without using any linearization assumptions. The approximate closed-form solution and exact numerical solution are presented to analyze the characteristics and physical meaning of the proposed guidance law. The key feature of the proposed guidance law lies in its simple implementation and exact nonlinear nature. Hence, the tolerable initial heading error of the proposed approach is larger than that of conventional linear optimal guidance laws. Numerical simulations are conducted to support the analytical findings.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the simultaneous gust and maneuver load alleviation problem of a seamless active morphing wing. The incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion with quadratic programming control allocation and virtual shape functions (denoted as INDI-QP-V) is proposed to fulfill this goal. The designed control allocator provides an optimal solution while satisfying actuator position constraints, rate constraints, and relative position constraints. Virtual shape functions ensure the smoothness of the morphing wing at every moment. In the presence of model uncertainties, external disturbances, and control allocation errors, the closed-loop stability is guaranteed in the Lyapunov sense. Wind tunnel tests demonstrate that INDI-QP-V can make the seamless wing morph actively to resist “1-cos” gusts and modify the spanwise lift distribution at the same time. The wing root shear force and bending moment have been alleviated by more than 44\% despite unexpected actuator fault and nonlinear backlash. Moreover, during the experiment, all the input constraints were satisfied, the wing shape was smooth all the time, and the control law was executed in real time. Furthermore, as compared with the linear quadratic Gaussian control, the hardware implementation of INDI-QP-V is easier; the robust performance of INDI-QP-V is also superior.},

The receiving aircraft is assumed to keep straight and steady flight, and the docking maneuver is performed exclusively by the tanker and its boom system. As opposed to the conventional approach, the docking maneuver consists in a coordinated and guided motion of the tanker and the boom arm that is simultaneous with the extension of the nozzle tip. To achieve this, a cooperative guidance algorithm is derived in a systematic manner. The first step is to reduce the docking problem to a planar kinematic guidance problem. Subsequently, the cooperative guidance law algorithm is derived and applied to generate commands for the inner-loop controllers of the tanker aircraft and the boom. The ability to achieve successful docking is demonstrated using numerical simulations, and advantages of this concept are highlighted using a comparison with a baseline controller that uses separated control of the tanker and the boom in a sequential manner.},

This paper presents a set of methods for orbit identification and estimation using only scalar measurements of the incident sunlight intensity, which should be available to most spacecraft without the need for additional dedicated hardware. By using these data to time the duration and transients of eclipse, a spacecraft may maintain a provided orbital estimate or develop a new orbital estimate from scratch. The presented methods use a novel sun-referenced orbit parameter conversion to identify candidate orbits, and an unscented Kalman filter based on the simplified general perturbations model and an atmosphere-corrected eclipse transient model to refine estimates and identify the correct candidate. These navigation methods are tested against public two-line element set data and are shown to provide continuous position estimates with an orbit-averaged error typically on the order of several kilometers in a variety of low-Earth-orbit geometries. So long as the spacecraft is in an eclipsing orbit about a known body, the algorithms described herein can provide orbital state estimates even to satellites without dedicated navigation hardware or external tracking.},

  abstract     = {Orbiting the primary of a binary asteroid system is extremely challenging due to the perturbative effects of the primary’s nonspherical gravity and the secondary’s close-proximity third-body gravity. In this work, the stability of perturbed Keplerian orbits around the primary is investigated from the point of view of the long-term eccentricity oscillation. Numerical investigations indicate that the eccentricity undergoes a large-amplitude oscillation, caused by the secular perturbation of the secondary’s gravity and may cause impact. A two-degree-of-freedom dynamic model is established, based on the doubly averaged, semi-analytical orbital dynamics incorporating effects of the primary’s oblateness and the secondary’s nonspherical third-body gravity. The oscillation of eccentricity, including its phase and amplitude, and its dependence on initial orbital geometry, is investigated through the phase space structure. The results can reveal the origin of the instability, predict stable and unstable regions in the space of orbital elements, and determine the initial orbital geometry that can ensure the secular stability. The binary asteroid system 2003 YT1 is used as an example to present our verifications and analyses, and the results can also be applied to other binary asteroid systems and even planetary systems with the central body’s oblateness and the third-body gravity dominating the perturbative environments.},

Safety ellipses are relative motion trajectories that do not require thrusting to ensure a high probability of short-term collision avoidance. Primer vector theory is used to derive analytic expressions that relate the necessary conditions for optimality to properties of the initial and final safety ellipses. The primer vector analysis is validated numerically using convex optimization and Monte Carlo methods. A general passive safety parameter for relative motion trajectories in near-circular orbits is also introduced. It is shown that for practical safety ellipse reconfiguration scenarios, the maneuver sequence generates optimal transfer trajectories that also remain passively safe.},

The proposed technique relies on a Taylor series expansion of the integral flow to model the dynamics around the reference solution and introduces an approximation of the high-order variational equations that reduces the complexity of evaluating the series. In particular, the high-order state-transition tensors (STTs) are approximated by capturing the dominant secular terms. Simple expressions to compute them are provided. The approximation stems from confining the Lyapunov instability of the motion to the time domain. The result is a time-explicit approximation of the STTs that can be used to predict the evolution of the uncertainty distribution accounting for nonlinear effects with minimal overhead. Finally, a high-order version of the extended Kalman filter is developed by implementing the approximation of the nonlinear terms of the Taylor series into an estimation scheme. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated with several practical examples.},

The control laws, which provide a blended normal acceleration and speed command response type in the longitudinal axis and a stability axes roll rate and sideslip command response type in the lateral/directional axes, were optimized to meet Level 1 requirements for a comprehensive set of stability, handling qualities, and performance specifications. The control laws were evaluated in flight by U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School and Textron Aviation test pilots using a series of handling qualities demonstration maneuvers, including pitch and roll capture and tracking tasks and an offset landing task. Quantitative performance metrics were collected, in addition to pilot handling qualities ratings and comments. Several modifications were made to the control laws based on initial pilot comments and ratings. The final results show that the optimized fly-by-wire control laws provided assigned Level 1 handling qualities for discrete tracking and offset landing tasks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a hybrid missile guidance algorithm is proposed for planar engagement scenarios. The method combines nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with a collision cone approach, and enables the guidance algorithm to achieve interception, while ensuring that the impact angle lies in a predefined range. The guidance scheme comprises two components: 1) point-mass-based NMPC and 2) collision-cone-based NMPC. The point-mass-based NMPC is employed when the distance between the missile and the target is large, and when this distance falls below a threshold, the algorithm switches to a collision-cone-based NMPC. Connections between the impact angle and the collision cone are theoretically established, and these are used in the collision-cone-based NMPC. The NMPC problems are formulated as quadratic programs that include appropriate constraints on the states and inputs, while not requiring target acceleration information. These quadratic programs are shown to be strictly convex. Detailed simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

First, to describe an arbitrary field of view accurately, the concept of the field-element vector is introduced to parameterize the field discretely. Also, based on the geometric projection, the field-element equations related to the satellite orbit, field parameters, and ground point, which can be solved analytically, are derived. Furthermore, using a two-dimensional map composed of the argument of latitude and ascending node, the problem of calculating visible intervals is transformed into the intersection problem of a group of parallel lines and single or double regions generated by the field of view and the target ground point, which can be solved rapidly. The proposed method is verified by simulations considering different types of sensor fields. The simulation results show that the proposed method is rapid, efficient, intuitive, and accurate, which makes it be suitable for different types of fields and have wide application prospects.},

The framework enables design of a robust linear parameter varying (LPV) controller for all individual vehicles as well as the interconnected group to account for uncertainties associated with the individual vehicles as well as the interconnections. In this paper, the robust controller design methodology for the individual systems and the cooperative system is implemented in a nested manner to enhance the performance. The application of the nested robust controller is distributed wherein well-known robust performance analysis is adopted and modified, and the controller synthesis methodology is developed on top of the same performance condition. Nested robust LPV controllers are synthesized for the short-period dynamics of F-16 VISTA over a flight envelope defined by Mach number and altitude of the aircraft. Then a group of homogeneous F-16 VISTA with individually designed LPV controllers is interconnected using a connection topology that suffers time delays, and a cooperative controller is designed using two methods described in this work. Numerical simulation results presented in the paper show that the group performance is enhanced with the robust LPV controller design methodology.},

The stochastic optimal control problem is recast as a time-discrete Markov decision process to comply with the standard formulation of reinforcement learning. An open-source implementation of the state-of-the-art algorithm Proximal Policy Optimization is adopted to carry out the training process of a deep neural network, used to map the spacecraft (observed) states to the optimal control policy. The resulting guidance and control network provides both a robust nominal trajectory and the associated closed-loop guidance law. Numerical results are presented for a typical Earth–Mars mission. To validate the proposed approach, the solution found in a (deterministic) unperturbed scenario is first compared with the optimal one provided by an indirect technique. The robustness and optimality of the obtained closed-loop guidance laws is then assessed by means of Monte Carlo campaigns performed in the considered uncertain scenarios.},

This paper shows that low-thrust bilinear tangent is able to perform a wide variety of maneuvers with a wide variety of thrust levels around asteroid Bennu. Additionally, this paper shows that even with a high control authority, the size of initial state perturbations that can be corrected depends on the size of the target state’s complex backward-reachable subspace and the location of the initial state of the maneuver in that subspace. For example, a 5 mN thruster on a 1000 kg spacecraft performed an aggressive shape and plane change maneuver for less than 3.5 g of fuel. The derived guidance algorithm then corrected 100\% of initial state perturbations drawn from and distributions. Ultimately, this paper shows that Newton–Raphson predictor–corrector bilinear tangent guidance is a capable guidance scheme when used on perturbations that lie within the reachable subspace of the target state.},

  abstract     = {In this paper attitude-independent three-axis magnetometer (TAM) sensor calibration algorithms are presented from a total least squares approach. One algorithm estimates biases only, whereas the other performs full calibration, which includes biases, scale factors, and nonorthogonality corrections. All calibration parameters are assumed to be constant. It is shown that the TAM calibration problem using a standard least squares point of view is statistically inconsistent because the effective measurement variance is a function of the calibration parameters. This inconsistency is overcome by using the total least squares formulation. The error covariance of the calibration parameters is also derived, which is shown to be equivalent to the standard least squares formation to within first-order terms. Also, the covariance of the measurement-to-estimate residual vector is derived, which cannot be accomplished using a standard least squares approach. This covariance is useful to quantify the effects of the measurement covariance for attitude determination in real-world situations. Both simulated and experimental results are shown to assess the performance of the TAM calibration algorithms, as well as the derived covariance expressions.},

In addition to the seeker field-of-view limit, constraints in the optimization problem include minimum dynamic pressure limit arising due to aerodynamic controllability. Using the time scale separation between the state variables, the full-order problem is reduced into lower-order subproblems, and a closed-form solution for guidance law is derived. It is shown that the performance of the interceptor is not very sensitive to perturbation of pulse firing time, and an offline generated lookup table is used to time the second thrust pulse firing. The proposed guidance law is computationally efficient, and its performance is benchmarked with that of pseudospectral-based feedback guidance with much lower computational cost. Simulation studies with point mass and six-degree-of-freedom model are presented highlighting the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed guidance law.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of guidance and control of an underwater vehicle. Guidance and control is achieved by introducing a control architecture with three modules: path generation, path following, and vehicle autopilot. This paper provides a formulation for the path-following algorithm, featuring an easily adjustable parameter that affects how aggressively the vehicle converges to a desired path. The framework for the path-following algorithm is built upon the Special Orthogonal Group SO(3) and introduces a path-following variable that allows the position of a target point moving along the desired path to be adjusted according to a specified control law. This paper derives guaranteed performance bounds of the path-following algorithm and considers limits on the vehicle’s angular rates, as well as limited performance of the vehicle autopilot. The resulting convergence properties are demonstrated with simulations using both a simple vehicle model and a vehicle modeled using computational fluid dynamics.},

The closed-form relationships are further analyzed in detail to determine the set of follower UAVs that characterize the envelope boundary and their dependency on the maneuver. The maneuver envelope for a general multiple UAV formation is expressed in the turn radius-speed space of the leader, and validation studies are considered for various formation sizes and geometries.

  abstract     = {Eigenmode distortion is a novel quantitative methodology developed to objectively evaluate motion cueing fidelity in flight simulation. It relies on an explicit coupling of linearized vehicle and Motion Cueing Algorithm dynamics. Modal analysis subsequently performed on this coupled system reveals the degree of distortion imposed by the Motion Cueing Algorithm on to the dynamics of the simulated vehicle. Eigenmode distortion thereby provides unprecedented insight into the combined dynamics of the two systems along modal coordinates. Compared with existing methods for motion cueing fidelity assessment, the eigenmode distortion method enables a systematic analysis of the coupled vehicle and Motion Cueing Algorithm dynamics. This is mainly because it does not consider the Motion Cueing Algorithm in isolation and does not inherently rely on assumptions regarding the excitation of the simulated vehicle dynamics. This paper outlines the theoretical foundation of the eigenmode distortion method and includes a case study on helicopter longitudinal dynamics and a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate its utility. The results presented in this paper shown that the eigenmode distortion method can reveal interactions between the Motion Cueing Algorithm and the vehicle dynamics that are currently not captured by other established methods, such as the Sinacori–Schroeder criteria and the Objective Motion Cueing Test.},

  abstract     = {Dynamical environments around small celestial bodies are complex and uncertain, leading to highly perturbed, uncertain orbital motions in their proximity. Under such complexity and uncertainty, mission designers need to plan robust guidance and control of the spacecraft orbit to meet some requirements derived from their mission objectives such as precise science observation campaigns. To develop a robust planner for spacecraft guidance under uncertainty, this paper presents a stochastic optimal control approach to design robust guidance policies that minimize the expected control effort while ensuring the requirement satisfaction with a user-defined confidence level, i.e., chance constraints. The solution method is formulated as a two-stage optimization framework that consists of a convex programming stage, followed by a nonlinear programming stage. The developed framework is applied to a small-body global-mapping scenario on a science orbit around asteroid Bennu, demonstrating the robustness of the optimized guidance policies; the stochastic orbital states are controlled to meet science requirements to 99.9\% confidence over 31 days with minimum control cost. Although the developed framework is demonstrated in a small-body global-mapping scenario, it is independent from specific equations of motion, and hence applicable to other proximity operation scenarios as well.},

In this paper, realistic multimode electric propulsion systems are incorporated within the formulation of gravity-assist, low-thrust trajectory design problems. Electric thrusters operate over a large set of discrete operation modes, and each mode is characterized by specific values for power, thrust, specific impulse, and mass flow rate. Unlike the traditional methods that approximate the aggregate behavior of electric thrusters’ performance (using polynomials fits), a novel construct is proposed to incorporate optimal discrete operating modes within indirect optimization. The capability of the tool and the efficacy of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by solving a multiyear, fuel-optimal trajectory problem from Earth to asteroid Psyche via a Mars gravity-assist maneuver and using a Hall-effect SPT-140 thruster with 21 operating modes. Comparisons with the traditional polynomial-based thruster modeling are presented.},

The proposed method does not require modification of the original integration algorithm used in conservative systems. First, the damped harmonic oscillator is used as benchmark for evaluating the proposed approach. Two more complex scenarios are presented next: one considering propagations in the two-body problem with drag forces, and another dealing with long-term translational propagations about small bodies considering orbit–attitude coupled force terms where the attitude is prescribed. Numerical experiments are performed, comparing results to a nominal analytical solution when it is available, or against a highly accurate propagated reference trajectory. The results in this paper show that including the nonconservative forces in the potential energy term for the discrete equations produces a very accurate discretization. This allows one to perform accurate and fast long-term numerical propagations with structure preserving variational algorithms, in scenarios where perturbations to the system can be modeled as nonconservative forces.},

Linear covariance dynamics and a continuous thrust model with control-dependent noise are implemented. Two formulations are considered: 1) a weighted-sum cost function with covariance and energy terms, and 2) a covariance cost function with an energy constraint (the epsilon-constraint method). In general, the former is simpler to implement, whereas the latter is more rigorous. However, a theorem is presented to prove that the necessary conditions for optimal control are equivalent in both formulations, and the first can be used to locate Pareto-optimal trajectories without sacrificing optimality. To provide an explicit example, this approach is applied to orbital maneuvers about an asteroid. Terminator orbit transfers, phasing maneuvers, and “proactive station-keeping” maneuvers are optimized, and the results indicate that significant uncertainty reduction is possible with small penalties in energy cost. Finally, Monte Carlo results verify that a linear covariance propagation was sufficient for these applications.},

Visual or topographic maps obtained from orbit are matched with camera or LiDAR data acquired onboard the lander using correlation-based techniques. For given orbital map and descent image resolutions, terrain information content, and measurement noise, there are fundamental limits on the accuracy to which the lander can be localized. Knowledge of these limits is useful in designing and judging the optimality of an estimator, or setting realistic accuracy requirements. This paper derives and validates mathematical expressions that predict these fundamental limits. The derivation, based on application of the Cramér–Rao lower bound, exposes a maximum-likelihood estimator that is confirmed to approach the derived accuracy limits. This work will be useful in the design of future map relative localization systems, as it can be used to inform requirements on desired localization accuracy, and to determine if a near-optimal estimator has been designed.},

The architecture of the mechanical system in the second simulator is configurable, as long as the system is made of a set of aircraft linked by an arbitrary number of elastic tethers. In both cases, the aircraft are modeled as rigid bodies and the controller is incorporated in the aerodynamic torque through the deflections of control surfaces. An analysis of the symmetric equilibrium state and the corresponding natural modes of a train (stacked configuration) of aircraft was carried out. It revealed that the higher the position of the aircraft in the train, the more they participate in the modes. Tether inertial and aerodynamic drag effects increase the equilibrium angles of attack of the aircraft and the tether tension at the attachment points. The potential applications and computational performance of the two codes are discussed.},

First, via a new angle, existing results concerning the stability of the standoff tracking of a stationary target with no wind by a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are reconsidered and extended; furthermore, a new compact condition for global asymptotic stability is provided. On the basis of the above, the phase separation problem is reexamined within the coordinated standoff tracking context, and globally finite-time stable distributed guidance laws are obtained that can treat simultaneously the convergence toward the desired standoff radius, the desired heading, and the proper angular difference between the tracking team of UAVs. In the sequel, the case of a moving target with wind is accounted for, and robust stability properties regarding the UAV convergence to the guidance vector field are shown. In the analysis, the concepts of total stability, input to state stability, as well as uniformly ultimately bounded stability are used. Finally, distributed guidance laws establishing robust global finite-time stability even in the case of both unknown target and wind velocity are proposed. The proposed guidance laws can track successfully even a maneuvering target as well as a slightly accelerating target but not forever, of course. Simulations demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the guidance laws.},

  abstract     = {Optical cameras are gaining popularity as the suitable sensor for relative navigation in space due to their attractive sizing, power, and cost properties when compared with conventional flight hardware or costly laser-based systems. However, a camera cannot infer depth information on its own, which is often solved by introducing complementary sensors or a second camera. In this paper, an innovative model-based approach is demonstrated to estimate the six-dimensional pose of a target relative to the chaser spacecraft using solely a monocular setup. The observed facet of the target is tackled as a classification problem, where the three-dimensional shape is learned offline using Gaussian mixture modeling. The estimate is refined by minimizing two different robust loss functions based on local feature correspondences. The resulting pseudomeasurements are processed and fused with an extended Kalman filter. The entire optimization framework is designed to operate directly on the manifold, uncoupling the process and measurement models from the global attitude state representation. It is validated on realistic synthetic and laboratory datasets of a rendezvous trajectory with the complex spacecraft Envisat, demonstrating estimation of the relative pose with high accuracy over full tumbling motion. Further evaluation is performed on the open-source SPEED dataset.},

  abstract     = {An electrostatically charged spacecraft is subject to the Lorentz force and torque when moving in the geomagnetic field. By active modulation of the surface charge, the induced Lorentz force and torque can be used for orbit and attitude control, respectively. Because of the electromagnetic mechanism, the orbit and attitude motion of such spacecraft are naturally coupled, and the induced Lorentz force and torque are both instantaneously underactuated. Thus, other kinds of actuation are required to render the system fully actuated and controllable. A hybrid control system is then proposed in this paper for Lorentz-augmented spacecraft relative orbit and attitude control. The relative orbit motion is controlled by the combination of the Lorentz force and the thruster-generated control force, and the relative attitude motion is governed by the combination of the Lorentz torque and the magnetic torque. By using the adaptive backstepping control method, a closed-loop control scheme is designed for the hybrid control system to deal with the dynamic coupling, underactuation, unknown external disturbances, and model approximation errors simultaneously. The parameter adaptation laws are derived via the Lyapunov theory to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system. Optimal distribution laws of the hybrid control inputs are then analytically solved. Finally, numerical examples are simulated in a -perturbed environment to verify the feasibility of the proposed hybrid control system and the validity of the closed-loop control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Sequential decision-making problems can be modeled as Markov decision processes and solved with value iteration to produce a table of values. However, the numeric table can be too large to deploy in systems using limited or legacy hardware with memory constraints. Neural networks have been suggested as a way to significantly compress the data while still preserving performance. Because simulations evaluate only a finite number of inputs, simulations are not sufficient to guarantee that a continuous neural network function will perform safely for all possible inputs. This paper presents a methodology for providing safety guarantees when using neural network representations of decision-making systems. This methodology uses the neural network verification tool ReluVal to determine the actions available in regions of the state space. With the action space restricted, a conservative overapproximation of the system dynamics is used to ensure that unsafe regions of the state space are unreachable. Experiments with example systems inspired by the ACAS X family of aircraft collision avoidance systems show that neural networks giving either horizontal or vertical maneuvers can be proven safe. In addition, constraints on aircraft dynamics are relaxed to compute the uncertainty tolerated before safety is compromised. The reachability method is flexible and can incorporate uncertainties such as pilot delay and sensor error. These results suggest that the method could be used in the future to certify neural network collision avoidance systems for use in real aircraft.},

A combination of lossless and successive convexification techniques is adopted to generate a sequence of convex problems that rapidly converges to the original problem solution. An automatic initialization strategy is proposed to make the solution process completely autonomous. In particular, a novel three-step continuation procedure is developed and proved to be more efficient than simpler strategies. This approach relies on the solution of intermediate problems, which either neglect atmospheric drag or fix the time-lengths of the launch vehicle ascent phases, that are solved in succession, gradually passing from easier instances of the optimization problem to the originally intended problem. State-of-the-art techniques to deal with such a complex problem are adopted to enhance the convergence rate, including safeguarding modifications, such as virtual controls and an adaptive trust region. To assess the validity of the proposed approach in a practical scenario, numerical results are presented for two representative practical applications, using as reference a Falcon 9 launch vehicle.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a general autonomous navigation method for any spacecraft for which relativistic effects are significant. It builds on a relativistic observation model and represents the foundational step in the development of interstellar navigation. By comparing astrometric and spectrometric measurements obtained in two different reference frames, the method estimates instantaneous spacecraft position and velocity, and distances to observed stars. The paper first derives relativistic autonomous observation equations, which are more general than those provided in the existing literature. It then presents an autonomous navigation algorithm that compares favorably to a nonrelativistic approach. A case study investigates the method in the context of technological details of a mission, including certain sources of noise and disturbance in the interstellar medium. Specifically, a state-of-the-art spacecraft traveling to Proxima Centauri at can estimate its position and velocity with less than 0.001\% error, and distances to stars it observes with less than 1\% error. Measurement noise is the dominant source of this error; thus, the algorithm is highly sensitive to sensor performance. A simple running average reduces these errors by more than an order of magnitude, which suggests that this algorithm is suitable as a first step in a realistic, recursive navigation algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the development and verification of an estimation architecture for autonomous relative navigation in multi-satellite systems using angles-only measurements. Unlike traditional angles-only navigation approaches, which are generally hindered by poor handling of observability constraints, this prototype solution is designed to be flexible and applicable to a multitude of relevant missions. The estimator converges accurately and robustly in varying orbital environments without requiring maneuvers by exploiting system nonlinearities using an unscented Kalman filter that is streamlined by formulating the measurement and dynamics models using relative orbital elements. While the majority of prior work has focused on only solving for the relative motion of a single target, the approach here enables estimation of several additional parameters. Key design trades are evaluated for estimating additive sensor biases, target ballistic properties in environments with strong nonconservative perturbations, adaptive process noise statistics, and the absolute orbit of the observing satellite. The architecture is generalized for relative navigation with multiple targets, and for decentralized estimation using multiple coordinated observers. These filter strategies are used to inform the development of a novel on-orbit demonstration of angles-only navigation known as the Starling Formation-flying Optical eXperiment (StarFOX) in partnership with NASA. Key hardware-in-the-loop algorithm verification results for StarFOX-specific scenarios are provided.},

Starting from an initial guess at the solution, the algorithm uses a harmonic balance technique to refine the solution through a gradient-based optimization approach. The algorithm introduces three major innovations when compared to previous techniques: it does not rely on state transition matrices, it simultaneously solves for the approximate higher-order linear time-invariant dynamics about the periodic solution, and it can be used to compute the harmonic control inputs that attenuate arbitrary state harmonics. Following a description of the algorithm, it is applied to three different aerospace vehicles with nonlinear time-periodic dynamics: a flapping-wing micro aerial vehicle, a helicopter, and a flapping-tail airplane. In all cases, the algorithm derives periodic solutions for the states and controls even when starting from very poor initial guesses. The algorithm has clear application in the development of advanced flight control laws that attenuate certain state harmonics and in the prediction of loads and vibrations.},

Soon after arrival, the spacecraft will inject into retrograde relative trajectories known as quasi-satellite orbits and study the geophysical environment of the Martian moon for more than three years. This paper presents the orbit design and maintenance strategy of the Martian Moons eXploration mission in the framework of the elliptic Hill problem with ellipsoidal secondary. This paper first introduces a numerical continuation procedure on the eccentricity of Phobos to replace purely periodic solutions with families of quasi-periodic invariant tori. Two-dimensional torus maps can be then constructed and used to represent physical quantities of interest, as well as to generate reference trajectories at arbitrary epochs. Sensitivity and stability analyses are carried out to investigate the dynamic properties of retrograde relative trajectories in the elliptic case. Finally, a linear quadratic regulator is implemented in order to assess the robustness of the computed trajectories under injection, navigation, and execution errors. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the baseline quasi-satellite orbits of the Martian Moons eXploration mission can be maintained with as low as per month.},

  abstract     = {The problem of optimum low-thrust collision avoidance between two objects in circular orbits is investigated. The thrust vector of the maneuvered satellite, applied continuously for a given time span, is held constant in magnitude as a consequence of Pontryagin’s maximum principle while its orientation is controlled following the solution of an optimal control problem using the indirect method written in B-plane coordinates. In addition, a simple, fully analytical solution for a tangential maneuver is derived and compared with the controlled solution. Results show that the analytical solution is sufficiently accurate and adequate for a preliminary design of the maneuver. The influence of environmental perturbations is also addressed and shown to be negligible.},

Then, a reaction control strategy is proposed, which aims at avoiding the buildup of the contact force and possible instabilities. It is proved that the controlled system is input-to-state stable. The performance of the observer and the controller is assessed through a numerical example featuring a 7-degree-of-freedom arm mounted on a spacecraft and a realistic measurement model.

The DGVSCMGs are mounted on the flexible structure as actuators for attitude and vibration control. A flexible structure with a cluster of angular momentum devices is considered to be a gyroelastic body. The detailed dynamics of a single gyroelastic body under the influence of the actuators is derived using Kane’s method. A simple controller capable of vibration suppression is proposed for the attitude maneuver. A novel steering law is designed for the DGVSCMGs. Null motion of the gimbal angles and rotor rates is considered to compensate for the undesirable modal force in the vibration equation. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller and steering law.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops an accurate contact law for characterizing the hopping motion of exploration rovers on small bodies in the solar system. The availability of such a law is important to provide guidance for rover deployment and mission planning. The contact between a rover and the surface of a small body is set up as a viscoelastic contact problem, for which there have previously been no complete solutions. The proposed new contact law is derived by modifying the equation representing the geometric relation between indentation and surface displacements so that it remains valid after Laplace transformation. The validity of this approach is demonstrated by analyzing the behavior of the Stieltjes convolution involved in the solution, which is found to be consistent with that expected for a viscoelastic material. A numerical verification shows that the new contact law exhibits a good match to results obtained using the finite element method. The new contact law is applied to hopping simulations of an example rover on the asteroid (162173) Ryugu, which reveal that the rover is capable of large traverses, but has a low likelihood of inter-hemispheric traverses from the polar regions.},

  abstract     = {Robotic manipulators used in space applications are often lightweight, exhibit significant joint flexibility, and have limited joint torques. Many applications of space manipulation involve the transport of massive objects, e.g., a captured satellite, well beyond the 1 g capability of these robots. This may cause challenges during manipulation, such as imprecise trajectory following during transport, oscillatory behavior, and difficulty berthing the object. Motivated by the space application, a fixed-base scenario is considered, and a methodology is proposed for massive object manipulation via flexible-joint manipulators in this Paper. The manipulation task includes the following phases: tracking and capture, path and trajectory planning, trajectory execution, and berthing. Visual servoing and compliance control are used to track and capture the object. Motion planning accounts for kinematic and dynamic constraints on joint stops, path smoothness, actuator limits, end effector slippage, and braking distance. Berthing is achieved through the use of compliance control. The efficacy of this methodology is experimentally investigated with a flexible-joint Rethink Baxter robot arm, and each manipulation phase is completed with a heavy load beyond the 1 g limit of the arm on an air bearing table.},

  abstract     = {Propagating uncertainties usually requires repeated evaluation of the subject model for a large number of different input parameters. Surrogate models have been widely used to avoid this computationally intensive uncertainty propagation by replacing the original model by an easy-to-evaluate function model. In this Paper, the polynomial chaos based Kriging is used as such a surrogate model for orbital uncertainty propagation. The polynomial chaos represents the global trend of the uncertainty distribution, while the Kriging describes the local variations. Such a combination can provide a more precise surrogate model than individual polynomial chaos or ordinary Kriging representation. To further enhance the accuracy, a new active sampling strategy is proposed to incrementally build and improve the polynomial chaos based Kriging model. This new modeling scheme only requires a small number of sampling points while achieving close performance to the Monte Carlo based propagation. It is also more accurate than the random sampling based Kriging model. Three orbital uncertainty propagation examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed surrogate model.},

  abstract     = {Over the past 20 years, unmanned aircraft have taken over military missions that were deemed to be too “dull, dirty, or dangerous” for manned aircraft. The urgent demand for aircraft that can execute these missions has resulted in a “build-fly-fix-fly” development mentality. Currently, documents that specify flying and handling quality requirements for manned aircraft, such as MIL-STD-1797, list those requirements as “TBD” for unmanned aircraft. In an effort to develop metrics that can be used to quantify the handling qualities of unmanned aircraft and expand the database that can be used to develop handling quality requirements, an analysis was performed using a Simulink model of the Calspan LJ-25D Variable Stability System aircraft at the United States Test Pilot School. Two maneuvers were simulated: 1) a climbing spiral, and 2) a precision offset landing. These maneuvers were chosen to evaluate the maneuver performance and workload, as measured by control surface activity, while varying stability and control parameters. The data were used to identify trends between the stability and control parameters and the resulting workload and maneuver performance metrics. Thumbprint plots were generated to identify Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 flying qualities and were compared to similar MIL-STD-1797 plots. Results point to using a combination of classical aircraft literal factors, such as the short-period damping and control anticipation parameter, with newly developed metrics, employing norm and Thiel’s inequality coefficient , to assess the maneuver performance and workload of the aircraft and flight controller during a maneuver.},

Guidance of a powered missile is decoupled into independent flight direction control with normal acceleration as an input to realize impact angle control/constrained guidance (IACG) and cooperative flight speed control with engine thrust as an input to realize salvo attack. Firstly, an IACG law is derived from a geometrically modified proportional navigation guidance. The trajectory shape and length under this proposed IACG law are proved to be independent of missile speed variation. Then a cooperative missile thrust control (CMTC) law is designed from a constrained consensus algorithm to cooperate remaining trajectory lengths without exceeding missile speed limit. Simplified aerodynamic and engine models of a missile are used in CMTC law design. The lower and upper bounds of speed are considered according to missile maneuverability and limited maximum engine thrust. Multimissile salvo attack with impact angle and time constraints is achieved through the combination of IACG and CMTC. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative guidance law.},

There is a possibility of extremely high speeds in wind scenarios where a thin shear layer separates a region of high wind speed from a region of zero wind, as it is the case in the leeward side of ridges. Flight mechanics and shear wind modelings are developed so that the motion of a glider can be mathematically described. The maximum speed achievable with dynamic soaring is determined, and the key factors for the speed performance are identified. Furthermore, it is shown that, depending on the wind speed, the maximum speed can reach the high-subsonic Mach number region where compressibility exerts an effect on the aerodynamic characteristics of gliders. It is found as a consequence of this effect that the drag rise due to compressibility is a limiting factor for the achievable maximum speed. Furthermore, quantities relevant for flight control and loads in high-speed dynamic soaring are identified and their effects are shown. An optimization method is used for constructing results on the high-speed performance enabled by dynamic soaring.},

Uncertainties in the initial conditions at reentry and in the ballistic coefficient for three representative test cases are considered: a three-state and a six-state steep Earth reentry and a six-state unguided lifting entry at Mars.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a convex programming algorithm based on modified Rodrigues parameters for a six-degree-of-freedom asteroid powered landing trajectory design problem. The trajectory design problem is formulated as a nonconvex fuel-optimal control problem with nonlinear coupled translational and rotational dynamics, nonconvex state and control constraints. In order to tackle the fuel-optimal control problem in the convexification framework, the original nonconvex continuous-time optimization problem is converted into a convex discrete-time optimization subproblem by linearizing and discretizing the dynamics and constraints. The effect of the coupling of translational and rotational dynamics on the convexification of nonconvex control constraints is discussed. The successive convexification method of solving a sequence of constrained convex subproblem is used to generate the optimal trajectory. The validity of the proposed algorithm for generating fuel-optimal trajectories and the effect of asteroid gravity on generated trajectories are examined through simulations of landing on different irregular asteroids. The Monte Carlo simulation is performed to examine the calculation performance of the proposed algorithm comparing to the Radau pseudospectral method algorithm and the proposed algorithm with the rotational motion parameterized by quaternions.},

Equations of motion for each phase are given in dimensionless form, which significantly reduces the number of parameters describing the system. The aim of the paper is to propose algorithms for choosing optimal parameters for the capture and tether deployment phases. This optimization provides small amplitudes of the tether and debris oscillations during towing. The numerical simulations of the removal of a spent Ariane 4 upper stage H10 confirm the correctness of the proposed mathematical models and optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Spin state predictions for defunct satellites in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) are valuable for active debris removal and servicing missions as well as material shedding studies and attitude-dependent solar radiation pressure (SRP) modeling. Previous studies have shown that solar radiation torques can explain the observed spin state evolution of some GEO objects via the Yarkovsky–O’Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack (YORP) effect. These studies have focused primarily on uniform rotation. Nevertheless, many objects are in nonprincipal axis rotation (i.e., tumbling). Recent exploration of the tumbling regime for the family of retired Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) 8–12 satellites has shown intriguing YORP-driven behavior including spin-orbit coupling, tumbling cycles, and tumbling period resonances. To better explore and understand the tumbling regime, a semi-analytical tumbling-averaged rotational dynamics model has been developed. The derivation requires analytically averaging over the satellite’s torque-free rotation, defined by Jacobi elliptic functions. Averaging is facilitated by a second-order Fourier series approximation of the facet illumination function. The averaged model is found to capture and explain the general long-term behavior of the full dynamics while reducing computation time by roughly three orders of magnitude. This improved computation efficiency promises to enable rapid exploration of general long-term rotational dynamics for defunct satellites and rocket bodies.},

Singularities in the algorithm can occur if the two orbits intersect. Alternative maneuvers for such singular cases are developed. The linear cotangential transfer algorithm is compared with the nonlinear cotangential transfer and the algorithm is found to be very similar. The development of the linear cotangential transfer leads to a new set of relative orbital elements that are well suited for defining safe trajectories. The characteristics of safe trajectories are discussed and a linear safety checking algorithm is developed. Finally, the combination of the cotangential transfers and safe orbits is used to define safe rendezvous trajectories for elliptical orbit rendezvous.},

  abstract     = {Verified interval orbit propagation provides mathematically guaranteed solutions of satellite position and velocity over time. These verified solutions are useful for conjunction analysis and other space-situational-awareness activities. Unfortunately, verified methods suffer from overestimation and explosive interval growth, limiting the possible propagation time and thus their applicability. Different orbital-element state models have been shown to increase the maximum propagation time to a degree, but at the expense of significant overestimation introduced by the state transformations. This paper proposes the Dromo state model for verified integration. Dromo is a regularized variation-of-parameter formulation of the perturbed two-body equations of motion. Taylor models are implemented for both integration and transformation. Moreover, a technique is developed for dealing with time uncertainty resulting from verified regularized propagation. Dromo significantly prolongs the maximum forecasting window, producing verified trajectories of days up to weeks in duration for the low Earth orbit regime. A sensitivity analysis of the integrator settings identifies combinations that produce stable and computationally efficient solutions. A sensitivity study of the orbital parameters shows that the method is applicable to a large orbital regime, especially for low Earth orbit regions that contain high densities of space debris.},

Navigation and guidance are typically performed using ground-based operations, which can be costly. This paper studies the possibility of removing the ground in the process through onboard navigation with optical measurements and accelerometer-based measurements. The paper first describes the dynamics and measurement models used to simulate a spacecraft’s interaction with the asteroid environment, followed by implementation details of navigation and guidance subsystems. The paper then presents a covariance analysis of this problem using simplified dynamics, focusing on the information content of the optical and measurements. Guided by this, an end-to-end autonomous exploration scheme with onboard navigation and event-driven orbit control is analyzed through simulation, introducing realistic errors between the truth and filter dynamics. The basic operations of this scheme are built around near-inertial hovering and include approach from the end of an interplanetary phase, reconnaissance at various viewing geometries, close gravity estimation, and orbit insertion. The feasibility of the proposed autonomous navigation and orbit control is evaluated using a Monte Carlo analysis and is shown to be robust.},

  abstract     = {With the upcoming launch of large constellations of satellites in the low-Earth orbit (LEO) region, it will become important to organize the physical space occupied by the different operating satellites in order to minimize critical conjunctions and avoid collisions. This paper introduces the definition of space occupancy as the domain occupied by an individual satellite as it moves along its nominal orbit under the effects of environmental perturbations throughout a given interval of time. After showing that space occupancy for the zonal problem is intimately linked to the concept of frozen orbits and proper eccentricity, frozen orbit initial conditions are provided in osculating element space and a frozen-orbit polar equation is obtained to describe the space occupancy region in closed analytical form. Next, the problem of minimizing space occupancy is analyzed in a realistic model including tesseral harmonics, third-body perturbations, solar radiation pressure, and drag. The corresponding initial conditions, leading to minimum space occupancy (MiSO) orbits, are obtained numerically for a set of representative configurations in LEO. The implications for the use of MiSO orbits to optimize the design of mega-constellations are discussed.},

Limited work has been done on tactical sensor tasking aimed at resolving specific hypotheses of interest, which is the focus of this paper. The discernment of spacecraft maneuvers and maintenance of custody is imperative for improved long-term space domain awareness. As such, a novel telescope tasking algorithm is developed using decision making, evidential reasoning, and reachability techniques. Position reachable set overapproximations are continuously computed assuming that spacecraft are maneuvering using optimal control, which are used to determine whether search or tracking actions are optimal, resulting in improved custody maintenance against worst-case spacecraft maneuvers. Moreover, a new Mahalanobis distance-based binary hypothesis detection method is derived to characterize spacecraft anomaly from a nominal trajectory. A Monte Carlo study is designed to a specified statistical confidence level to examine the accuracy of the algorithm. Lastly, the algorithm is implemented on a robotic telescope in real-time. Thus, using reachable set overapproximations and searches, new evidence to hypothesis belief mappings, a Monte Carlo study, and a real-time demonstration, a novel telescope tasking strategy is presented.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates robust nonlinear control for close formation flight of multiple fixed-wing aircraft. It aims to achieve precise position control in general flight operation under the aerodynamic impact induced by the trailing vortices of leader aircraft. One crucial concern is the boundedness of position errors subject to uncertainties and disturbances to be regulated with accuracy. This paper develops a robust nonlinear control algorithm to fulfill precise close formation-tracking control. The proposed control algorithm consists of baseline control laws and disturbance observers. The baseline control laws are employed to stabilize the nonlinear dynamics of close formation flight, whereas the disturbance observers are introduced to compensate system uncertainties and formation-related aerodynamic disturbances. The position control performance can be guaranteed within the desired boundedness to harvest enough drag reduction for a follower aircraft in close formation using the proposed design. The effectiveness of the proposed design is demonstrated via the numerical simulation of the close formation flight of two fixed-wing aircraft.},

Using some concrete examples it is shown that the proposed framework is flexible enough to tackle interesting guidance problems related to multiple targets scenarios. It is also shown that the same framework offers a practical solution for the optimal intercept guidance problem with constraints on the lateral missile acceleration.},

In the event of a reaction wheel failure, it is shown that the key challenge of maintaining accurate autonomous three-axis tracking is a problem of singularity avoidance in control allocation. In particular, control law singularities occur depending on the type of orbit, the environment, and the attitude, where the system is no longer controllable. Two algorithmic singularity avoidance techniques based on singularity prediction and artifici‘al potential functions are proposed. In addition, an optimized reaction wheel configuration is proposed to enhance singularity avoidance capability. To illustrate the effectiveness of the singularity avoidance control laws, they are tested in simulations that include the effects of perturbing environmental torques, reaction wheel jitter, and actuator misalignment.},

  abstract     = {If during a guided powered descent maneuver the descent vehicle deviates from the planned trajectory, then the vehicle may need to adjust the commanded thrust in order to still reach the target landing site or to avoid violating mission constraints. However, often the nominal thrust command at any time along a minimum-fuel powered descent trajectory is either at the maximum or the minimum throttle, and as a result the corrective thrust command may be outside the allowable throttle range. A margin must therefore be added between the planned throttle command and the engine throttle limits, but this margin may be overly conservative to the detriment of performance. In this paper, the powered descent trajectory is modeled as a stochastic process in order to nonconservatively adjust the bounds on the feed-forward optimal thrust magnitude command to allow for sufficient feedback authority. The margin on the nominal throttle is computed as a function of the covariance of the closed-loop thrust commands so that if the nominal throttle is within the limits, plus the margin, then the closed-loop throttle is within the allowable limits with high probability. The proposed method can be solved onboard without iteration.},

A low-energy lunar halo transfer orbit is chosen as the reference trajectory, which can represent the dramatically varying dynamics in the vast Earth–Moon region, and demonstrates much more complex environments than the vicinity of libration points. This trajectory exhibits time-varying topology of four different types, with two new ones: saddle saddle center and complex saddle complex saddle center (to the authors’ best knowledge, never studied in the literature). Stability transitions occur with a tremendous variation of the eigenvalues, bringing new challenges to effective formation controller design. To obtain bounded motion, topology-type-dependent HSP controller is proposed using the local stable/unstable manifolds. Difficulty arises in the transition regions, where close-to-zero real (complex) eigenvalues appear and require huge control gains, which may be infeasible for onboard computers. Accordingly, the controller is improved by considering additionally the local center manifold, and the gains required are always lower than 25. The controller is simple to implement because only position information is required, and its validity and robustness in the presence of initial deviations and navigation errors are verified by Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract     = {Controlling large swarms of robotic agents presents many challenges, including, but not limited to, computational complexity due to a large number of agents, uncertainty in the functionality of each agent in the swarm, and uncertainty in the swarm’s configuration. This work generalizes the swarm state using random finite set (RFS) theory and solves a centralized control problem with a quasi-Newton optimization through the use of model predictive control (MPC) to overcome the aforementioned challenges. This work uses the RFS formulation to control the distribution of agents assuming an unknown or unspecified number of agents. Computationally efficient solutions are also obtained via the MPC version of the iterative linear quadratic regulator (ILQR), a variant of differential dynamic programming. Information divergence is used to define the distance between the swarm RFS and the desired swarm configuration through the use of the modified distance. Simulation results using MPC and ILQR show that the swarm intensity converges to the desired intensity. Additionally, the RFS control formulation is shown to be very flexible in terms of the number of agents in the swarm and configuration of the desired Gaussian mixtures. Lastly, the ILQR and the Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density filter are used in conjunction to solve a spacecraft relative motion problem with imperfect information to show the viability of centralized RFS control for this real-world scenario.},

These are first derived for the general case for a finite burn beginning at the epoch time; simplifications are made for when the target is the spacecraft state at a desired final time, and the controls at the epoch time are impulsive ’s. An application is presented comparing the STT method with a linearized numerical predictor–corrector for computing an impulsive station-keeping maneuver in an unstable halo orbit around the Earth–moon Lagrange point. The STT method is shown to perform significantly faster, while also converging on accurate solutions for long-horizon targets where the predictor–corrector method fails. The formulation is able to accommodate any number of perturbations in the dynamics, rendering it suitable for onboard operational usage. This approach provides promise for fast and efficient determination of the desired controls to achieve a nonlinear target constraint surface in a highly nonlinear dynamic environment.},

All possible relative orbits can be represented by a hypo-epi curve or a deformed curve on the x-y plane and a simple z-axis harmonic oscillator motion. The designed relative orbits are used to create identical constellation patterns of multiple satellites, called parametric constellations in this study, by closed-form formulas and satellite phasing rules obtained from the geometrical relationship and periodic conditions. In conclusion, the resulting solution contributes to solving technical dynamics and tracking problems by simply designing complex relative motions in free space.},

Gauss’s planetary equations and relative motion equations are used to map maneuvers at a given time to displacements at the predicted close approach. The model is then extended to map changes in state between two times, allowing one to propagate covariance matrices. The analytical formulation reduces the optimization problem to an eigenproblem, for both maximum deviation and minimum collision probability. Two maximum deviation cases, total deviation and impact parameter, are compared for a large set of spacecraft–debris conjunction geometries derived from European Space Agency’s Meteoroid and Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference (MASTER-2009) model. Moreover, the maximum impact parameter and minimum collision probability maneuvers are compared assuming covariances known at the maneuver time, to evaluate the net effect of lead time in collision probability. In all cases, solutions are analyzed in the b-plane to leverage its natural separation of phasing and geometry change effects. Both uncertainties and maximum deviation grow along the time axis for long lead times, limiting the reduction in collision probability.},

First, a torus-centric formulation of relative motion is presented. Then, relative distance between spacecraft is examined for two spacecraft on the same torus separated by small angle displacements. The examination motivates the creation of a design methodology that uses a new means of visualizing relative motion on quasi-periodic orbits known as expansion maps. This technique is applied to both the averaged and circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). In the CR3BP, both Lissajous and quasi-halo formations are considered. The expansion map demonstrates its capacity to design spacecraft formations in all cases. The creation of this generalized approach toward understanding and designing relative trajectories is a critical next step for formation flight research. Whereas most modern studies solve relative motion problems in particular environments, the techniques discussed in this paper can be applied to a wide variety of systems.},

The restrictive assumption of decoupling the three-dimensional interceptor–target engagement into two separate mutually orthogonal planes is relaxed. The guidance commands are derived using sliding mode control, with a time-to-go estimate that accounts for interceptor’s heading angle errors. It is shown that even for arbitrarily wide launch envelops, interception is guaranteed at a prespecified desired impact time. Further, a weighted control allocation technique is presented to allocate suitable lateral accelerations along the pitch and the yaw directions. Finally, numerical simulations, including extensive Monte Carlo assessments, are carried out with constant speed as well as two different realistic interceptor models that consider time-varying speed owing to aerodynamic parameter variations. Guidance strategy is shown to be effective in the presence of noisy measurements, uncertainties, and system lag. The performance of the proposed strategy is shown to be superior compared with an existing one.},

The guidance commands for many-to-one engagement scenario are derived considering nonlinear engagement kinematics and an improved time-to-go estimate that takes the interceptors’ heading errors into account. A resource allocation technique is used, which provides flexibility in apportioning the required lateral acceleration in the pitch and the yaw planes. The proposed strategies use the notions of sliding mode control, which is known for its finite-time convergence and better disturbance rejection capabilities. With the proposed techniques, and under various interaction topologies, the multi-interceptor group is able to simultaneously intercept the target, both at an impact time specified in advance as well as when the impact time is decided during engagement itself. The control is executed in an event-triggered fashion, thereby reducing the resource utilization burden while guaranteeing satisfactory closed-loop performance of the guidance strategies. Finally, various engagement scenarios have been considered in simulations to support the theoretical claims.},

This opens up the possibility to compute the guidance profile continuously on board the spacecraft, circumventing all convergence issues associated to optimal solvers, and thus constituting a valid alternative to solutions based on the convexification of the underlying optimal control problem. A new general methodology called “backward generation of optimal examples” is proposed to create the data necessary to train the artificial neural networks. With respect to previous works, our databases contain orders of magnitude more optimal trajectories. Several schemes to train representations of either the optimal policy (thrust profile) or the value function (optimal mass) are proposed and tested. We find that they accurately approximate the optimal thrust and that a spacecraft employing these networks would be able to reach the target conditions using only 2\% more propellant than in the corresponding mathematically optimal transfer. All networks trained are tested during simulations of interplanetary transfers with respect to their ability to reach optimally the target conditions starting from nominal and off-nominal conditions.},

European Space Agency’s Herschel is the only spacecraft to date that has achieved an accuracy between 0.8 and 0.9 arcsec without employing FGS and by using only precise commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors. This paper improves upon Herschel’s pointing accuracy by at least [314, 925, 925]\% for German Aerospace Center’s future mission named “Infrared Astronomy Satellite Swarm Interferometer (IRASSI).” IRASSI’s closed-loop attitude determination and control system (ADCS) is carefully developed by selecting high-precision COTS sensors and actuators, implementing two optimal attitude estimation algorithms for the sensor data fusion, three robust control algorithms for the attitude control, and a pseudoinverse distribution algorithm for spacecraft momenta allocation among the redundant reaction wheels in three different configurations. Monte Carlo simulations of IRASSI’s ADCS demonstrate that an unprecedented three-axis absolute pointing error of [0.193, 0.078, 0.078] arcsec is achieved. Furthermore, performance comparison between the rate-integrating and rate-gyroscope-based multiplicative extended Kalman filter for this mission is demonstrated. Finally, performance comparison of three attitude controllers establishes their feasibility for this mission.},

Geometric-dynamic approaches offer a universal solution to trajectory generation that is both intuitive and computationally efficient. In this paper, an extension of Bézier spline-based techniques is presented that exploits the quaternion structure of a Pythagorean hodograph curve to include the orientation of the vehicle in a four-dimensional trajectory specification. The trajectory is constructed to achieve continuity and paired with a timing law that ensures continuity. Various kinodynamic evaluation parameters are derived and presented for use in trajectory optimization, and the technique is demonstrated on a high-fidelity nonlinear model of an F16 jet. The segmented nature of this approach allows for the efficient scaling of the algorithm to large environments with long and complex trajectories, which combined with efficient spatial separation computations allow for environments with multiple obstacles or trajectories. The focus of this paper is on the method used to represent the trajectory rather than the optimization algorithm that finally exploits this structure to generate the optimal trajectory.},

The control objectives are relative position and attitude tracking and keeping, which include keeping the spacecraft stay at a certain distance above the specific face of the object, and keeping the spacecraft’s certain body-fixed axis pointing to the object during the process. This problem is challenging because the desired motion of the tracking spacecraft is determined by both the object’s attitude status and the relative motion between the spacecraft and the object. A nonlinear orbit-attitude coordinated adaptive tracking controller is developed to fulfill the tracking mission. The sufficient condition for the asymptotic stability is investigated. The influences of the uncertainties including the mass and inertial matrix of the spacecraft and disturbance are taken into consideration. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the tracking control.},

  abstract     = {Airborne wind energy (AWE) systems are tethered flying devices that harvest wind resources at higher altitudes, which are not accessible to conventional wind turbines. To become a viable alternative to other renewable energy technologies, AWE systems are required to fly reliably and autonomously for long periods of time while being exposed to atmospheric turbulence and wind gusts. In this context, the present paper proposes a three-step methodology to improve the resilience of an existing baseline control system toward these environmental disturbances. In the first step, upset conditions are systematically generated that lead to a failure of the control system using the subset simulation method. In the second step, the generated conditions are used to synthesize a surrogate model that can be used to predict upsets beforehand. In the final step an avoidance maneuver is designed that keeps the AWE system operational while minimizing the impact of the maneuver on the average pumping cycle power. The feasibility of the methodology is demonstrated on the example of tether rupture during pumping cycle operation. As an additional contribution a novel transition strategy from retraction to traction phase is presented that can reduce the probability of tether rupture significantly.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a collaborative tracking control problem using a group of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with constant and nonidentical speeds. The dynamics of fixed-wing UAVs are modeled by unicycle-type equations with nonholonomic constraints, assuming that UAVs fly at constant altitudes in the nominal operation mode. The controller is designed such that all fixed-wing UAVs as a group can collaboratively track a desired target’s position and velocity. This paper first presents conditions on the relative speeds of tracking UAVs and the target to ensure that the tracking objective can be achieved when UAVs are subject to constant-speed constraints. A reference velocity is constructed that includes both the target’s velocity and position as feedback, which is to be tracked by the group centroid. In this way, all vehicles’ headings are controlled such that the group centroid follows a reference trajectory that successfully tracks the target’s trajectory. A spacing controller is further devised to ensure that all vehicles stay close to the group centroid trajectory. Tradeoffs in the controller design and performance limitations of the target tracking control due to the constant-speed constraint are also discussed in detail. Experimental results with three fixed-wing UAVs tracking a target rotorcraft are provided.},

An analysis of system dynamics relates slung load response to cable tension, and a means to estimate cable tension without a direct cable force sensor is described. Three different estimators (least squares, maximum likelihood, and Kalman filter) are derived and compared for this estimation problem. Flight tests performed in a motion capture studio are used to demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach. Payload mass is estimated with less than 3\% error without the use of a cable tension sensor. Mass added to the payload to intentionally change the center of mass and moment of inertia is used to verify the estimation of center of mass and moment of inertia, with center of mass estimates estimated to well within one centimeter of the true location. Trajectory tracking tests comparing uncompensated (i.e., nominal) center of mass and compensated (estimated) center of mass show that payload position tracking is essentially unchanged. However, payload orientation, cable tension, and rotorcraft position tracking are significantly improved when the estimated center of mass is incorporated into the feedback loop.},

  abstract     = {Advanced large-wing-span aircraft result in more structural flexibility and the potential for instability or poor handling qualities. These shortcomings call for stability augmentation systems that entail active structural control. Consequently, the in-flight estimation of wing shape is beneficial for the control of very flexible aircraft. This paper proposes a new methodology for estimating flexible structural states based on extended Kalman filtering by exploiting ideas employed in aided inertial navigation systems. High-bandwidth-rate gyro angular velocities at different wing stations are integrated to provide a short-term standalone inertial shape estimation solution, and additional low-bandwidth aiding sensors are then employed to bound diverging estimation errors. The proposed filter implementation does not require a flight dynamics model of the aircraft, facilitates the often tedious Kalman filtering tuning process, and allows for accurate estimation under large and nonlinear wing deflections. To illustrate the approach, the technique is verified by means of simulations using sighting devices as aiding sensors, and an observability study is conducted. In contrast to previous work in the literature based on stereo vision, a sensor configuration that provides fully observable state estimation is found using only one camera and multiple rate gyros for Kalman filtering update and prediction phases, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a methodology for systematically studying the nonlinear frequency responses of an aircraft model using numerical continuation with periodic forcing, thereby presenting an extension of conventional bifurcation analysis in flight dynamics applications. The motivation is to identify nonlinear phenomena in the frequency domain that are absent in linearized models upon which many control law designs are based since these phenomena can degrade the performance or robustness of the linear-model-based controllers. Because the aerospace industry typically uses linearizations in controller design, both open-loop and closed-loop behaviors are considered. When the example aircraft considered here is forced with small control surface deflections, highly nonlinear responses are observed. This includes period-doubling bifurcations, fold bifurcations leading to existence of multiple solutions, quasi-periodic motions, and formation of isolas. Closed-loop responses of a proportional stability augmentation controller for this aircraft become out of phase with the linear prediction at low forcing frequencies when the aircraft operates at high angle of attack. To address these behaviors, the methodology is extended by employing two-parameter continuation of the controller gain to assess its effectiveness in those nonlinear regions, where linear controller design techniques cannot be used. Time histories are used to verify the results.},

In this paper, sliding-mode-based collaborative maneuvering strategies are developed for a pair of UAVs moving on a two-dimensional plane and carrying a rigid payload. Such strategies are apt for applications such as payload delivery, where the 2-UAV system has to interact with either a stationary or a maneuvering platform. The strategies are designed using the concept of nonsingular terminal sliding mode and a kinematics-based formulation of interaction between the 2-UAV system and a point on the platform. The strategies enable the 2-UAV system to track the maneuvering platform and deliver the payload to the platform from any angle, within a finite-time interval. In addition, the maneuvering strategies also include a controller so that the payload can be oriented to a desired angle. These strategies are then generalized, using the concept of collision cones, to scenarios where the payload is to be delivered to within a region on the platform, rather than to a point.},

  abstract     = {Fragmentation clouds from explosions or collision of payloads and rocket bodies in space pose a threat to objects in Earth orbit. Most of the fragments are too small to be tracked and can only be accounted for statistically. Here, a framework for the fully statistical treatment of a fragmentation cloud, its evolution and ramifications, without the need of simplifying assumptions, is presented. The cloud is modeled as an uncertainty around a single fragment, which can be propagated using any of the existing, nondeterministic, nonlinear orbital uncertainty propagation methods. This work is focused on providing the initial distribution and the estimation of the statistical collision probability. The NASA standard breakup model is revisited to derive a probability distribution of the initial fragment cloud. Two density transformation methods are discussed to obtain the distribution in a subset of orbital elements, suitable for mid- to long-term evolution. The fragment spatial density and the impact rates on targets in any orbit are obtained. The method is applied to show the fragment cloud distribution of a payload collision in low Earth orbit (LEO). Its collision probability with a satellite in LEO and a rocket body in the geostationary transfer orbit are estimated. The result is compared against, and shows the limitations of, sampling and methods based on finite differences.},

In particular it is shown that the knowledge of the semimajor axis of the orbit of the secondary with respect to the primary is critical to guarantee a sufficient level of navigation accuracy. A method is proposed to allow for the inclusion of the orbital parameters of the secondary asteroid in the estimation process. It is shown that the inclusion of the estimation of the orbital parameters of the secondary provides the required information to allow navigating in the proximity of the binary system at the Lagrange point L4. The paper then demonstrates that the same method can be used to navigate a small formation of two spacecraft at L4 provided that intersatellite position and velocity vectors can be measured with sufficient accuracy. In this case the formation can be controlled even if the optical sensor onboard one of the spacecraft partially fails.},

This paper presents a new analytical predictor–corrector guidance algorithm for the Earth-aerocapture problem. Bank control is open loop (lift-up) during the descent phase and closed loop (lift-down) during the ascent phase in order to emulate the bang–bang bank structure of optimal aerocapture. The guidance is developed using analytical functions representing the flight-path angle and the composite effects of atmospheric density, lift and drag coefficients, and vehicle mass along the ascent trajectory. These functions result in a closed-form equation for exit velocity and a method for predicting the switching condition from lift-up to lift-down control. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and near-optimal performance of this new analytical guidance method.},

The problem is posed in relative orbit element (ROE) space, which yields insight into relative motion geometry and allows for the straightforward inclusion of perturbations in linear time-variant form. Reachable set theory is used to translate the cost-minimization problem into a geometric path-planning problem and formulate the reachable delta- minimum, a new metric to assess optimality and quantify reachability of a maneuver scheme. Next, this paper presents a methodology to compute maneuver schemes that meet this new optimality criterion and achieve a prescribed reconfiguration. Though the methodology is applicable to any linear time-variant system, this paper uses a state representation in ROE to derive new globally optimal maneuver schemes in orbits of arbitrary eccentricity. The methodology is also used to generate quantifiably suboptimal solutions when the optimal solutions are unreachable. Further, this paper determines the mathematical impact of uncertainties on achieving the desired end state and provides a geometric visualization of those effects on the reachable set. The proposed algorithms are tested in realistic reconfiguration scenarios and validated in a high-fidelity computational simulation environment.},

  abstract     = {In optimal control and optimization problems where partial convexity already exists, it is highly desirable to reformulate the nonconvex parts of the problem in a way amendable to the use of a convex optimization algorithm. The biggest challenge in doing so lies with nonlinear equality constraints. Traditional linearization-based techniques have inherent shortcomings that can cause them to be ineffective in some routine applications. In this paper a novel method is developed to treat a class of nonlinear equality constraints by a convex–concave decomposition. In a relaxed problem each nonlinear equality constraint of the class is represented by three inequality constraints that are either convex or concave. It is theoretically established that the relaxed problem can be set up to have the same solution as the original one. A convergent successive solution approach is designed to find the solution of the relaxed problem by solving a sequence of convex optimization problems. The application of the proposed method in a fuel-optimal finite-thrust spacecraft circumnavigation problem demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach where the conventional linearization method fails under most conditions.},
