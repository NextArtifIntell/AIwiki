  abstract     = {Explainable recommendations enable users to understand why certain items are suggested and, ultimately, nurture system transparency, trustworthiness, and confidence. Large crowdsourcing recommendation systems ought to crucially promote authenticity and transparency of recommendations. To address su ch challenge, this paper proposes the use of stream-based explainable recommendations via blockchain profiling. Our contribution relies on chained historical data to improve the quality and transparency of online collaborative recommendation filters – Memory-based and Model-based – using, as use cases, data streamed from two large tourism crowdsourcing platforms, namely Expedia and TripAdvisor. Building historical trust-based models of raters, our method is implemented as an external module and integrated with the collaborative filter through a post-recommendation component. The inter-user trust profiling history, traceability and authenticity are ensured by blockchain, since these profiles are stored as a smart contract in a private Ethereum network. Our empirical evaluation with HotelExpedia and Tripadvisor has consistently shown the positive impact of blockchain-based profiling on the quality (measured as recall) and transparency (determined via explanations) of recommendations.},

On the contrary, industrial applications are scenarios with real and uncontrolled conditions where thousands of different activities (such as transporting or manufacturing craft products), with an incredible variability, may be developed. In this context, new and enhanced human activity recognition technologies are needed. Therefore, in this paper, a new activity recognition technology, focused on Industry 4.0 scenarios, is proposed. The proposed mechanism consists of different steps, including a first analysis phase where physical signals are processed using moving averages, filters and signal processing techniques, and an atomic recognition step where Dynamic Time Warping technologies and k-nearest neighbors solutions are integrated; a second phase where activities are modeled using generalized Markov models and context labels are recognized using a multi-layer perceptron; and a third step where activities are recognized using the previously created Markov models and context information, formatted as labels. The proposed solution achieves the best recognition rate of 87% which demonstrates the efficacy of the described method. Compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, an improvement up to 10% is reported.},

  abstract     = {Accurate segmentation of casting defects plays a positive role in the quality control of casting products, and is of great significance for accurate extraction of the mechanical properties of defects in the casting solidification process. However, as the shape of casting defects is complex and irre gular, it is challenging to segment casting defects by existing segmentation methods. To address this, a spectrum domain instance segmentation model (SISN) is proposed for segmenting five types of casting defects with complex shapes accurately. The five defects are inclusion, shrinkage, hot tearing, cold tearing and micro pore. The proposed model consists of three sub-models: the spectrum domain region proposal model (SRPN), spectrum domain region of interest alignment model (SRoIAlign) and spectrum domain instance generation model (SIGN). SRPN uses a multi-scale anchoring mechanism to detect defects of various sizes, where the SSReLU and SCPool functions are used to solve the spectrum domain gradient explosion problem and the spectrum domain over-fitting problem. SRoIAlign uses the floating-point quantization operation and the tri-linear interpolation method to quantize the 3D proposals to the feature values in an accurate manner. SIGN is a full-spectrum domain neural network applied to 3D proposals, generating a segmentation instance of defects in a point-wise manner. In the experiments, we test the effectiveness of the proposed model from three aspects: segmentation accuracy, time performance and mechanical property extraction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the growing use of Intelligent Personal Agents in different human activities and in various domains led the corresponding research to focus on the design and development of agents that are not limited to interaction with humans and execution of simple tasks. The latest research eff orts have introduced Intelligent Personal Agents that utilize Natural Language Understanding (NLU) modules and Machine Learning (ML) techniques in order to have complex dialogues with humans, execute complex plans of actions and effectively control smart devices. To this aim, this article introduces the second generation of the CERTH Intelligent Personal Agent (CIPA) which is based on the RASA framework and utilizes two machine learning models for NLU and dialogue flow classification. CIPA-Generation B provides a dialogue-story generator that is based on the idea of adjacency pairs and multiple intents, that are classifying complex sentences consisting of two users’ intents into two automatic operations. More importantly, the agent can form a plan of actions for implicit Demand-Response and execute it, based on the user’s request and by utilizing AI Planning methods. The introduced CIPA-Generation B has been deployed and tested in a real-world scenario at Centre’s of Research &amp; Technology Hellas (CERTH) nZEB SmartHome in two different domains, energy and health, for multiple intent recognition and dialogue handling. Furthermore, in the energy domain, a scenario that demonstrates how the agent solves an implicit Demand-Response problem has been applied and evaluated. An experimental study with 36 participants further illustrates the usefulness and acceptance of the developed conversational agent-based system.},

  abstract     = {3D mesh subdivision is essential for geometry modeling of complex surfaces, which benefits many important applications in the fields of multimedia such as computer animation. However, in the ordinary adaptive subdivision, with the deepening of the subdivision level, the benefits gained from the imp rovement of smoothness cannot keep pace with the cost caused by the incremental number of faces. To mitigate the gap between the smoothness and the number of faces, this paper devises a novel improved mesh subdivision method to coordinate the smoothness and the number of faces in a harmonious way. First, this paper introduces a variable threshold, rather than a constant threshold used in existing adaptive subdivision methods, to reduce the number of redundant faces while keeping the smoothness in each subdivision iteration. Second, to achieve the above goal, a new crack-solving method is developed to remove the cracks by refining the adjacent faces of the subdivided area. Third, as a result, the problem of coordinating the smoothness and the number of faces can be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, in which the possible threshold sequences constitute the solution space. Finally, the Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is improved to efficiently search the Pareto frontier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing mesh subdivision methods in different settings.},

  abstract     = {In classification tasks, feature selection (FS) can reduce the data dimensionality and may also improve classification accuracy, both of which are commonly treated as the two objectives in FS problems. Many meta-heuristic algorithms have been applied to solve the FS problems and they perform satisf actorily when the problem is relatively simple. However, once the dimensionality of the datasets grows, their performance drops dramatically. This paper proposes a self-adaptive multi-objective genetic algorithm (SaMOGA) for FS, which is designed to maintain a high performance even when the dimensionality of the datasets grows. The main concept of SaMOGA lies in the dynamic selection of five different crossover operators in different evolution process by applying a self-adaptive mechanism. Meanwhile, a search stagnation detection mechanism is also proposed to prevent premature convergence. In the experiments, we compare SaMOGA with five multi-objective FS algorithms on sixteen datasets. According to the experimental results, SaMOGA yields a set of well converged and well distributed solutions on most data sets, indicating that SaMOGA can guarantee classification performance while removing many features, and the advantage over its counterparts is more obvious when the dimensionality of datasets grows.},

Digital twin plays a significant role as the instrument that enables digital access to precise real-time information about physical objects and supports the optimisation of the related processes through conversi on of the big data associated with them into actionable information. A number of frameworks and conceptual models has been proposed in the research literature that addresses the requirements and benefits of digital twins, yet their applications are explored to a lesser extent. A time-domain machining vibration model based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed as a digital twin component in this paper. The developed conditional StyleGAN architecture enables (1) the extraction of knowledge from existing models and (2) a data-driven simulation applicable for production process optimisation. A novel solution to the challenges in GAN analysis is then developed, where the comparison of maps of generative accuracy and sensitivity reveals patterns of similarity between these metrics. The sensitivity analysis is also extended to the mid-layer network level, identifying the sources of abnormal generative behaviour. This provides a sensitivity-based simulation uncertainty estimate, which is important for validation of the optimal process conditions derived from the proposed model.},

Moreover, man-made disasters can have enormous moral and economic consequences for people. A typical example is the large deadly and catastrophic explosion in Beirut on 4 August 2020, which destroyed a very large area of the city. This research paper introduces a Geo-AI disaster response computer vision system, capable to map an area using material from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). SAR is a unique form of radar that can penetrate the clouds and collect data day and night under any weather conditions. Specifically, the Memory-Augmented Deep Convolutional Echo State Network (MA/DCESN) is introduced for the first time in the literature, as an advanced Machine Vision (MAV) architecture. It uses a meta-learning technique, which is based on a memory-augmented approach. The target is the employment of Deep Reservoir Computing (DRC) for domain adaptation. The developed Deep Convolutional Echo State Network (DCESN) combines a classic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with a Deep Echo State Network (DESN), and analog neurons with sparse random connections. Its training is performed following the Recursive Least Square (RLS) method. In addition, the integration of external memory allows the storage of useful data from past processes, while facilitating the rapid integration of new information, without the need for retraining. The proposed DCESN implements a set of original modifications regarding training setting, memory retrieval mechanisms, addressing techniques, and ways of assigning attention weights to memory vectors. As it is experimentally shown, the whole approach produces remarkable stability, high generalization efficiency and significant classification accuracy, significantly extending the state-of-the-art Machine Vision methods.},

  abstract     = {Global natural resources are affected by several causes such as climate change effects or unsustainable management strategies. Indeed, the use of water has been intensified in urban buildings because of the proliferation of HVAC ( Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning ) systems, for instance cooling towers, where an abundant amount of water is lost during the evaporation process. The measurement of the evaporation is challenging, so a virtual sensor could be used to tackle it, allowing to monitor and manage the water consumption in different scenarios and helping to plan efficient operation strategies which reduce the use of fresh water. In this paper, a deep generative approach is proposed for developing a virtual sensor for probabilistic estimation of the evaporation in cooling towers, given the surrounding conditions. It is based on a conditioned generative adversarial network (cGAN), whose generator includes a recurrent layer (GRU) that models the temporal information by learning from previous states and a densely connected layer that models the fluctuations of the conditions. The proposed deep generative approach is not only able to yield the estimated evaporation value but it also produces a whole probability distribution, considering any operating scenario, so it is possible to know the confidence interval in which the estimation is likely found. This deep generative approach is assessed and compared with other probabilistic state-of-the-art methods according to several metrics (CRPS, MAPE and RMSE) and using real data from a cooling tower located at a hospital building. The results obtained show that, to the best of our knowledge, our proposal is a noteworthy method to develop a virtual sensor, taking as input the current and last samples, since it provides an accurate estimation of the evaporation with wide enough confidence intervals, contemplating potential fluctuations of the conditions.},

  abstract     = {Robotic grasping in dynamic environments is still one of the main challenges in automation tasks. Advances in deep learning methods and computational power suggest that the problem of robotic grasping can be solved by using a huge amount of training data and deep networks. Despite these huge accomp lishments, the acceptance and usage in real-world scenarios is still limited. This is mainly due to the fact that the collection of the training data is expensive, and that the trained network is a black box. While the collection of the training data can sometimes be facilitated by carrying it out in simulation, the trained networks, however, remain a black box. In this study, a three-step model is presented that profits both from the advantages of using a simulation approach and deep neural networks to identify and evaluate grasp points. In addition, it even offers an explanation for failed grasp attempts. The first step is to find all grasp points where the gripper can be lowered onto the table without colliding with the object. The second step is to determine, for the grasp points and gripper parameters from the first step, how the object moves while the gripper is closed. Finally, in the third step, for all grasp points from the second step, it is predicted whether the object slips out of the gripper during lifting. By this simplification, it is possible to understand for each grasp point why it is stable and – just as important – why others are unstable or not feasible. All of the models employed in each of the three steps and the resulting Overall Model are evaluated. The predicted grasp points from the Overall Model are compared to the grasp points determined analytically by a force-closure algorithm, to validate the stability of the predicted grasps.},

Correspondingly, developing defensive mechanisms in which swarms can be used to protect against adversarial Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is a pr oblem that requires further attention. Prior work on intercepting UAVs relies mostly on utilizing additional sensors or uses the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, for which strong conditions need to be met to guarantee the existence of a saddle-point solution. To that end, this work proposes a novel interception method that utilizes the swarm’s onboard PID controllers for setting the drones’ states during interception. The drone’s states are constrained only by their physical limitations, and only partial feedback of the adversarial drone’s positions is assumed. The new framework is evaluated in a virtual environment under different environmental and model settings, using random simulations of more than 165,000 swarm flights. For certain environmental settings, our results indicate that the interception performance of larger swarms under partial observation is comparable to that of a one-drone swarm under full observation of the adversarial drone.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the spread of video sensor networks both in public and private areas has grown considerably. Smart algorithms for video semantic content understanding are increasingly developed to support human operators in monitoring different activities, by recognizing events that occur in the o bserved scene. With the term event, we refer to one or more actions performed by one or more subjects (e.g., people or vehicles) acting within the same observed area. When these actions are performed by subjects that do not interact with each other, the events are usually classified as simple. Instead, when any kind of interaction occurs among subjects, the involved events are typically classified as complex. This survey starts by providing the formal definitions of both scene and event, and the logical architecture for a generic event recognition system. Subsequently, it presents two taxonomies based on features and machine learning algorithms, respectively, which are used to describe the different approaches for the recognition of events within a video sequence. This paper also discusses key works of the current state-of-the-art of event recognition, providing the list of datasets used to evaluate the performance of reported methods for video content understanding.},

The existing transfer learning method generally n eeds to acquire the shared parameters by integrating human knowledge. However, in many real applications, an understanding of which parameters can be shared is unknown beforehand. Transfer learning model is essentially a special multi-objective optimization problem. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel auto-sharing parameter technique for transfer learning based on multi-objective optimization and solves the optimization problem by using a multi-swarm particle swarm optimizer. Each task objective is simultaneously optimized by a sub-swarm. The current best particle from the sub-swarm of the target task is used to guide the search of particles of the source tasks and vice versa. The target task and source task are jointly solved by sharing the information of the best particle, which works as an inductive bias. Experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed algorithm on several synthetic data sets and two real-world data sets of a school data set and a landmine data set, which show that the proposed algorithm is effective.},

  abstract     = {The automatization of the Re-Identification of an individual across different video-surveillance cameras poses a significant challenge due to the presence of a vast number of potential candidates with a similar appearance. This task requires the learning of discriminative features from person image s and a distance metric to properly compare them and decide whether they belong to the same person or not. Nevertheless, the fact of acquiring images of the same person from different, distant and non-overlapping views produces changes in illumination, perspective, background, resolution and scale between the person’s representations, resulting in appearance variations that hamper his/her re-identification. This article focuses the feature learning on automatically finding discriminative descriptors able to reflect the dissimilarities mainly due to the changes in actual people appearance, independently from the variations introduced by the acquisition point. With that purpose, such variations have been implicitly embedded by the Mahalanobis distance. This article presents a learning algorithm to jointly model features and the Mahalanobis distance through a Deep Neural Re-Identification model. The Mahalanobis distance learning has been implemented as a novel neural layer, forming part of a Triplet Learning model that has been evaluated over PRID2011 dataset, providing satisfactory results.},

  abstract     = {The inverse kinematics of robotic manipulators consists of finding a joint configuration to reach a desired end-effector pose. Since inverse kinematics is a complex non-linear problem with redundant solutions, sophisticated optimization techniques are often required to solve this problem; a possibl e solution can be found in metaheuristic algorithms. In this work, a modified version of the firefly algorithm for multimodal optimization is proposed to solve the inverse kinematics. This modified version can provide multiple joint configurations leading to the same end-effector pose, improving the classic firefly algorithm performance. Moreover, the proposed approach avoids singularities because it does not require any Jacobian matrix inversion, which is the main problem of conventional approaches. The proposed approach can be implemented in robotic manipulators composed of revolute or prismatic joints of n degrees of freedom considering joint limits constrains. Simulations with different robotic manipulators show the accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach. Additionally, non-parametric statistical tests are included to show that the proposed method has a statistically significant improvement over other multimodal optimization algorithms. Finally, real-time experiments on five degrees of freedom robotic manipulator illustrate the applicability of this approach.},

Very often, situations cannot be defined but need to be discovered as recurrent patterns within time series data of the system under consideration. T his paper addresses the assessment of different approaches to discover frequent variable-length patterns in time series. Because of the success of artificial neural networks (NN) in various research fields, a special issue of this work is the applicability of NNs to the problem of pattern discovery in time series. Therefore we applied and adapted a Convolutional Autoencoder and compared it to classical nonlearning approaches based on Dynamic Time Warping, based on time series discretization as well as based on the Matrix Profile. These nonlearning approaches have also been adapted, to fulfill our requirements like the discovery of potentially time scaled patterns from noisy time series. We showed the performance (quality, computing time, effort of parametrization) of those approaches in an extensive test with synthetic data sets. Additionally the transferability to other data sets is tested by using real life vehicle data. We demonstrated the ability of Convolutional Autoencoders to discover patterns in an unsupervised way. Furthermore the tests showed, that the Autoencoder is able to discover patterns with a similar quality like classical nonlearning approaches.},

Recently, due to the increase in the richness and variety of attribute information associated with individual nodes, detectin g communities in attributed graphs becomes a more challenging problem. Most existing works focus on the similarity between pairwise nodes in terms of both structural and attribute information while ignoring the higher-order patterns involving more than two nodes. In this paper, we explore the possibility of making use of higher-order information in attributed graphs to detect communities. To do so, we first compose tensors to specifically model the higher-order patterns of interest from the aspects of network structures and node attributes, and then propose a novel algorithm to capture these patterns for community detection. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets with varying sizes and different characteristics of attribute information demonstrated the promising performance of our algorithm.},

While common looms can weave repetitive patterns, Jacquard looms can weave the patterns without repetition restrictions. A pattern in which the warps and wefts cross on a grid is defined in a binary matrix. The binary matrix can define which warp and weft is on top at each grid point of the Jacquard fabric. The process can be regarded as encoding from pattern to textile. In this work, we propose a decoding method that generates a binary pattern from a textile fabric that has been already woven. We could not use a deep neural network to learn the process based solely on the training set of patterns and observed fabric images. The crossing points in the observed image were not completely located on the grid points, so it was difficult to take a direct correspondence between the fabric images and the pattern represented by the matrix in the framework of deep learning. Therefore, we propose a method that can apply the framework of deep learning viau the intermediate representation of patterns and images. We show how to convert a pattern into an intermediate representation and how to reconvert the output into a pattern and confirm its effectiveness. In this experiment, we confirmed that 93% of correct pattern was obtained by decoding the pattern from the actual fabric images and weaving them again.},

An example is the aircraft fuel quantity indication (FQI) system, of which the design is strongly dependent on the tank geometry definition. Flexibl e FQI design methods are therefore desirable to swiftly assess system-level impact due to aircraft level changes. For this purpose, a genetic algorithm with a two-stage fitness assignment and FQI specific crossover procedure is proposed (FQI-GA). It can handle multiple measurement accuracy constraints, is coupled to a parametric definition of the wing tank geometry and is tested with two performance objectives. A range of crossover procedures of comparable node placement problems were tested for FQI-GA. Results show that the combinatorial nature of the probe architecture and accuracy constraints require a probe set selection mechanism before any crossover process. A case study, using approximated Airbus A320 requirements and tank geometry, is conducted and shows good agreement with the probe position results obtained with the FQI-GA. For the objectives of accessibility and probe mass, the Pareto front is linear, with little variation in mass. The case study confirms that the FQI-GA method can incorporate complex requirements and that designers can employ it to swiftly investigate FQI probe layouts and trade-offs.},

This paper proposes a novel multi-behaviors co-ordination controller model using enzymatic numerical P systems for autonomous mobile robots navigation in unknown environ ments. An environment classifier is constructed to identify different environment patterns in the maze-like environment and the multi-behavior co-ordination controller is constructed to coordinate the behaviors of the robots in different environments. Eleven sensory prototypes of local environments are presented to design the environment classifier, which needs to memorize only rough information, for solving the problems of poor obstacle clearance and sensor noise. A switching control strategy and multi-behaviors coordinator are developed without detailed environmental knowledge and heavy computation burden, for avoiding the local minimum traps or oscillation problems and adapt to the unknown environments. Also, a serial behaviors control law is constructed on the basis of Lyapunov stability theory aiming at the specialized environment, for realizing stable navigation and avoiding actuator saturation. Moreover, both environment classifier and multi-behavior coordination controller are amenable to the addition of new environment models or new behaviors due to the modularity of the hierarchical architecture of P systems. The simulation of wheeled mobile robots shows the effectiveness of this approach.},
