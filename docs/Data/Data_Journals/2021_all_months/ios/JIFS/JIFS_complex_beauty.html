  abstract     = {The fourth party logistics (4PL) is an combiner that designs and implements the holistic supply chain solutions by using skills, knowledge, technology and resources of the service provider and its customer. A 4PL provider is also a technological service provider with eligible intellectual capital a nd the sufficient computer/software infrastructure. Defining the most appropriate 4PL service provider from the alternatives is not easy for companies, the solution can be addressed within the framework of the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem, and subjective and uncertain data are required for this solution. “Fuzzy set theory” is a helpful tool for dealing with such subjectivity and uncertainty. In recent times, extensions of fuzzy sets have been evolved to address and describe the subjectivities and uncertainties more widely. Neutrosophic sets are one of the extensions of fuzzy sets, and unlike other extensions, they use the independent indeterminacy-membership function, thereby extracting important information and improving the accuracy of the decision-making process. A neutronophic MCDM method was proposed for the assessment of 4PL providers’ performance. In the application part of the study, neutrosophic language scale was used by three experts to evaluate the performance of 4PL providers. Then the closeness coefficient of each alternative was computed and sequenced in descending order. We also presented a comparative analysis with neutrosphic TOPSIS method. The results determined that the proposed neutrosophic MCDM method could be used in the performance evaluation of 4PL providers and similar problems.},

  abstract     = {Risk management is the key factor to obtain safety in the working environment and its effectiveness increases with accuracy assessment and robust analysis. However, it is hard to succeed because of uncertainties in the working environment. Therefore, there are a lot of risk assessment methods in th e literature to assess occupational health and safety risks. The traditional risk assessment methods handle each activity in the working environment separately and they do not consider the interactions among them. Furthermore, in these methods, potential outcomes of the risk parameters are considered based on the most possible outcome although there may be more than one potential outcome. Differ from the traditional methods, The House of Safety method has been proposed to consider all potential outcomes and handle the interactions among the activities. In this study, an extension of The House of Safety is proposed to consider interactions among potential risks and to determine the most effective prevention method based on the potential risks. Hence, this extension provides an evaluation of the whole system. The proposed model has been developed by integrating Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and DEMATEL into Quality Function Deployment (QFD). In this direction, FIS is used to determine activity-related probabilities, “FAHP” is utilized to identify all possible damage potentials of risks, and the DEMATEL is used to clarify interactions among risks. Finally, all information produced by these methods were aggregated to obtain total risk scores by using QFD. In addition, a second home has been created to link prevention and risks. Therefore, an effective prevention plan has been made to eliminate priority risks with all effective parameters. This stage provides the opportunity for optimum prevention plan against risk or risk groups dominating the system at the same time. In this study, unlike traditional methods including a partial risk assessment perspective, an integrated method that takes into account the risks on their own and the interactions between them is proposed in the literature, and the proposed approach has been applied to an open pit mine.},

In this study, a framework is presented that predicts and encourages taking proactive actions to solve customer problems before they lead to a call to the call center. Machine learning techniques are implemented and models are trained with a dataset which is collected from an internet service provider’s systems in order to detect internet connection problems of the customers proactively. Firstly, two classification techniques which are multi perceptron neural networks and radial basis neural networks are applied as supervised techniques to classify whether the internet connection of customers is problematic or not. Then, by using unsupervised techniques, namely Kohonnen’s neural networks and Adaptive Resonance Theory neural networks, the same data set is clustered and the clusters are used for the customer problem prediction. The methods are then integrated with an ensemble technique bagging. Each method is implemented with bagging in order to obtain improvement on the estimation error and variation of the accuracy. Finally, the results of the methods applied for classification and clustering with and without bagging are evaluated with performance measures such as recall, accuracy and Davies-Bouldin index, respectively.},

The facial recognition system (FCS) is a kind of biometric system. FCS provides a unique mathematical model by determining the distance between the cheekbones, chin, no se, eyes, jawline, and similar positions using the facial features of the persons. Determining the gender and age group of chosen persons’ from face images is the main purpose of this study. It is targeted to distinguish the gender of the person and to obtain information about the person is children or adults by making essential works on the images. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the deep face recognition algorithms that widely used to recognize facial images. This study is suggested as a study that detects noise in images using the fuzzy logic-based filter method and classifies this cleared data by gender using the matrix completion and CNN. TensorFlow which is a machine learning library that used to train and tests deep learning methods is used for experiments. The customer photographs taken during using the system are transformed into a matrix expression through a system trained using this algorithm. The obtained results indicated that the offered technique detects age and gender with a 96% accuracy value and 1.145 seconds time.},

  abstract     = {Process capability analysis (PCA) is a tool for measuring a process’s ability to meet specification limits (SLs), which the customers define. Process capability indices (PCIs) are used for establishing a relationship between SLs and the considered process’s ability to meet these limits as an index. PCA compares the output of a process with the SLs through these capability indices. If the customers’ needs contain vague or imprecise terms, the classical methods are inadequate to solve the problem. In such cases, the information can be processed by the fuzzy set theory. Recently, ordinary fuzzy sets have been extended to several new types of fuzzy sets such as intuitionistic fuzzy sets, Pythagorean fuzzy sets, picture fuzzy sets, and spherical fuzzy sets. In this paper, a new extension of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, which is called penthagorean fuzzy sets, is proposed, and penthagorean fuzzy PCIs are developed. The design of production processes for COVID-19 has gained tremendous importance today. Surgical mask production and design have been chosen as the application area of the penthagorean fuzzy PCIs developed in this paper. PCA of the two machines used in surgical mask production has been handled under the penthagorean fuzzy environment.},

  abstract     = {Facility location selection is a vital decision for companies that affects both cost and delivery time over the years. However, determination of the facility location is a NP-hard problem. A hybrid algorithm that combines revised weighted fuzzy c-means with Nelder Mead (RWFCM-NM) performs well when compared with well-known algorithms for the facility location problem (FLP) with deterministic customer demands and positions. The motivation of the study is both analyzing performance of the RWFCM-NM algorithm with probabilistic customer demands and positions and proposing a new approach for this problem. This paper develops two new algorithms for FLP when customer demands and positions are probabilistic. The proposed algorithms are a probabilistic fuzzy c-means algorithm and Nelder-Mead (Probabilistic FCM-NM), a probabilistic revised weighted fuzzy c-means algorithm and Nelder Mead (Probabilistic RWFCM-NM) for the un-capacitated planar multi-facility location problem when customer positions and customer demands are probabilistic with predetermined service level. Proposed algorithms performances were tested with 13 data sets and comparisons were made with four well known algorithms. According to the experimental results, probabilistic RWFCM-NM algorithm demonstrates superiority on compared algorithms in terms of total transportation costs.},

During the last decade, several works on scheduling problems have used a fuzzy approach including either uncertain or imprecise data. A fuzzy logic based tool for multi-objective Hybrid Flow-shop Scheduling with Multi-processor Tasks (HFSMT) problem is presented in this paper. In this study, HFSMT problems with a fuzzy processing time and a fuzzy due date are formulated, taking Oğuz and Ercan’s benchmark problems in the literature into account. Fuzzy HFSMT problems are formulated by three-objectives: the first is to maximize the minimum agreement index and the second is to maximize the average agreement index, and the third is to minimize the maximum fuzzy completion time. An efficient genetic algorithm(GA) is proposed to solve the formulated fuzzy HFSMT problems. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparing it with the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm in the literature.},

The user requirements become more demanding. Competition among the manufacturing companies is at its limits and transforms the product s to be more complex.

Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is a key solution to track the entire lifespan of the product from idea to design, design to manufacture and manufacture to service. Besides the complexity of products and production, the selection of the right PLM solution which will become the backbone of enterprises is an open problem. In this paper, a thorough literature review is conducted to analyze the most important features for selecting the right PLM solution for manufacturing firms. Moreover, to overcome the challenge of decision makers’ (DM) subjective judgments, a novel interval value spherical fuzzy COPRAS (IVSF-COPRAS) multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method is introduced. The paper aims to help enterprises rapidly identify the best alternative vendor/solution to be selected based on the need of the organization. In order to show the applicability, DM inputs are collected from a leading defense company where the PLM selection process is ongoing.

  abstract     = {Cloud computing represents relatively new paradigm of utilizing remote computing resources and is becoming increasingly important and popular technology, that supports on-demand (as needed) resource provisioning and releasing in almost real-time. Task scheduling has a crucial role in cloud computin g and it represents one of the most challenging issues from this domain. Therefore, to establish more efficient resource employment, an effective and robust task allocation (scheduling) method is required. By using an efficient task scheduling algorithm, the overall performance and service quality, as well as end-users experience can be improved. As the number of tasks increases, the problem complexity rises as well, which results in a huge search space. This kind of problem belongs to the class of NP-hard optimization challenges. The objective of this paper is to propose an approach that is able to find approximate (near-optimal) solution for multi-objective task scheduling problem in cloud environment, and at the same time to reduce the search time. In the proposed manuscript, we present a swarm-intelligence based approach, the hybridized bat algorithm, for multi-objective task scheduling. We conducted experiments on the CloudSim toolkit using standard parallel workloads and synthetic workloads. The obtained results are compared to other similar, metaheuristic-based techniques that were evaluated under the same conditions. Simulation results prove great potential of our proposed approach in this domain.},

  abstract     = {Pipelines are a nonlinear and complex component to transfer fluid or gas from one place to another. From economic and environmental points of view, the safety of transmission lines is incredibly important. Furthermore, condition monitoring and effective data analysis are important to leak detection and localization in pipelines. Thus, an effective technique for leak detection and localization is presented in this study. The proposed scheme has four main steps. First, the learning autoregressive technique is selected to approximate the flow signal under normal conditions and extract the mathematical state-space formulation with uncertainty estimations using a combination of robust autoregressive and support vector regression techniques. In the next step, the intelligence-based learning observer is designed using a combination of the robust learning backstepping method and a fuzzy-based technique. The learning backstepping algorithm is the main part of the algorithm that determines the leak estimation. After estimating the signals, in the third step, their classification is performed by the support vector machine algorithm. Finally, to find the size and position of the leak, the multivariable backstepping algorithm is recommended. The effectiveness of the proposed learning control algorithm is analyzed using both experimental and simulation setups.},

In this paper, a new fuzzy extension of the most used capital budgeting techniques is proposed. In this content, first interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets (IVFFSs) are defined, and the algebraic and aggregation operations are determined for interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy (IVFF) numbers. The formulations of IVFF net present value, IVFF equivalent uniform annual value, and IVFF benefit-cost ratio (B/C) methods are generated. To validate the proposed methods, proposed formulations are illustrated with a hypothetical example, and the results are compared with classical fuzzy capital budgeting techniques.},

CIFSs help us define membership functions more flexibly, taking into account the vagueness in membership and non-membership degrees. In this study, TOPSIS, which is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, is developed under circular intuitionistic fuzzy environment. The proposed CIF-TOPSIS method is applied to determine the most appropriate pandemic hospital location selection problem. Then, a sensitivity analysis based on criteria weights and the weight of the decision maker’s optimistic and pessimistic attitudes are conducted to check the robustness of the decisions given by the proposed approach.

  abstract     = {Occupational safety problems are no longer acceptable for any industrial environment. Lack of comprehensive and reliable evaluations for occupational safety causes many undesired events and harm to employees during the industrial process. In this study, it is aimed to develop an applicable risk ana lysis methodology for evaluating the undesired occupational events that occurred in the multi-process system where no historical accident records. The difficulty in obtaining and analyzing the data required for the determination of the occupational safety risks especially in the manually executed processes has been overcome with the Bayesian Network and interval type-2 fuzzy sets by using the expert judgments. While BN enables to development of a comprehensive reasoning approach about the occurrence of the events, interval type-2 fuzzy sets better represent the ambiguity in the judgments by covering the uncertainty in a wider mathematical range with less computational effort according to other fuzzy sets. During multi-processes in industrial activity, various occupational undesired events may occur, including rare events with very serious consequences or frequent events with very low severity consequences. To able to consider all kinds of events occurring in an industrial environment from a holistic risk perspective, a novel fuzzy scale for specifying the probability and consequence of the events are proposed by the interval type-2 fuzzy numbers. Therefore, all undesired events regardless the probability and consequence which may occur during the multi-processes in a system and the main root causes of these events can be observed within the proposed methodology. A case study is used to emphasize the effect of the proposed methodology for risk analysis of occupational safety in underground mining. The results have indicated that occupational safety education is the most contributing factor to occurring the undesired occupational events in underground mining. We believe that this study could help evaluate the safety risk of the multi-process systems comprehensively and holistically and proposing strategic planning for mitigating the occupational safety risks.},

One of the most important evacuation tasks is the minimum cost lexicographic flow modelling task, which allows aggrieved to be transported to safe areas along the optimal transportation routes, taking into account the priority of shelters. It is inevitable that when modelling an evacuation scenario, an expert will encounter difficulties in setting network parameters due to the inherent uncertainty of a network, the rapid change in the nature of the movement, etc. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets allow simulating doubts and uncertainty of a decision-maker when choosing a membership function. Due to the increasing complexity of the decision-making problems, experts cannot assess all the network parameters correctly because much specific knowledge is required, and each expert cannot be familiar with all attributes equally. Therefore, different decision-makers should have different values for various attributes. The algorithm proposed incorporates the search for the order of reliable shelters according to the modified TOPSIS method and the minimum cost paths in intuitionistic fuzzy conditions based on the non-standard subtraction operation. A case study is conducted to verify the proposed algorithm.},

To handle with uncertainty in real-life, the Dijkstra’s algorithm should be adapted to fuzzy environment. The weight of arc -which is the vague travel time between two nodes- can be expressed in bipolar neutrosophic fuzzy sets containing positive and negative statements.

Therefore, a systematic review methodology that contains bibliometric and descriptive analysis is followed in this study. 104 scientific papers including SFS in their titles, abstracts and keywords are reviewed. The papers are then analyzed and categorized based on titles, abstracts, and keywords to construct a useful foundation of past research. Finally, trends and gaps in the literature are identified to clarify and to suggest future research opportunities in the fuzzy logic area.},

  abstract     = {Reaching a high vaccination coverage level is of vital essence when preventing epidemic diseases. For mandatory vaccines, the demand can be forecasted using some demographics such as birth rates or populations between certain ages. However, it has been difficult to forecast non-mandatory vaccine de mands because of vaccine hesitation, alongside other factors such as social norms, literacy rate, or healthcare infrastructure. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to explore the predominant factors that affect the non-mandatory vaccine demand, focusing on the recommended childhood vaccines, which are usually excluded from national immunization programs. For this study, fifty-nine factors were determined and categorized as system-oriented and human-oriented factors. After a focus group study conducted with ten experts, seven system-oriented and eight human-oriented factors were determined. To reveal the cause and effect relationship between factors, one of the multi-criteria decision-making methods called Fuzzy-DEMATEL was implemented. The results of the analysis showed that “Immunization-related beliefs”, “Media/social media contents/messaging”, and “Social, cultural, religious norms” have a strong influence on non-mandatory childhood vaccine demand. Furthermore, whereas “Availability and access to health care facilities” and “Political/ financial support to health systems” are identified as cause group factors, “Quality of vaccine and service delivery management” is considered an effect group factor. Lastly, a guide was generated for decision-makers to help their forecasting process of non-mandatory vaccine demands to avoid vaccine waste or shortage.},

  abstract     = {An analysis of the scientific literature on project cash flow control and fuzzy modelling shows that project cash flows are modelled using only basic approaches drawn from fuzzy theory, which may distort the credibility of the model. In this paper, we therefore propose to use the whole spectrum of fuzzy arithmetic, and to select operations that suit the nature of the cash flows in question, their dependencies and the preferences of the project manager. An analysis of the literature also shows that in practically all existing models of project costs and cash flow management, project costs and cash flows are treated at a very high level of generality (without considering the various types of project, factors influencing their variability and signals warning of imminent cash-related problems), and estimations are not updated on an ongoing basis throughout the duration of the project. The results of a survey performed with the participation of 100 project managers show that this simplistic view of project cash flows may be distorting, and cannot guarantee the development of an efficient project cost and cash flow control system. We propose an approach that at least partially compensates for these drawbacks: it differentiates between types of project cash flows and the factors and triggers affecting changes in cash flows. Two case studies are used for a an initial verification of the approach. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research perspectives.},

  abstract     = {Project managers supervise projects to ensure their smooth completion within a stipulated time frame and budget while guaranteeing construction quality. The relationships of various attributes with quality can be quantified and classified to facilitate such supervision. Therefore, this study used a data mining algorithm to analyze the relationships between defects, quality levels, contract sums, project categories, and progress in 1,015 inspection projects. In the first part, association rule mining (ARM), an unsupervised data mining approach, was used to obtain 11 rules relating two defect types (i.e., quality management system and construction quality) and determine the relationships between the four attributes (i.e., quality level, contract sum, project category, and progress). The resulting association rule may be beneficial for construction management because project managers can use it to determine the correlations between defects and attributes. In the second part, supervised data mining techniques, namely neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (C5.0 and QUEST) algorithms, were applied to develop a classification model for quality prediction. The target variable was quality, which was divided into four levels, and the decision variables comprised 499 defects, 3 contract sums, 7 project categories, and 2 progress variables. The results indicated that five defects were important. Finally, the four indicators of gain chart, break-even point (BEP), accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to evaluate the model. For the SVM model, the actual value predicted by the gain chart was 96.04%, the BEP was 0.95, and the AUC was 0.935. The SVM yielded optimal classification efficiency and effectively predicted the quality level. The data mining model developed in this study can serve as a reference for effective construction management.},

A novel combined forecasting model named, Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm optimization of Triangular Fuzzy Grey Model, MFO-TFGM (1,1), is presented in this study. The existing TFGM (1,1) model parameters are optimized by a new nature- inspired heuristic algorithm named Moth-Flame Optimization algorithm which is inspired by the moths flying path. Unlike the studies in the literature, in order to improve the forecasting accuracy, six parameters (λL, λM, λR, α, β and γ) were optimized. After the steps of the model is presented, a forecasting implementation has been made with the proposed model. Turkey’s hourly electricity consumption data is utilized to show the success of the prediction model. Prediction results of proposed model is compared with TFGM (1,1).

Understanding and measuring the limitations of adopting autonomous vehicles and selecting the best autonomous vehicle based on different aspects is crucial for enhancing the adoption process. Defining the criteria and the appropriate evaluation methodology is very important for selecting the best autonomous vehicles. However, this selection process is a human judgment-based process where both benefit and cost criteria with imprecise linguistic assessments should be considered. The KEmeny Median Indicator Ranks Accordance (KEMIRA) method is a method that enables ranking the benefit and cost criteria independently. In this paper, a new KEMIRA method based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets is defined. Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTS) are newly utilized to represent the hesitancy of the decision-makers. The proposed new KEMIRA is approach the first study that defines the alternative scores and weights of the criteria via HFLTS. The computational steps of the new model are applied to autonomous vehicle selection. A real application is employed to show the applicability of the new KEMIRA method.},

  abstract     = {In line with the increase in consciousness on sustainability in today’s global world, great emphasis has been attached to food waste management. Food waste is a complex issue to manage due to uncertainties on quality, quantity, location, and time of wastes, and it involves different decisions at ma ny stages from seed to post-consumption. These ambiguities re-quire that some decisions should be handled in a linguistic and ambiguous environment. That forces researchers to benefit from fuzzy sets mostly utilized to deal with subjectivity that causes uncertainty. In this study, as a novel approach, the spherical fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (SFAHP) was used to select the best food treatment option. In the model, four main criteria (infrastructural, governmental, economic, and environmental) and their thirteen sub-criteria are considered. A real case is conducted to show how the proposed model can be used to assess four food waste treatment options (composting, anaerobic digestion, landfilling, and incineration). Also, a sensitivity analysis is generated to check whether the evaluations on the main criteria can change the results or not. The proposed model aims to create a subsidiary tool for decision makers in relevant companies and institutions.},

Our approach aims to cluster the data according to their fuzzy membership value and model it with similar characteristics. This approach allows for efficient clustering of objects with more than one cluster characteristic. On the other hand, our approach will enable us to combine boosting type ensemble algorithms, which are various forms of assemblies that are widely used in machine learning due to their excellent success in the literature. We used a mobile game’s customers’ marketing and gameplay data for predicting their customer lifetime value for testing our approach.

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is the most common cancer that progresses from cells in the breast tissue among women. Early-stage detection could reduce death rates significantly, and the detection-stage determines the treatment process. Mammography is utilized to discover breast cancer at an early stage prior to a ny physical sign. However, mammography might return false-negative, in which case, if it is suspected that lesions might have cancer of chance greater than two percent, a biopsy is recommended. About 30 percent of biopsies result in malignancy that means the rate of unnecessary biopsies is high. So to reduce unnecessary biopsies, recently, due to its excellent capability in soft tissue imaging, Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) has been utilized to detect breast cancer. Nowadays, DCE-MRI is a highly recommended method not only to identify breast cancer but also to monitor its development, and to interpret tumorous regions. However, in addition to being a time-consuming process, the accuracy depends on radiologists’ experience. Radiomic data, on the other hand, are used in medical imaging and have the potential to extract disease characteristics that can not be seen by the naked eye. Radiomics are hard-coded features and provide crucial information about the disease where it is imaged. Conversely, deep learning methods like convolutional neural networks(CNNs) learn features automatically from the dataset. Especially in medical imaging, CNNs’ performance is better than compared to hard-coded features-based methods. However, combining the power of these two types of features increases accuracy significantly, which is especially critical in medicine. Herein, a stacked ensemble of gradient boosting and deep learning models were developed to classify breast tumors using DCE-MRI images. The model makes use of radiomics acquired from pixel information in breast DCE-MRI images. Prior to train the model, radiomics had been applied to the factor analysis to refine the feature set and eliminate unuseful features. The performance metrics, as well as the comparisons to some well-known machine learning methods, state the ensemble model outperforms its counterparts. The ensembled model’s accuracy is 94.87% and its AUC value is 0.9728. The recall and precision are 1.0 and 0.9130, respectively, whereas F1-score is 0.9545.},

  abstract     = {Linguistic terms are quite suitable to make evaluations in multiple criteria decision making problems since humans prefer them rather than sharp evaluations. When linguistic evaluations are used in the decision matrix instead of exact numerical values, fuzzy set theory can capture the vagueness in the linguistic evaluations. Ordinary fuzzy sets have been extended to many new types of fuzzy sets such as intuitionistic fuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets, spherical fuzzy sets and picture fuzzy sets. Spherical fuzzy sets are an extension of picture fuzzy sets whose squared sum of their parameters is at most equal to one. This paper develops a novel spherical fuzzy CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method and applies it for prioritizing supplier selection criteria. Supplier selection is one of the most critical aspects of any organization since any mistake in this process may cause poor supplier performance and inefficiencies in the business processes. Supplier selection is a multi-criteria decision making problem involving several conflicting criteria and alternatives. A numerical illustration of the proposed method is also given for this problem.},

  abstract     = {Assessing functions of fuzzy arguments and ranking of fuzzy quantities are two key steps in fuzzy modeling and Fuzzy Multicriteria Decision Analysis (FMCDA). Approximate calculations along with the use of centroid index as a defuzzification based ranking methods are a generally accepted approach to applications in the fuzzy environment. This paper presents a novel fuzzy system, F-CalcRank, which is integration of two coupled fuzzy systems: F-Calc (Fuzzy Calculator) and F-Ranking (Fuzzy Ranking). F-Calc allows assessing functions of fuzzy numbers with the use of different approaches: approximate calculations, standard fuzzy arithmetic, and transformation methods. The input values to F-Calc are fuzzy numbers with the following membership functions: triangular and trapezoidal, Gaussian, bell shape, sigmoid, and piece-wise linear continuous or upper semicontinuous membership functions of any complexity, as well as fuzzy linguistic terms of a given term set. F-Ranking system is intended for ranking of a given set of fuzzy numbers, including those, which are inputs and/or outputs of the F-Calc system. F-Ranking includes six ranking methods: three defuzzification based and three pairwise comparison ones. The structure of F-CalcRank as well as input and output information and the user interfaces of both F-Calc and F-Ranking systems, which can also be used independently, are presented. Examples of computing functions of fuzzy arguments and ranking of fuzzy numbers using implemented methods as well as exploring a real case study in agro-ecology with the use of a math model in fuzzy environment are considered. These examples stress the features and novelty of F-CalcRank system as well as presented applied research. The computer modules created within F-CalcRank are a basis for different FMCDA models developed by the authors. F-CalcRank system is intended for university education, research and various applications in engineering and technology.},

  abstract     = {By 2050, the global population is estimated to rise to over 9 billion people, and the global food need is expected to ascend 50%. Moreover, by cause of climate change, agricultural production may decrease by 10%. Since cultivable land is constant, multi-layered farms are feasible alternatives to yi eld extra food from the unit land. Smart systems are logical options to assist production in these factory-like farms. When the amount of food grown per season is assessed, a single indoor hectare of a vertical farm could deliver yield equal to more than 30 hectares of land consuming 70% less water with nearly zero usage of pesticides. In this study, we evaluated technology selection for three vertical farm alternatives via MCDM methods. Even though commercial vertical farms are set up in several countries, area is still fresh and acquiring precise data is difficult. Therefore, we employed fuzzy logic as much as possible to overcome related uncertainties. WEDBA (Weighted Euclidean Distance Based Approximation) and MACBETH (Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique) methods are employed to evaluate alternatives.},

Taking the carbon emission and processing time as the objectives, the cutting rate, feed per tooth, and cuttin g width as the optimization variables. A multi-objective optimization model of NC milling parameters is established. An non-dominated sorting gravity search algorithm (NSGSA) is used to solve the multi-objective model, and the position update backoff operation is introduced. Finally, taking NC machining process as an example, the multi-objective optimization results and the single objective optimization results are compared respectively, the actual data show that when the optimization objective is high efficiency and low carbon, the processing time and carbon emissions are 173 and 192 respectively. The comparison results show that the combination of processing parameters obtained by multi-objective optimization is the best, the optimal parameter combination obtained by NSGSA algorithm is verified by grey correlation analysis, and the grey correlation degree of the optimal solution set is 0.81, which is the largest in all solution sets. This approach can help the decision-makers flexibly select the corresponding milling parameters, and provide decision-makers with flexible selection decisions suitable for various scenarios.},

Traditional community detection algorithms would represent the netwo rk using an adjacency matrix based on observations, which may contain redundant information or noise that interferes with the detection results. In this paper, we propose a community detection algorithm based on density clustering. In order to improve the performance of density clustering, we consider an algorithmic framework for learning the continuous representation of network nodes in a low-dimensional space. The network structure is effectively preserved through network embedding, and density clustering is applied in the embedded low-dimensional space to compute the similarity of nodes in the network, which in turn reveals the implied structure in a given network. Experiments show that the algorithm has superior performance compared to other advanced community detection algorithms for real-world networks in multiple domains as well as synthetic networks, especially when the network data chaos is high.},

Firstly, the deficiency of the existing operating laws is elaborated in detail and three cases are described to identify the accuracy of the proposed operating laws in the context of t-spherical fuzzy environment. Also, a novel score function is proposed to obtain the consistent value in ranking of the alternatives. The backbone of this research, t-spherical fuzzy preference relation, consistent t-spherical fuzzy preference relations, incomplete t-spherical fuzzy preference relations, consistent incomplete t-spherical fuzzy preference relations, and acceptable incomplete t-spherical fuzzy preference relations are established.

Dual hesitant fuzzy sets explicitly show a set of membership degrees and a set of non-membership degrees, which also imply a set of important data: hesi tant degrees.The traditional definition of distance between dual hesitant fuzzy sets only considers membership degree and non-membership degree, but hesitant degree should also be taken into account. To this end, using these three important data sets (membership degree, non-membership degree and hesitant degree), we first propose a variety of new distance measurements (the generalized normalized distance, generalized normalized Hausdorff distance and generalized normalized hybrid distance) for dual hesitant fuzzy sets in this paper, based on which the corresponding similarity measurements can be obtained. In these distance definitions, membership degree, non-membership-degree and hesitant degree are of equal importance. Second, we propose a clustering algorithm by using these distances in dual hesitant fuzzy information system. Finally, a numerical example is used to illustrate the performance and effectiveness of the clustering algorithm. Accordingly, the results of clustering in dual hesitant fuzzy information system are compared using the distance measurements mentioned in the paper, which verifies the utility and advantage of our proposed distances.

  abstract     = {Arabic language has a set of sound letters called diacritics, these diacritics play an essential role in the meaning of words and their articulations. The change in some diacritics leads to a change in the context of the sentence. However, the existence of these letters in the corpus transcription affects the accuracy of speech recognition. In this paper, we investigate the effect of diactrics on the Arabic speech recognition based end-to-end deep learning. The applied end-to-end approach includes CNN-LSTM and attention-based technique presented in the state-of-the-art framework namely, Espresso using Pytorch. In addition, and to the best of our knowledge, the approach of CNN-LSTM with attention-based has not been used in the task of Arabic Automatic speech recognition (ASR). To fill this gap, this paper proposes a new approach based on CNN-LSTM with attention based method for Arabic ASR. The language model in this approach is trained using RNN-LM and LSTM-LM and based on nondiacritized transcription of the speech corpus. The Standard Arabic Single Speaker Corpus (SASSC), after omitting the diacritics, is used to train and test the deep learning model. Experimental results show that the removal of diacritics decreased out-of-vocabulary and perplexity of the language model. In addition, the word error rate (WER) is significantly improved when compared to diacritized data. The achieved average reduction in WER is 13.52%.},

  abstract     = {A query application for On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) examines various kinds of data stored in a Data Warehouse (DW). There have been no systematic studies that look at the impact of query optimizations on performance and energy consumption in relational and NoSQL databases. Indeed, due to a lack of precise power calculation techniques in various databases and queries, the energy activity of several basic database operations is mostly unknown, as are the queries themselves, which are very complicated, extensive, and exploratory. As a result of the rapidly growing size of the DW system, query response times are regularly increasing. To improve decision-making performance, the response time of such queries should be as short as possible. To resolve these issues, multiple materialized views from individual database tables have been collected, and queries have been handled. Similarly, due to overall maintenance and storage expenses, as well as the selection of an optimal view set to increase the data storage facility’s efficacy, materializing all conceivable views is not viable. Thus, to overcome these issues, this paper proposed the method of energy-aware query optimization and processing, on materialized views using enhanced simulated annealing (EAQO-ESA). This work was carried out in four stages. First, a Simulated Annealing (SA) based meta-heuristic approach was used to pre-process the query and optimize the scheduling performance. Second, the optimal sets of views were materialized, resulting in enhanced query response efficiency. Third, the authors assessed the performance of the query execution time and computational complexity with and without optimization. Finally, based on processing time, efficiency, and computing cost, the system’s performance was validated and compared to the traditional technique.},

  abstract     = {In the current industrial production process, waste heat of low quality is seriously wasted. In order to effectively recover low-quality waste heat, the research group developed a small energy conversion device –Roots power machine. On this basis, the research group designed a low-quality waste hea t efficient utilization system with the equipment as the core and successfully applied it to low-quality waste heat recovery. However, in the actual operation process, the system can not run stably due to the occasional fluctuation of the input gas source. In view of this, after the study of waste heat recovery system, the fluctuation of gas source can be controlled by different grades according to the degree of change. Fuzzy rules also divide variables into different grades to solve problems, and fuzzy control can convert continuous changes of airflow into discrete changes, which greatly reduces the complexity of the control system. Therefore, the research group proposed a control strategy based on fuzzy PID. The simulation results show that the adjustment time of fuzzy PID is within 7 s, and the adjustment effect is obviously better than that of traditional PID. The experimental results show that the speed deviation under the condition of air source fluctuation is within the speed fluctuation rate (±5%), and the speed deviation under the condition of sudden disturbance load is within the steady speed adjustment rate (±3.5%), both of which meet the requirements of indexes. Therefore, the fuzzy PID control strategy can further improve the stability of output speed, reduce airflow pulsation, and provide the possibility for grid-connected power generation.},

  abstract     = {In feature weighted fuzzy c-means algorithms, there exist two challenges when the feature weighting techniques are used to improve their performances. On one hand, if the values of feature weights are learnt in advance, and then fixed in the process of clustering, the learnt weights might be lack o f flexibility and might not fully reflect their relevance. On the other hand, if the feature weights are adaptively adjusted during the clustering process, the algorithms maybe suffer from bad initialization and lead to incorrect feature weight assignment, thus the performance of the algorithms may degrade the in some conditions. In order to ease these problems, a novel weighted fuzzy c-means based on feature weight learning (FWL-FWCM) is proposed. It is a hybrid of fuzzy weighted c-means (FWCM) algorithm with Improved FWCM (IFWCM) algorithm. FWL-FWCM algorithm first learns feature weights as priori knowledge from the data in advance by minimizing the feature evaluation function using the gradient descent technique, then iteratively optimizes the clustering objective function which integrates the within weighted cluster dispersion with a term of the discrepancy between the weights and the priori knowledge. Experiments conducted on an artificial dataset and real datasets demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms the-state-of-the-art feature weight clustering methods. The convergence property of FWL-FWCM is also presented.},

As there are a lot of factors affecting carbon emissions, a novel multi-variable grey model (GM(1,N) model) based on linear time-varying parameters discrete grey model (TDGM(1,N)) has been established. I n this model, linear time-varying function is introduced into the traditional model, and dynamic optimization of fixed parameters which can only be used for static analysis is carried out. In order to prove the applicability and effectiveness of the model, this paper compared the model with the traditional model and simulated the carbon emissions of Anhui Province from 2005 to 2015. Carbon emissions in the next two years are also predicted. The results show that the TDGM(1,N) model has better simulation effect and higher prediction accuracy than the traditional GM(1,N) model and the multiple regression model(MRM) in practical application of carbon emissions prediction. In addition, the novel model of this paper is also used to predict the carbon emissions in 2018–2020 of Anhui Province.},

In medical telemetry networks frequency spectrum concept is used for providing treatment to patients who are far away from hospitals. In cognitive radios, spectrum sensing concept is used in which energy detection method is mostly used because it is simple to implement. While measuring health care environments using cognitive radios probability detection, false alarm probability and threshold parameters are calculated. In this paper for identifying spectrum holes in spectrum sensing using energy detection, distributed diffusion non-negative least mean square algorithm is proposed. It gives better results compared to energy detection concept alone in terms of probability detection converged earlier. If number of nodes are increasing probability detection is decreased from one and move towards left and its SNR is around 1.5-2 dB with proposed method.

  abstract     = {Short text matching is one of the fundamental technologies in natural language processing. In previous studies, most of the text matching networks are initially designed for English text. The common approach to applying them to Chinese is segmenting each sentence into words, and then taking these w ords as input. However, this method often results in word segmentation errors. Chinese short text matching faces the challenges of constructing effective features and understanding the semantic relationship between two sentences. In this work, we propose a novel lexicon-based pseudo-siamese model (CL2 N), which can fully mine the information expressed in Chinese text. Instead of utilizing a character-sequence or a single word-sequence, CL2 N augments the text representation with multi-granularity information in characters and lexicons. Additionally, it integrates sentence-level features through single-sentence features as well as interactive features. Experimental studies on two Chinese text matching datasets show that our model has better performance than the state-of-the-art short text matching models, and the proposed method can solve the error propagation problem of Chinese word segmentation. Particularly, the incorporation of single-sentence features and interactive features allows the network to capture the contextual semantics and co-attentive lexical information, which contributes to our best result.},

The proposed integrated cognitive femtocell and Fuzzy-based approach reduces the indoor coverage problems and enhances the throughput of the macrocell users by allowing adaptive spectrum management based on the demand, thereby eliminating spectrum underlay and overlay problems during critical conditions. In cognitive femtocell networks, the access points are prepared and installed with Cognitive Radio which can determine spectrum dynamically by macrocells and nearby Femto Access Points.

Then we design a quantile regression neural network to predict reference signal receiving power (RSRP) by feeding the above features. The network structure is specially constructed to be generalized on various complex real environments. To prove the effectiveness of proposed features and deep learning model, extensive comparative ablation experiments are applied.

Firstly, the overall framework of greenhouse monitoring algorithm was built, including fuzzy clustering algorithm and sensing layer devices. Secondly, the temperature-humidity sensors and light sensitivity sensors in the sensing layer devices were used to deeply mine and optimize the parameters of temperature, humidity and light intensity in current greenhouse, so as to ensure the stability of subsequent transmission. Meanwhile, the corresponding perceptual recognition layer and broadband access method were designed, and GPRS technology was used to feed back the data information to the monitoring data layer through temperature-humidity sensors and light sensitivity sensors. Moreover, UDP protocol was taken as the data core transmission protocol, and the adaptive protection design algorithm was proposed to ensure the most reasonable transmission of monitoring data, get the current monitoring data of temperature, humidity and illuminance. The experimental results show that the maximum delay time of the algorithm is 46 s, which is far lower than the traditional algorithm, and the delay time of temperature monitoring is also lower than the traditional algorithm.

This method is used to analyze the thermal error of the spindle reference point of the tauren EDM (Electro-discharge machin ing) machine tool. The thermal imager is used to obtain the temperature field distribution of the machine tool while the machine tool simulates actual operating conditions. Based on this, the arrangement of temperature measurement points is determined, and the temperature data of the corresponding measurement points are got by temperature sensors. In actual engineering, too many temperature measurement points can cause problems such as too high cost, too much wiring. And normal processing can be affected. In order to establish that the thermal error prediction model of the machine tool spindle reference point can meet the actual engineering needs, the adaptive FCM clustering algorithm is used to optimize the temperature measurement points. While collecting the temperatures of the optimized temperature measurement points, the displacement sensors are used to detect the thermal deformation data in X, Y, Z directions of the spindle reference position. Based on the test data, the RBF neural network thermal errors prediction model of the machine tool spindle reference point is established. Then, the test results are used to verify the accuracy of the thermal errors analysis model.

We introduced the facts mining technique in public fitness to extract high-degree knowledge from raw data, which facilitates predicting heart diseases from risk factors and their prevention. The existing work intends to introduce a new risk element in heart diseases using novel data mining strategies. Latest actual international affected person’s information (e.g., smoking, area of residence, age, weight, blood stress, chest pain, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), block arteries became accrued by way of the use of questionnaire through direct interview technique from patients. Novel two-variable decision trees are constructed for coronary heart illness records primarily based on chance factors and ranking of risk elements. The results show a correct prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) from the risk factor if records on chance factors are available as direct results of this study, tobacco, loss of physical exercise, and weight-reduction plan play a vital role in predicting heart diseases, which is the most important reason for mortality in developing countries, especially in my country.},

  abstract     = {A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is divided into groups of sensor nodes for efficient transmission of data from the point of measuring to sink. By performing clustering, the network remains energy-efficient and stable. An intelligent mechanism is needed to cluster the sensors and find an organizer n ode, the cluster head. The organizer node assembles data from its constituent nodes called member nodes, finds an optimal route to the sink of the network, and transfers the same. The nomination of cluster head is crucial since energy utilization is a major challenge of sensor nodes deployed over a hostile environment. In this paper, a fuzzy-based Improved Harris’s Hawk Optimization Algorithm (IHHO) is proposed to select an able cluster head for data communication. The fuzzy inference model ponders balance energy, distance from self to sink node, and vicinity of nodes from cluster head as input factors and decides if a candidate node is eligible for becoming a cluster head. The IHHO tunes the logic into an energy-efficient network with less complexity and more ease. The novelty of the paper lies in applying the hawk-pack technique based on fuzzy rules. Simulations show that the combination of Fuzzy based IHHO reduces the death of nodes through which network lifetime is enhanced.},

Although some researchers have made great efforts to improve the accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis, accurate diagnosis of multiple faults is still a difficult problem. In orde r to improve the accuracy of transformer multiple faults diagnosis, a multiple fault diagnosis method based on interval fuzzy probability is proposed. Different from the previous methods which provide single-value probability, this method use probability interval to represent the occurrence degree of various possible faults, which can objectively predict the potential faults that occurring in a transformer and provide a more reasonable explanation for the diagnosis results. In the proposed method, the interval fuzzy set is used to describe the evaluation of state variables and the interval fuzzy probability model based on interval weighted average is applied to integrate the fault information. The representative matrix of fault types based on fuzzy preference relationship is established to estimate the relative importance of each gas in the dissolved gases. The proposed method can provide the probability of probable faults in transformer, help engineers quickly determine the type and location of faults, and improve the accuracy of diagnosis and maintenance efficiency of transformer. The effectiveness of the method is verified with case studies.},

The higher dimension of the feature space is one of the most critical issues in e-mail classification problems due to accuracy considerations. The problem of finding the subset fe atures that significantly influence the performance of e-mail spam classification has become one of the important challenges. This paper proposes to overcome such a problem, an intelligent approach to Binary Differential Evolution Support Vector Machine (BDE-SVM). The proposed approach enhances the Binary Differential Evolution (BDE) algorithm based on the correlation coefficient as a fitness function to select the significant subset feature evaluated by an SVM classifier. To our best of knowledge, the correlation coefficient as the fitness function has not been used in the differential evolution algorithm before. The selected subset feature is used to assess the most features that contribute to the reliability of the email spam classification. The finding of the enhanced BDE is to present a powerful accuracy. The tests were conducted using “Spambase” and “SpamAssassin.” Identified benchmark datasets are to assess the feasibility of the proposed solution. The result with full-feature accuracy was 93.55 percent compared to the proposed BDE-SVM approach, which is 93.99 percent. Empirical findings also show that our method is capable of effectively increasing the number of features required to enhance the reliability of the email spam classification.},

However, since consumers can be influenced by their social friends, their tastes often change, which resulting in the cold start problem of familiar users (CSPFU), and the traditi onal product recommendation methods are difficult to achieve satisfactory results because they focus on identifying the preferable new products instead of boring familiar products. Therefore, a consumer multi-stage compensation product evaluation model (CMCPEM) based on the multidimensional correlation of products and customers to identify the products that consumers may feel tired is proposed. Specifically, the multidimensional correlation indexes are firstly proposed to depict the preferences of the consumer for the target product to be identified, other consumers who have social contagion and structural equivalence relationships with the consumer and other consumers of homogeneous products. After the direct linear, non-linear and indirect fusion of these multidimensional correlation indexes, the compensation indexes (CIs) are proposed to comprehensively describe the first stage of product evaluation process of consumers. Then, J test in the non-nested model is used to screen out the non-nested CIs that consumers focus on. Finally, in the third stage, the final decision result is given by comprehensively considering CIs that consumers focus on and the indexes that represent consumers’ favorite. Experiment results on YELP data confirm the effectiveness of CMCPEM in successfully launching the continuous marketing campaign.},

  abstract     = {Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) are still largely used to dispense cash to the customers. ATM cash replenishment is a process of refilling ATM machine with a specific amount of cash. Due to vacillating users demands and seasonal patterns, it is a very challenging problem for the financial institutio ns to keep the optimal amount of cash for each ATM. In this paper, we present a time series model based on Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) technique called Time Series ARIMA Model for ATM (TASM4ATM). This study used ATM back-end refilling historical data from 6 different financial organizations in Pakistan. There are 2040 distinct ATMs and 18 month of replenishment data from these ATMs are used to train the proposed model. The model is compared with the state-of- the-art models like Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Amazon’s DeepAR model. Two approaches are used for forecasting (i) Single ATM and (ii) clusters of ATMs (In which ATMs are clustered with similar cash-demands). The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) are used to evaluate the models. The suggested model produces far better forecasting as compared to the models in comparison and produced an average of 7.86/7.99 values for MAPE/SMAPE errors on individual ATMs and average of 6.57/6.64 values for MAPE/SMAPE errors on clusters of ATMs.},

Then, the basic properties of the presented similarity measures are discussed. Afterward, a decision-making process under the Fermatean fuzzy environment based on TOPSIS method is established, and a new method based on the proposed Fermatean fuzzy sets similarity measures is designed to solve the problems of medical diagnosis. Ultimately, an interpretative multi-criteria decision making example and two medical diagnosis examples are provided to demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the proposed method. Through comparing the different methods in the multi-criteria decision making and the medical diagnosis application, it is found that the new method is as efficient as the other methods.

The purpose of this paper is to improve automobile insurance fraud management and explore the application of data mining technology in automobile insur ance fraud identification. To this aim, an Apriori algorithm based on simulated annealing genetic fuzzy C-means (SAGFCM-Apriori) have been proposed. The SAGFCM-Apriori algorithm combines fuzzy theory with association rule mining, expanding the application scope of the Apriori algorithm. Considering that the clustering center of the traditional fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm is easy to fall into local optimal, the simulated annealing genetic (SAG) algorithm is used to optimize it. The SAG algorithm optimized FCM (SAGFCM) is used to generate fuzzy membership degrees and introduces fuzzy data into the Apriori algorithm. The Apriori algorithm is improved by reducing the rule mining time when acquiring rules. The results of empirical studies on several data sets demonstrate that the optimization of FCM by SAG can effectively avoid the local optimal problem, improve the accuracy of clustering, and enable SAGFCM-Apriori to obtain better fuzzy data during data preprocessing. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can reduce the mining time of association rules and improve mining efficiency. Finally, the SAGFCM-Apriori algorithm is applied to the scene of automobile insurance fraud identification, and the automobile insurance fraud data is mined to obtain fuzzy association rules that can identify fraud claims.},

  abstract     = {Text-based reading comprehension models have great research significance and market value and are one of the main directions of natural language processing. Reading comprehension models of single-span answers have recently attracted more attention and achieved significant results. In contrast, mult i-span answer models for reading comprehension have been less investigated and their performances need improvement. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a text-based multi-span network for reading comprehension, ALBERT_SBoundary, and build a multi-span answer corpus, MultiSpan_NMU. We also conduct extensive experiments on the public multi-span corpus, MultiSpan_DROP, and our multi-span answer corpus, MultiSpan_NMU, and compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves F1 scores of 84.10 and 92.88 on MultiSpan_DROP and MultiSpan_NMU datasets, respectively, while it also has fewer parameters and a shorter training time.},

  abstract     = {Manifold learning plays an important role in nonlinear dimensionality reduction. But many manifold learning algorithms cannot offer an explicit expression for dealing with the problem of out-of-sample (or new data). In recent, many improved algorithms introduce a fixed function to the object functi on of manifold learning for learning this expression. In manifold learning, the relationship between the high-dimensional data and its low-dimensional representation is a local homeomorphic mapping. Therefore, these improved algorithms actually change or damage the intrinsic structure of manifold learning, as well as not manifold learning. In this paper, a novel manifold learning based on polynomial approximation (PAML) is proposed, which learns the polynomial approximation of manifold learning by using the dimensionality reduction results of manifold learning and the original high-dimensional data. In particular, we establish a polynomial representation of high-dimensional data with Kronecker product, and learns an optimal transformation matrix with this polynomial representation. This matrix gives an explicit and optimal nonlinear mapping between the high-dimensional data and its low-dimensional representation, and can be directly used for solving the problem of new data. Compare with using the fixed linear or nonlinear relationship instead of the manifold relationship, our proposed method actually learns the polynomial optimal approximation of manifold learning, without changing the object function of manifold learning (i.e., keeping the intrinsic structure of manifold learning). We implement experiments over eight data sets with the advanced algorithms published in recent years to demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Path planning in an unknown environment is a basic task for mobile robots to complete tasks. As a typical deep reinforcement learning, deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm has gained wide popularity in path planning tasks due to its self-learning and adaptability to complex environment. However, most of path planning algorithms based on DQN spend plenty of time for model training and the learned model policy depends only on the information observed by sensors. It will cause poor generalization capability for the new task and time waste for model retraining. Therefore, a new deep reinforcement learning method combining DQN with prior knowledge is proposed to reduce training time and enhance generalization capability. In this method, a fuzzy logic controller is designed to avoid the obstacles and help the robot avoid blind exploration for reducing the training time. A target-driven approach is used to address the lack of generalization, in which the learned policy depends on the fusion of observed information and target information. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm converges faster than DQN algorithm in path planning tasks and the target can be reached without retraining when the path planning task changes.},

  abstract     = {Online advertisements are bought through a mechanism called real-time bidding (RTB). In RTB, the ads are auctioned in real-time on every webpage load. The ad auctions can be of two types: second-price or first-price auctions. In second-price auctions, the bidder with the highest bid wins the auctio n, but they only pay the second-highest bid. This paper focuses on first-price auctions, where the buyer pays the amount that they bid. This research evaluates how multi-armed bandit strategies optimize the bid size in a commercial demand-side platform (DSP) that buys inventory through ad exchanges. First, we analyze seven multi-armed bandit algorithms on two different offline real datasets gathered from real second-price auctions. Then, we test and compare the performance of three algorithms in a production environment. Our results show that real data from second-price auctions can be used successfully to model first-price auctions. Moreover, we found that the trained multi-armed bandit algorithms reduce the bidding costs considerably compared to the baseline (naïve approach) on average 29%and optimize the whole budget by slightly reducing the win rate (on average 7.7%). Our findings, tested in a real scenario, show a clear and substantial economic benefit for ad buyers using DSPs.},

Therefore, this work introduces an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-based rotor flux estimator for electric vehicle. The proposed estimator is an amalgamation of fuzzy inference system and artificial neural network, in which fuzzy inference system is designed using artificial neural network. The training data for neuro-fuzzy estimator is generated offline by acquiring rotor flux for different values of torque. The conventional fuzzy logic and differential calculation methods are also developed for comparative analysis. The efficacy of developed system is established by analyzing it under varying load conditions. It is revealed from the results that suggested methodology provides an improved efficiency i.e. 94.51% in comparison to 82.68% for constant flux operation.},

  abstract     = {Short-term electricity load forecasting (STLF) plays a key role in operating the power system of a nation. A challenging problem in STLF is to deal with real-time data. This paper aims to address the problem using a hybrid online model. Online learning methods are becoming essential in STLF because load data often show complex seasonality (daily, weekly, annual) and changing patterns. Online models such as Online AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (Online ARIMA) and Online Recurrent neural network (Online RNN) can modify their parameters on the fly to adapt to the changes of real-time data. However, Online RNN alone cannot handle seasonality directly and ARIMA can only handle a single seasonal pattern (Seasonal ARIMA). In this study, we propose a hybrid online model that combines Online ARIMA, Online RNN, and Multi-seasonal decomposition to forecast real-time time series with multiple seasonal patterns. First, we decompose the original time series into three components: trend, seasonality, and residual. The seasonal patterns are modeled using Fourier series. This approach is flexible, allowing us to incorporate multiple periods. For trend and residual components, we employ Online ARIMA and Online RNN respectively to obtain the predictions. We use hourly load data of Vietnam and daily load data of Australia as case studies to verify our proposed model. The experimental results show that our model has better performance than single online models. The proposed model is robust and can be applied in many other fields with real-time time series.},

The existing frameworks exploit a direct negotiation mechanism where the provider and consumer can directly talk to each other, which may not be applicable in the future due to increasing demand on broker-based models. The proposed ADSLANF will take very less total negotiation time due to complicated negotiation mechanisms using a third-party broker agent.

The lack of such QoS parameters discourages cloud users from using the services of cloud service providers.

These parameters cannot sufficiently guarantee the desired user experience or that a task will be completed within a predetermined time. Therefore, this study considered the cost-enabled QoS-aware task (job) scheduling algorithm to enhance user satisfaction and maximize the profit of commercial cloud providers. The proposed scheduling algorithm estimates the cost-enabled QoS metrics of the virtual resources available from the unified resource layer in real-time. Moreover, the virtual machine (VM) manager frequently updates the current state-of-the art information about resources in the proposed scheduler to make appropriate decisions. Hence, the proposed approach guarantees profit for cloud providers in addition to providing QoS parameters such as make-span, cloud utilization, and cloud utility, as demonstrated through a comparison with existing time-and cost-based task scheduling algorithms.},

For cloud security applications, the third party’s data embedding can be done (e.g., cloud service). In such a scenario, to protect the cover image from unauthori zed access, it is essential to encrypt before embedding it. It can be overcome by combining the RDH scheme with encryption. However, the key challenge in integrating RDH with encryption is that the correlation between adjacent pixels begins to disappear after encryption, so reversibility cannot be accomplished. RDH with elliptic curve cryptography is proposed to overcome this challenge. In this paper (ECC-RDH) by adopting additive homomorphism property; the proposed method, the stego image decryption gives the sum of the original image and confidential data. The significant advantages of this method are, the cover image is transferred with high security, the embedding capacity is 0.5 bpp with a smaller location map size of 0.05 bpp. The recovered image and secrets are the same as in the original, and thus 100% reversibility is proved.},

Moreover, to make the embedded data more robust against re-compression attack and error due to transmission over noisy channels, we employ Turbo error correcting codes. The actual data embedding is done using a proposed variant of matrix encoding that is capable of embedding three bits by modifying only one bit in block of seven carrier features. We have carried out experiments to validate the performance and it is found that the proposed method achieves better payload capacity and visual quality and is more robust than some of the recent state-of-the-art methods proposed in the literature.},

On the other hand, the trend of cyberattacks is on the rise in today’s modern Web-driven world. Therefore, effective countermeasures for the analysis and detection of malicious websites is cruc ial to combat the rising threats to the cyber world security. In this paper, we systematically reviewed the state-of-the-art techniques and identified a total of about 230 features of malicious websites, which are classified as internal and external features. Moreover, we developed a toolkit for the analysis and modeling of malicious websites. The toolkit has implemented several types of feature extraction methods and machine learning algorithms, which can be used to analyze and compare different approaches to detect malicious URLs. Moreover, the toolkit incorporates several other options such as feature selection and imbalanced learning with flexibility to be extended to include more functionality and generalization capabilities. Moreover, some use cases are demonstrated for different datasets.},

  abstract     = {Due to the rapid growth in sensor technology and embedded technology, wireless body area network WBANs plays a vital role in monitoring the human body system and the surrounding environment. It supports many healthcare applications on the one hand and are very much help full in pandemic scenarios. It has become the most innovative health care area, which is intriguing to many researchers because of its vast future prospective and potential. Data collected by different wireless sensors or nodes is very personal, critical, and important because of human life involvement. WBANs can minimize human to human contact, which helps stop the spread of severe infectious diseases. The biggest concern is the maintenance of privacy and accuracy of data is still a hot area of research due to nature of attacks, which are changing day by day and increasing, as well as for the sake of better performance. A suitable security mechanism is a way to address above issues, for achieving data security, it is expedient to propose a mechanism. It is essential to update the patient’s regular data. WBANs help to deliver truthful reports related to the patient’s health regularly and individually. This paper proposes an algorithm that shows a better result than the existing algorithm in their previous works. This work is all about proposing a mechanism which needs comparatively less resource. Only authentic entities can interact with the server, which has become obligatory for both sides, keeping data safe. Several authentication schemes have been proposed or discussed by different researchers. This paper has proposed a Secure and Efficient WBANs Authentication Mechanism (SEAM). This security framework will take care of the authentication and the security of transmitted data.},

  abstract     = {Recommender System (RS) is an information filtering approach that helps the overburdened user with information in his decision making process and suggests items which might be interesting to him. While presenting recommendation to the user, accuracy of the presented list is always a concern for the researchers. However, in recent years, the focus has now shifted to include the unexpectedness and novel items in the list along with accuracy of the recommended items. To increase the user acceptance, it is important to provide potentially interesting items which are not so obvious and different from the items that the end user has rated. In this work, we have proposed a model that generates serendipitous item recommendation and also takes care of accuracy as well as the sparsity issues. Literature suggests that there are various components that help to achieve the objective of serendipitous recommendations. In this paper, fuzzy inference based approach is used for the serendipity computation because the definitions of the components overlap. Moreover, to improve the accuracy and sparsity issues in the recommendation process, cross domain and trust based approaches are incorporated. A prototype of the system is developed for the tourism domain and the performance is measured using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), unexpectedness, precision, recall and F-measure.},

  abstract     = {Legal practitioners analyze relevant previous judgments to prepare favorable and advantageous arguments for an ongoing case. In Legal domain, recommender systems (RS) effectively identify and recommend referentially and/or semantically relevant judgments. Due to the availability of enormous amounts of judgments, RS needs to compute pairwise similarity scores for all unique judgment pairs in advance, aiming to minimize the recommendation response time. This practice introduces the scalability issue as the number of pairs to be computed increases quadratically with the number of judgments i.e., O (n2). However, there is a limited number of pairs consisting of strong relevance among the judgments. Therefore, it is insignificant to compute similarities for pairs consisting of trivial relevance between judgments. To address the scalability issue, this research proposes a graph clustering based novel Legal Document Recommendation System (LDRS) that forms clusters of referentially similar judgments and within those clusters find semantically relevant judgments. Hence, pairwise similarity scores are computed for each cluster to restrict search space within-cluster only instead of the entire corpus. Thus, the proposed LDRS severely reduces the number of similarity computations that enable large numbers of judgments to be handled. It exploits a highly scalable Louvain approach to cluster judgment citation network, and Doc2Vec to capture the semantic relevance among judgments within a cluster. The efficacy and efficiency of the proposed LDRS are evaluated and analyzed using the large real-life judgments of the Supreme Court of India. The experimental results demonstrate the encouraging performance of proposed LDRS in terms of Accuracy, F1-Scores, MCC Scores, and computational complexity, which validates the applicability for scalable recommender systems.},

The paper works with a dataset of Spanish video reviews. The audio is available as Spanish text and is translated to English while visual features are extracted from the videos. Multiple classification models are made to analyze the sentiments at each modal stage i.e. for the Spanish and English textual datasets as well as the datasets obtained upon coalescing the English and Spanish textual data with the corresponding visual cues. The results show that the analysis of Spanish textual features combined with the visual features outperforms its English counterpart with the highest accuracy difference, thereby indicating an inherent correlation between the Spanish visual cues and Spanish text which is lost upon translation to English text.},

There exists a great demand for affective systems to serve the context of mixed-language scenario. Hence, this work focusses on an effective methodology to recognize human affective state using speech samples from a mixed language framework. A unique cepstral and bi-spectral speech features derived from the speech samples classified using random forest (RF) are applied for the task. This work is first of its kind with the proposed approach validated and found to be effective on a self-recorded database with speech samples comprising from eleven various diverse Indian languages. Six different affective states of angry, fear, sad, neutral, surprise and happy are considered. Three affective models have been investigated in the work.

Fake news is deliberately created either to increase the readership or disrupt the order in the society for political and commercial benefits. It is of paramount importance to identify and filter out fake news especially in democratic societies. Most existing methods for detecting fake news involve traditional supervised machine learning which has been quite ineffective. In this paper, we are analyzing word embedding features that can tell apart fake news from true news. We use the LIAR and ISOT data set. We churn out highly correlated news data from the entire data set by using cosine similarity and other such metrices, in order to distinguish their domains based on central topics. We then employ auto-encoders to detect and differentiate between true and fake news while also exploring their separability through network analysis.},

Several studies have been conducted to study the psychological factors influencing the social network usage of people but only a few works have explored the relationship between the user’s personality and their orientation to spread rumors. This research aims to investigate the effect of personality on rumor spread on social networks. In this work, we propose a psychologically-inspired fuzzy-based approach grounded on the Five-Factor Model of behavioral theory to analyze the behavior of people who are highly involved in rumor diffusion and categorize users into the susceptible and resistant group, based on their inclination towards rumor sharing. We conducted our experiments in almost 825 individuals who shared rumor tweets on Twitter related to five different events. Our study ratifies the truth that the personality traits of individuals play a significant role in rumor dissemination and the experimental results prove that users exhibiting a high degree of agreeableness trait are more engaged in rumor sharing activities and the users high in extraversion and openness trait restrain themselves from rumor propagation.},

In this work, a weight modulation based top-down model is proposed that integrates the visual features that depend on its importance for the target search application. The model is designed to learn the optimal weights such that it biases the features of the target from the other surrounding regions. Experimental analysis is performed on various scenes on a standard dataset with the selected object in the scene. Metrics such as area under curve, average hit number and correlation reveal that the method is more suitable in target identification, by suppressing the other region.},

On the other hand, many photo editing tools evolved to make it effortless to alter multimedia content. It makes people accustomed to modifying their p hotographs or videos either for fun or extracting attention from others. This altering brings a questionable validity and integrity to the kind of multimedia content shared over the internet when used as evidence in Journalism and Court of Law. In multimedia forensics, intense research work is underway over the past two decades to bring trustworthiness to the multimedia content. This paper proposes an efficient way of identifying the manipulated region based on Noise Level inconsistencies of spliced mage. The spliced image segmented into irregular objects and extracts the noise features in both pixel and residual domains. The manipulated region is then exposed based on the cosine similarity of noise levels among pairs of individual objects. The experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method over other state-of-art methods.},

Although, current image fusion technologies, including conventional and deep learning algorithms, can produce sup erior fused images, however, they will require huge volumes of images of various modalities. This solution may not be viable for some situations, where time efficiency is expected or the equipment is inadequate. This paper addressed a modified end-to-end Generative Adversarial Network(GAN), termed Loss Minimized Fusion Generative Adversarial Network (LMF-GAN), a triple ConvNet deep learning architecture for the fusion of medical images with a limited sampling rate. The encoding network is combined with a convolutional neural network layer and a dense block called GAN, in contrast to conventional convolutional networks. The loss is minimized by training GAN’s discriminator with all the source images by learning more parameters to generate more features in the fused image. The LMF-GAN can produce fused images with clear textures through adversarial training of the generator and discriminator. The proposed fusion method has the ability to achieve state-of-the-art quality in objective and subjective evaluation, in comparison with current fusion methods. The model has experimented with standard data sets.},

In the second step, we perform a pixel-wise classification of the iris region to delineate the pupil. The images in the study are from the OpenEDS challenge and were used to evaluate both the accuracy and computational cost of the proposed segmentation method. Our approach achieved a score of 0.93 on the leaderboard, outperforming the baseline model by achieving a higher accuracy and using a smaller number of parameters. These results demonstrate the great promise pipelined models hold along with the benefit of using domain-specific processing and feature engineering in conjunction with deep-learning based approaches for segmentation tasks.},

This work proposes an ensemble learning technique by combining predictions of different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting forged portrait photographs. In the proposed method seven different pretrained CNN architectures such as AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogLeNet, Res-Net-18, ResNet-101, Inception-v3, and Inception-ResNet-v2 are utilized. As an initial step, we fine-tune the seven pretrained networks for portrait forgery detection with illuminant maps of images as input, and then uses a majority voting ensemble scheme to combine predictions from the fine-tuned networks. Ensemble methods had been found out to be good for improving the generalization capability of classification models. Experimental analysis is conducted using two publicly available portrait splicing datasets (DSO-1 and DSI-1). The results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods using traditional machine learning techniques as well as the methods using single CNN classification models.},

However, relying on the expertise of pathologists is a demanding and time-consuming process for histopathological analysis. The automated diagnosis of colon cancer from biopsy examination played an important role for pat ients and prognosis. As conventional handcrafted feature extraction requires specialized experience to select realistic features, deep learning processes have been chosen as abstract high-level features may be extracted automatically. This paper presents the colon cancer detection system using transfer learning architectures to automatically extract high-level features from colon biopsy images for automated diagnosis of patients and prognosis. In this study, the image features are extracted from a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) and used to train the Bayesian optimized Support Vector Machine classifier. Moreover, Alexnet, VGG-16, and Inception-V3 pre-trained neural networks were used to analyze the best network for colon cancer detection. Furthermore, the proposed framework is evaluated using four datasets: two are collected from Indian hospitals (with different magnifications 4X, 10X, 20X, and 40X) and the other two are public colon image datasets. Compared with the existing classifiers and methods using public datasets, the test results evaluated the Inception-V3 network with the accuracy range from 96.5% - 99% as best suited for the proposed framework.},

In this paper, a memory-efficient Subsampled Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow (SLKOF) is proposed. The proposal employs the Subsampling of images for various levels. The proposal deals with the computation of OKN gain for different image Subsampling factors using the MATLAB platform. The experimental set up to observe OKN is done using computer-based rotation control of the drum through a stepper motor. The results are compared with the well established Lucas-Kanade (LK) method for Optical flow. It is observed that OKN gain corresponds to 1/4th of a subsampled image of the SLKOF method correlates with the LK method for the majority of the cases. This validation evidently elucidates that the proposal is computationally efficient.},

About 2.1 million women are affected every year and it is the second most leading cause of cancer death in women. Initial detection and diagnosis of cancer appreciably increase the chance of s aving lives and reduce treatment costs. In this paper, we perform a survey of the techniques utilized in breast cancer detection and diagnosis in image processing, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). We also proposed a novel computer-vision based cost-effective method for breast cancer detection and diagnosis. Along with the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, our proposed method is capable of finding the exact position of the abnormality present in the breast that will help in breast-conserving surgery or partial mastectomy. The proposed method is the simplest and cost-effective approach that has produced highly accurate and useful outcomes when compared with the existing approach.},

The primary eye care centers need to include a comprehensive glaucoma screening and include machine learning models to elaborate it as decision support system. The proposed system considers the state of art of eye gaze features to understand cognitive processing, direction and restriction of visual field. There is no significant difference in global and local ratio and skewness value of fixation duration and saccade amplitude, which suggest that there is no difference in cognitive processing. The significance value of saccadic extent along vertical axis, Horizontal Vertical ratio (HV ratio), convex hull area and saccadic direction show that there is restriction in vertical visual field. The statistical measures (p &lt; 0.05) and Spearman correlation coefficient with class label validate the results. The proposed system compared the performance of seven classifiers: Naïve Bayes classifier, linear and kernel Support Vector classifiers, decision tree classifier, Adaboost, random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier. The discrimination of eye gaze features of glaucoma and normal is efficiently done by XGBoost with accuracy 1.0. The decision support system is cost-effective and portable.},

Based on railway rescue features, it was proposed that the couple number of relief point - emergency point is the key to affect railway rescue cost and efficiency. Under the premise of the maximum satisfaction degree of quantity demanded at all emergency points, a multi-objective programming model is established by maximizing the satisfaction degree of dispatching time and the satisfaction degree of the couple number of relief point - emergency point.

To study the subway’s influence on urban traffic, this paper collects data on traffic indicators in Nanchang from 2008 to 2018. The research is carried out from three aspects: traffic accessibility, green traffic, and tr affic security. First, Grey Relational Analysis is used to select 18 traffic indicators correlated with the subway from 22 traffic indicators. Second, the data is discretized and learned based on Bayesian Networks to construct the structural network of the subway’s influence. Third, to verify the reliability of using GRA and the effectiveness of Bayesian Networks (GRA-BNs), Bayesian Networks with full indicators analysis and other four algorithms (Naive Bayes, Random Decision Forest, Logistic and regression) are employed for comparison. Moreover, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area, true positive (TP) rate, false positive (FP) rate, precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy are utilized for comparing each situation. The result shows that GRA-BNs is the most effective model to study the impact of the subway’s operation on urban traffic. Then, the dependence relations between the subway and each index are analyzed by the conditional probability tables (CPTs). Finally, according to the analysis, some suggestions are put forward.},

On th is basis, the Bayesian network and multinomial logit model are established. The constructed model was tested from the perspective of model prediction accuracy and variables importance. Bayesian networks are used to analyze the interrelationships among influencing factors, and multinomial logit models are used to compare and evaluate the impact of different variables on the injury severity under different circumstances. The results show that: the prediction accuracy of the Bayesian network model and multinomial logit model is 64.57% and 65.97%, respectively. The Bayesian network reference analyses indicate that injury severity is affected by the crash factors, and there are various interactions between the various factors. The multinomial logit model analyses indicate that the factors including drivers’ age, female driver, rural roads, drunk driving, drug driving, crash time, side collision accident, etc. could significantly increase injury severity. Airbags are more effective in reducing fatal crash than injury crash. The probability of accidents caused by drug driving drivers is greater than drunk driving, drunk driving drivers are 1.79 times and 2.34 times more likely to suffer an injury severity and fatal injury severity in crashes as compared to a no injury severity, respectively, and drug driving is 1.93 times and 2.6 times, respectively. Seat belts may avoid 92.2% of fatalities. Roadside guardrail reduces the incidence of fatal crash better than injury crash.

  abstract     = {To deal with the systematic risk of financial institutions and the rapid increasing of loan applications, it is becoming extremely important to automatically predict the default probability of a loan. However, this task is non-trivial due to the insufficient default samples, hard decision boundarie s and numerous heterogeneous features. To the best of our knowledge, existing related researches fail in handling these three difficulties simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised loan default prediction model WEAKLOAN that systematically solves all these challenges based on deep metric learning. WEAKLOAN is composed of three key modules which are used for encoding loan features, learning evaluation metrics and calculating default risk scores. By doing so, WEAKLOAN can not only extract the features of a loan itself, but also model the hidden relationships in loan pairs. Extensive experiments on real-life datasets show that WEAKLOAN significantly outperforms all compared baselines even though the default loans for training are limited.},

Based on the operation proce ss analysis of the third-party platform crowdsourcing innovation model, this paper proposes that the essence of crowdsourcing innovation is the value co-creation of multi-agent participation. Based on grounded theory, this paper constructs the theoretical model of the realization mechanism of multi-agent participation value co-creation in crowdsourcing innovation from the three parties’ perspective. This research finds that value co-creation factors include six factors: task attributes, incentive mechanisms, trust mechanisms, the platform supports, participation motivation, and diversities.

However, studies on transfer effect of improving other untrained cognitive domains while p erforming the contents are insufficient. The present paper intended to collect literature published by PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science until December 2019 and analyze the trends of CCT and the transfer effect in each training area. Studies on CCT (82/891) have been increasing each year, and universities (60/82) in the United States (17/82) have published the most. In the literature that reported clinical effect (18/82), the cognitive domain mostly studied was memory (14/18), and the N-Back (3/14) method accounted for most of the training contents. Moreover, the contents that showed the highest degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality (BC) indices were the memory area, and video accounted for the highest among the intervention methods. In particular, the closeness centrality (CC) index of the memory and attention contents showed similar results. It can be interpreted that the possibility of the transfer effect occurring from memory and attention areas is the highest since the semantic distance (i.e. the similarity of the training process) between the attention contents and memory contents was the closest. The effectiveness of the actual transfer effect between the memory and attention should be verified.},

To improve the energy recovery rate of pure electric vehicles, a series regenerat ive braking control strategy based on PMSM fuzzy logic is proposed in this paper. According to this strategy, the motor braking shall be used as much as possible based on ensuring braking stability, 4 braking zones shall be divided according to the braking intensity, and different braking force distribution strategies shall be used, while comprehensively considering influencing factors such as vehicle speed, ECE regulations, battery, and motor characteristics. Simulink and Cruise are used for modeling and united simulation. The results show that the built model is accurate and reliable. The energy recovery rate can be improved effectively and the cruising range of pure electric vehicles can be extended based on proposed series regenerative braking control strategy.},

As both Vietnam and China are important member countries of this agreement, the close tra de cooperation that exists between Vietnam and China has important economic and political implications, and its development has been further improved by the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The vast majority of this trade is done through intermodal container transport, so efficient multimodal container transport has become necessary to enable cross-border trade. With the rapid development of China’s transportation infrastructure, Chongqing has become an emerging logistics hub in inland China. Hai Phong is the largest port city in Vietnam, and it has extensive multimodal transport infrastructure. In this paper, we scientifically evaluate the competing routes for the multimodal container transport supporting China-Vietnam trade, analyse eight transport routes from Chongqing to Hai Phong, and evaluate these routes with the Delphi and CFPR methods. This study can inform Chinese and Vietnamese trade enterprises in terms of selecting their preferred multimodal transport route strategies and the governmental authorities of both countries in making management decisions.},

The higher the sensitivity of prices is, the lower the fares and profits of the tourist railways service will realize. In addition, the initial scale of tourism demand of each region along the railway has a direct impact on whether to build a stop in the area. A larger demand scale will increase the possibility of the tourist-dedicated train stopping.

  abstract     = {The shared supply chain model has provided new ideas for solving contradictions between supply and demand for large-scale standardized production by manufacturers and personalized demands of consumers. On the basis of a platform network effect perspective, this study constructs an evolutionary game model of value co-creation behavior for a shared supply chain platform and manufacturers, analyzes their evolutionary stable strategies, and uses numerical simulation analysis to further verify the model. The results revealed that the boundary condition for manufacturers to participate in value co-creation on a shared supply chain platform is that the net production cost of the manufacturers’ participation in the platform value co-creation must be less than that of nonparticipation. In addition, the boundary condition for the shared supply chain platform to actively participate in value co-creation is that the cost of the shared supply chain platform for active participation in value co-creation must be less than that of passive participation. Moreover, value co-creation behavior on the shared supply chain platform is a dynamic game interaction process between players with different benefit perceptions. Finally, the costs and benefits generated by the network effect can affect value co-creation on shared supply chain platforms.},

  abstract     = {The customized products such as electromechanical prototype products are a type of product with research and trial manufacturing characteristics. The BOM structures and processing parameters of the products vary greatly, making it difficult for a single shop to meet such a wide range of processing parameters. For the dynamic and fuzzy manufacturing characteristics of the products, not only the coordinated transport time of multiple shops but also the fact that the product has a designated output shop should be considered. In order to solve such Multi-shop Integrated Scheduling Problem with Fixed Output Constraint (MISP-FOC), a constraint programming model is developed to minimize the total tardiness, and then a Multi-shop Integrated Scheduling Algorithm (MISA) based on EGA (Enhanced Genetic Algorithm) and B&amp;B (Branch and Bound) is proposed. MISA is a hybrid optimization method and consists of four parts. Firstly, to deal with the dynamic and fuzzy manufacturing characteristics, the dynamic production process is transformed into a series of time-continuous static scheduling problem according to the proposed dynamic rescheduling mechanism. Secondly, the pre-scheduling scheme is generated by the EGA at each event moment. Thirdly, the jobs in the pre-scheduling scheme are divided into three parts, namely, dispatched jobs, jobs to be dispatched, and jobs available for rescheduling, and at last, the B&amp;B method is used to optimize the jobs available for rescheduling by utilizing the period when the dispatched jobs are in execution. Google OR-Tools is used to verify the proposed constraint programming model, and the experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and feasible.},

It is found that the cross-border acquisitions taken by Chinese private enterprises have four kinds of acquisition ownership strategies leading to high acquisition performance under different internal and external conditions. This study points out that ownership strategy is a key decision affecting cross-border acquisition performance and provides a variety of paths leading to the same outcome rather than just finding the linear relationship between corporate activity and performance. This study supports the assumption of equivalence, and reveals a variety of scenarios in which cross-border acquisition ownership contributes to the outcome of high cross-border acquisition performance, and further confirms the view of causal asymmetry between condition and outcome. This study reveals whether the proportion of cross-border acquisition ownership affects cross-border acquisition performance and under what circumstances is conducive to the realization of expected cross-border acquisition performance.},

  abstract     = {In order to further improve vehicle ride performance, a dynamic monitoring feedback iteration control algorithm is proposed by combining the features of a variable-damping semi-active suspension system and applying them to the system. A seven-degree-of-freedom finished vehicle simulation model is b uilt based on MATLAB/Simulink. The root-mean-square values of the acceleration of the sprung mass, the dynamic travel of the suspension and the dynamic tire load are taken as evaluation indicators of vehicle ride performance. An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to determine the weighting coefficients of the evaluation indicators, and a genetic algorithm is utilized to determine the optimal damping of the suspension under various typical working conditions. Suspension damping is controlled with a dynamic monitoring feedback iteration algorithm. The correction coefficients of the control algorithm are determined according to the deviation between the obtained damping and the optimized damping so that the control parameters will agree with the optimal result under typical working conditions, and the control effect under other working conditions is verified. The simulation results indicate that the proposed dynamic monitoring feedback iteration control algorithm can effectively reduce the root-mean-square value of the acceleration of the sprung mass by 10.56% and the root-mean-square value of the acceleration of the dynamic travel of the suspension by 11.98% under mixed working conditions, thus improving vehicle ride performance. The study in this paper provides a new attempt for damping control of semi-active suspension and lays a theoretical foundation for its application in engineering.},

This paper proposes an adaptive matching resource allocation algorithm based on uncertain factors under mobile cloud computing environment. Uncertain factors of the mobile terminal are derived via QoS attribute, and then user information and load characteristics of the user requested resources are analyzed through CLIQUE similarity matching. Afterwards, based on the mapping between similarity and resources, resource paging allocation can be carried out based on adaptive matching resource allocation algorithm. From the perspective of consumers, dynamics of mobile terminals and uncertainty of paging scheduling in the mobile cloud resource environment under different user requested resources can be considered to allow minimized delay and optimized paging strategies.},

The network uses 2D Convolutional Neural Network (2DCNN) and Multi Spatial-Temporal scale 3D Convolutional Neural Network (MST_3DCNN) respectively to extract spatial information and motion information. Spatial information and motion information of the same time quantum receive 3D convolutional integration to generate the temporary Spatial-Temporal information of a certain moment. Then, the Spatial-Temporal information of multiple single moments enters Temporal Pyramid Net (TPN) to generate the local Spatial-Temporal information of multiple time scales. Finally, bidirectional recurrent neutral network is used to act on the Spatial-Temporal information of all parts so as to acquire the context information spanning the length of the entire video, which endows the network with video context information extraction capability. Through the experiments on the three video action recognitio common experimental data sets UCF101, UCF11, UCFSports, the Spatial-Temporal information deep fusion network proposed in this paper has a high correct recognition rate in the task of video action recognitio.},

To improve the accuracy of information security risk assessment in wireless sensor networks, we propose a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method based on Bayesian attack graphs.

  abstract     = {In this work, modified constant modulus algorithm based on bat algorithm is proposed for wireless sensor communications systems. The bat algorithm is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm, which mainly used to solve optimization problems. The proposed algorithm focused on modified constant mo dulus algorithm, which is also applicable to the constant modulus algorithm. The error function of blind equalization algorithm is used as the evaluation function of the bat algorithm, and then the initial value of the weight vector is calculated adaptively by the bat algorithm. Theoretical analysis is provided to illustrate that the proposed algorithm has a faster convergence speed than the original one and is suitable for almost all blind channel equalization algorithms. The simulation results support the newly proposed improved algorithm. The proposed algorithm could be applied to some more complex wireless channel environments to improve the reception performance of sensor communication systems.},

  abstract     = {In server clusters, the static scheduling algorithm has superior performance when the user visits are relatively stable. In the face of sudden increase in user traffic, the dynamic scheduling algorithm has a better load balancing effect than the static scheduling algorithm. However, in the face of complex network environments, the static scheduling algorithm cannot adjust the load according to the performance of the server in real time. The dynamic scheduling algorithm using a single weight to evaluate server performance is unreliable, and load scheduling with reference to the number of connections has uncertainty. In view of this problem, this paper proposes a cluster load balancing algorithm based on dynamic consistent hash based on the study of load balancing based on LVS clusters. By analyzing the performance and load parameters, we divide the request process into in-cycle and out-of-cycle. By setting up the LVS cluster system, the performance weights, load parameters, number of virtual nodes and cycles of the algorithm in this paper are determined experimentally. Finally, the response time and throughput of the algorithm in this paper are compared with the WRR algorithm and WLC algorithm. The results show that the time and throughput of this algorithm are better than WRR algorithm and WLC algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Mass of an object is an important characteristic for quality assessment. However, in some cases, it is hard to measure the mass of objects with instruments directly. In this paper, we proposed a novel method based on Fuzzy c-means (FCM) to measure the mass of an object by analyzing the deformation degree in a grid pattern. In the spatial field, thin plate spline (TPS) algorithm was adopted to calculate the minimum deformation bending energy in order to give a quantitative analysis of the weight; In frequency domain, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm was used to calculate the spectrum within a deformation frequency area before and after the change of grids, from which the relationship between weight and spectrum was investigated using FCM algorithm. Two different equations evaluated by the above two methods were proposed in order to calculate the mass of an object. Both of them showed a high level of explanatory power of R2 (R2 = 0.9833 and R2 = 0.9698, respectively). The equations were then used to determine the estimated mass. Estimated and measured values were plotted against each other. A high correlation (R2 = 0.9833 and R2 = 0.9698, respectively) was found between actual and calculated mass. Finally, Bland-Altman plot was introduced to access the agreement of the calculated mass and the actual mass. The average bias was –54.408 g and –0.007 g for spatial domain method and frequency domain method, respectively. Theoretical analysis and experiments were performed to verify the effectiveness of our approaches.},

Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is unavoidable in the Internet of things. However, at the same time, there are more attacks against the M2M system. Therefore, a reliable and secure authentication mechanism is required. Blockchain technology is decentralized and highly secure while being tamper-proof. This protects M2M service providers by eliminating the single point of failures. This paper proposes a blockchain-based authentication scheme that uses a practical Byzantine fault tolerance (pBFT) consensus mechanism for M2M security in cyber physical systems. By implementing a blockchain to an M2M system, it provides an ID for devices on the blockchain. Simulation results have shown that the data on the chain cannot be altered. A pBFT consensus algorithm also ensures that the blockchain network is able to come to a consensus with faults.},

The inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism properties of object-oriented l anguage can improve the reusability, scalability and interoperability of software while increasing the difficulty of testing OOS. Researchers have proposed a variety of testing methods to test OOS among which random testing (RT) has been widely used due to its simplicity and ease of use. An OMISS-ARTsum algorithm is proposed in this paper that uses improved OMISS random test FSCS-ART with max-sum standard, which is an implementation version of fixed-sized-candidate-set ART. The OMISS-ARTsum algorithm calculates the total distance between a candidate test case and the executed test case set before the next test case is selected from the set of candidate test cases. Unlike the traditional max-sum based FSCS-ART algorithm, OMISS-ARTsum does not calculate the distance between each executed test case and the candidate case and then sum up the total distance, but uses the method of summing up all the executed test cases and the candidate cases. The information of executing test cases is saved as a whole and the distance between the executed test case set and candidate cases is calculated at the same time. Experiment shows that compared to the OMISS-ART algorithm, the proposed OMISS-ARTsum algorithm can reduce the time overhead.},

Gradually e-bike riders have become more important commuters in China, however, the influence of FG or GC on them is not clear yet and need pay more attention to it. This study chooses two almost identical intersections to obtain highly accurate trajectory data of e-bike riders to study their decision-making behaviors under FG or GC. The e-bike riders’ behavior is classified into four categories and is to identify their stop-pass decision points using the acceleration trend. Two binary-logit models were built to predict the stop–pass decision behaviors for the different e-bike rider groups, explaining that the potential time to the stop-line is the dominant independent factor of the different behaviors of GC and FG. Furthermore empirical analysis of decision points indicated that GC provides the earlier stop-pass decision point and longer decision making duration on the one side while results in more complexity of decision making and greater risk of stop-line crossing than FG on the other side.},

In order to obtain accurate 3D obstacle information, this paper proposes an algorithm for fusing 2D lidar and binocular vision to complete the obstacle location. In this paper, the depth value of the 2D lidar point cloud is used as a benchmark. By fitting the error equation of the binocular camera point cloud depth value, the depth value of the camera point cloud is modified to obtain an accurate 3D camera point cloud, thereby obtaining an accurate 3D obstacle information. Many experiments have proved that the fusion algorithm of 2D lidar and binocular vision can obtain accurate 3D obstacle information. The method of fusion 2D lidar and binocular vision can approximately achieve the measurement effect of 3D lidar, and the point cloud of obstacles is relatively dense, so the accurate 3D obstacle information can be obtained. This method can reduce the influence of single sensor on the robot locating obstacles, thus completing the accurate locating of obstacles, which is of certain significance to robot navigation.},

  abstract     = {The artificial potential field method is usually applied to the path planning problem of driverless cars or mobile robots. For example, it has been applied for the obstacle avoidance problem of intelligent cars and the autonomous navigation system of storage robots. However, there have been few stu dies on its application to intelligent bridge cranes. The artificial potential field method has the advantages of being a simple algorithm with short operation times. However, it is also prone to problems of unreachable targets and local minima. Based on the analysis of the operating characteristics of bridge cranes, a two-dimensional intelligent running environment model of a bridge crane was constructed in MATLAB. According to the basic theory of the artificial potential field method, the double-layer artificial potential field method was deduced, and the path and track fuzzy processing method was proposed. These two methods were implemented in MATLAB simulations. The results showed that the improved artificial potential field method could avoid static obstacles efficiently.},

The experimental results showed that the point cloud classification based on the optimized random forest algorithm in this paper achieved a total classification accuracy of 94.15% in dataset 1 acquired by lidar, the overall accuracy of classification on dataset 2 obtained by dense matching reaches 92.03%, both were higher than the unoptimized random forest algorithm and MRF, SVM point cloud classification method, and dimensionality reduction through feature optimization can greatly improve the efficiency of the algorithm.},

The reason is that the driver parameters of the robot cannot properly match the walking gait algorithm, and the insufficient performance of the robot driver leads to the poor motion capability of the robot. In this paper, the optimization design process of biped robot parameters is studied and expounded, and its motion capability is improved by optimizing the driving parameters of the robot. Firstly, the contradiction between walking speed, stability and driver performance of biped robot is analysed. The performance evaluation functions of the three are further established, and the optimal parameter design to a certain extent is realized based on the multi-objective optimization method. Finally, combining with the physical simulation engine, the design parameters are simulated and checked, and the robot design process is completed through the guidance of simulation results.},

This paper proposes temporal knowledge graph link prediction model based on deep learning. This model selects the TransR transformation model suitable for big data and makes entity projection in relation space containing different semantic meanings, so as to vector the entities and complex semantic relations in graph. Then it adopts LSTM recursive neural network and adds the top-bottom relational information of the graph for sequential learning. Finally it constantly carries out deep learning through incremental calculation and LSTM recursive network to improve the accuracy of prediction. The incremental LSTM model highlights the hidden semantic and clinical temporal information and effectively utilizes sequential learning to mining forward-backward dependent information. It compensates the deficiency of lower prediction accuracy on timely knowledge graph caused by the traditional link prediction models. Finally, it is proved that the new model has better performance over temporal knowledge graph link prediction.},

  abstract     = {Multi-robot systems have many potential applications; however, the available results for coordination were based on qualitative information. Fuzzy logic reasoning has a feature of human being thinking, so a novel coordinated algorithm is proposed. The algorithm utilizes sharing sensing information of rooms and semantic robots to coordinating robots in a structured environment exploration. The approach divides all teammate robots into two classes according to robot exploration performance, and divides rooms into large, medium and small ones according to estimations of the individual areas. On the purpose of minimizing exploration time of the system, the reasoning coordination assigns large room to good performance robot, and vice versa. A parameter update law is introduced for fuzzy membership functions. Finally, the results are validated by computer simulations for a structured environment.},

Choices being made by the consumer that should maximize her subjective utility are decisions studied by revealed preference th eory. A finite number of possible alternatives is considered. They are mutually exclusive propositions identifying all quantitative states of nature of a consumption plan. Each proposition of it is expressed by a real number. This research work distinguishes it from its temporary truth value depending on the state of information and knowledge of the consumer. Since each point of the consumption space of the consumer belongs to a two-dimensional convex set, this article focuses on conjoint distributions of mass. Indeed, the consumption space of the consumer is generated by all coherent summaries of a conjoint distribution of mass. Each point of her consumption space is connected with a weighted average of states of nature of two consumption plans jointly studied. They give rise to a conjoint distribution of mass. The consumer chooses a point of a two-dimensional convex set representing that bundle of goods actually demanded by her inside of her consumption space. This paper innovatively shows that it is nothing but a bilinear and disaggregate measure. It is decomposed into two real numbers, where each real number is a linear measure. In this paper, different measures are obtained. They can be disaggregate or aggregate measures, where the latter are independent of the notion of ordered pair of consumption plans.},

  abstract     = {Uniform Resource Location (URL) is the network unified resource location system that specifies the location and access method of resources on the Internet. At present, malicious URL has become one of the main means of network attack. How to detect malicious URL timely and accurately has become an e ngaging research topic. The recent proposed deep learning-based detection models can achieve high accuracy in simulations, but several problems are exposed when they are used in real applications. These models need a balanced labeled dataset for training, while collecting large numbers of the latest labeled URL samples is difficult due to the rapid generation of URL in the real application environment. In addition, in most randomly collected datasets, the number of benign URL samples and malicious URL samples is extremely unbalanced, as malicious URL samples are often rare. This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning malicious URL detection method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) to solve the above two problems. By utilizing the unlabeled URLs for model training in a semi-supervised way, the requirement of large numbers of labeled samples is weakened. And the imbalance problem can be relieved with the synthetic malicious URL generated by adversarial learning. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the classic SVM and LSTM based methods. Specially, the proposed method can obtain high accuracy with insufficient labeled samples and unbalanced dataset. e.g., the proposed method can achieve 87.8% /91.9% detection accuracy when the number of labeled samples is reduced to 20% /40% of that of conventional methods.},

In the midst of numerous alternative energy resources, solar energy is widely used as it persists in large volumes with varying specification ratings. It is suited for both stand-alone and grid-co upled application. The Maximum Power Tracking (MPPT) scheme has a profound effect on the operating efficiency of a Photovoltaic (PV) power plant. This paper proposes an inventive hybridized Human Psychology Optimization-Perturb and Observation (HPO-PO) MPPT approach for obtaining the optimal duty cycle of the boost converter to harvest global maxima from a grid-connected Total Cost Tied (TCT) configured PV array of 4080 W. The suggested method provides enriched performance both in steady-state, as well as in rapid and randomly changing weather conditions. Comparison studies of various MPPT procedures, including Perturbation and Observation (PO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and Human Psychology Optimization (HPO) in MATLAB environment, illustrate the usefulness of the evoked system in meeting its goals. The suggested MPPT procedure has offered enhanced activities in terms of voltage quality, maximum power tracking capability, and converter efficiency compared to other methods. The recommended hybridized MPPT approach is experimentally validated on a hardware set-up using a 16-bit dsPIC30F2010 Digital Signal Controller in enhancing the behavior of the grid-connected PV system.},

In reality, the strong Lipschitz condition is so strictly and hardly applied to judge the stability in measure for UDDEs. For the sake of solving the above issue, the stability in measure based on new Lipschitz condition as a larger scale of applications is verified in this paper. In other words, if it satisfies the strong Lipschitz condition, it must satisfy the new Lipschitz conditions. Conversely, it may not be established. An example is provided to show that it is stable in measure based on the new Lipschitz conditions, but it becomes invalid based on the strong Lipschitz condition.

Most of the initial research is to manually extract features and use classifiers such as support vector machines to score images. With the development of deep learning, traditional manual feature extraction methods are gradually replaced by convolutional neural networks to extract more comprehensive features. However, it is a huge challenge to artificially design an aesthetic neural network. Recently, Neural Architecture Search has upsurged to find suitable neural networks for many tasks in deep learning. In this paper, we first attempt to combine Neural Architecture Search with computational aesthetics. We design and apply a customized progressive differentiable architecture search strategy to obtain a light-weighted and efficient aesthetic baseline model. In addition, we simulate the multi-person rating mechanism by outputting the distribution of the aesthetic value of the image, replacing the previous classification scheme of judging the beauty and unbeauty of the image by the threshold value, and propose a self-weighted Earth Mover’s Distance loss to better fit human subjective scoring. Based on the baseline model, we further introduce several strategies including an attention mechanism, the dilated convolution, and adaptive pooling, to enhance the performance. Finally, we design several groups of comparative experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our baseline aesthetic model and the introduced improvement strategies.},

  abstract     = {Binarization is the most important stage in historical document image processing. Efficient working of character and word recognition algorithms depend on effective segmentation methods. Segmentation algorithms in turn depend on images free of noises and degradations. Most of these historical docum ents are illegible with degradations like bleeding through degradation, faded ink or faint characters, uneven illumination, contrast variation, etc. For effective processing of these document images, efficient binarization algorithms should be devised. Here a simple modified version of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed for historical document binarization. AOD-Net architecture for generating dehazed images from hazed images is modified to create the proposed network.The new CNN model is created by incorporating Difference of Concatenation layer (DOC), Enhancement layer (EN) and Thresholding layer into AOD-Net to make it suitable for binarization of highly degraded document images. The DOC layer and EN layer work effectively in solving degradation that exists in the form of low pass noises. The complexity of working of the proposed model is reduced by decreasing the number of layers and by introducing filters in convolution layers that work with low inter-pixel dependency. This modified version of CNN works effectively with a variety of highly degraded documents when tested with the benchmark historical datasets. The main highlight of the proposed network is that it works efficiently in a generalized manner for any type of document images without further parameter tuning. Another important highlight of this method is that it can handle most of the degradation categories present in document images. In this work, the performance of the proposed model is compared with Otsu, Sauvola, and three recent Deep Learning-based models.},

Since the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) has the characteristics of fast convergence speed and a few adjustment parameters, WOA is applied to optimize the parameters in the objective function of WNPSVR. Compared with traditional prediction models, WNPSVR-WOA is not easy to fall into local minimum values and is insensitive to noise. Thus, the prediction and control of molten steel end-point information are more accurate. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model. Within different error bounds (0.005 wt.% for carbon content model and 10°C for temperature model), the hit rates of carbon content and temperature are 89% and 95%, respectively. Meanwhile, a double hit rate of 85% is achieved. The above results conclude that our WNPSVR-WOA has important reference value for actual BOF application and can improve the steel product quality. Moreover, WNPSVR-WOA can also be used to other fields.},

  abstract     = {As a spontaneous facial expression, micro-expression reveals the psychological responses of human beings. However, micro-expression recognition (MER) is highly susceptible to noise interference due to the short existing time and low-intensity of facial actions. Research on facial action coding syst ems explores the correlation between emotional states and facial actions, which provides more discriminative features. Therefore, based on the exploration of correlation information, the goal of our work is to propose a spatiotemporal network that is robust to low-intensity muscle movements for the MER task. Firstly, a multi-scale weighted module is proposed to encode the spatial global context, which is obtained by merging features of different resolutions preserved from the backbone network. Secondly, we propose a multi-task-based facial action learning module using the constraints of the correlation between muscle movement and micro-expressions to encode local action features. Besides, a clustering constraint term is introduced to restrict the feature distribution of similar actions to improve categories’ separability in feature space. Finally, the global context and local action features are stacked as high-quality spatial descriptions to predict micro-expressions by passing through the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network. The proposed method is proved to outperform other mainstream methods through comparative experiments on the SMIC, CASME-I, and CASME-II datasets.},

  abstract     = {Smart farming is one of the immense applications of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Still, most of the researches have been focusing on precision agriculture using WSNs. In general, the nodes within the wireless sensor systems are self-configured. Based on the application requirement, gadgets withi n the region of interest collect data, prepare it, and send it to the recipient. The biggest impediments to these sensor systems are collision, restricted battery, and transmission capacity. Due to these characteristics, the node battery depletes earlier, when it starts working. Currently, agriculture depends on rain due to the lack of water resources and irrigation services. The crop development depends totally on the factors of water, the climatic conditions of the soil, etc. In large-scale agriculture, it is exceptionally problematic to analyze all the parameters accurately throughout the growing field. In this article, high-precision architecture for large-scale agriculture has been proposed. An IoT (Internet of Things) enabled WSN has been built and installed in the respective areas to measure the physical quantities regularly. In addition, Lévy-Walk Bat (LWBA) algorithm has been proposed to optimize the collected data. The prediction accuracy of the collected data is evaluated by LWBA and then, it is compared with the existing optimization algorithms with different error solvers. It has provided the exact information regarding the whole landscape and it will help the farmers to irrigate precisely.},

One major drawback of IT2FLSs is the high computational cost of the iterative Karnik-Mendel (KM) algorithms in type-reduction (TR). From the practical point of view, this prevents us ing IT2FLS in real-world applications. To address this issue, a novel non-iterative method called Moradi-Zirkohi-Lin (MZL) TR method is proposed for computing the centroid of an IT2FLS. This makes the practical implementation of the IT2FLSs simpler. Comparative simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the KM TR method in terms of computational burden. Besides, closer results, in terms of accuracy, to the KM TR method among the existing non-iterative TR methods are also achieved by the proposed TR method.},

A FPIS ove rcomes the shortcoming that rough set theory assumes elements in the universe with equal probability and leads to lose some useful information. This paper integrates the probability distribution into the fuzzy relations in a FPIS and studies its reduction. Firstly, the concept of a FPIS is introduced and its reduction is proposed. Then, the fuzzy relations in a FPIS are divided into three categories (P-necessary, P-relatively necessary and P-unnecessary fuzzy relations) according to their importance. Next, entropy measurement for a FPIS is investigated. Moreover, some reduction algorithms are constructed. Finally, an example is given to verify the effectiveness of these proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In the increasingly competitive logistics industry, much more emphasis has been put on customer satisfaction by firms to distinguish themselves from their competitors. Motivated by the practices, the consistent vehicle routing problem (ConVRP) incorporates service consistency into the vehicle routi ng problem to improve customer satisfaction. However, the majority of the existing research considers the ConVRP in a deterministic environment while the uncertainties are not fully studied. Therefore, this paper solves the consistent vehicle routing problem under uncertain environment (UnConVRP) taking into account uncertain customer demands, travel times, and service times. Over a multi-day planning horizon, customers may have multi-day or single-day service requirements. The same driver is assigned to each customer almost at the same time each day when customers require service. The objective is to design the routes for vehicles over the planning horizon under uncertain environment while maintaining service consistency. Two uncertain programming models are established based on different decision criteria and the crisp equivalents are proposed using uncertainty theory. An efficient template-based solution framework is designed to solve the models where the artificial bee colony algorithm is embedded. Initially, the template route is constructed to guarantee the service consistency of frequent customers. Then the final daily routes can be derived from the template route. Finally, numerical experiments are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Several experimental tests are performed over both convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) using a 10-fold cross-validation process to check system effectiveness. In CNN, 1-D Convolutional layer is employed for the processing of EEG signals. In RNN, LSTM and GRU are used to check system accuracy. For performance measure various metrices were considered such as accuracy, precision, recall and kappa score. Acquired results suggest that gated recurrent unit (GRU) outperforms other models in terms of accuracy and complexity both. GRU model has 91.2% accuracy and has three layers only, which reduces the model’s complexity. The training cost is also decreasing due to the low complexity of the model.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript proposes a new data hiding approach that is used in watermark applications in video by transforming the RGB model to HSV model. This method initially estimates the number of frames needed to embed the data (watermark). Then two sets of RGB (Red, Green, Blue) coefficients (R1, G1, B1 ), (R2, G2, B2) are converted to HSV (Hue, saturation, values) Coefficients (H1, S1, V1) and (H2, S2, V2). The ‘Value’ Coefficients V1 and V2 are used to embed the watermark, since there exists a strong correlation between the adjacent ‘Value’ Coefficients. The same process is repeated on adjacent HSV coefficients till the watermark is fully embedded. After embedding the data HSV coefficients are again converted back to RGB coefficients. During the extraction phase, the data is extracted by transforming the RGB coefficient to HSV coefficients. One bit of information can be extracted from two adjacent HSV coefficients. Experimental outcomes show that the proposed watermarking approach is efficiently against attacks, viz noise, filtering, etc. Also, the proposed method performs better than traditional watermarking methods with the help of embedding rate (bpp), Structural similarity index measurement (SSIM), Visual quality (PSNR), Normalized cross-correlation (NC).},

For proper prediction, an effective model should be produced according to field data that can predict damage degree of local buildings.

Effective parameters of this model as an input data of model consist of height and age of the building, shear wave velocity of soil, plan equivalent moment of inertia, fault distance, earthquake acceleration, the number of residents, the width of the street for 527 buildings in the city. The output parameter of the model, which was the damage degree of the buildings, was also classified as five groups of no damage, slight damage, moderate damage, extensive damage, and complete damage. The ranges of input and output classification were obtained based on the supervised center classification (SCC-FCM) method in accordance with field data.},

  abstract     = {Failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) is a proactive quality tool that allows the identification and prevention of the potential failure modes of a process or product. In a conventional FMECA, for each failure mode, three risk parameters, namely frequency, non-detection, and sever ity are evaluated and a risk priority number (RPN) is calculated by multiplying these parameters to assess one signal criticality. However, in many cases, it suffers from some shortcomings regarding the decision-making and the situation where the information provided is ambiguous or uncertain. This paper describes a new fuzzy multi-criticality approach for improving the use of FMECA by treating FMECA as a fuzzy multi-criteria optimization model. The new approach bases on replacing the calculation of a single criticality with a fuzzy inference system for improving the criticality evaluations which offers five partial criticalities that efficiently and separately calculate the impact of a failure on the environment, personnel, production, equipment, and management. In addition, an analytical hierarchy method (AHP) is used to calculate the priorities weights for each partial criticality and construct a criticality matrix in order to improve the relevance of decision-making. Furthermore, a real case of LPG storage system for ZCINA Hassi Messaoud in Algeria is provided to illustrate the practical implementation of the suggested approach and extremely shows the pertinence of the suggested fuzzy model as decision-making tools in preventing industrial risks with providing encouraging results regarding the criticality estimation and improve decision-making by prioritizing “preventive –corrective actions” and determine the efficient action for each partial criticality to control the risk effectively.},

  abstract     = {Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is difficult to deploy to mobile and portable devices due to its large number of parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs). To tackle this problem, we propose a novel channel pruning method. We use the modified squeeze-and-excitation blocks (MSEB) to m easure the importance of the channels in the convolutional layers. The unimportant channels, including convolutional kernels related to them, are pruned directly, which greatly reduces the storage cost and the number of calculations. For ResNet with basic blocks, we propose an approach to consistently prune all residual blocks in the same stage to ensure that the compact network structure is dimensionally correct. After pruning we retrain the compact network from scratch to restore the accuracy. Finally, we verify our method on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ILSVRC-2012. The results indicate that the performance of the compact network is better than the original network when the pruning rate is small. Even when the pruning amplitude is large, the accuracy can also be maintained or decreased slightly. On the CIFAR-100, when reducing the parameters and FLOPs up to 82% and 62% respectively, the accuracy of VGG-19 even improve by 0.54% after retraining.

According to the system principle and fault mechanisms, the fault tree of the retraction system was first established. The u ncertainties of the bottom events were then described using the universal grey number to obtain the universal grey representation of the system failure probability. And compared with the traditional interval operation, the results show that universal grey operation can solve the problem of interval expansion with uncertainty. Importance analyses of the bottom events were then conducted based on the probability importance and the key importance. By comparing the two important indices of the bottom events, the larger the value is, the higher the importance is. It was found that the occurrence of the bottom events “pipeline oil leakage,” “pump motor damage,” and “oil pollution” had the greatest impact on system failure probability, thus determining the key weak links affecting system failure and indicating the most effective targets for improvement.},

Aggregation of expert’s judgement becomes utmost important before solving such competitive situations. Considering this the present paper proposes a method to solve intuitionistic fuzzy game problems by using aggregation operators on payoff judgments of more than one expert. The proposed method significantly adds to the existing literature by overcoming the limitation of Li’s existing method that considers only one expert’s opinion for solving intuitionistic fuzzy game problems.

However, with the expectation of memory overhead and response time, along with th e increasing scale of data, DCNN faces three non-rival challenges in a big data environment: excessive network parameters, slow convergence, and inefficient parallelism. To tackle these three problems, this paper develops a deep convolutional neural networks optimization algorithm (PDCNNO) in the MapReduce framework. The proposed method first pruned the network to obtain a compressed network in order to effectively reduce redundant parameters. Next, a conjugate gradient method based on modified secant equation (CGMSE) is developed in the Map phase to further accelerate the convergence of the network. Finally, a load balancing strategy based on regulate load rate (LBRLA) is proposed in the Reduce phase to quickly achieve equal grouping of data and thus improving the parallel performance of the system. We compared the PDCNNO algorithm with other algorithms on three datasets, including SVHN, EMNIST Digits, and ISLVRC2012. The experimental results show that our algorithm not only reduces the space and time overhead of network training but also obtains a well-performing speed-up ratio in a big data environment.},

The purpose of the model is to integrate physical and material dimensions to maximize net corporate profits through inbound and outbound financial flows; it involves payment mechanisms between the financial and physical flows through maximizing the cash flows of manufacturing sites and suppliers, as two conflicting objectives that must consider the reciprocal effects of their decisions. These objectives are calculated by subtracting costs from the revenue; this process, of course, will ultimately result in an optimization of the organization’s financial flow. To solve the proposed mathematical model, the study relies on two algorithms, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Imperialist Competition Algorithm (ICA). The sample under investigation is solved separately using the three algorithms, and results are then compared. The observations of the study reveal the better performance of PSO.},

In recent years, machine learning methods have been widely used as prediction models to identify malicious web domains. In this study, we propose a Fuzzy-Weighted Least Squares Support Vector Machine (FW-LS-SVM) model for malicious web domain identification. In our proposed model, a fuzzy-weighted operation is applied to each data sample considering the fact that different samples may have different importance. This fuzzy-weighted operation is also able to alleviate the influence of noise data and improve the model’s robustness by assigning weights to error constraints. For comparison purposes, three commonly used single machine learning classifiers and three widely used ensemble models are included in our experiments, in order to assess the performance of our proposed FW-LS-SVM and its ensemble version. Hyperlink indicators and uniform resource locator-based features are used to train the prediction models. Experimental results show that our proposed approach is highly effective in identifying malicious web domains, outperforming the well-established single and ensemble models being compared.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid energy storage system supplies a feasible solution to battery peak current reduction by introducing supercapacitor as auxiliary energy source. Energy management control strategy is a key technology for guaranteeing performance. In this paper, we describe a predictive energy management strate gy for battery and supercapacitor hybrid energy storage systems of pure electric vehicles. To utilize the supercapacitor reasonably, Markov chain model is proposed to predict the future load power during a driving cycle. The predictive results are subsequently used by power distribution strategy, which is designed using a low-pass filter and a fuzzy logic controller. The strategy model is developed under MATLAB/Simulink software environment. To validate the performance of the proposed control strategy, a comparison test is implemented based on a 72 V rated voltage hybrid energy storage system experimental platform. The results indicate that the battery peak currents by proposed predictive control strategy are reduced by 26.32%, 28.21% and 27.12% under the UDDS, SC03 and NEDC three driving cycles respectively.},

Therefore, to remedy this limitation, this paper reports a n extended risk prioritization approach by integrating the MULTIMOORA approach, Z-numbers and power weighted average (PWA) operator. Firstly, the Z-numbers with triangular fuzzy numbers are applied to reflect the self-confidence and uncertainty of expert’s judgment. Next, the PWA operator for Z-numbers (Z-PWA) with similarity measure is proposed to obtain the group risk evaluation matrix by considering the influence of the deviation among risk evaluation information. Then, an extended version of MULTIMOORA method with developed entropy method is presented to calculate risk priority ranking order of each failure. Finally, the equipment failures in a certain oil and gas plant is utilized to test the extended risk prioritization approach for FMEA model. After that, the sensitivity and comparison studies are led to illustrate the availability and reliability of the proposed risk prioritization approach for FMEA based risk analysis problem.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Ad hock Networks (MANETs) are currently used for developing the privacy and accuracy of modern networks. Furthermore, MANET applications are fit to be data-oriented systems, that introduce a secure and more robust data transmission protocol making it a topmost priority in the design. The lac k of infrastructure in the existence of dynamic topology as well as limited resources of MANET is a major challenge facing those interested in the field. Further, the nonexistence of a formerly authorized trust relationship within the connected nodes produces instability of the detection process in MANETs. Basically, by adding adapted LEACH routing protocol to MANET, enhancement of the preserved nodes vitality will be achieved, moreover, the load balancing with data loss reduction provides MANET ability to tracks along with shortest and limited paths. This paper proposes a newly developed detection scheme for both active and passive black-hole attacks in MANETs. Moreover, the scheme deals with assessing a group of selected features for each node-based AdaBoost-SVM algorithm. These features are collected from cluster members nodes based on Ad hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (OMDV) with LEACH routing protocol clustering approaches. Although SVM is considered a more stable classifier, there are great influences of the AdaBoost weight adaption algorithm to enhance the classification process in terms of strengthening the weights of extracted features. This hybrid algorithm is essential for active black-hole attacks as well as for identifying passive black-hole attacks in MANET. The proposed scheme is tested against the effect of mobility variation to determine the accuracy of the detection process including the routing overhead protocol. The experimental results investigated that the accuracy of detecting both active and passive black-holes attacks in MANET reached 97% with a promising time complexity for different mobility conditions. Moreover, the proposed scheme provides an accurate decision about malicious vs benign node dropping behavior using an adjustable threshold value.},

  abstract     = {A new integrated modelling architecture based on the concept of the fuzzy logic is presented to represent the turning process. Such an architecture consists of two stages. In the first stage, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) having various topologies are employed to extract rule bases using perhaps limit ed amount of sparse data. In the second stage, the fuzzy rules extracted are assessed and integrated using the singular value decomposition-QR factorization (SVD-QR) paradigm in order to minimize the computational efforts. Such a step leads to reducing the number of fuzzy rules and results in a reduced FLS model. Such a reduced model is then employed to represent the turning process and predict both the cutting force and the surface roughness. In addition, it provides a comprehensive understanding of the turning process presented linguistically in the form of If/Then rules. The proposed structure has been validated using a set of laboratory experiments. It has been noticed that it can predict both the cutting force and the surface roughness successfully. In addition, such an integrated architecture outperforms the artificial neural network, the well-known FLS, the radial basis functions and the multilinear regression model, where the overall improvement is of approximately 19%, 13%, 14% and 270%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The uncapacitated transportation problem (UTP) deals with minimizing the transportation costs related to the delivery of a homogeneous product from multi-suppliers to multi-consumers. The application of the UTP can be extended to other areas of operations research, including inventory control, pers onnel assignment, signature matching, product distribution with uncertainty, multi-period production and inventory planning, employment scheduling, and cash management. Such a UTP with interval-defined demands and suppliers capacities (UTPIDS) is investigated in this paper. In UTPIDS, the demands and suppliers capacities may not be known exactly but vary within an interval due to variation in the economic conditions of the global economy. Following the variation, the minimal total cost of the transportation can also be varied within an interval and thus, the cost bounds can be obtained. Here, although the lower bound solution can be attained methodologically, the correct estimation of the worst case realization (the exact upper bound) on the minimal total transportation cost of the UTPIDS is an NP-hard problem. So, the decision-makers seek for minimizing the transportation costs and they are interested in the estimation of the worst case realization on these minimal costs for better decision making especially, for proper investment and return. In literature very few approaches are available to find this estimation of the worst case realization with some shortcomings. First, we demonstrate that the available heuristic methods fail to obtain the correct estimation of the worst case realization always. In this situation, development of a better heuristic method to find the better near optimal estimation of the worst case realization on the minimal total costs of the UTPIDS is desirable. Then this paper provides a new polynomial time algorithm that runs in O (N2) time (N, higher of the numbers of source and destination nodes) for better estimation. A comparative assessment on solutions of available benchmark instances, some randomly generated numerical example problems and a real-world application shows promising performance of the current technique. So, our new finding would definitely be benefited to practitioners, academics and decision makers who deal with such type of decision making instances.},

Furthermore, we show that the set Iα (M) of all α-ideals on a linear MTL-algebra M only contains two trivial α-ideals {0} and M. However, the authors [24] studied the structure of Iα (M) in a linear BL-algebra M, which means some results with respect to Iα (M) given in [24] are trivial.

T he key step is to compute the footprint of uncertainty of the IT2FS. To this aim, the upper membership function is computed by aggregating the membership functions of the linguistic terms contained in the PLTS, and the lower membership function is obtained by moving the upper membership function downward with the step being total entropy of the PLTS. The comparison rules, some operations, and an aggregation operator for PLTSs are introduced.

It is a crucial procedure to obtain the prioritization of technical characteristics for the products or services in QFD. Tr aditional QFDs are often implemented by a small number of QFD members. However, with the increasing complexity of product and service design, QFD requires the participation of more QFD members from dispersed departments or institutions. Additionally, the evaluation information given by QFD members may widely differ due to their different knowledge and background. Furthermore, the psychological behaviours of QFD members also greatly influence the final prioritization of technical characteristics. Hence, this paper proposes a novel QFD framework to prioritize technical characteristics using a consensus-reaching process and prospect theory when large numbers of QFD members are involved. In the large-scale QFD framework, prospect theory is generally utilized to depict the psychological behaviours of QFD members. Then, QFD members are divided into several clusters. Eventually, a consensus-reaching process is established to assist QFD members in reaching a consensus. To verify the practicability of the presented framework, this paper applies it to the evaluation of contingency plan to determine the critical measures.},

Furthermore, we construct a hierarchical structured-attention-based model (HSA) for Indonesian NER to extract sequence features from different perspectives. Specifically, we use an enhanced convolutional structure as well as an enhanced attention structure to extract deeper features from characters and tokens. Experimental results show that HSA establishes competitive performance on IDNER and three benchmark datasets.},

Based on the above limitations, on the one hand, the multiple background risks are defined by linear weighting of different backgr ound asset risks in this paper; on the other hand, the total nine kinds of mental accounts are comprehensively considered. Especially, the risk curve is regarded as the risk measurement of different mental accounts for the first time. Under the framework of uncertainty theory, a novel mean-entropy portfolio model with risk curve and total mental accounts under multiple background risks is constructed. In addition, transaction fees, chance constraint, upper and lower limits and initial wealth constraints are also considered in our proposed model. In theory, the equivalent forms of the models with different uncertainty distributions (general, normal and zigzag) are presented by three theorems. Simultaneously, the corresponding concrete expressions of risk curves are obtained by another three theorems. In practice, two numerical examples verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed model. Finally, we can obtain the following unique and meaningful findings: (1) investors will underestimate the potential risk if they ignore the existence of multiple background risks; (2) with the increase of the return threshold, the return of the sub-portfolio will inevitably increase, but investors also bear the risk that the risk curve is higher than the confidence curve at this time.},

In literature many theories and fuzzy sets (FS) are presented for the evaluation of these dec ision tasks, but most of these theories and fuzzy sets have failed to explain the uncertainty and vagueness in the decision making issues. Therefore, we use complex intuitionistic fuzzy set (CIFS) instead of fuzzy set and intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS). A new type of aggregation operation is also developed by the use of complex intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (CIFNs), their accuracy and the score functions are also discussed in detail. Moreover, we utilized the Maclaurin symmetric mean (MSM) operator, which have the ability to capture the relationship among multi-input arguments, as a result, CIF Maclarurin symmetric mean (CIFMSM) operator and CIF dual Maclaurin symmetric mean (CIFDMSM) operator are presented and their characteristics are discussed in detail. On the basis of these operators, a MAGDM method is presented for the solution of group decision making problems. Finally, the validation of the propounded approach is proved by evaluating a numerical example, and by the comparison with the previously researched results.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new approach to build the rule-base on Neo-Fuzzy-Neuron (NFN) Networks. The NFN is a Neuro-Fuzzy network composed by a set of n decoupled zero-order Takagi-Sugeno models, one for each input variable, each one containing m rules. Employing Multi-Gene Genetic Programming (MG-G P) to create and adjust Gaussian membership functions and a Gradient-based method to update the network parameters, the proposed model is dubbed NFN-MG-GP. In the proposed model, each individual of MG-GP represents a complete rule-base of NFN. The rule-base is adjusted by genetic operators (Crossover, Reproduction, Mutation), and the consequent parameters are updated by a predetermined number of Gradient method epochs, every generation. The algorithm uses Elitism to ensure that the best rule-base is not lost between generations. The performance of the NFN-MG-GP is evaluated using instances of time series forecasting and non-linear system identification problems. Computational experiments and comparisons against state-of-the-art alternative models show that the proposed algorithms are efficient and competitive. Furthermore, experimental results show that it is possible to obtain models with good accuracy applying Multi-Gene Genetic Programming to construct the rule-base on NFN Networks.},

  abstract     = {It is impossible for agents on both sides to achieve complete rationality in the decision-making process of two-sided matching (TSM). The TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multi-criteria decision-making) method considering the psychological behavior of decision-makers is well appli ed in the multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems. The TSM is a MCDM problem. Therefore, in this paper, a method based on TODIM technique is introduced to solve the TSM problem, in which the intuitionistic linguistic numbers are utilized to describe the mutual evaluation between candidates and hiring managers. The focus of this paper is to develop a method for the multi-criteria TSM problem under intuitionistic linguistic environment. First, the evaluation matrices of each agent with respect to each criterion are provided by agents on the opposite side, and the weight assigned to each criterion is determined according to the importance of the evaluation criterion to the matching agent. Then, the dominance measurement of each agent over another one can be calculated based on the intuitionistic linguistic TODIM method. Next, a bi-objective optimization model which aims to maximize the overall satisfaction degree of agents on both sides is constructed to attain the optimal matching pair. Furthermore, the feasibility of the solution method is verified by a case study of person-position matching (PPM), and the matching result demonstrates that the proposed method is effective in dealing with multi-criteria PPM problem. Finally, the sensitivity of parameters and some comparative studies are discussed.},

For crisp information granulation, the universe is decomposed into granules by binary relations on the universe, say, preorder, tolerance and equivalence relations. A knowledge stru cture is composed of all information granules induced by a relation that corresponds to the granulation. This paper establishes a novel theoretical framework for the measurement of information granularity of knowledge structures. First, two new relations between knowledge structures are introduced through the use of their respective Boolean relation matrices, where the granular equality relation is defined based on an orthogonal transformation with the transformation matrix being a permutation matrix, and the granularly finer relation is presented by combining the classical finer relation and the orthogonal transformation. Then, it is demonstrated that the simplified knowledge structure base with the granularly finer relation is a partially ordered set, which can be represented by a Hasse diagram. Subsequently, an axiomatic definition of information granularity is proposed to satisfy the constraints regarding these two relations. Moreover, a general form of the information granularity is given, and some existing measures are proved to be its special cases. Finally, as an application of the proposed measure, the attribute significance measure is developed based on the information granularity.},

  abstract     = {This research is concerned with the adaptive neural network observer based fault approximation and fault-tolerant control of time-varying nonlinear systems. A new strategy for adaptively updating the weights of neural network parameters is proposed to enhance fault detection accuracy. Lyapunov func tion theory (LFT) is applied for adaptively updating the learning parameters weights of multi-layer neural network (MLNN). The purpose of using adaptive learning rates to update the weight parameters of MLNN is to obtain the global minima for highly nonlinear functions without increasing the computational complexities and costs and increase the efficacy of fault detection. Results of the proposed adaptive MLNN observer are compared with conventional MLNN observer and high gain observer. The effects of various faults or failures are studied in detail. The proposed strategy shows more robustness to disturbances, uncertainties, and unmodelled system dynamics compared to the conventional neural network, high gain observer and other existing techniques in literature. Fault tolerant control (FTC) schemes are also proposed to account for the presence of various faults and failures. Separate sliding mode control (SMC) based FTC schemes are designed for each observer to ensure stability of the faulty system. The suggested strategy is validated on Boeing 747 100/200 aircraft. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed adaptive MLNN observer and the FTC based on the proposed adaptive MLNN compared to the conventional MLNN, high gain observer and other existing schemes in literature. Comparison of the performance of all the strategies validates the superiority of the proposed strategy and shows that the FTC based on proposed adaptive MLNN strategy provides better robustness to various situations such as disturbances and uncertainties. It is concluded that the proposed strategy can be integrated into the aircraft for the purpose of fault diagnosis, fault isolation and FTC scheme for increasing the performance of the system.},

In view of the fact that traditional kansei engineering can not effectively reflect the complex and changeable psychological factors of users, and it has not explored the complex relationship between customer satisfaction and perceptual demand characteristics. To address this problem, some uncertainty techniques including rough sets and fuzzy sets are applied to capture more accurate emotion knowledge.

The EGM is applied to analyze the attractive factor of morphological characteristics of the product, and then the demand items with the highest satisfaction are analyzed through CFKM. The semantic difference method is combined to construct a decision table, and through attribute reduction and importance calculation to obtain the weight of the core product design items. In order to explore the non-linear relationship between design elements and kansei images, the fuzzy weighted association rule mining method was applied to obtain the set of frequent fuzzy weighted association rules based on evidence theory’s reliability indices of minimum support and confidence so as to realize user demand-driven product design.

However, potential SMIs discrimination often faces the problem of insufficient ava ilable information of the long-term evolution of the network, and the existing discriminant methods based on link analysis fail to obtain more accurate results. To fill this gap, a consensus smart discriminant algorithm (CSDA) is proposed to identify the potential SMIs with the aid of attention concentration (AC) between users in a closed triadic structure. CSDA enriches and expands the users’ AC information by fusing multiple attention concentration indexes (ACIs) as well as filters the noise information caused by multi-index fusion through consensus among the indexes. Specifically, to begin with, to enrich the available long-term network evolution information, the unidirectional attention concentration indexes (UACIs) and the bidirectional attention concentration indexes (BACIs) are defined; next, the consensus attention concentration index (CACI) is selected according to the principle of minimum upper and lower bounds of link prediction bias to filter noise information; the potential SMI is determined by adaptively calculating CACI among the user to be identified, unconnected user group and their common neighbor.

The question “whether the configuration with lesser number of electrodes is common amongst different stimuli presentation paradigms” remains unanswered. There are publicly available datasets for EEG based human emotional states recognition. Since this work is focused towards classifying emotions while subjects are experiencing different stimuli, therefore we need to perform new experiments. Keeping aforementioned issues in consideration, this work presents a novel experimental study that records EEG data for three different human emotional states evoked with four different stimuli presentation paradigms. A methodology based on iterative Genetic Algorithm in combination with majority voting has been used to achieve configuration with reduced number of EEG electrodes keeping in consideration minimum loss of classification accuracy. The results obtained are comparable with recent studies. Stimulus independent configurations with lesser number of electrodes lead towards low computational complexity as well as reduced set up time for future EEG based smart systems for emotions recognition},

  abstract     = {Regarding the ever-increasing development of data and computational centers due to the contribution of high-performance computing systems in such sectors, energy consumption has always been of great importance due to CO2 emissions that can result in adverse effects on the environment. In recent yea rs, the notions such as “energy” and also “Green Computing” have played crucial roles when scheduling parallel tasks in datacenters. The duplication and clustering strategies, as well as Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) techniques, have focused on the reduction of the energy consumption and the optimization of the performance parameters. Concerning scheduling Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of a datacenter processors equipped with the technique of DVFS, this paper proposes an energy- and time-aware algorithm based on dual-phase scheduling, called EATSDCDD, to apply the combination of the strategies for duplication and clustering along with the distribution of slack-time among the tasks of a cluster. DVFS and control procedures in the proposed green system are mapped into Petri net-based models, which contribute to designing a multiple decision process. In the first phase, we use an intelligent combined approach of the duplication and clustering strategies to run the immediate tasks of DAG along with monitoring the throughput by concentrating on the reduction of makespan and the energy consumed in the processors. The main idea of the proposed algorithm involves the achievement of a maximum reduction in energy consumption in the second phase. To this end, the slack time was distributed among non-critical dependent tasks. Additionally, we cover the issues of negotiation between consumers and service providers at the rate of μ based on Green Service Level Agreement (GSLA) to achieve a higher saving of the energy. Eventually, a set of data established for conducting the examinations and also different parameters of the constructed random DAG are assessed to examine the efficiency of our proposed algorithm. The obtained results confirms that our algorithm outperforms compared the other algorithms considered in this study.},

Assets criticality analysis is one of the main steps in many maintenance methodologies, including Reliability Centered Mainten ance. The present study seeks to provide a solution for determining critical assets for more efficient maintenance management. In this regard, an integrated approach of the analytical hierarchy process and fuzzy inference system was proposed based on the concept of the risk matrix. According to the concept of the risk matrix, two main criteria of failure consequences and probability were employed to determine assets criticality. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to consider all sub-criteria of failure consequences and probability. Finally, using two main criteria as inputs, a fuzzy inference system was developed to determine the criticality of the assets. The proposed approach was implemented in a gas refinery; the results showed its effectiveness and applicability in the process of prioritizing assets based on criticality criteria. The proposed approach has the advantages of multi-criteria decision-making techniques, modeling ambiguity and uncertainty in real issues, modeling the process of inference in the human mind, and storing the knowledge of the organization’s expert.},

It creates a way where the user’s data becomes the victim of various security threats. Among those users’ data, images act as primary data, and its encr yption security methodologies are fascinating. The conventional encryption techniques don’t work well against the various other hidden security threats but require substantial computational time and cost with poor permutation performance. Hence to deal with this, an auto-encoder induced DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) sequence via chaotic image encryption framework is designed in our proposed work. It integrates the properties of DNA encoding and the chaotic maps to handle the data losses effectively and resist several attacks such as statistical attacks, chosen-plaintext attacks, etc. Moreover, an auto-encoder is used to control the data noises, thereby ensuring a better encryption performance. Here, the auto-encoder is activated to generate a permuted image with less time complexity and noise. A secret key is then initialized with the aid of SHA-256. Finally, image encryption and decryption are achieved, followed by the successful transmission of data over a digital network. The performance of the proposed work is analyzed with varied metrics to strengthen its efficiency over the prior techniques.},

The weathering of LDPE depends on environment factors, while the complexity of the weathering processes inhibits the evaluation of environmental weathering risk s. To elucidate the correlation between weathering and environmental factors, and to predict the weathering risk of target areas of interest, three-year-long natural weathering tests were conducted at twelve natural exposure stations in China. Properties of weathered LDPE were compared and analysed using factor analysis. The fuzzy recognition method based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was established and used to predict the weathering risk based on environmental database. The results indicate that the factor scores can partitioned the atmospheric environments into five weathering risk grades. This article used the accumulated cumulative temperature of the daily maximum temperature for weathering risk evaluation, which is more scientific than the annual average temperature widely used and is useful for revealing the difference in LDPE weathering in Turpan and Korla. A comparative chart of LDPE’s weathering risk in China was established by this fuzzy recognition method for the first time, which caters to the continuous extension of high-speed railway to new regions.},

The proposed method is compared to the traditional IMM filter, IMM with Bayesian Network (BNs) and a state-of-the-art Adaptive TPM-based parallel IMM (ATPM-PIMM) algorithm. The experiments were carried out in an artificial numerical example as well as in two real-world health monitoring applications: the PRONOSTIA platform and the Li-ion batteries data set provided by NASA.

Multi-cloud is a multi-tenant and multi-vendor heterogeneous cloud platform in terms of services and security under a defined SLA (service level agreement). The div erse deployment of the multi-cloud model leads to rise in security risks. In this paper, we define a multi-cloud model with hybridization of vendor and security to increase the end-user experience. The proposed model has a heterogeneous cloud paradigm with a combination of firewall tracts to overcome rising security issues. The proposed work consists of three steps, firstly, all incoming traffic from the consumer end into five major groups called ambient. Secondly, design a next-generation firewall (NGFW) topology with a mixture of tree-based and demilitarized zone (DMZ) implications. Test implementation of designed topology performed by using a simple DMZ technique in case of vendor-specific model and NGFW on hybrid vendor based multi-cloud model. Furthermore, it also defines some advantages of NGFW to overcome these concerns. The proposed work is helpful for the new consumer to define their dynamic secure cloud services under a single SLA before adopting a multi-cloud platform. Finally, results are compared in terms of throughput and CPU utilization in both cases.},

Due to the lacking of sufficient expression features and facial images, it is challenging to automatically recognize facial expression with high accuracy. In this paper, we propose a fusion handcraft feature method to improve FER from images. Firstly, a new texture feature extraction method PD-LDN (Pixel Difference Local Directional Number pattern) is proposed, which can extract more local information, reduce noise disturbance and feature dimension. Secondly, the handcrafted features including PD-LDN texture features, geometric features, and BOVW (Bag of Visual Words) semantic features are connected in parallel to an improved autoencoder network for fusion. Finally, the fused features are input into the softmax classifier for recognizing facial expression. We conduct extensive experiments on JAFFE and CK+datasets. Our proposed method shows superior performance than the state-of-the-art approaches on recognizing facial expressions.},

  abstract     = {Firefly algorithm (FA) is one of most important nature-inspired algorithm based on swarm intelligence. Meanwhile, FA uses the full attraction model, which results too many unnecessary movements and reduces the efficiency of searching the optimal solution. To overcome these problems, this paper pres ents a new job, how the better fireflies move, which is always ignored. The novel algorithm is called multiple swarm strategy firefly algorithm (MSFFA), in which multiple swarm attraction model and status adaptively switch approach are proposed. It is characterized by employing the multiple swarm attraction model, which not only improves the efficiency of searching the optimal solution, but also quickly finds the better fireflies that move in free status. In addition, the novel approach defines that the fireflies followed different rules in different status, and can adaptively switch the status of fireflies between the original status and the free status to balance the exploration and the exploitation. To verify the robustness of MSFFA, it is compared with other improved FA variants on CEC2013. In one case of 30 dimension on 28 test functions, the proposed algorithm is significantly better than FA, DFA, PaFA, MFA, NaFA,and NSRaFA on 24, 23, 23, 17, 15, and 24 functions, respectively. The experimental results prove that MSFFA has obvious advantages over other FA variants.},

  abstract     = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of various low-cost devices with limited battery power for surveillance of certain vicinity. The main concern was to prolong the network lifetime to save energy. The heterogeneous nodes are deployed in the given setting divided into two INSTANT-OFF and NEVER- OFF states. Then each one is further subdivided by a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The INSTANT-OFF (Good, Better, and Best) has three states active, idle, sleep, and always worked as Cluster Members (CMs) to sense the physical environment. The NEVER-OFF (Good, Better, and Best) has active and idle states. The first two most optimum NEVER-OFF selected as Cluster Head (CH) and Data Collector (DC), and the remaining belonged to CMs. The cluster boundary was defined by parameter Distance from Base Station (DisBS) to meet the unequal clustering approach. The energy consumes during sensing, processing, and transmission phases by its appropriate nodes. The CMs worked reactively and saved energy by idle and sleep states, while the CH and DC worked in a proactive mode and saved energy in an idle state. The sensing job was done by CMs that consumed a minor amount of energy and transmitted packets of 200 bits length to DC. The DC received packets of 200 bits length from CMs and aggregated them into 6400 bits length packets, then delivered them to CH. The reactive and proactive mechanisms saved the energy as 85.1033% in 2000 rounds; increased lifetime up to 774 rounds, re-clustering setup took place after 1912 rounds, and enhanced the throughput as 100% and latency time 0.001123 by experiment evaluation. The result shows that most energy consumption job were communicated with BS performed by CH hop by hop through other CH. The unequal clustering approach maintained the consumption of energy levels throughout WSNs processing.},

  abstract     = {Concept factorization (CF) is an effective matrix factorization model which has been widely used in many applications. In CF, the linear combination of data points serves as the dictionary based on which CF can be performed in both the original feature space as well as the reproducible kernel Hilbe rt space (RKHS). The conventional CF treats each dimension of the feature vector equally during the data reconstruction process, which might violate the common sense that different features have different discriminative abilities and therefore contribute differently in pattern recognition. In this paper, we introduce an auto-weighting variable into the conventional CF objective function to adaptively learn the corresponding contributions of different features and propose a new model termed Auto-Weighted Concept Factorization (AWCF). In AWCF, on one hand, the feature importance can be quantitatively measured by the auto-weighting variable in which the features with better discriminative abilities are assigned larger weights; on the other hand, we can obtain more efficient data representation to depict its semantic information. The detailed optimization procedure to AWCF objective function is derived whose complexity and convergence are also analyzed. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and representative benchmark data sets and the clustering results demonstrate the effectiveness of AWCF in comparison with some related models.},

  abstract     = {The traditional blind source separation (BSS) algorithm is mainly used to deal with signal separation under the noiseless model, but it does not apply to data with the low signal to noise ratio (SNR). To solve the problem, an adaptive variable step size natural gradient BSS algorithm based on an im proved wavelet threshold is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an improved wavelet threshold method is used to reduce the noise of the signal. Secondly, the wavelet coefficient layer with obvious periodicity is denoised using a morphological component analysis (MCA) algorithm, and the processed wavelet coefficients are recombined to obtain the ideal model. Thirdly, the recombined signal is pre-whitened, and a new separation matrix update formula of natural gradient algorithm is constructed by defining a new separation degree estimation function. Finally, the adaptive variable step size natural gradient blind source algorithm is used to separate the noise reduction signal. The results show that the algorithm can not only adaptively adjust the step size according to different signals, but also improve the convergence speed, stability and separation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In the last decade, due to wireless technology’s enhancement, the people’s interest is highly increased in Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs). WBSNs consist of many tiny biosensor nodes that are continuously monitoring diverse physiological signals such as BP (systolic and diastolic), ECG, EMG, SpO2, and activity recognition and transmit these sensed patients’ sensitive information to the central node, which is straight communicate with the controller. To disseminate this sensitive patient information from the controller to remote Medical Server (MS) needs to be prolonged high-speed wireless technology, i.e., LTE, UMTS, WiMAX, WiFi, and satellite communication. It is a challenging task for the controller to choose the optimal network to disseminate various patient vital signs, i.e., emergency data, normal data, and delay-sensitive data. According to the nature of various biosensor nodes in WBSNs, monitor patient vital signs and provide complete intelligent treatment when any abnormality occurs in the human body, i.e., accurate insulin injection when patient sugar level increased. In this paper, first, we select the optimal network from accessible networks using four different fuzzy attribute-based decision-making techniques (Triangular Cubic Hesistent Fuzzy Weighted Averaging Operator, Neutrosophic Linguistic TOPSIS method, Trangualar Cubic Hesistent Fuzzy Hamacher Weighted Averaging Operator and Cubic Grey Relational Analysis) depending upon the quality of service requirement for various application of WBSNs to prolong the human life, enhanced the society’s medical treatment and indorse living qualities of people. Similarly, leakage and misuse of patient data can be a security threat to human life. Thus, confidential data transmission is of great importance. For this purpose, in our proposed scheme, we used HECC for secure key exchange and an AES algorithm to secure patient vital signs to protect patient information from illegal usage. Furthermore, MAC protocol is used for mutual authentication among sensor nodes and Base Stations (BS). Mathematical results show that our scheme is efficient for optimal network selection in such circumstances where conflict arises among diverse QoS requirements for different applications of WBSNs.},

  abstract     = {Data acquisition problem on large distributed wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is considered as a challenge in the growth of Internet of Things (IoT). Recently, the combination of compressive sensing (CS) and routing techniques has attracted much attention of researchers. An open question of this co mbination is how to integrate these techniques effectively for specific tasks. On the other hand, CS data reconstruction process is considered as one of the CS challenges because it requires to recover N data from only M measurement where M&lt; &lt;N. Through this paper, we propose a new scheme for data gathering in IoT based heterogeneous WSN that includes a new effective Deterministic Clustering using CS technique (DCCS) to handle the data acquisition problem. DCCS reduces the total overhead computational cost needed to self-organize WSN using a simple approach and then uses CS at each sensor node to decrease the overall energy consumption and increase the network lifetime. The proposed scheme includes also an effective CS reconstruction algorithm called Random Selection Matching Pursuit (RSMP) to improve the recovery process at the base station (BS). RSMP adds a random selection process during the forward step to give the opportunity for more columns to be selected as an estimated solution in each iteration. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme succeeds to minimize the overall network power consumption and prolong the network lifetime beside provide better performance in CS data reconstruction.},

In order to deal with the various emerges like packet routing, node mobility, and energy optimization as well as energy balancing in WSNs. The proposed protocol accounts for the basic QoS restraints such as Delay, HopCount and Energy Level for each link of ‘n’ number of routes and predicts the best optimal path among these in-between sender and receiver nodes throughout the route discovery process. It also assures the energy level of each node existing on the route during the route reply process. It incorporates the modified mobility prediction approach in order to estimate the stableness of link failure time for every link of each path during the route reply process. The main objective of this work to achieve the energy balancing among the nodes is achieved through fuzzy rules based node’s trust classification is introduced and based on this energy weight of each node is adjusted according to their trustworthiness. It accomplishes the path sustainment process when the link among the two nodes goes down. Moreover, the proposed model has been given careful attention for selecting additional substitute routes throughout link failure.

  abstract     = {This study proposes the novel method of lithium-ion battery state of health (SoH) estimation and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction to ensure the safety and reliability of the energy storage system. A fuzzy brain emotional learning neural network (FBELNN) is employed to estimate SoH and a recur rent cerebellar model neural network (RCMNN) is used for the RUL prediction. The inputs of FBELNN are extracted features from the monitoring curve of the constant voltage and current, because the lithium-ion battery is seldom completely discharged and the discharging situation in actual operating process is complex. The FBELNN learns the battery aging features that are extracted and selected by discrete wavelet transform and principal component analysis, respectively. The SoH estimation results from the FBELNN are accurate due to the special structure and parameters adaptive laws. The RCMNN and online training again can improve the performance of RUL prediction, because recurrent units can capture the dynamic features. Experimental data are performed by using NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence battery datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the root mean square error of SoH estimation is smaller by the FBELNN and the prediction accuracy of RUL is higher by RCMNN under the different starting points.},

In this paper we are present multigranulation roughness based on soft relations. Firstly we approximate a non-empty subset with respect to aftersets and foresets of finite number of soft binary relations. In this way we get two sets of soft sets called the lower approximation and upper approximation with respect to aftersets and with respect to foresets. Then we investigate some properties of lower and upper approximations of the new multigranulation rough set model. It can be found that the Pawlak rough set model, Qian et al. multigranulation rough set model, Shabir et al. rough set model are special cases of this new multigranulation rough set model.

Because some criteria are subjective and the evaluation process usually needs more than one decision maker (DM), probabilistic linguistic information is suitable to express DMs’ opinions. Therefore, we propose a novel EDAS method with probabilistic linguistic information based on D-S evidence theory for evaluating nursing homes. First, a new score function for probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) is put forward in order to compare PLTSs and use EDAS method conveniently. Then, a novel uncertainty measure based on D-S evidence theory is proposed to obtain the criteria weights. Furthermore, a novel EDAS method for PLTSs based on cobweb area model is put forward to reduce the effect of some extreme values influencing the decision result. Finally, our method is applied to a real case of evaluating nursing homes in Nanjing city, and the effectiveness of our method is illustrated by comparing the traditional decision methods.},

This paper presents a novel approach for grou p decision making under uncertainty with the involvement of the third-party evaluator in the decision making process. Recognizing the challenge in adequately determining the weight of decision makers in group decision making, the evidence theory is appropriately used with the involvement of the third-party evaluator. To effectively model the uncertainty and imprecision in the decision making process, fuzzy preference relations are used for better representing the subjective assessment of individual decision makers. To adequately determine the ranking of available alternatives, the logarithmic least square method is applied for appropriately aggregating the fuzzy preference relation of individual decision makers. A group consensus index is developed for facilitating consensus building in group decision making. This leads to better group decisions being made. A real-world application is presented that shows the proposed approach is effective in solving group decision making problems under uncertainty.},

It studies the credit transmission characteristics regarding core enterprise credit radiation, presents the core enterp rise credit segmentation and credit pricing, and transforms them into the calculation of credit guarantee and the default probability of core enterprises. Credit guarantee is regarded as a constraint of financial institutions’ credit decisions. Using probability density and logistic tools, we construct a profit maximization model for financial institutions and solve their optimal credit decision for a specific interest rate. Through numerical experiments, we verify the validity of the model and conclude that increasing the business volume between financing enterprises and core enterprises or reducing the probability of default can effectively improve financial institutions’ credit line.},

  abstract     = {Case-based reasoning (CBR) is one of the most popular methods used in emergency decision making (EDM). Case retrieval plays a key role in EDM processes based on CBR and usually functions by retrieving similar historical cases using similarity measurements. Decision makers (DMs), thus, choose the mo st appropriate historical cases. Although uncertainty and fuzziness are present in the EDM process, in-depth research on these issues is still lacking. In this study, a heterogeneous multi-attribute case retrieval method based on group decision making (GDM) with incomplete weight information is developed. First, the case similarities between historical and target cases are calculated, and a set of similar historical cases is constructed. Six formats of case attributes are considered, namely crisp numbers, interval numbers, linguistic variables, intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, single-valued neutrosophic numbers (NNs) and interval-valued NNs. Next, the evaluation information from the DMs is expressed using single-valued NNs. Additionally, the evaluation utilities of similar historical cases are obtained by aggregating the evaluation information. The comprehensive utilities of similar historical cases are obtained using case similarities and evaluation utilities. In this process, the weights of incomplete information are determined by constructing optimization models. Furthermore, the most appropriate similar historical case is selected according to the comprehensive utilities. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated using two examples; its performance is then compared with those of other similar methods to demonstrate its validity and efficacy.},

  abstract     = {The main target of this paper is to design a density-based clustering algorithm using the weighted grid and information entropy based on MapReduce, noted as DBWGIE-MR, to deal with the problems of unreasonable division of data gridding, low accuracy of clustering results and low efficiency of paral lelization in big data clustering algorithm based on density. This algorithm is implemented in three stages: data partitioning, local clustering, and global clustering. For each stage, we propose several strategies to improve the algorithm. In the first stage, based on the spatial distribution of data points, we propose an adaptive division strategy (ADG) to divide the grid adaptively. In the second stage, we design a weighted grid construction strategy (NE) which can strengthen the relevance between grids to improve the accuracy of clustering. Meanwhile, based on the weighted grid and information entropy, we design a density calculation strategy (WGIE) to calculate the density of the grid. And last, to improve the parallel efficiency, core clusters computing algorithm based on MapReduce (COMCORE-MR) are proposed to parallel compute the core clusters of the clustering algorithm. In the third stage, based on disjoint-set, we propose a core cluster merging algorithm (MECORE) to speed-up ratio the convergence of merged local clusters. Furthermore, based on MapReduce, a core clusters parallel merging algorithm (MECORE-MR) is proposed to get the clustering algorithm results faster, which improves the core clusters merging efficiency of the density-based clustering algorithm. We conduct the experiments on four synthetic clusters. Compared with H-DBSCAN, DBSCAN-MR and MR-VDBSCAN, the experimental results show that the DBWGIE-MR algorithm has higher stability and accuracy, and it takes less time in parallel clustering.},

  abstract     = {In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), effective transmission with acceptable degradation in the power of sensor nodes is a key challenge. In a large network, holdup is bound to occur in communicating superfluous data. The aforementioned issues namely, energy, delay and data redundancy are interdepend ent on each other and a tradeoff needs to be worked out to improve the overall performance. The extant methods in the literature employ either centralized or distributed approach to select a cluster head (CH). In this paper, sink originated hybrid and dynamic clustering with routing technique is proposed. The proposed routing algorithm works based on node handling capability of each sensor node in the selection of CH and also helps in identifying the forwarder node. In addition, processing load of a sensor node is also considered for selecting the forwarder. Both space and time correlation is used to collect data from the clusters and then aggregated to provide a proficient communication. The introduced method is evaluated with the performance of the previously available techniques like, Data Routing for In-Network Aggregation (DRINA), Efficient Data Collection Aware of Spatio-Temporal Correlation (EAST), Cluster-Based Data Aggregation (CBDA), Energy-Efficient Data Aggregation and Transfer (EEDAT), and Distributed algorithm for Integrated tree Construction and data Aggregation (DICA). Simulation parameters considered for assess ing the performance of the proposed algorithm are aggregation ratio, routing overhead, packet delivery fraction, throughput, packet delay and consumed energy. The experimental analysis of the introduced algorithm generates paramount outcome of finest aggregation quality with diverse key characteristics and circumstances as required by a sensor network.},

The crop alternatives are evaluated against several economic, technical, social and environmental criteria. The results favor the cultivation of soy bean, goji berry and buckwheat, while tamarind appears to be the least favored crop among the considered alternatives.

The operation strategies are evaluated through five objectives such as Productivity, Quality, Cost, Time and Importance score. The importance scores of all strategies are firstly obtained from the Fuzzy TOPSIS method. The sets of the weight of criteria are then established by using SA while MOLP approach is used to select appropriate strategies under multi-conflicting objectives with limited resources.

Understanding the needs and behavior of the target customer plays a vital role in the success of the business so the sentiment anal ysis process would help the marketer to improve the quality of the product as well as a shopper to buy the correct product. Due to its automatic learning capability, deep learning is the current research interest in Natural language processing. Skip-gram architecture is used in the proposed model for better extraction of the semantic relationships as well as contextual information of words. However, the main contribution of this work is Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) algorithm based LSTM for sentiment analysis. LSTM is used in the proposed model for understanding complex patterns in textual data. To improve the performance of the LSTM, weight parameters are enhanced by presenting the Adaptive PSO algorithm. Opposition based learning (OBL) method combined with PSO algorithm becomes the Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) classifier which assists LSTM in selecting optimal weight for the environment in less number of iterations. So APSO - LSTM ‘s ability in adjusting the attributes such as optimal weights and learning rates combined with the good hyper parameter choices leads to improved accuracy and reduces losses. Extensive experiments were conducted on four datasets proved that our proposed APSO-LSTM model secured higher accuracy over the classical methods such as traditional LSTM, ANN, and SVM.

The output of this process was subjected to another round of compression using a more robust but slower compressor (PAQ8f). The compression ratio of the second compression was, on average,  18%, which is high for random data. The results of the second compression were superior to the lossy JPEG. Under the used data set, lossy JPEG needs to sacrifice  10% on average to realize nearly total lossless compression ratios of the two-successive compressions.

These methods based on fuzzy theory are collectively referred to as fuzzy preference modeling methods. The fuzzy sets preference model is the first practice of fuzzy theory used in the field of preference modeling, and it is still widely used by researchers until now. Subsequently, based on fuzzy theory, the researchers also proposed linguistic term sets and cloud model.

  abstract     = {For the job shop with variable processing speeds, the aim of energy saving and consumption reduction is implemented from the perspective of production scheduling. By analyzing the characteristics of the workshop, a multi-objective mathematical model is established with the objective of reducing the total energy consumption and shortening the makespan. A multi-objective discrete water wave optimization (MODWWO) algorithm is proposed for solving the problem. Firstly, a two-vector encoding method is adopted to divide the scheduling solution into two parts, which represent speed selection and operation permutation in the scheduling solution, respectively. Secondly, some dispatching rules are used to initialize the population and obtain the initial scheduling solutions. Then, three operators of the basic water wave optimization algorithm are redesigned to make the algorithm adaptive for the multi-objective discrete scheduling problem under study. A new propagation operator is presented with the ability of balancing global exploration and local exploitation based on individual rank and neighborhood structures. A novel refraction operator is designed based on crossover operation, by which each individual can learn from the current best individual to absorb better information. And a breaking operator is modified based on the local search strategy to enhance the exploitation ability. Finally, extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed MODWWO algorithm is effective for solving the considered energy-saving scheduling problem.},

In order to achieve good fusion performance, a method by combining roll ing guidance filter (RGF) and convolutional sparse representation (CSR) is proposed. In the proposed method, RGF is performed on every pre-registered IR and VIS source images to obtain their detail layers and base layer. Then, the detail layers are fused with a serious of weighted coefficients produced by joint bilateral filer (JBF). The base layer is decomposed into a sub-detail-layer and a sub-base-layer. CSR is applied to fuse the sub-detail-layer and averaging strategy is used to fuse the sub-base-layer. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by adding the fused detail layer and base layer.

  abstract     = {In view of the problem that it is difficult to quantitatively assess the interactivity between attributes in the identification process of 2-order additive fuzzy measure, this work uses the intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) to describe and deal with the interactivity between attributes. Firstly, the interactivity between attributes is defined by the supermodular game theory. On this basis, the experts employ the intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN) to assess the interactivity between attributes, Secondly, the opinions of all experts are aggregated by using the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted average operator (IFWA). Finally, based on the aggregated results, the intuitionistic fuzzy interaction degree between attributes is defined and calculated by the score function of IFN. Thus, a 2-order additive fuzzy measure identification method based on IFSs is further proposed. Based on the proposed method, using the Choquet fuzzy integral as nonlinear integration operator, a multi-attribute decision making (MADM) process is presented. Taking the credit evaluation of the big data listed companies in China as an application example, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the analysis results of application example.},

  abstract     = {Air quality index (AQI) is an indicator usually issued on a daily basis to inform the public how good or bad air quality recently is or how it will become over the next few days, which is of utmost importance in our life. To provide a more practicable way for AQI prediction, so that residents can c lear about air conditions and make further plans, five imperative meteorological indicators are elaborately selected. Accordingly, taking these indicators as independent variables, a fuzzy multiple linear regression model with Gaussian fuzzy coefficients is proposed and reformulated, based on the linearity of Gaussian fuzzy numbers and Tanaka’s minimum fuzziness criterion. Subsequently, historical data in Shanghai from March 2016 to February 2018 are extracted from the government database and divided into two parts, where the first half is statistically analyzed and used for formulating four seasonal fuzzy linear regression models in views of the special climate environment of Shanghai, and the second half is used for prediction to validate the performance of the proposed model. Furthermore, considering that there is beyond dispute that triangular fuzzy number is more prevalent and crucial in the field of fuzzy studies for years, plenty of comparisons between the models based on the two types of fuzzy numbers are carried out by means of the three measures including the membership degree, the fuzziness and the credibility. The results demonstrate the powerful effectiveness and efficiency of the fuzzy linear regression models for AQI prediction, and the superiority of Gaussian fuzzy numbers over triangular fuzzy numbers in presenting the relationships between the meteorological factors and AQI.},

First, more than 120,000 online hotel reviews related were retrieved. Second, a novel and dataset-based seven-dimensional evaluation system, applying the BERT model was proposed. This solves the problem of polysemous words, and can more accurately reflect the service attributes consumers really care about. In particular, the analysis reveals that the overall consumer satisfaction is affected by key service attributes including service, cleanliness, equipment, price, location, internet and catering, among which the cleanliness attributes has the greatest impact. Lastly, the latest Kismet emotional recognition method was adopted to effectively identify the emotional polarity and 11 detailed emotions. The regression relationship between emotion and overall satisfaction was also verified, which enabled a more accurate analysis for consumption emotions and satisfaction.},

This paper develops an extended FMEA approach based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic Z-numbers (HFLZNs). Firstly, the concept of HFLZNs is proposed to describe the evaluation information, which inherits the prominent features of the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set and linguistic Z-numbers (LZNs). Secondly, an HFLZN assessment method is developed to determine the weights of risk factors, and the weights of experts are measured based on hesitation degree. Subsequently, considering the psychological characteristics of decision makers, Tomada de Decisão Iterativa Multicritério and LZNs are integrated to obtain the risk ranking of failure modes. Finally, the practicability of the extended FMEA method is proven by an illustrative example concerning the risk evaluation of a nuclear main pump bearing, and its robustness is verified by indepth analysis.},

However, cybersecurity risk assessment process is susceptible to subjective and objective effects. To solve this problem, this paper introduced cybersecurity risk assessment m ethod based on fuzzy theory of Attack-Defense Tree model and probability cybersecurity risk assessment technology, and applied it to airport automatic fuel supply control system. Firstly, an Attack-Defense Tree model was established based on the potential cybersecurity threat of the system and deployed security equipment. Secondly, the interval probability of the attack path was calculated using the triangular fuzzy quantification of the interval probabilities of the attack leaf nodes and defensive leaf nodes. Next, the interval probability of the final path was defuzzified. Finally, the occurrence probability of each final attack path was obtained and a reference for the deployment of security equipment was provided. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) considering the distribution of equipment in industrial control system, a new cybersecurity risk evaluation model of industrial control system is proposed. (2) The experimental results of this article are compared with other assessment technologies, and the trend is similar to that of other evaluation methods, which proves that the method was introduced in this paper is scientific. However, this method reduces the subjective impact of experts on cybersecurity risk assessment, and the assessment results are more objective and reasonable. (3) Applying this model to the airport oil supply automatic control system can comprehensively evaluate risk, solve the practical problems faced by the airport, and also provide an important basis for the cybersecurity protection scheme of the energy industry.},

Based on the least squares estimation and uncertainty theory, we first proposed the slope me an model, which is to calculate the slopes of expected value and each given data, and the average value of these slopes as the slope of the linear regression equation, substituted into the expected value coordinates, and we can get the linear regression equation. Then, we proposed the deviation slope mean model, which is a very good model and the focus of this paper. The idea of the deviation slope mean model is to calculate the slopes of each given data deviating from the regression equation, and take the average value of these slopes as the slope of the regression equation. Substituted into the expected value coordinate, we can get the linear regression equation. The deviation slope mean model can also be extended to multiple linear regression equation, we transform the established equations into matrix equation and use inverse matrix to solve unknown parameters. Finally, we put forward the hybrid model, which is a simplified model based on the combination of the least squares estimation and deviation slope mean model. To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed models, we provide numerical examples and solve the linear regression equations of the imprecisely observed data and the precisely observed data respectively.

  abstract     = {Cross-dock is defined as the practice of unloading goods from incoming vehicles and loading them directly into outbound vehicles. Cross-docking can simplify supply chains and help them to deliver goods to the market more swiftly and efficiently by removing or minimizing warehousing costs, space req uirements, and use of inventory. Regarding the lifetime of perishable goods, their routing and scheduling in the cross-dock and transportation are of great importance. This study aims to analyze the scheduling and routing of cross-dock and transportation by System Dynamics (SD) modeling to design a reverse logistics network for the perishable goods. For this purpose, the relations between the selected variables are first specified, followed by assessing and examining the proposed model. Finally, four scenarios are developed to determine the optimal values of decision variables. The results indicate the most influencing factors on reaching the optimal status is the minimum distance between the cross-dock and destination, rather than increasing the number of manufactories.},

Massive data analysis now drives nearly every aspect of society and can facilitate informed decision-making by businesses. Fully automated data flow d etection of anomalies plays a crucial role in maintaining data service stability and preventing malicious attacks. This paper presents an extensible and generic real-time monitoring system framework (EGRTMS) for large-scale time-series data. EGRTMS employs a prediction module and an anomaly detection module within an anomaly filtering layer for the accurate identification of anomalies. Moreover, the alarm module and anomaly handling module within an anomaly trace processing layer enables the system to respond swiftly to the detected threats. Our solution does not rely on the labelling of anomalies; instead, a predictor module with a deep learning attention-based mechanism learns the normal behaviour of the data, and an anomaly handling module determines the dynamic alarm-threshold by utilizing a sliding window. The results of this study demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms other anomaly detection systems on most real and synthetic datasets.},

  abstract     = {Digitized forms of images do widely used for medical diagnostics. To maintain the privacy of an individual in e-health care applications, securing the medical image becomes essential. Hence exclusive encryption algorithms have been developed to protect the confidentiality of medical images. As an a lternative to software implementations, the realization of image encryption architectures on hardware platforms such as FPGA offers significant benefit with its reconfigurable feature. This paper presents a lightweight image encryption scheme for medical image security feasible to realize as concurrent architectural blocks on reconfigurable hardware like FPGA to achieve higher throughput. In the proposed encryption scheme, Lorentz attractor’s chaotic keys perform the diffusion process. Simultaneously, the pseudo-random memory addresses obtained from a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) circuit accomplishes the confusion process. The proposed algorithm implemented on Intel Cyclone IV FPGA (EP4CE115F29C7) analyzed the optimal number of concurrent blocks to achieve a tradeoff among throughput and resource utilization. Security analyses such as information entropy, histogram, correlation, and PSNR confirms the algorithm’s encryption quality. The strength of diffusion keys was ensured by randomness verification through the standard test suite from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The proposed scheme has a larger keyspace of 2384 that guarantees good confusion through near-zero correlation, and successful diffusion with a PSNR of &lt;5 dB towards the statistical attacks. Based on the hardware analysis, the optimal number of concurrent architectural blocks (2 N) on the chosen FPGA to achieve higher throughput (639.37 Mbps), low power dissipation (138.85 mW), minimal resource utilization (1268 Logic Elements) and better encryption quality for the proposed algorithm is recommended as 4 (with N = 2).},

However, in engineering practice, it is almost impossible to get the accurate system model and also the system noise is non-independent Gaussian white noise. So the traditional state estimation methods are not suitable for uncertainty system with non Gaussian white noise. In this paper, the Kalman Filter-Support Vector Machine (KF-SVM) based data fusion algorithm is proposed for system with model uncertainty and correlated noise. Firstly, the state pre-estimates are calculated by the proposed improved Kalman Filter for single sensor system. Then, the state estimation is obtained via proposed KF-SVM data fusion algorithm for multi-sensor system. Finally, compared with the traditional algorithms, the simulation results show that the proposed fusion algorithm based on KF-SVM does not need to calculate the sensor cross-covariance matrix and has better estimation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {‘With the help of powerful image editing software, various image modifications are possible which are known as image forgeries. Copy-move is the easiest way of image manipulation, wherein an area of the image is copied and replicated in the same image. The major reason for performing this forgery i s to conceal undesirable contents of the image. Thus, means are required to unveil the presence of duplicated areas in an image. In this article, an effective and efficient approach for copy-move forgery detection (CMFD) is proposed, which is based on stationary wavelet transform (SWT), speeded-up robust features (SURF), and a novel scaled density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (sDBSCAN) clustering. The SWT allows the SURF descriptor to extract only energy-rich features from the input image. The SURF features can detect the tampered regions even under post-processing attacks like contrast adjustment, scaling, and affine transformation on the images. On the extracted features, a novel scaled density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (sDBSCAN) clustering algorithm is applied to detect forged regions with high accuracy as it can easily identify the clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes and can filter the outliers. For performance evaluation, three publicly available datasets namely MICC-F220, MICC-F2000, and image manipulation dataset (IMD) are employed. The qualitative and quantitative analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art CMFD approaches in the presence of different post-processing attacks.},

  abstract     = {Regional integrated energy system (RIES) provides a platform for coupling utilization of multi-energy and makes various energy demand from client possible. The suitable RIES composition scheme will upgrade energy structure and improve integrated energy utilization efficiency. Based on a RIES constr uction project in Jiangsu province, this paper proposes a new multi criteria decision-making (MCDM) method for the selection of RIES schemes. Because that subjective evaluation on RIES schemes benefit under criteria has uncertainty and hesitancy, intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy number (ITFN) which has the better capability to model ill-known quantities is presented. In consideration of risk attitude and interdependency of criteria, a new decision model with risk coefficients, Mahalanobis-Taguchi system and Choquet integral is proposed. Firstly, the decision matrices given by experts are normalized, and then are transformed to minimum expectation matrices according to different risk coefficients. Secondly, the weights of criteria from different experts are calculated by Mahalanobis-Taguchi system. Mobius transformation coefficients based on interaction degree are to calculate 2-order additive fuzzy measures, and then the comprehensive weights of criteria are obtained by fuzzy measures and Choquet integral. Thirdly, based on group decision consensus requirement, the weights of experts are obtained by the maximum entropy and grey correlation. Fourthly, the minimum expectation matrices are aggregated by the intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy Bonferroni mean operator. Thus, the ranking result according to the comparison rules using the minimum expectation and the maximum expectation is obtained. Finally, an illustrative example is taken in the present study to make the proposed method comprehensible.},

In today’s internet era IoT integrates the digital devices, sensing equipment and computing devices for data sensing, gathering and communicate the data to the Base station via the optimal path. WSN, owing to the characteristics such as energy con strained and untrustworthy environment makes them to face many challenges which may affect the performance and QoS of the network. Thus, in WSN based IoT both security and energy efficiency are considered as herculean design challenges and requires important concern for the enhancement of network life time. Hence, to address these problems in this paper a novel secure energy aware cluster based routing algorithm named Trusted Energy Efficient Fuzzy logic based clustering Algorithm (TEEFCA) has been proposed. This algorithm consists of two major objectives. Firstly, the trustworthy nodes are identified, which may act as candidate nodes for cluster based routing. Secondly, the fuzzy inference system is employed under the two circumstances namely selection of optimal Cluster Leader (CL) and cluster formation process by considering the following three parameters such as (i) node’s Residual Energy level (ii) Cluster Density (iii) Distance Node BS. From, the experiment outcomes implemented using MATLAB it have been proved that TEEFCA shows significant improvement in terms of power conservation, network stability and lifetime when compared to the existing cluster aware routing approaches.},

The computation of the objective function deals with the ant colony approach for minimum energy consumption and the varying size of the cluster in each cycle is calculated based on the competition radius.

Distributed applications can transfer data using web services. Trus t is the main criterion to select the appropriate web service. Neuro-fuzzy systems including clustering are applied to assess the trust of single web services. This paper considers nine criteria including quality of service, subjective perspectives, user preference, credibility of raters, objective perspectives, dynamic computing, bootstrapping, independency and security. To obtain a neuro-fuzzy system with high prediction accuracy, the paper considers eight neuro-fuzzy membership functions (i.e., trapmf, gbellmf, trimf, gaussmf, dsigmf, psigmf, gauss2mf, pimf) using the k-means clustering. Also, to increase the speed and reduce the fuzzy rules, a three-level neuro-fuzzy system (13 neuro-fuzzy) is investigated. The main target of this paper is evaluating the trust of single web services using the nine aforementioned criteria, as web services selection is a main issue which is still absorbing researchers to conduct research works on this field and analyze it. Ultimately, the results show reasonable root mean square error (RMSE) amount, precision value, recall value, and F-score value. In comparison to previous research works, this study obtained the lower amounts of errors and presents the more accurate trust of single web services.},

Path planning is a prerequisite for the realization of submarine reconnaissance, surveilla nce, combat and other underwater tasks. The WWO algorithm based on shallow wave theory is a novel evolutionary algorithm that mimics wave motions containing propagation, refraction and breaking to obtain the global optimization solution. The WWO algorithm not only avoids jumps out of the local optimum and premature convergence but also has a faster convergence speed and higher calculation accuracy. To verify the effectiveness and feasibility, the WWO algorithm is applied to solve the randomly generated threat areas and generated fixed threat areas. Compared with other algorithms, the WWO algorithm can effectively balance exploration and exploitation to avoid threat areas and reach the intended target with minimum fuel costs. The experimental results demonstrate that the WWO algorithm has better optimization performance and is robust.},

  abstract     = {The normal intuitionistic fuzzy number (NIFN), which membership function and non-membership function are expressed by normal fuzzy numbers (NFNs), can better describe the normal distribution phenomenon in the real world, but it cannot deal with the situation where the sum of membership function and non-membership function is greater than 1. In order to make up for this defect, based on the idea of q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-ROFNs), we put forward the concept of normal q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-RONFNs), and its remarkable characteristic is that the sum of the qth power of membership function and the qth power of non-membership function is less than or equal to 1, so it can increase the width of expressing uncertain information for decision makers (DMs). In this paper, firstly, we give the basic definition and operational laws of q-RONFNs, propose two related operators to aggregate evaluation information from DMs, and develop an extended indifference threshold-based attribute ratio analysis (ITARA) method to calculate attribute weights. Then considering the multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC) method has strong stability, we combine MABAC with q-RONFNs, put forward the q-RONFNs-MABAC method, and give the concrete decision steps. Finally, we apply the q-RONFNs-MABAC method to solve two examples, and prove the effectiveness and practicability of our proposed method through comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {As a new extended model of fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy set theory is a useful tool to process uncertain information in decision making problems. The traditional hesitant fuzzy multi-attribute decision making (MADM) can only choose an optimal strategy, which is not suitable for all of the complex sce narios. Typically, in practical application, decision making problems may be more complicated involving three options of acceptance, non-commitment and rejection decisions. Three-way decisions, which divide universe into three disjoint regions by a pair of thresholds, are more efficient to deal with these problems. Therefore, how to utilize three-way decision theory to process hesitant fuzzy information is an essential issue to be studied. In this paper, from the perspective of hesitant fuzzy distance, a hesitant fuzzy three-way decision model is proposed. First, because hesitant fuzzy element (HFE) is a set of several possible membership degrees, it cannot be compared with thresholds directly. Hence, this paper converts it into the comparison between the distance and the thresholds. Then, to calculate thresholds more reasonably, shadowed set theory is introduced to avoid the subjectivity of threshold acquisition. Furthermore, sequential strategy is adopted to solve the multi-attribute decision making problems. Finally, an example of medical diagnosis and simulation experiments are given to prove the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed hesitant fuzzy three-way decision model.},

  abstract     = {Traffic congestion on a road results in a ripple effect to other neighbouring roads. Previous research revealed existence of spatial correlation on neighbouring roads. Similar traffic patterns with regards to day and time can be seen amongst roads in a neighbouring area. Presently, nonlinear models of neural network are applied on historical data to predict traffic congestion. Even though neural network has successfully modelled complex relationships, more time is needed to train the network. A non-parametric approach, the k-nearest neighbour (K-NN) is another method for forecasting traffic condition which can capture the nonlinear characteristics of traffic flow. An earlier study has been done to predict traffic flow using K-NN based on connected roads (both downstream and upstream). However, impact of road congestion is not only to connected roads, but also to roads surrounding it. Surrounding roads that are impacted by road congestion are those having ‘high relationship’ with neighbouring roads. Thus, this study aims to predict traffic state using K-NN by determining high relationship roads within neighbouring roads. We determine the highest relationship neighbouring roads by clustering the surrounding roads by combining grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) with k-means. Our experiments showed that prediction of traffic state using K-NN based on high relationship roads using both GLCM and k-means produced better accuracy than using k-means only.},

Dynamic economic load dispatch optimally shares the power on an hourly basis for a day among the com mitted generating units to satisfy the feasible load demand. Emission of pollutants from the combustion fossil fuel and gradual depletion of fossil fuel encourages the usage of renewable energy sources. Implementation of renewable energy sources with the reinforcement of green energy transforms the fossil fuel-based plant into a hybrid generating plant. The increase in power production with the increase in electricity demand implicates challenges for economical operation. The proposed algorithm is applied to the DED problem for fossil fuel based and renewable energy system to find economic schedule of generated power among the committed generating units. The proposed optimization algorithm is inspired by the huddling behavior of the emperor penguin. The exploration strategy is enhanced by adapting oppositional based learning. Chaotic mapping is used to maintain a proper balance between exploration and exploitation in the entire search space, which minimizes the cost of generation in the power system.},

The problem is formulated for maximizing the sum rate of MIMO-NOM A by assigning power to multiple layers of users. In order to overcome these problems, two distinct evolutionary algorithms are applied. In particular, the recently implemented Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) and the prominent Optimization of Particle Swarm (PSO) are utilized in this process. The MIMO-NOMA model optimizes the power allocation by layered transmission using the proposed Joint User Clustering and Salp Particle Swarm Optimization (PPSO) power allocation algorithm. Also, the closed-form expression is extracted from the current Channel State Information (CSI) on the transmitter side for the achievable sum rate. The efficiency of the proposed optimal power allocation algorithm is evaluated by the spectral efficiency, achievable rate, and energy efficiency of 120.8134bits/s/Hz, 98Mbps, and 22.35bits/Joule/Hz respectively. Numerical results have shown that the proposed PSO algorithm has improved performance than the state of art techniques in optimization. The outcomes on the numeric values indicate that the proposed PSO algorithm is capable of accurately improving the initial random solutions and converging to the optimum.},

Various approaches have been proposed and implemented concerning the indoor positioning systems. This stud y propose an fuzzy inference based Kalman filter to improve the position estimation in indoor navigation. The presented system is based on FIS based Kalman filter aiming at predicting the actual sensor readings from the available noisy sensor measurements. The proposed approach has two main components, i.e., multi sensor fusion algorithm for positioning estimation and FIS based Kalman filter algorithm. The position estimation module is used to determine the object location in an indoor environment in an accurate way. Similarly, the FIS based Kalman filter is used to control and tune the Kalman filter by considering the previous output as a feedback. The Kalman filter predicts the actual sensor readings from the available noisy readings. To evaluate the proposed approach, the next-generation inertial measurement unit is used to acquire a three-axis gyroscope and accelerometer sensory data. Lastly, the proposed approach’s performance has been investigated considering the MAD, RMSE, and MSE metrics. The obtained results illustrate that the FIS based Kalman filter improve the prediction accuracy against the traditional Kalman filter approach.},

However, part-of-speech information was not considered to guide the learning of feature representation and feature mapping in previous pivot-based models. Therefore, we present a fused part-of-speech vectors and attention-based model (FAM). In our model, we fuse part-of-speech vectors and feature word embeddings as the representation of features, giving deep semantics to mapping features. And we adopt Multi-Head attention mechanism to train the cross-domain sentiment classifier to obtain the connection between different features.

  abstract     = {Large-scale datasets collected from heterogeneous sources often require a join operation to extract valuable information. MapReduce is an efficient programming model for processing large-scale data. However, it has some limitations in processing heterogeneous datasets. This is because of the large amount of redundant intermediate records that are transferred through the network. Several filtering techniques have been developed to improve the join performance, but they require multiple MapReduce jobs to process the input datasets. To address this issue, the adaptive filter-based join algorithms are presented in this paper. Specifically, three join algorithms are introduced to perform the processes of filters creation and redundant records elimination within a single MapReduce job. A cost analysis of the introduced join algorithms shows that the I/O cost is reduced compared to the state-of-the-art filter-based join algorithms. The performance of the join algorithms was evaluated in terms of the total execution time and the total amount of I/O data transferred. The experimental results show that the adaptive Bloom join, semi-adaptive intersection Bloom join, and adaptive intersection Bloom join decrease the total execution time by 30%, 25%, and 35%, respectively; and reduce the total amount of I/O data transferred by 18%, 25%, and 50%, respectively.},

Implicit models such as GANs tend to generate better samples compared to explicit models that are trained on tractable data likelihood. However, GANs overlook the exp licit data density characteristics which leads to undesirable quantitative evaluations and mode collapse. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid generative adversarial network (HGAN) for which we can enforce data density estimation via an autoregressive model and support both adversarial and likelihood framework in a joint training manner which diversify the estimated density in order to cover different modes. We propose to use an adversarial network to transfer knowledge from an autoregressive model (teacher) to the generator (student) of a GAN model. A novel deep architecture within the GAN formulation is developed to adversarially distill the autoregressive model information in addition to simple GAN training approach. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets (i.e., MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HGAN under qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The experimental results show the superiority and competitiveness of our method compared to the baselines.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is a severe disease for women health, however, with expensive diagnostic cost or obsolete medical technique, many patients are hard to obtain prompt medical treatment. Thus, efficient detection result of breast cancer while lower medical cost may be a promising way to protect women he alth. Breast cancer detection using all features will take a lot of time and computational resources. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a novel framework with surrogate-assisted firefly algorithm (FA) for breast cancer detection (SFA-BCD). As an advanced evolutionary algorithm (EA), FA is adopted to make feature selection, and the machine learning as classifier identify the breast cancer. Moreover, the surrogate model is utilized to decrease computation cost and expensive computation, which is the approximation function built by offline data to the real object function. The comprehensive experiments have been conducted under several breast cancer dataset derived from UCI. Experimental results verified that the proposed framework with surrogate-assisted FA significantly reduced the computation cost.},

  abstract     = {For deep learning’s insufficient learning ability of a small amount of data in the Chinese named entity recognition based on deep learning, this paper proposes a named entity recognition of local adverse drug reactions based on Adversarial Transfer Learning, and constructs a neural network model AS AIBC consisting of Adversarial Transfer Learning, Self-Attention, independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN), Bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and conditional random field (CRF). However, of the task of Chinese named entity recognition (NER), there are only few open labeled data sets. Therefore, this article introduces Adversarial Transfer Learning network to fully utilize the boundary of Chinese word segmentation tasks (CWS) and NER tasks for information sharing. Plus, the specific information in the CWS is also filtered. Combing with Self-Attention mechanism and IndRNN, this feature’s expression ability is enhanced, thus allowing the model to concern the important information of different entities from different levels. Along with better capture of the dependence relations of long sentences, the recognition ability of the model is further strengthened. As all the results gained from WeiBoNER and MSRA data sets by ASAIBC model are better than traditional algorithms, this paper conducts an experiment on the data set of Xinjiang local named entity recognition of adverse drug reactions (XJADRNER) based on manual labeling, with the accuracy, precision, recall and F-Score value being 98.97%, 91.01%, 90.21% and 90.57% respectively. These experimental results have shown that ASAIBC model can significantly improve the NER performance of local adverse drug reactions in Xinjiang.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of the Internet of Things and 5G networks have generated a large amount of data. By offloading computing tasks from mobile devices to edge servers with sufficient computing resources, network congestion and data transmission delays can be effectively reduced. The placement of edge server is the core of task offloading and is a multi-objective optimization problem with multiple resource constraints. Efficient placement approach can effectively meet the needs of mobile users to access services with low latency and high bandwidth. To this end, an optimization model of edge server placement has been established in this paper through minimizing both communication delay and load difference as the optimization goal. Then, an Edge Server placement based on meta-Heuristic alGorithM (ESH-GM) has been proposed to achieve multi-objective optimization. Firstly, the K-means algorithm is combined with the ant colony algorithm, and the pheromone feedback mechanism is introduced into the placement of edge servers by emulating the mechanism of ant colony sharing pheromone in the foraging process, and the ant colony algorithm is improved by setting the taboo table to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm. Then, the improved heuristic algorithm is used to solve the optimal placement of edge servers. Experimental results using Shanghai Telecom’s real datasets show that the proposed ESH-GM achieves an optimal balance between low latency and load balancing, while guaranteeing quality of service, which outperforms several existing representative approaches.},

In addition, better than the distance measures given by predecessors, we define a new quaternary function on IVIFSs to construct the above-mentioned distance measures, which called interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy dissimilarity function. Two specific methods for building the quaternary functions are proposed. Moreover, we also analyzed the degradation of the distance measures in this paper, and show that our measures can perfectly cover the measures on a simpler set. Finally, we provide illustrative examples in pattern recognition and medical diagnosis problems to confirm the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed distance measures.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy is found to be the fourth most common chronic neurological disorder that tends to abnormal and unpredictable brain activity and seizure states. According to statistics, 70% of the epilepsy patients can be cured if identified and treated with anti-epileptic drugs or shock stimulations. Only about 7% to 8% need to be operated. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a cheap and effective way to record the prolonged activities of the brain through electrical impulses between neural cells. Seizure is difficult to detect in neonates as the signal involves a lot of disturbances and the existing high accuracy system for adults can’t be used for neonates. In an attempt to build an impregnable system to detect seizure in early stages, EEG signals of neonates procured from Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the Helsinki University Hospital. These signals were processed and fed into three different robust algorithms –Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN). The experimental results were compared and the proposed CNN model with 95.99% accuracy outperforms all the state-of-art models for automated Epileptic Seizure prediction in Neonates. Deep CNN has been a powerful tool in extracting robust features from EEG signals. This generalized system can be used by medical experts for detecting Seizure in neonates with better accuracy and reliability.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a Stewart’s positive solution optimization model is proposed, for obtaining the complex solution to a Stewart’s forward kinematics problem, considering the existence of multiple solutions. The model converts the positive kinematics problem into an optimization problem, in which the v alue of the objective function is used to represent the precision of Stewart’s positive solution. A self-aggregating moth–flame optimization algorithm (SMFO) is used to improve the accuracy of Stewart’s forward kinematics solution. Two features were added to the conventional MFO algorithm to obtain a more stable balance between global and local explorations. First, Gaussian distribution was used for the flame population to select suitable individuals for Levy Flight operation, increase the diversity of the population, and enhance the algorithm’s ability to jump out of a local optimum. Second, in the middle and late iterations, the positions of the flames were periodically adjusted using the light intensity-attraction characteristic (LIAC) to strengthen the connection between individual flames and enhance the local exploration ability of the algorithm. The proposed SMFO algorithm is compared with three classic meta-heuristic algorithms for eight benchmark functions. Experimental results indicate that the SMFO algorithm is significantly better than the other three algorithms in terms of solution quality and convergence rate. To verify the effectiveness of the SMFO algorithm in solving the Stewart positive kinematics optimization model, values of eight sets of conventional position and posture parameters as well as limiting position and posture parameters were randomly obtained, and values of 16 sets of position and posture parameters were obtained using four algorithms. The results indicate that the SMFO algorithm can improve the accuracy of the forward kinematics solution to 4.05E-09 mm.},

  abstract     = {Decision making (DM) is an important process encountered in every moment of life. Since it is difficult to interpret life depending on a single criterion, Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) enables to make decisions easier by creating appropriate choice in situations of uncertainty, complexity, and conflicting objectives. Therefore, we have studied the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) which is one of the MCDM methods based on binary comparison logic. When uncertainties concerning the nature of life are considered, the solution procedure of AHP has been addressed by using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Numbers (IT2FN)s to obtain more realistic results. The usability of AHP with IT2FN is increased by amplifying hierarchy with sub-levels. Since sub-criterion may also need to be evaluated on sub-criteria in some cases of real multi-criteria problems, it is explicitly essential that each of sub-sub-criterion is included in the hierarchy at the own level in the real sense. In this paper, a new multilevel type-2 fuzzy AHP method is expanded by adding sub-criteria to the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy AHP (IT2FAHP) method developed by Kahraman et al. [C. Kahraman, B. Öztayşi, İ. Sarı and B. Turanoğlu, Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process with interval type-2 fuzzy sets, Knowledge-Based Systems 59 (2014), 48–57.]. Thanks to the extended method, another aim is to ensure that even complex situations that have multiple levels can be solved simply. Also, the proposed method is illustrated with a portfolio selection problem. Thus, the AHP method with type-2 fuzzy sets is carried out to the portfolio selection problem, which is in the scope of finance theory, for the first time in the literature.},

The problem of site selection for nursing homes is a complex system engineering problem that involves not onl y economic interests but also social interests. Due to the limitations of human thinking in the evaluation process, the evaluation value of a nursing home site might be an interval grey number. Moreover, the evaluation indicator system for nursing home locations is a two-layer system that has been neglected in the literature. Therefore, the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process is extended to a new grey approach, i.e., the grey analytic hierarchy process, which can solve the evaluation problems for a two-layer indicator system under an interval grey environment. By constructing a three-point interval grey number, grey evaluation criteria are given to obtain a judgment matrix for interval grey numbers. Definitions of the initial weights, nongreyness weights and integrated weights are proposed to find the best evaluation object. Finally, the effectiveness of the method proposed by this paper is verified by comparative analyses of other grey methods.},

  abstract     = {Classification methods play an important role in many fields. However, they cannot effectively classify the samples from sample spaces that are varying with time, for they lack continual learning ability. A continual learning classification method for time-varying data space based on artificial imm une system, CLCMTVD, is proposed. It is inspired by the intelligent mechanism that memory cells of the biological immune system can recognize and eliminate previous invaders when they attack again very fast and more efficiently, and these memory cells can evolve with the evolution of previous invaders. Memory cells were continuously updated by learning testing data during the testing stage, thus realize the self-improvement of classification performance. CLCMTVD changes a linearly inseparable spatial problem into many classification problems of several different times, and it degenerates into a common supervised learning classification method when all data independent of time. To assess the performance and possible advantages of CLCMTVD, the experiments on well-known datasets from UCI repository, synthetic data and XJTU-SY rolling element bearing accelerated life test datasets were performed. Results show that CLCMTVD has better classification performance for time-invariant data, and outperforms the other methods for time-varying data space.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic and frequent re-clustering of nodes along with data aggregation is used to achieve energy-efficient operation in wireless sensor networks. But dynamic cluster formation supports data aggregation only when clusters can be formed using any set of nodes that lie in close proximity to each othe r. Frequent re-clustering makes network management difficult and adversely affects the use of energy efficient TDMA-based scheduling for data collection within the clusters. To circumvent these issues, a centralized Fixed-Cluster Architecture (FCA) has been proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme leads to a simplified network implementation for smart spaces where it makes more sense to aggregate data that belongs to a cluster of sensors located within the confines of a designated area. A comparative study is done with dynamic clusters formed with a distributive Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) and a centralized Harmonic Search Algorithm (HSA). Using uniform cluster size for FCA, the results show that it utilizes the available energy efficiently by providing stability period values that are 56% and 41% more as compared to LEACH and HSA respectively.},

In CVRP, several vehicles start their journey from a central depot to provide services to different cities and finally return to the depot. This paper introduces an additional time beyond t he service time at each city to fulfill the pre-ordered demands. The need for this excess service time is to provide the services to new customers who are not enlisted at the start of the process. It is a market enhancement step. The proposed model’s main objective is to find the maximum time-dependent profit by using the optimum number of vehicles in an appropriate route and spending optimum excess service time in each city. The model considers travel time and travel cost as fuzzy numbers. An expected value model (EVM) is formulated using the credibility approach on fuzzy variables. A hybrid meta-heuristic method combining a genetic algorithm (GA) and bacteria foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA) is designed to solve the proposed model. The proposed model is explained with the help of some numerical examples. Sensitivity analyses based on different independent parameters of the algorithms are also conducted.},

  abstract     = {Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has emerged recently due to its advancements and applications in various scientific and industrial fields. WSN consists a set of low cost and readily deployable sensors to monitor targets and recognise the physical phenomena. The principal challenge in WSN is to deploy these sensor nodes in optimal positions to achieve efficient network. Such network should satisfy the quality of service requirements in order to achieve high performance levels. Hence, this paper focuses on target Q-coverage problem where each target requires different number of sensors to monitor them. A Sequential Vertex Coloring based Sensor Placement (SVC-SP) algorithm is proposed to determine the number of sensors required and its optimal spot to satisfy the coverage quality requirement. The SVC-SP algorithm determines sensor requirement by partitioning the target set into independent subsets depending on the target’s position and the sensor’s sensing range. Each independent set consists set of targets that are nearer in the network such that a common sensor is sufficient to monitor them. The cardinality of such independent subsets provides the sensor requirement for target coverage. The optimal spot for each target is determined by the mean positioning of the targets in each independent set. This process is repeated until the q-requirement for each target is satisfied. Further, to improve the optimal spot for sensors, the random based SVC-SP algorithm, cuckoo search based SVC-SP algorithm and the genetic algorithm based SVC-SP algorithm are utilized. The simulation results show that genetic algorithm based SVC-SP algorithm performs better than other existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims at improving the operation of the water distribution networks (WDN) by developing a leak monitoring framework. To do that, an online statistical hypothesis test based on leak detection is proposed. The developed technique, the so-called exponentially weighted online reduced kernel g eneralized likelihood ratio test (EW-ORKGLRT), is addressed so that the modeling phase is performed using the reduced kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) model, which is capable of dealing with the higher computational cost. Then the computed model is fed to EW-ORKGLRT chart for leak detection purposes. The proposed approach extends the ORKGLRT method to the one that uses exponential weights for the residuals in the moving window. It might be able to further enhance leak detection performance by detecting small and moderate leaks. The developed method’s main advantages are first dealing with the higher required computational time for detecting leaks and then updating the KPCA model according to the dynamic change of the process. The developed method’s performance is evaluated and compared to the conventional techniques using simulated WDN data. The selected performance criteria are the excellent detection rate, false alarm rate, and CPU time.},

The datasets employed for experimentation are preproces sed and extracted using an automated segmentation technique using bit plane level data of radiograph images. The flow of proposed work is comprised of three stages, in stage 1 preprocessing is carried out, classification of preprocessed radiographs are classified into male and female samples using convolution kernels based deep neural net. Further, distance features are extracted from the origin of carpal bones to tip of extracted phalangeal regions in the classified outcomes from stage 2 using imtool image analyzer. Finally, classification of distance features is performed using Support Vector Machines with Gaussian Kernel (SVM-GK) to label the radiographs into ages from 1 to 17. The experimentation is performed on the datasets of Pediatric Bone Age challenge of Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) of about 12000 images of 1–17 year age groups. The convergence between actual and clinically validated chronological age is also tested with Gaussian process regression model (GPRM) along with SVM. A very minimal loss of about 4.7% is occurred during classification using deep neural network. The classification accuracy is found to be 76.8% and 88.1% and 0.75 and 1.41 RMSE with respect to GPRM and SVM-GK.},

This paper proposes a three-way decision method based on hybrid data. First, the distance between two objects based on the conditional attribute set in a given hybrid information system is developed and Gaussian kernel based on this distance is acquired. Then, the fuzzy Tcos-equivalence relation, induced by this information system, is obtained by using Gaussian kernel. Next, the decision-theoretic rough set model in this hybrid information system is presented. Moreover, a three-way decision method is given by means of this decision-theoretic rough set model and inclusion degree between two fuzzy sets. Finally, an example is employed to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method, which may provide an effective method for hybrid data analysis in real applications.},

  abstract     = {The image intelligent processing analysis technology uses a computer to imitate and execute some intellectual functions of the human brain, and realizes an image processing system with artificial intelligence, that is, an image processing analysis technology is an understanding of an image. The deg ree of intelligent automated analysis and processing is low, many operations need to be done manually, causing human error, inaccurate detection, and time-consuming and laborious. Deep learning method can extract features step by step in the original image from the bottom to the top. Therefore, based on feature analysis technology, this paper uses the deep learning method to intelligently and automatically analyse the visual image. This method only needs to send the image into the system, and then the manual analysis is not needed, and the analysis result of the final image can be obtained. The process is completely intelligent and automatically processed. First, improve the deep learning model and use massive image data to choose and optimize parameters. Results indicate that our method not only automatically derives the semantic information of the image, but also accurately understands the image accurately and improve the work efficiency.},

It is responsible for providing safe and reliable electrical energy to urban rail trains and power lighting equipment. This paper processes the ob tained long-period rail transit power load learning sample data matrix, according to the principle of normalization processing, effectively eliminates irregular data in the sample set and fills in possible missing data, thereby eliminating bad data or fake data for model learning. Moreover, this avoids the generation of huge errors that cause exponential growth in the model due to the increase in the learning sample size and the irregularity of the data. According to the characteristics of power load, this paper comprehensively considers the influence of temperature and date type on the maximum daily load, applies the fuzzy neural network model to the long-period load forecasting of long-period rail transit, and introduces the whole process of establishing the forecasting model in detail. Through detailed analysis of the actual data provided by the EUNITE network, the relevant factors affecting the daily maximum load were determined, and then the appropriate fuzzy input was selected to establish the corresponding fuzzy neural network prediction model, and a relatively ideal prediction result was obtained. The experimental results fully proved the great potential of fuzzy neural network in long-term power load forecasting.},

  abstract     = {Small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises have the characteristics of large numbers and small scales. Problems such as backward manufacturing technology, lack of talents, small amount of information resources, and insufficient product research and development capabilities have severely restr icted the development of enterprises. The backward manufacturing design model cannot adapt to the development trend of modern manufacturing informatization. This paper proposes and designs a fuzzy inference model and fuzzy inference engine algorithm with threshold. In order to describe the numerical multiple input and multiple output variables in the industrial manufacturing design industry, the relevant experience is used to make numerical reasoning decisions. Applying fuzzy sets and fuzzy theory to the expert system, a fuzzy rule model containing the membership function information and thresholds of the corresponding fuzzy sets is proposed and established, and a fuzzy reasoning system suitable for numerical and uncertain reasoning decisions is constructed. The improved grey relational analysis method is used to decompose and evaluate the exponential mathematical quantitative process of manufacturing enterprises. Based on the fuzzy Decision Analytic Network Process (DANP) method to calculate the relative weight of the influencing factors in the evaluation system, the evaluation index of the enterprise is obtained. Starting from the industrial manufacturing design process, this article constructs a relatively comprehensive and reasonable enterprise exponential mathematical quantitative process decomposition evaluation system. Considering that there are complex interactions between the various influencing factors in the system, the fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method is selected to process the direct impact matrix of the evaluation system, and the causal relationship between the indicators is obtained. The fuzzy exponential gray correlation method is used to evaluate the quantitative process of industrial manufacturing design, avoiding the shortcomings of traditional methods that only consider ideal values.},

In view of this phenomenon, this paper will study a new school-enterprise cooperation mechanism based on the improved decision tree algorithm. The research of this paper is divided into three parts. First, after analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the algorithm, the algorithm of the decision tree is improved, which makes the improved algorithm more suitable for the field of school-enterprise cooperation. Then, based on cloud computing and intelligence, this paper establishes a new model of school-enterprise cooperation platform, which solves some problems of data management and information exchange in school-enterprise cooperation. Finally, in order to make the cooperation mechanism of this paper better used in practice, this paper builds an online and offline hybrid training base, hoping to make the cooperation between schools and enterprises closer through the training base. In order to test the effect of the cooperation model, this paper takes school as the experimental model. After investigation and research, it is believed that thanks to the school-enterprise cooperation mechanism in this paper, the cooperative enterprise of school has been greatly improved in the past three years, and the willingness of enterprises to cooperate has become more and more strong.

Therefore, this article mainly introduces the symbol recognition system based on 3D stereo vision. The three-dimensional image is ta ken by the visual coordinate measuring machine in two places on the left and right. Perform binocular stereo matching on the edge of the feature points of the two images. A corner detection algorithm combining SUSAN and Harris is used to detect the left and right camera calibration templates. The two-dimensional coordinate points of the object are determined by the image stereo matching module, and the three-dimensional discrete coordinate points of the object space can be obtained according to the transformation relationship between the image coordinates and the actual object coordinates. Then draw the three-dimensional model of the object through the three-dimensional drawing software. Experimental data shows that the logic resources and memory resources occupied by image preprocessing account for 30.4% and 27.4% of the entire system, respectively. The results show that the system can calibrate the internal and external parameters of the camera. In this way, the camera calibration result will be more accurate and the range will be wider. At the same time, it can effectively make up for the shortcomings of traditional modeling techniques to ensure the measurement accuracy of the detection system.},

  abstract     = {The potato itself has high nutritional value, strong adaptability, long industrial chain and extremely stable yield. At the same time, due to the rich variety of processed products, the further improvement of China’s social and economic level is greatly strengthened. In February 2016, the Ministry of Agriculture issued guiding opinions on promoting the development of the potato industry, which took potato as the main food product for industrial development. The central government attaches great importance to the rapid development of the potato industry, but at the same time, it also exposes many problems, which affect the production and development of the potato industry to a large extent. In order to change this problem, the relevant staff needs to strengthen the application of intelligent technology, so as to improve the level of potato production and processing and improve the competitive advantage of China’s potato industry. There are many types of research on the potato industry in China, but most of them focus on Cultivation and maintenance skills, and there is almost no research on market competition of agricultural products economic management based on the intelligent system. Based on the current situation of potato production in China, combined with the advantages of an intelligent system, this paper analyzes its competitive advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of economic management, and constructs the industrial competitiveness analysis model with the intelligent system as the core technology, and analyzes and discusses the adverse factors affecting the competitiveness. And from the perspective of international trade, the export competitiveness of China’s potato industry was analyzed. Finally, we collected Ximeng as the sample of this study and verified the core points of improving competitiveness from the research.

The algorithm does not depend on the initial value of the system and is combined with the open-loop D-type iterative learning law. We design a period that shortens as the number of iteration s increases. During this period, the controller corrects the state deviation, so that the system tracking error converges to the boundary unrelated to the initial state error, which is determined only by the system’s uncertainty and interference. Furthermore, based on the λ norm theory, the appropriate control gain is selected to suppress the tracking error caused by the sensor fault, and the uniform convergence of the control algorithm and the boundedness of the error are proved. The simulation results of the speed control of the injection molding machine system verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

Although there are many research results on the nonlinear classification of the basketball sports neural network model, usually only one model is used, which has certain defects. The combination forecasting model based on the ARIMA model and neural network based on LSTM can make up for this defect. In the process of the experiment, the most important is the construction of the combination model and the acquisition of volunteer data in the process of the ball game. In this experiment, the ARIMA model is used as the linear part of the data, and LSTM neural network model is used to get the sequence of body injury. The results of the empirical study show that: it is reasonable to divide the injury of thigh and calf in the process of basketball sports, which is very consistent with the force point of the human body in the process of sports. The results of the two models predicting the average degree of bodily injury for many times are about 0.32 and 0.38 respectively, which are far less than 1. The execution time of the program for simultaneous prediction on the computer is about 1 minute, which is extremely effective.},

The results show that the main motion variables corresponding to the conjugate complex root (0.0530.287i) are the velocity and pitch angle of the aircraft, and they all change slowly and long period.

This art icle mainly studies the company’s employee quality evaluation model based on BP neural network. This article first collects and preprocesses employees’ usual performance data, and then predicts their corresponding quality scores based on BP neural network. And use MATLAB software to simulate the constructed prediction model, and finally develop a complete set of employee performance data prediction system based on this model, so as to achieve the purpose of employee quality evaluation. The experimental data in this paper shows that the average relative error of model training output tends to be stable. After the 40th iteration of training, the average relative error of model training can reach 0.0128. After the prediction model training was completed, 15 sets of verification samples were used to verify the model. The verification results found that the average relative error of the model converged, so the model did not overfit. Experimental results show that although BP neural network has two excellent functions of adaptive and nonlinear approximation, it can solve the complex nonlinear relationship between normal performance and overall performance. But BP neural network still has its own inevitable shortcomings in some aspects. For example the redundancy between the employee scoring sample data; the problem that the input variable dimensionality is too high, which leads to the low efficiency of the model; the fuzzy neural network is easy to fall into the local optimum and it is difficult to find the global optimum.},

In the previous studies, rumor clarification is mostly finished by relying on external media or news reports instead of intervening and controlling from inside the network, which causes that the speed of rumor clarification is far lower than the speed of rumor spreading, and it is not ideal for the effect of rumor clarification. In this paper, a new Twin-SIR spreading model is proposed, in which, a rumor clarification node named as “rumor dispeller” with the spreading ability is introduced. The rumor dispeller is involved in the spreading process of the model together with the rumor spreader to control the spreading of rumor and thus to achieve the purpose of clarifying rumor. At the same time, during the process of building the model, we also apply the traditional media as a spreading parameter to the spreading process of the model. We built the mean-field equation of the model and then implemented further analysis of the model on homogeneous networks and heterogeneous networks. Through experimental simulations, the “rumor dispeller” was found to have the ability to reduce the spread of rumor spreading, and that the selection of the initial “rumor dispeller” node can affect the effect of rumor spreading, and at the same time, the external media have an important influence on rumor clarification.

The experimental results in this paper show that after planting fibrous stem cells with different elastic modulus, the cell proliferation is obvious after the tensile mechanical stimulation of different conditions, and the different elastic modulus scaffolds are stimulated by the tensile mechanical stimulation of 2% tensile amplitude. The cell morphology is different. The low elastic modulus is round-like, and the high elastic modulus is fusiform-like. After 5% and 12% stretch amplitude, the cells are oriented at different elastic modulus. Arranged, there is no obvious difference in cell morphology.},

Sub optimal strategies were used in these models to estimate the sparsest coefficients. In this work various algorithms were analyzed to address its optima l solutions. The sparsest solution can be found for the linear equations which are under determined. In this work, a complete study is carried out based on Compressive Sensing Matching Pursuit Back Tracking Iterative Hard Threshold (CMPBIHT) algorithm in the real-world scenario. As the BIHT algorithm may often fail to converge and its performance seems to be degraded if the conditions fail. To address these challenges, we have modified the BIHT algorithm to guarantee the convergence using the proposed method, even in this regime. Further the proposed CMPBIHT algorithm is evaluated and compared with the state of art techniques and it is observed that the proposed algorithm retains the similarities of the original algorithm. In this proposed model we have adopted the Compressive Sensing (CS) schemes along with Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). With this proposal we are able to solve the least squares problem for the new residual. We also investigated the reliability in sparse solutions along with compressive sensing techniques while decoding and over complete representations. An extensive research is carried out at the reconstruction side with the fundamental theme of CS, IHT and OMP techniques. The simulation results perform better efficiency at the reconstruction of the Gaussians signals by guaranteeing the productions in the residual error and noise. Further the proposed algorithm performs better at the reconstruction with nominal complexity in each of the iteration computationally.},

In this study, we propose a method by which user clustering, improved genetic, and rectangular region path planning algorithms are combined to design personalized travel routes for users. First, the social relationships of users are analyzed, and close friends are clustered into categories to obtain several friend clusters. Next, the historical trajectory data of users in the cluster are analyzed to obtain joint points in the trajectory map, these are matched according to the keywords entered by users. Finally, the search area is narrowed and the recommended travel route is obtained through improved genetic and rectangular region path planning algorithms. Theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations show that the proposed method is more accurate at path prediction and regional coverage than other methods. In particular, the average area coverage rate of the proposed method is better than that of the existing algorithm, with a maximum increasement ratio of 31.80%.},

  abstract     = {Protecting information from manipulation is important challenge in current days. Digital images are one of the most popular information representation. Images could be used in several fields such as military, social media, security purposes, intelligence fields, evidences in courts, and newspapers. Digital image forgeries mean adding unusual patterns to the original images that cause a heterogeneity manner in form of image properties. Copy move forgery is one of the hardest types of image forgeries to be detected. It is happened by duplicating part or section of the image then adding again in the image itself but in another location. Forgery detection algorithms are used in image security when the original content is not available. This paper illustrates a new approach for Copy Move Forgery Detection (CMFD) built basically on deep learning. The proposed model is depending on applying (Convolution Neural Network) CNN in addition to Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (CovLSTM) networks. This method extracts image features by a sequence number of Convolutions (CNVs) layers, ConvLSTM layers, and pooling layers then matching features and detecting copy move forgery. This model had been applied to four aboveboard available databases: MICC-F220, MICC-F2000, MICC-F600, and SATs-130. Moreover, datasets have been combined to build new datasets for all purposes of generalization testing and coping with an over-fitting problem. In addition, the results of applying ConvLSTM model only have been added to show the differences in performance between using hybrid ConvLSTM and CNN compared with using CNN only. The proposed algorithm, when using number of epoch’s equal 100, gives high accuracy reached to 100% for some datasets with lowest Testing Time (TT) time nearly 1 second for some datasets when compared with the different previous algorithms.},

Aiming at the problem o f missing probabilistic information in the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy element, a new complement scheme is proposed. In this scheme, the weighted average result of the original data information is used to complement, and the original data information is retained to a large extent. Then this paper proposes several probabilistic hesitant fuzzy distance measures based on Lance distance. The decision reference point is constructed by the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy Lance distance, which overcomes the influence of the extreme value on the decision-making result, and defines the value function based on the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy Lance distance. In view of the fact that the attribute weights are completely unknown, the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy exponential entropy is constructed by using the actual data, and the attribute weights of different prospect states are obtained. Aiming at the problem that attribute weights of different prospect states have different effects on the cumulative prospect value, the expression of the cumulative prospect value is improved. The improved closeness coefficient of the TOPSIS method is used to order the emergency schemes. Finally, the new method is applied to the emergency decision-making case of a sudden outbreak of epidemic respiratory disease. The results show that the contrast of the new method is obvious, which is conducive to distinguish different schemes. The new method is more suitable for the complex and changeable emergency decision-making field.},

In this paper, a multi-objective optimization model is built to find the optimum operation scheme of the natural gas transmission network. This model aims to balance two conflicting optimization objective named maximum a specified node delivery flow rate and minimum compressor station power consumption cost. The decision variables involve continuous and discrete variables, including node delivery flow rate, number of running compressors and their rotational speed. Besides, a series of equality and inequality constraints for nodes, pipelines and compressor stations are introduced to control the optimization results. Then, the developed optimization model is applied to a practical large tree-topology gas transmission network, which is 2,229 km in length with 7 compressor stations, 2 gas injection nodes and 20 gas delivery nodes. The ɛ-constraint method and GAMS/DICOPT solver are adopted to solve the bi-objective optimization model. The optimization result obtained is a set of Pareto optimal solutions. To verify the validity of the proposed method, the optimization results are compared with the actual operation scheme. Through the comparison of different Pareto optimal solutions, the variation law of objective functions and decision variables between different optimal solutions are clarified. Finally, sensitivity analyses are also performed to determine the influence of operating parameter changes on the optimization results.},

  abstract     = {Graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which are capable of effectively processing graph-structural data, have been successfully applied in text classification task. Existing studies on GCN based text classification model largely concerns with the utilization of word co-occurrence and Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF–IDF) information for graph construction, which to some extent ignore the context information of the texts. To solve this problem, we propose a gating context-aware text classification model with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and graph convolutional network, named as Gating Context GCN (GC-GCN). More specifically, we integrate the graph embedding with BERT embedding by using a GCN with gating mechanism to enable the acquisition of context coding. We carry out text classification experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed model. Experimental results shown our model has respectively obtained 0.19%, 0.57%, 1.05% and 1.17% improvements over the Text-GCN baseline on the 20NG, R8, R52, and Ohsumed benchmark datasets. Furthermore, to overcome the problem that word co-occurrence and TF–IDF are not suitable for graph construction for short texts, Euclidean distance is used to combine with word co-occurrence and TF–IDF information. We obtain an improvement by 1.38% on the MR dataset compared to Text-GCN baseline.},

  abstract     = {Three-way decisions, as a better way than two-way decisions, has played an important role in many fields. As an extension of formal concept, rough semiconcept constitutes a new approach for data analysis. By now, three-way concept, which combines three-way decisions with formal concept, has been an efficient tool for knowledge representation problems. Hence, we want to further apply three-way decisions to rough semiconcept. In this work, we introduce three-way rough semiconcept by an example, which combines rough semiconcept with the assistant of three-way decisions. After that, we attain the structure of all three-way rough semiconcepts from an algebraic perspective. Furthermore, we give two kinds of approximation operators, which can characterize three-way rough semiconcepts. Finally, we present algorithms for searching three-way rough semiconcepts. An example is to demonstrate the correct and effective of algorithms in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) as a successful optimization algorithm is widely used in many practical applications due to its advantages in fast convergence speed and convenient implementation. As a population optimization algorithm, the quality of initial population plays an important role in the performance of PSO. However, random initialization is used in population initialization for PSO. Using the solution of the solved problem as prior knowledge will help to improve the quality of the initial population solution. In this paper, we use homotopy analysis method (HAM) to build a bridge between the solved problems and the problems to be solved. Therefore, an improved PSO framework based on HAM, called HAM-PSO, is proposed. The framework of HAM-PSO includes four main processes. It contains obtaining the prior knowledge, constructing homotopy function, generating initial solution and solving the to be solved by PSO. In fact, the framework does not change the PSO, but replaces the random population initialization. The basic PSO algorithm and three others typical PSO algorithms are used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of this framework. The experimental results show that the four PSO using this framework are better than those without this framework.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of cost-efficient depth cameras, many effective feature descriptors have been proposed for action recognition from depth sequences. However, most of them are based on single feature and thus unable to extract the action information comprehensively, e.g., some kinds of feature descri ptors can represent the area where the motion occurs while they lack the ability of describing the order in which the action is performed. In this paper, a new feature representation scheme combining different feature descriptors is proposed to capture various aspects of action cues simultaneously. First of all, a depth sequence is divided into a series of sub-sequences using motion energy based spatial-temporal pyramid. For each sub-sequence, on the one hand, the depth motion maps (DMMs) based completed local binary pattern (CLBP) descriptors are calculated through a patch-based strategy. On the other hand, each sub-sequence is partitioned into spatial grids and the polynormals descriptors are obtained for each of the grid sequences. Then, the sparse representation vectors of the DMMs based CLBP and the polynormals are calculated separately. After pooling, the ultimate representation vector of the sample is generated as the input of the classifier. Finally, two different fusion strategies are applied to conduct fusion. Through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, the performance of the proposed method is proved better than that of each single feature based recognition method.},

In this work, we present a mu lti-view spatiotemporal approach based on spectral histogramming for hand gesture signature recognition. A Microsoft Kinect sensor is adopted to capture the motion of signing in a sequence of depth frames. The depth frame sequence is viewed from three directional sights to retrieve rich information, such as temporal changes at each spatial location, the signing motion flow of each vertical and horizontal spatial space in a temporal manner. Furthermore, the proposed approach performs feature description on different levels of locality. This function enables a multi-resolution analysis on this dynamic signature. The robustness of the proposed approach is reflected with the promising result by striking the state-of-the-art performance, as substantiated in the empirical results.},

(2) It develops a hybrid analysis and comparison framework based on the BPNN model. It identifies that the BPNN model is more suitable for approving SMB loans, as it can precisely identify the second type of error.

Further, it illustrates the applicability of the BPNN model.

  abstract     = {Software-defined networking is a new paradigm that overcomes problems associated with traditional network architecture by separating the control logic from data plane devices. It also enhances performance by providing a highly-programmable interface that adapts to dynamic changes in network policie s. As software-defined networking controllers are prone to single-point failures, providing security is one of the biggest challenges in this framework. This paper intends to provide an intrusion detection mechanism in both the control plane and data plane to secure the controller and forwarding devices respectively. In the control plane, we imposed a flow-based intrusion detection system that inspects every new incoming flow towards the controller. In the data plane, we assigned a signature-based intrusion detection system to inspect traffic between Open Flow switches using port mirroring to analyse and detect malicious activity. Our flow-based system works with the help of trained, multi-layer machine learning-based classifier, while our signature-based system works with rule-based classifiers using the Snort intrusion detection system. The ensemble feature selection technique we adopted in the flow-based system helps to identify the prominent features and hasten the classification process. Our proposed work ensures a high level of security in the Software-defined networking environment by working simultaneously in both control plane and data plane.},

To overcome the inherent inflexibility of traditional hard clustering methods, a new fuzzy clustering-based classifier selection method is proposed based on the mini-batch k-means algorithm to obtain the best performing base classifiers for generating classifier compositions. The RS-based classifier composition method was applied to enhance the robustness of candidate classifier compositions by randomly selecting several subspaces in the original feature space. The GA-based classifier compositional optimization method was applied to optimize the parameters of the promising classifier composition through the iterative mechanism of the GA. Finally, six datasets collected from the real world were tested with four evaluation indicators to assess the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results showed that the proposed model outperformed the benchmark models with higher predictive accuracy and efficiency.},

In this paper, K-mean clustering method is adopted to classify customers into four categories, namely 1) the most valuable customers, 2) valuable customers, 3) general customers and 4) customers with low contribution. By adding a new evaluation dimension of CTS, the original RFM model is improved. In this way, the RFMC model is built and can provide more comprehensive evaluation on customer value. Finally, the results show that the addition of CTS index significantly changes the clustering results of the original RFM model and the overall consideration of consumption amount and CTS truly reflect the customer value. Thus, the improved RFMC model optimizes the results of customer stratification and it can effectively sort out the valuable customers for enterprises. Enterprises will be more dedicated to serving the valuable customers so as to maximize profits and reduce service costs of customers with lower value to make up for profit losses.},

  abstract     = {Unlike other linguistic modellings, probabilistic linguistic term sets can express clearly the importance of different linguistic variables. The notion of Probabilistic Linguistic Preference Relations (PLPRs) constitutes an extension of linguistic preference relations, and as such has received incr easing attention in recent years. In group decision-making (GDM) problems with PLPRs, the processes of consistency adjustment, consensus-achieving and desirable alternative selection play a key role in deriving the reliable GDM results. Therefore, this paper focuses on the construction of a GDM method for PLPRs with local adjustment strategy. First, we redefine the concepts of multiplicative consistency and consistency index for PLPRs, and some properties for multiplicative consistent PLPRs are studied. Then, in order to obtain the acceptable multiplicative consistent PLPRs, we propose a convergent consistency adjustment algorithm. Subsequently, a consensus-achieving method with PLPRs is constructed for reaching the consensus goal of experts. In both consistency adjustment process and consensus-achieving method, the local adjustment strategy is utilized to retain the original evaluation information of experts as much as possible. Finally, a GDM method with PLPRs is investigated to determine the reliable ranking order of alternatives. In order to show the advantages of the developed GDM method with PLPRs, an illustration for determining the ranking of fog-haze influence factors is given, which is followed by the comparative analysis to clarify its validity and merits.},

  abstract     = {In online social networks (OSNs), socialbots are responsible for various malicious activities, and they are mainly programmed to imitate human-behavior to bypass the existing detection systems. The socialbots are generally successful in their malicious intent due to the existence of OSN users who f ollow them and thereby increase their reputation in the network. Analysis of the socialbot networks and their users is vital to comprehend the socialbot problem from target users’ perspective. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach for characterizing and detecting socialbot targets, i.e., users who are susceptible to be trapped by the socialbots. We model OSN users based on their identity and behavior information, representing the static and dynamic components of their personality. The proposed approach classifies socialbot targets into three categories viz. active, reactive, and inactive users. We evaluate the proposed approach using three classifiers over a dataset collected from a live socialbot injection experiment conducted on Twitter. We also present a comparative evaluation of the proposed approach with a state-of-the-art method and show that it performs significantly better. On feature ablation analysis, we found that network structure and user intention and personality related dynamic features are most discriminative, whereas static features show the least impact on the classification. Additionally, following rate, multimedia ratio, and follower rate are most relevant to segregate different categories of the socialbot targets. We also perform a detailed topical and behavioral analysis of socialbot targets and found active users to be suspicious. Further, joy and agreeableness are the most dominating personality traits among the three categories of the users.},

The urban ecological risk assessment could be regarded as a classical multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) iss ue. The interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (IVIFS) can fully describe the uncertain information for the urban ecological risk assessment. Furthermore, the classical TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for Interactive Multi-Criteria Decision Making) is built on cumulative prospect theory (CPT), which is a selectable method in reflecting the DMs’ psychological behavior. Thus, in this paper, the TODIM method based on the CPT is proposed for MAGDM issue under IVIFS. At the same time, it is enhancing rationality to get the weight information of attributes by using the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy entropy weight method. And focusing on hot issues in contemporary society, this article applies the discussed method to urban ecological risk assessment, and demonstrates urban ecological risk assessment model based on the proposed method. Finally, through comparing the outcome of comparative analysis, we conclude that this improved approach is acceptable.},

  abstract     = {With the widespread of location-based social networks (LBSNs), the amount of check-in data grows rapidly, which helps to recommend the next point-of-interest (POI). Extracting sequential patterns from check-in data has become a meaningful way for next POI recommendation, since human movement exhibi ts sequential patterns in LBSNs. However, due to the check-ins’ sparsity problem, exploiting sequential patterns in next POI recommendation is a challenging issue, which makes the learned sequential patterns unreliable. Inspired by the fact that auxiliary information can be incorporated to alleviate this situation, in this paper, we model sequential transition based on both item-wise check-in sequences and region-wise spatial information. Besides, we propose an attention-aware recurrent neural network (ATTRNN) to learn the contribution of different time steps. Furthermore, considering users’ decision-making is influenced by public’s common preference to some extent, we design a novel framework, namely HSP (short for “Hybrid model based on Sequential feature mining and Public preference awareness”), to recommend POIs for a given user. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation for HSP on two real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed HSP achieves significantly improvements.},

  abstract     = {Since label noise can hurt the performance of supervised learning (SL), how to train a good classifier to deal with label noise is an emerging and meaningful topic in machine learning field. Although many related methods have been proposed and achieved promising performance, they have the following drawbacks: (1) They can lead to data waste and even performance degradation if the mislabeled instances are removed; and (2) the negative effect of the extremely mislabeled instances cannot be completely eliminated. To address these problems, we propose a novel method based on the capped ℓ1 norm and a graph-based regularizer to deal with label noise. In the proposed algorithm, we utilize the capped ℓ1 norm instead of the ℓ1 norm. The used norm can inherit the advantage of the ℓ1 norm, which is robust to label noise to some extent. Moreover, the capped ℓ1 norm can adaptively find extremely mislabeled instances and eliminate the corresponding negative influence. Additionally, the proposed algorithm makes full use of the mislabeled instances under the graph-based framework. It can avoid wasting collected instance information. The solution of our algorithm can be achieved through an iterative optimization approach. We report the experimental results on several UCI datasets that include both binary and multi-class problems. The results verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison to existing state-of-the-art classification methods.},

  abstract     = {The accuracy and stability of relative pose estimation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a target depend on whether the characteristics of the underwater image can be accurately and quickly extracted. In this paper, a whale optimization algorithm (WOA) based on lateral inhibition (LI) i s proposed to solve the image matching and vision-guided AUV docking problem. The proposed method is named the LI-WOA. The WOA is motivated by the behavior of humpback whales, and it mainly imitates encircling prey, bubble-net attacking and searching for prey to obtain the globally optimal solution in the search space. The WOA not only balances exploration and exploitation but also has a faster convergence speed, higher calculation accuracy and stronger robustness than other approaches. The lateral inhibition mechanism can effectively perform image enhancement and image edge extraction to improve the accuracy and stability of image matching. The LI-WOA combines the optimization efficiency of the WOA and the matching accuracy of the LI mechanism to improve convergence accuracy and the correct matching rate. To verify its effectiveness and feasibility, the WOA is compared with other algorithms by maximizing the similarity between the original image and the template image. The experimental results show that the LI-WOA has a better average value, a higher correct rate, less execution time and stronger robustness than other algorithms. The LI-WOA is an effective and stable method for solving the image matching and vision-guided AUV docking problem.},

In the proposed model, the Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) approach is employed to integrate four carefully selected similarity indexes, which are designed according to different structural features. In addition, to adaptively estimate the weight for each index based on the observed network structures, a new weight calculation method is presented by considering the distribution of similarity scores. Due to taking separate similarity indexes into account, the proposed method is applicable to multiple different types of network. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other prediction methods in terms of accuracy and stableness on 10 benchmark networks.},

This paper attempts to devise a novel approach to tackle the consensus outliers especially for non-uniform data, filling the gap in the existing literature. In particular, the concentrate region for a set of non-uniform data is first computed with the proposed searching algorithm such that the domain of aggregation function is partitioned into sub-regions. The aggregation will then operate adaptively with respect to the corresponding sub-regions previously partitioned. Finally, the overall aggregation is operated with a proposed novel consensus measure. To demonstrate the working and efficacy of the proposed approach, several illustrative examples are given in comparison to a number of alternative aggregation functions, with the results achieved being more intuitive and of higher consensus.},

  abstract     = {Zadeh’s fuzzy sets are very useful tool to handle imprecision and uncertainty, but they are unable to characterize the negative characteristics in a certain problem. This problem was solved by Zhang et al. as they introduced the concept of bipolar fuzzy sets. Thus, fuzzy set generalizes the classic al set and bipolar fuzzy set generalize the fuzzy set. These theories are based on the set of real numbers. On the other hand, the set of complex numbers is the generalization of the set of real numbers so, complex fuzzy sets generalize the fuzzy sets, with wide range of values to handle the imprecision and uncertainty. So, in this article, we study complex bipolar fuzzy sets which is the generalization of bipolar fuzzy set and complex fuzzy set with wide range of values by adding positive membership function and negative membership function to unit circle in the complex plane, where one can handle vagueness in a much better way as compared to bipolar fuzzy sets. Thus this paper leads us towards a new direction of research, which has many applications in different directions. We develop the notions of union, intersection, complement, Cartesian product and De-Morgan’s laws of complex bipolar fuzzy sets. Furthermore, we develop the complex bipolar fuzzy relations, fundamental operations on complex bipolar fuzzy matrices and some operators of complex bipolar fuzzy matrices. We also discuss the distance measure on complex bipolar fuzzy sets and complex bipolar fuzzy aggregation operators. Finally, we apply the developed approach to a numerical problem with the algorithm.},

In this paper, a so-called G-CNN architecture that combined the gated recurrent units (GRU) with a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed, which respectively focus on the monitored and exogenous data. The most important is the introduction of a complementary double-referenced thresholding approach that processes prediction errors and calculates threshold, achieving balance between the minimization of false positives and the false negatives. The outstanding performance and extensive applicability of our model is demonstrated by experiments on two public datasets from aerospace and a new server machine dataset from an Internet company. It is also found that the monitored data is close associated with the exogenous data if any, and the interpretability of the G-CNN is discussed by visualizing the intermediate output of neural networks.},

As a kind of intelligent computing algorithm, DNA computing has the advantages of high parallelism and high storage density, so it is widely used in solving classical combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a new DNA algorithm that uses DNA molecular operations to solve the vertex coloring problem. For a simple n-vertex graph and k different kinds of color, we appropriately use DNA strands to indicate edges and vertices. Through basic biochemical reaction operations, the solution to the problem is obtained in the O (kn2) time complexity.

  abstract     = {In real situations, players might represent administrative areas of different scales; players might have different activity abilities. Thus, we propose an extension of the Banzhaf-Owen index in the framework of fuzzy transferable-utility games by considering supreme-utilities and weights simultaneo usly, which we name the weighted fuzzy Banzhaf-Owen index. Here we adopt three existing notions from traditional game theory and reinterpret them in the framework of fuzzy transferable-utility games. The first one is that this weighted index could be represented as an alternative formulation in terms of excess functions. The second is that, based on an reduced game and related consistency, we offer an axiomatic result to present the rationality of this weighted index. Finally, we introduce two dynamic processes to illustrate that this weighted index could be reached by players who start from an arbitrary efficient payoff vector and make successive adjustments.},

However, detecting intrusions using deep learning methods from infrared images captured at night remains a challenging task because of the lack of sufficient training samples. To address this issue, a transfer strategy that migrates daytime RGB images to the nighttime style of infrared images is proposed in this study. The proposed method consists of two stages. In the first stage, a data generation model is trained on the basis of generative adversarial networks using RGB images and a small number of infrared images, and then, synthetic samples are generated using a well-trained model. In the second stage, a single shot multibox detector (SSD) model is trained using synthetic data and utilized to detect abnormal objects from infrared images at nighttime. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two groups of experiments, namely, railway and non-railway scenes, are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and an improvement of 17.8% is achieved for object detection at nighttime.},

  abstract     = {The widespread application of infrared human action recognition in intelligent surveillance has attracted significant attention. However, the infrared action recognition dataset is limited, which limits the development of infrared action recognition. Existing methods for infrared action recognition are based on features in the same sample, without paying attention to within-class differences. Motivated by the idea of weighting video information, this paper proposes a novel infrared action recognition framework to reweight the samples of training sets named REWS to solve the problems of limited infrared action data and the large within-class differences in the infrared action recognition dataset. In the proposed framework, we first map infrared action video data to a low-dimensional feature space, and use the cosine similarity between the feature data of the training set and the testing set to determine the weight of the training set samples. Each training set sample has an independent weight. Then, a support vector machine (SVM) is trained by the training sets with weights to recognize the infrared actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance compared with hand-crafted features based methods on the benchmark InfAR dataset.},

Color pattern samples were collected and analyzed to construct a color library for cockpit color matching. Color scheme groups were accordingly redesigned and visualized. Based on fuzzy-set theory, the Kansei engineering model was thus used to evaluate the emotional image of the color schemes, and rank them in terms of priority. A support vector machine was trained to construct a comprehensive intelligent color evaluation system. After training and validating the evaluation model, accurate emotional evaluation of color matching schemes could be achieved. Thus, the proposed system enables the extraction, mapping and evaluation of cockpit color matching schemes, and can be used in color scheme design for other cabins.},

To solve these problems, this paper proposes a new semi-supervised method for classification of PQDs based on generative adversarial network (GAN). Firstly, a GAN model is designed which we call it PQDGAN. After the unsupervised pre-training with unlabeled training data, the trained discriminator is extracted alone and conduct supervised training with a small amount of labelled training data. Finally, the discriminator became a classifier with high accuracy. This model can achieve the step of feature extraction and selection efficiently. In addition, only a small amount of labelled training data is used, which greatly reduces the dependence of classification model on labelled data. Experiments show that this method has high classification accuracy, less computations and strong robustness. It is a new semi-supervised method for classification of PQDs.},

Different experimentations are conducted to decide the suitable parameters of the proposed edge detector and to examine its validity. To evaluate the strength of the proposed model, the results are compared to Canny, Sobel, Prewitt, LOG and Saryazdi methods. Finally, by calculation of mean square error (MSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the value of PSNR is always equal to or greater than the PSNR value of suggested methods. Moreover, by calculation of Baddeley’s error metric (BEM) on ten test images from the Berkeley Segmentation DataSet (BSDS), we show that the proposed method outperforms the other methods.

The problem of mis classification also occurs while having tiny logo in large image with other objects. To address this problem, Patch-CNN is proposed for logo recognition which uses small patches of logos for training to solve the problem of misclassification. The classification is accomplished by dividing the logo images into small patches and threshold is applied to drop no logo area according to ground truth. The architectures of AlexNet and ResNet are also used for logo detection. We propose a segmentation free architecture for the logo detection and recognition. In literature, the concept of region proposal generation is used to solve logo detection, but these techniques suffer in case of tiny logos. Proposed CNN is especially designed for extracting the detailed features from logo patches. So far, the technique has attained accuracy equals to 0.9901 with acceptable training and testing loss on the dataset used in this work.},

Aiming at resolving the multi-attribute dynamic decision problem with the attribute value being an interval grey number and the decision-maker’s weight information unknown, we propose the use of the close degree of grey incidence method to determine the index weight. Our approach revolves around three reference points: peers, development, and expectations. Value matrices of the three reference points are expressed according to the Cumulative Prospect Theory, which also determines the distance from the center of the grey target. Based on the Orness measure, we establish a multi-stage weight optimization model to calculate the stage weight and the comprehensive cumulative prospect value of each agency. Finally, we verify the validity and practicability of our method with the use of parameter sensitivity analysis, a comparison with other methods, and a case study.},

  abstract     = {The reasons for consumers’ resale behavior are complex and sometimes diverse, and the investigation of consumer resale behavior is not a simple matter. Therefore, only through a lot of investigation and inquiry can we reach relevant conclusions. Based on machine learning and BP neural network, this paper constructs a consumer online resale behavior measurement model. The contraction-expansion factor can balance the global search and local search capabilities in different iteration periods, and the differential evolution operator is introduced to solve the problem of lack of population diversity. After building the model, this study collects data through questionnaires, and combines neural network training models to take data training and data prediction. In addition, this study compares and analyzes real data with predicted data, and visually displays the comparison results through statistical graphs. The results show that the method proposed in this paper has certain effects and can provide theoretical references for subsequent related research.},

In particular, the recognition accuracy of Japanese characters is not high. Base d on machine learning technology, this study combines image feature retrieval technology to construct a Japanese character recognition model and uses Japanese character features as the algorithm recognition object. Moreover, this study expands image features by generating a brightness enhancement function using a bilateral grid. In order to exclude the influence of the edge and contour of the image scene on the analysis of the image source, the brightness value of the HDR image is used instead of the pixel value of the image as the image data. In addition, this research designs experiments to study the translation effects of this research model.

After that, the forecast of the independent variables has been conducted with the ordered weighted moving average (OWMA) operator and new proposed OWA operators using probabilities that are presented in the paper. Using these new methods and the proposed econometric model, it is possible to establish future prices. The results show a greater impact of the interest rate than inflation, as well as the need to include supply and demand variables that have not been included due to the absence of systematic information.},

This paper helps investors answer that question, and the paper presents an MCHP approach using different criteria based on financial ratios that the decision maker (in this case, the investor) will give different weights to make a portfolio based on her preferences; different importance is given to each criterion. An example using the Mexican Stock Exchange is presented.},

To identify emotions, a step-by-step structure is used, which, based on statistical data from p hysiological signal metrics, generates the representative arousal value (direct correlation); from the PANAS questionnaire, the system generates the valence value (inverse correlation), as a first approximation to the techniques of emotion recognition without the use of artificial intelligence. The system gathers information concerning arousal activity from a subject using the following metrics: beats per minute (BPM), heart rate variability (HRV), the number of galvanic skin response (GSR) peaks in the skin conductance response (SCR) and forearm contraction time, using three physiological signals (Electrocardiogram - ECG, Galvanic Skin Response - GSR, Electromyography - EMG).},

The inputs and outputs for the DEA model are selected based on the CAMELS rating. The major c ontributions of this study are threefold. First, this study investigates the efficiency of Malaysian banks using a novel dynamic network DEA model. Second, the Malaysian banking industry is found to be efficient in creating earning assets rather than in creating loans or profit. The results reveal that only a few banks in Malaysia have been efficient in converting deposits and equities into profit. Third, Islamic banks, in general, have been performing efficiently in the production and profitability approaches. Conventional banks, in contrast, are found to have been efficient in the intermediation approach. Policy implications are derived from the main conclusions.},

  abstract     = {The empirical evidence suggests that stock returns in the emerging technology environment exhibit high stock return volatility. The fundamental aim of the article is to investigate the dynamic, time series properties of the correlations between daily log returns and magnitude of the volatility tran smissions from the emerging technologies environment to the Spanish banking sector, the Spanish market portfolio and the finance industry in the EU area. Using daily log returns for the performance variables and an equally weighted index was constructed as proxy to represent the emerging technology phenomena covering a period from the 7th of July of 2015 to the 20th of September of 2019. The study applies generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity GARCH followed by the diagonal BEKK approach. One key finding is that the emerging technology environment is important in capturing volatility of Spanish banking sector, the Spanish market portfolio and the finance industry in the EU area through significant volatility clustering, volatility spillover and volatility persistence. Results exhibit very large GARCH and relatively low ARCH effects indicating a long persistence of resulting shocks over volatility. Broadly, the Spanish banking sector seems to be the most exposed to volatility spillover. Nevertheless, it is the finance industry across the EU which is more affected by the volatility persistence from emerging technology shocks in terms of volatility and cross – volatility point of view. Additionally, high volatility periods provide insights about an increased integration and volatility spillover. From an investor perspective, one important implication is that adding stocks from different emerging technologies to a portfolio does not necessarily lead to risk reduction.},

The current study adopted MADM analytical methods including AHP, ELECTRE, BORDA, TOPS IS and SAW to rank the initiatives / strategic plans in BSC. Then the results of those methods were compared against each other in order to find a robust model for selecting strategic plans. The correlation coefficient between methods indicated that multidimensional and ELECTRE methods with 0.944 are the best performing and AHP with negative correlation (–0.455) is the worst performing method for selecting strategic plans in BSC. The high correlation demonstrates that the model can be a useful and effective tool to finding the critical aspects of evaluation criteria as well as the gaps to improve company performance for achieving desired level. Developing multidimensional model is the core model for the selection of strategic plans. This study addresses the problem and issues of group decision making process for selecting strategic plans in BSC.

The main purpose of this paper is to arise a new method to support the provider selection process. In this sense, this paper introduces the intuitionistic fuzzy version of dimensional analysis under a group decision making and multi-criteria environment applied to suppliers selection. Likewise, a set of decision makers reveal their preferences about the criteria and options in evaluation by mean of a linguistic grade that are mapped via intuitionistic numbers. Consequently, the importance of each decision maker and criteria is considered in the method. Hence, the methodology assumes that exist a choice better than the rest which is called ideal alternative. Each choice in evaluation, is compared with that ideal to induce an index of similarity. Additionally, the alternative with highest index of similarity is proposed as solution to the supplier selection problem. The method offer a systematic mode to deal with the interrelationship between the criteria attached into the decision making sphere. Finally, a numerical example is addressed to supplier selection to facilitate the understanding of the proposed method.},

Results show that the highest indirect effect is given by the variables hospitality and sustainable development, some other interesting results are those found in causes, destination management, and accessibility; in effects, economic growth, and profitability.

  abstract     = {SMEs have a very important performance in any current economy because they contribute both to the generation of wealth and to the creation of jobs. In this article we analyze a sample of 12,658 Catalan SMEs and show the level of association that exists between some of their financial ratios to cons truct a synthetic measure that explains their business size. For the study of financial ratios, we used three data analysis techniques first, and to find the optimal number of clusters, we used the Two-Phase Clusters algorithm. Subsequently, and once the optimal number of groups was known, the most probable business size (cluster) for each company was calculated through a Fuzzy Clustering analysis. Finally, the optimal cluster, estimated for each company, was validated with a Probit model. The results allowed knowing that the size reported by each company is not necessarily equal to the synthetic measure proposed in this article. It is suggested to validate our results with an accounting analysis, other equally robust methodologies or algorithms, such as neural networks.},

It uses order-induced variables that modify the reordering process of the arguments inc luded in the aggregation. The principal advantage of the introduced induced mechanism is the consideration of highly complex attitude from the decision makers. We study some families of the IGOWLA operator as measures for the characterization of the weighting vector. This paper presents the general formulation of the operator and some special cases, including the induced ordered weighted logarithmic geometric averaging (IOWLGA) operator and the induced ordered weighted logarithmic aggregation (IOWLA). Further generalizations using quasi-arithmetic mean are also proposed. Finally, an illustrative example of a group decision-making procedure using a multi-person analysis and the IGOWLA operator in the area of innovation management is analyzed.},

Given this assumption, pen sion fund managers may take greater risks to realize higher returns and subsequently reduce their pension liabilities. This study demonstrates that the discount rate used to calculate a two-life annuity and the expected return on the portfolio are not necessarily equal. A stochastic-based model is used to determine the proper discount rate for calculating the two-life annuity. The model includes fluctuations of both the interest rate and the payments made by the annuity. In general, this study contributes to the stability of pension systems by determining the appropriate discount rate when computing required actuarial reserves or the portfolio’s required rate of return given a reserve.},

Therefore, the objective of this study is to know the combinations of conditions (female employment in sports, government support, financing for entrepreneurs, perception of entrepreneurial opportunities and capacities, glass ceiling index and masculine values in society) that generate high levels of female entrepreneurship in the countries of the European Union, as these values are closer to the male TEA (Total Early-Stage Entrepreneurial Activity). A total of 13 European countries were analysed using the fsQCA methodology. The results show that, for high levels of female TEA, the main combination is high levels of government support*high levels of glass ceiling index*low levels of masculinity*low levels of opportunities perception and high levels of female employment in sport, explaining 45% of the cases.

The present study focuses on new technology-based firms (NTBFs), using a Mamdani fuzzy inference system with five inputs and five outputs, to assess the impact that ICTs have on economic performance, applying the reasoning of fuzzy logic. For the construction of the fuzzy inference system, a database of NTBFs founder-promoters was used. Information about ICTs (use of internet technologies, collaboration technologies, management technologies, support for decision-making and, search and data management) and measures of economic performance (sales, net profit, profitability, productivity and improvement of production costs) were extracted from the database for use in developing the model, which begins with definitions of the relationships between the input and output variables. The analyses performed indicated a slight change in economic performance through the interaction between ICTs measures. These findings will help firms make better decisions regarding the implementation of ICT infrastructure, allowing them to improve their economic performance.},

Mishandling of the electronic system, patient behaviour and environmental changes which are all lead to incorrect data generation while using WSN for medical purposes. It leads to a false alarm being raised, network resource wastage, a false node priority level and low reliability. We have introduced the Mutual Trust Model (MTM) for Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) with the help of Fog-Node (FN) to address these issues and to ensure the trustworthiness of the information acquired. In this, First-Hand Trust Method calculates the confidence value of the individual sensor node. Then, with neighbor node support, the Stigmercy Trust Method (STM) is implemented to reinforce the trust source node. Ultimately, the individual patient’s confidence value for the MTM model is determined. With the assistance of the wireless-mininet network emulator and the RYU controller, the network environment model implement, and the results have been obtained. MTM predicts the confidence level of the collected data significantly and produces an accuracy of 92.3 percentage to prevent the emergency band from being used dispensable.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on script identification in natural scene images. Traditional CNNs (Convolution Neural Networks) cannot solve this problem perfectly for two reasons: one is the arbitrary aspect ratios of scene images which bring much difficulty to traditional CNNs with a fixed size image as the input. And the other is that some scripts with minor differences are easily confused because they share a subset of characters with the same shapes. We propose a novel approach combing Score CNN, Attention CNN and patches. Attention CNN is utilized to determine whether a patch is a discriminative patch and calculate the contribution weight of the discriminative patch to script identification of the whole image. Score CNN uses a discriminative patch as input and predict the score of each script type. Firstly patches with the same size are extracted from the scene images. Secondly these patches are used as inputs to Score CNN and Attention CNN to train two patch-level classifiers. Finally, the results of multiple discriminative patches extracted from the same image via the above two classifiers are fused to obtain the script type of this image. Using patches with the same size as inputs to CNN can avoid the problems caused by arbitrary aspect ratios of scene images. The trained classifiers can mine discriminative patches to accurately identify some confusing scripts. The experimental results show the good performance of our approach on four public datasets.},

  abstract     = {The fundamental aim of feature selection is to reduce the dimensionality of data by removing irrelevant and redundant features. As finding out the best subset of features from all possible subsets is computationally expensive, especially for high dimensional data sets, meta-heuristic algorithms are often used as a promising method for addressing the task. In this paper, a variant of recent meta-heuristic approach Owl Search Optimization algorithm (OSA) has been proposed for solving the feature selection problem within a wrapper-based framework. Several strategies are incorporated with an aim to strengthen BOSA (binary version of OSA) in searching the global best solution. The meta-parameter of BOSA is initialized dynamically and then adjusted using a self-adaptive mechanism during the search process. Besides, elitism and mutation operations are combined with BOSA to control the exploitation and exploration better. This improved BOSA is named in this paper as Modified Binary Owl Search Algorithm (MBOSA). Decision Tree (DT) classifier is used for wrapper based fitness function, and the final classification performance of the selected feature subset is evaluated by Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Simulation experiments are conducted on twenty well-known benchmark datasets from UCI for the evaluation of the proposed algorithm, and the results are reported based on classification accuracy, the number of selected features, and execution time. In addition, BOSA along with three common meta-heuristic algorithms Binary Bat Algorithm (BBA), Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO), and Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA) are used for comparison. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms similar methods by reducing the number of features significantly while maintaining a comparable level of classification accuracy.},

Many variants of CNN for K-nearest neighbor have been proposed by different researchers. However, few studies were conducted on condensed fuzzy K-nearest neighbor. In this paper, we present a c ondensed fuzzy K-nearest neighbor (CFKNN) algorithm that starts from an initial instance set S and iteratively selects informative instances from training set T, moving them from T to S. Specifically, CFKNN consists of three steps. First, for each instance x ∈ T, it finds the K-nearest neighbors in S and calculates the fuzzy membership degrees of the K nearest neighbors using S rather than T. Second it computes the fuzzy membership degrees of x using the fuzzy K-nearest neighbor algorithm. Finally, it calculates the information entropy of x and selects an instance according to the calculated value. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets are conducted to compare CFKNN with four state-of-the-art algorithms (CNN, edited nearest neighbor (ENN), Tomeklinks, and OneSidedSelection) regarding the number of selected instances, the testing accuracy, and the compression ratio. The experimental results show that CFKNN provides excellent performance and outperforms the other four algorithms.},

Developing a proper forecasting model for the quarterly hydropower generation is crucial for associated energy sectors, which could assist policymakers in adjusting corresponding schemes for facing with sustained demands. For this purpose, this paper presents a fractional nonlinear grey Bernoulli model (abbreviated as FANGBM(1,1)) coupled seasonal factor and Particular Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, namely PSO algorithm-based FASNGBM(1,1) model. In the proposed method, the moving average method that eliminates the seasonal fluctuations is introduced into FANGBM(1,1), then in which the structure parameters of FASNGBM(1,1) are determined by PSO. Based on hydropower generation of China from the first quarter of 2011 to the final quarter of 2018 (2011Q1-2018Q4), the numerical results show that the proposed model has a better performance than that of other benchmark models. Eventually, the quarterly hydropower generation of China from 2019 to 2020 are forecasted by the proposed model, according to results, the hydropower generation of China will reach 11287.14 × 108 Kwh in 2020.},

However, there are still some cases where it is not convenient to give an evaluation using the PLTS gramma. Sometimes the evaluators can only give a comparative relationship between alternatives, sometimes evaluators may have difficulty understanding all the alternatives and cannot give a complete assessment. Therefore, we propose a method to transform the comparative linguistic expressions (CLEs) into PLTSs, and the comparison objects of CLEs are alternatives evaluated by PLTSs. And the probability distribution has been adjusted to make the transformation more in line with common sense. Then, a method to correct the deviation is proposed, allowing alternatives to be compared in the case of incomplete assessment. Combining the above two methods, we propose a decision-making method when both CLEs and incomplete assessments coexist. With the study in this paper, the limitations of PLTS-based evaluation and decision-making are reduced and the flexibility of using PLTS is improved.},

  abstract     = {In the field of security, the data labels are unknown or the labels are too expensive to label, so that clustering methods are used to detect the threat behavior contained in the big data. The most widely used probabilistic clustering model is Gaussian Mixture Models(GMM), which is flexible and pow erful to apply prior knowledge for modelling the uncertainty of the data. Therefore, in this paper, we use GMM to build the threat behavior detection model. Commonly, Expectation Maximization (EM) and Variational Inference (VI) are used to estimate the optimal parameters of GMM. However, both EM and VI are quite sensitive to the initial values of the parameters. Therefore, we propose to use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to initialize the parameters. Firstly, SVD is used to factorize the data set matrix to get the singular value matrix and singular matrices. Then we calculate the number of the components of GMM by the first two singular values in the singular value matrix and the dimension of the data. Next, other parameters of GMM, such as the mixing coefficients, the mean and the covariance, are calculated based on the number of the components. After that, the initialization values of the parameters are input into EM and VI to estimate the optimal parameters of GMM. The experiment results indicate that our proposed method performs well on the parameters initialization of GMM clustering using EM and VI for estimating parameters.},

Based on the analysis of the two selection mechanism, a dynamic reference-vector-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm(RMaEA) is proposed. Adaptive-adjusted reference vector is used to improve the distribution of the algorithm in global area, and the improved non-dominated relationship is used to improve the convergence in a certain local area.

Referring to methods to determine fuzzy membership function, the function between DCWAG and the starting service time is constructed. By setting an threshold for DCWAG, the starting service time that the threshold corresponds can be treated as the maximum time window, which meets the actual situation. The goal of the model is to minimize the total cost. For the algorithm, MDOVRPFTW without maximum time windows is an extension of the NP-hard problem, the hybrid genetic algorithm was designed, which is combination of genetic algorithm and Hungarian algorithm. When the hybrid genetic algorithm applied to one pharmaceutical logistics company in Beijing City, China, one optimal scheme is determined. Then the rationality and the stability of solutions by the hybrid genetic algorithm are proved.

Firefly algorithm uses multi-objective function, which is a combination of Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Bit Error rate (BER). The histogram shifting technique embeds secret data in the optimal pixel locations. The quality of test images is analyzed under varying payload as well as under varying fractional order. Experimental results conclude that this scheme produces good quality stego image.

  abstract     = {Under demand response enabled demand-side management, the home energy management (HEM) schemes schedule appliances for balancing both energy and demand within a residence. This scheme enables the user to achieve either a minimum electricity bill (EB) or maximum comfort. There is always the added bu rden on a HEM scheme to obtain the least possible EB with comfort. However, if a time window that contains comfortable time slots of the day for an appliance operation, is identified, and if the cost-effective schedule-pattern gets generated from these windows autonomously, then the burden can be reduced. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-level method that can assist the HEM scheme by generating a cost-effective schedule-pattern for scheduling home appliances. The first level uses a classifier to identify the comfortable time window from past ON and OFF events. The second level uses pattern generation algorithms to generate a cost-effective schedule-pattern from the identified window. The generated cost-effective schedule-pattern is applied to a HEM scheme as input to demonstrate the proposed two-level approach. The simulation results exhibit that the proposed approach helps the HEM scheme to schedule home appliances cost-effectively with a satisfactory user-comfort between 90% and 100%.},

However, current water supply decisions on transboundary water resources may ignore the psychological perception of multi-stakeholders, and the evolution of emergencies increases the uncertainty of decision making. Both factors would lead to the low acceptance of water-related decisions. Utility satisfaction, perceived losses, and quantity satisfaction were selected in this paper to identify the perceived satisfaction of upstream governments, downstream governments, and the public, respectively, over multiple decision-making stages. A modeling framework combining prospect theory and the multi-stage multi-objective programming methodology was then developed to measure the perceived satisfaction of different stakeholders in a watershed under emergency. A two-stage NSGA-II and TOPSIS based approach was adopted to find the optimal compromise solution to solve the model. The framework was applied in the Lancang–Mekong River basin to provide suggestions to decision makers. Upstream decision makers must choose a moderate proportional fairness degree when making emergency decisions to maximize the perceived satisfaction of all stakeholders. Meanwhile, the perceived loss of downstream countries with low water demand should be considered first in the formulation of emergency water supply plans. Furthermore, although water supply from upstream countries can improve perceived water quantity satisfaction of downstream publics, additional actions must still be taken to change the traditional concepts of the public.},

Series in intu itionistic fuzzy environment is a part of the intuitionistic fuzzy calculus theory, of which core idea is limit. However, the order used in the existing limit theory is not the one used in intuitionistic fuzzy calculus, causing the separation of the limit theory and intuitionistic fuzzy calculus. Thus, series in intuitionistic fuzzy environment is not closely related to the intuitionistic fuzzy calculus. In order to solve the above problem, we construct the related theories. There are mainly the following three aspects: (1) the limit theory including the sequence limit and the function limit is studied based on the new order. (2) we re-examine the numerical series according to the new tool of researching IFNs: the basis and the coordinates.

  abstract     = {This paper aims to investigate the compensation contract design problem consisting of a risk neutral firm and two risk averse workers with and without helping effort in the presence of bilateral moral hazard by Stackelberg game in the framework of principal-agent theory. Three classes of contract m odels are established in three modes, which reflect whether helping effort takes place between both workers and whether personal performance evaluation contract or relative performance evaluation contract is applied by the firm. By solving models, optimal efforts of the firm, optimal individual and workgroup incentive coefficients, optimal personal effort and helping effort, and the firm’s expected profit are deduced in different modes. In addition, a numerical experiment is investigated by focusing on the impacts of effort cost coefficients of the firm and the worker, and bilateral moral hazard on optimal compensation contracts and profit of the firm in three modes, which provide some valuable management insights about optimal strategy for the firm. The main findings show that the relative performance evaluation contract works better than the personal performance evaluation contract when the two workers is cooperative, which means that helping effort takes place between the two workers. Furthermore, a higher marginal contribution can motive the worker to make more helping effort for her partner, thus achieving win-win outcome based on the relationship of cooperation. For the firm, the optimal strategy is to design the relative performance evaluation contract for both workers and motivate them to make cooperative relationship by exerting helping effort under bilateral moral hazard. Moreover, bilateral moral hazard decreases the motivations of the workers but increases the firm’s profit. This proposed work contributes to the investigation of compensation contract design by combining three critical factors, that is, multiple agents, bilateral moral hazard, and helping effort. The findings provide some theoretical guidance on how to set up optimal mechanism between the firm and multiple agents in the presence of bilateral moral hazard and how to reduce the adverse influence of bilateral moral hazard on participants’ profits.},

To identify the overall influence, we define the Shapley value as the DM’s weight. Entropy is a measure which makes it better than similarity measures to recognize a group decision making problem. Since we propose a relative entropy to measure the difference between two systems, which improves the accuracy of the distance measure.In this paper, a MCGDM approach named as TODIM is presented under q-rung orthopair fuzzy information.The proposed TODIM approach is developed for correlative MCGDM problems, in which the weights of the DMs are calculated in terms of Shapley values and the dominance matrices are evaluated based on relative entropy measure with q-rung orthopair fuzzy information.Furthermore, the efficacy of the proposed Gq-ROFWA operator and the novel TODIM is demonstrated through a selection problem of modern enterprises risk investment. A comparative analysis with existing methods is presented to validate the efficiency of the approach.},

  abstract     = {In many cases, complex problems cannot be accurately described by precise numerical values. Fuzzy theory provides a suitable tool for solving these problems. However, if decision makers cannot reach an agreement on the method for defining linguistic variables based on fuzzy sets, TIVFNs (triangular interval-valued fuzzy numbers) can provide more accurate modeling. Therefore, solving fuzzy MCGDM (multiple criteria group decision-making) problem with an unknown expert weight and criterion weight in TIVFNs has become an important research direction. In this paper, TIVF-VIKOR (triangular interval-valued fuzzy VIKOR) method, which is suitable for the environment of TIVFNs, is proposed to solve the problem of fuzzy MCGDM. To achieve this goal, the TIVF-VIKOR method is innovatively adopted similarity and coefficient of variation are combined to calculate expert weight, and deviation maximization method based on divergence matrix is used to calculate criterion weight. VIKOR method is used to find the compromise solutions, which are converted into the form of binary connection number, and the optimal compromise solution is obtained after ranking. The proposed method is applied to the problem of machine fault detection, and the validity and feasibility of the method are illustrated. Compared with the TOPSIS∖ELECTRE method, the ranking results of the three methods are equivalent, and the fluctuation of the TIVF-VIKOR method is more distinct.},

Firstly, a cooperative hunting tea m is established and a game model of cooperative hunting is built. Secondly, through the learning of the escaper’s strategy choice, the trajectory of the escaper’s limited T-step cumulative reward is established, and the trajectory is adjusted to the hunter’s strategy set. Finally, the Nash equilibrium solution is obtained by solving the cooperative hunt game, and each hunter executes the equilibrium strategy to complete the hunt task.

In fact, we discuss the fuzzy E-Bayesian estimation of reliability for PVC window production system. This approach is used to create the fuzzy E-Bayesian estimations of system reliability by introducing and applying a theorem called “Resolution Identity” for fuzzy sets. To be more specific, the model parameters are assumed to be fuzzy random variables. For this purpose, the original problem is transformed into a nonlinear programming problem which is divided into four sub-problems to simplify the computations. Finally, the results obtained for the sub-problems can be used to determine the membership functions of the fuzzy E-Bayesian estimation of system reliability.

  abstract     = {Blind Source Separation(BSS) is one of the research hotspots in the field of signal processing. In order to improve the accuracy of speech recognition in driving environment, the driver’s speech signal must be enhanced to improve its signal to noise ratio(SNR). Independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm is the most classical and efficient blind statistical signal processing technique. Compared with other improved ICA algorithms, fixed-point algorithm (FastICA) is well known for its fast convergence speed and good robustness. However, the convergence of FastICA algorithm is comparatively susceptible to the initial value selection of the original demixing matrix and the calculation of the iterative process is relatively large. In this paper, the gradient descent method is used to reduce the effect of initial value. What’s more, the improved secant method is proposed to speed up the convergence rate and reduce the amount of computation. As the results of mixed speech separation experiment turn out, the improved algorithm is of better performance relative to the standard FastICA algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the speech quality of the target driver. It is suitable for speech separation in driving environment with low SNR.},

  abstract     = {According to the characteristics of the tool hydraulic control system of the double cutters experimental pplatform, intelligent control methodology forecasted by fuzzy neural network is introduced into the control system. The two level control systems of fuzzy neural network predictive control and fuzzy control are designed. The fuzzy neural network predictive controller mainly completes the analysis and control of the speed and pressure in the tool hydraulic system. The speed control signal and pressure control signal from the first level are output to the fuzzy controller. Then, through logical reasoning, the control signal is output and the actuator is driven by the fuzzy controller to complete the control function of the tool system. In this paper, compared with the traditional PID control, the fuzzy neural network predictive control technology has better control accuracy, dynamic response performance and steady-state accuracy. The fuzzy neural network predictive control technology can be used to control the tool hydraulic system of Tunnel Boring Machine.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel graph cut method for iterated segmentation of objects with specific shape bias (SBGC). In contrast with conventional graph cut models which emphasize the regional appearance only, the proposed SBGC takes the shape preference of the interested object into account to drive the seg mentation. Therefore, the SBGC can ensure a more accurate convergence to the interested object even in complicated conditions where the appearance cues are inadequate for object/background discrimination. In particular, we firstly evaluate the segmentation by simultaneously considering its global shape and local edge consistencies with the object shape priors. Then these two cues are formulated into a graph cut framework to seek the optimal segmentation that maximizing both of the global and local measurements. By iteratively implementing the optimization, the proposed SBGC can achieve joint estimation of the optimal segmentation and the most likely object shape encoded by the shape priors, and eventually converge to the candidate result with maximum consistency between these two estimations. Finally, we take the ellipse shape objects with various segmentation challenges as examples for evaluation. Competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods validate the effectiveness of the technique.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a two-stage supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer, exploring the impact of the fuzzy uncertainty of product yield and demand and the deciders’ risk attitudes on the optimal order quantity of the retailer. At the same time, this study tries to analyze the coordination problem in the two-stage supply chain with consideration of the retailer and the manufacturer’s risk attitudes. Firstly, this study develops a supply chain optimal decision model in a centralized decision framework. In the proposed model, the L-R fuzzy numbers are used to depict the yield and demand with fuzzy characteristics. Then, the coordination of quantity discount in a supply chain is studied. Consequently, this research further investigates a special case in which the market demand and yield are assumed to be triangular fuzzy numbers, and the optimal solution of the order quantity and the wholesale price are obtained. At last, this paper utilizes several numerical examples to validate the proposed model. The results show that the quantity discount contract can coordinate the supply chain in a fuzzy environment, and the optimal order quantity decreases with the increasing of the risk bias coefficient of the retailer and the manufacturer. It also suggests that risk-seeking retailer will order more products, in addition, the manufacturer tend to choose a risk-seeking retailer as partner and the retailer is more likely to choose a risk-seeking rather than risk-aversion manufacturer as partner.},

It is showed that there is a Galois’s connection between the category of L-convex spaces and the category of L-interval spaces. In particular, the category of L-2-arity convex spaces can be embedded in the categ ory of L-interval spaces as a coreflective subcategory. Further, some properties of L-interval spaces are introduced including L-geometric (resp. L-Peano, L-Pasch and L-sand-glass) property. It is proved that an L-2-arity convex space is an L-JHC convex space iff its segment operator has L-Peano property. It is also proved that an L-JHC convex space with an L-idempotent segment operator has L-sand-glass property. Further, it is also proved that an L-idempotent interval space having L-Peano+L-Pasch property has L-geometric property and L-sand-glass property.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a possible relationship between two main objects, which are three-dimensional copulas (3D-Cs) and geometric picture fuzzy numbers (GPFNs). This opens up a potential field for future studies for these two objects that three-dimensional copulas can become useful tools for handling uncertainty information in the form of a picture fuzzy set (PFS). Specifically, we define a GPFN as a base element of the PFS and a defined domain of three-dimensional copulas that contains a set of GPFNs, then we show some examples of three-dimensional copulas identified on this domain. In this framework, we present the theorems related to these two objects. At the same time, we provide some examples for three-dimensional semi-copulas, three-dimensional quasi-copulas, and three-dimensional empirical copulas defined on D, which is a defined domain of a three-dimensional copula and contains a set of GPFNs Dg*. In addition, we also introduce a new approach to non-linear programming problems.},
