  abstract     = {Smart parking is becoming more and more an integral part of smart city initiatives. Utilizing and managing parking areas is a challenging task as space is often limited, finding empty spaces are hard and citizens want to park their vehicles close to their preferred places. This becomes worse in important/posh areas of major metropolitan cities during rush hour. Due to unavailability of proper parking management system, citizens have to roam around a lot in order to find a suitable parking area. This leads to the wastage of valuable time, unnecessary fuel consumption and environmental pollution. This paper proposes a smart parking management system (SPMS) based on multiple criteria based parking space reservation algorithm (MCPR) that allows the driver/owner of vehicles to find and reserve most appropriate parking space from anywhere at any time. The system also considers the concept of dynamic pricing strategy for calculating parking charge in order to gain more revenue by the government agencies as well as private investors. The system employs sensors to calculate concentration index, average inter-arrival time of vehicles of a parking area for better parking management and planning. The simulation results show that proposed system reduces the average extra driving required by the users to find a parking area and hence it will reduce traffic congestion, which in turn reduces air pollution caused by unnecessary driving to find a proper parking area.},

  abstract     = {Older adults often need some level of assistance in performing daily living activities. Even though these activities are common to the vast majority of individuals ( e.g. , eating, bathing, dressing), the way they are performed varies across individuals. Supporting older people in performing their everyday activities is a major avenue of research in smart homes. However, because of its early stage, this line of work has paid little attention on customizing assistive computing support with respect to the specific needs of each older adult towards improving its effectiveness and acceptability. We propose a tool-based approach to allowing caregivers to define services in the area of home daily living, leveraging their knowledge and expertise on the older adult they care for. This approach consists of two stages: 1) a wizard allows caregivers to define an assistive service, which supports aspects of a daily activity that are specific to an older adult; 2) the wizard-generated service is uploaded in an existing smart home platform and interpreted by a dedicated component, carrying out the caregiver-defined service. Our approach has been implemented. Our wizard has been successfully used to define existing manually-programmed, activity-supporting services. The resulting services have been deployed and executed by an existing assisted living platform deployed in the home of community-dwelling individuals. They have been shown to be equivalent to their manually-programmed counterparts. We also conducted an ergonomics study involving five occupational therapists, who tested our wizard with clinical vignettes describing fictitious patients. Participants were able to successfully define services while revealing an ease of use of our wizard.},

  abstract     = {One of the major challenges in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on machine learning is the scarcity of labeled data. Indeed, collecting a sufficient amount of training data to build a reliable recognition problem is often prohibitive. Among the many solutions in the literature to mitigate this issue, collaborative learning is emerging as a promising direction to distribute the annotation burden over multiple users that cooperate to build a shared recognition model. One of the major issues of existing methods is that they assume a static activity model with a fixed set of target activities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that is based on Growing When Required (GWR) neural networks. A GWR network continuously adapts itself according to the input training data, and hence it is particularly suited when the users share heterogeneous sets of activities. Like in federated learning, for the sake of privacy preservation, each user contributes to the global activity classifier by sharing personal model parameters, and not by directly sharing data. In order to further mitigate privacy threats, we implement a strategy to avoid releasing model parameters that may indirectly reveal information about activities that the user specifically marked as private. Our results on two well-known publicly available datasets show the effectiveness and the flexibility of our approach.},

  abstract     = {An important part of nursing care is the physiotherapist’s physical exercise recovery training (for instance, walking), which is aimed at restoring athletic ability, known as rehabilitation (rehab). In rehab, the big problem is that it is difficult to maintain motivation. Therapies using robots have been proposed, such as animalistic robots that have positive psychological, physiological, and social effects on the patient. These also have an important effect in reducing the on-site human workload. However, the problem with these robots is that they do not actually understand what emotions the user is currently feeling. Some studies have been successful in estimating a person’s emotions. As for non-cognitive approaches, there is an emotional estimation of non-verbal information. In this study, we focus on the characteristics of real-time sensing of emotion through heart rates – unconsciously evaluating what a person experiences – and applying it to select the appropriate turn of phrase by a voice-casting robot. We developed a robot to achieve this purpose. As a result, we were able to confirm the effectiveness of a real-time emotion-sensitive voice-casting robot that performs supportive actions significantly different from non-voice casting robots.},

To come up with valuable services, several solutions to analyze the spatio-temporal trajectories of visitors have been put forward. However, they neither consider the inherent uncertainty of the underlying indoor positioning technologies – Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), RFID, etc. – nor other visitors’ features apart from the spatio-temporal ones (e.g. the level of interaction with the museum displays). For that reason, the present work introduces RECITE, a framework to classify trajectories representing visitors’ actions that copes with the aforementioned limitations of existing solutions. Firstly, RECITE states a novel mapping process for a BLE-based indoor positioning system to accurately detect the visitors’ locations. On top of this mechanism, RECITE includes an ensemble of fuzzy rule classifiers able to tag the visitors’ ongoing trajectories in real time considering both spatio-temporal and other behavioural factors. Finally, the framework has been evaluated in a case of use scenario showing quite promising results.},

From the recorded video data, the human silhouette regions in every frame are then extracted based on the codebook background subtraction technique. Low-dimensionality representative features of extracted silhouetted are then extracted by convolutional neural network-based autoencoder (CNN-AE). Features obtained from the CNN-AE are applied to construct an one class support vector machine (OCSVM) model, which is a data driven model based on the video recordings and can be applied for fall detection. From the comprehensive experimental evaluations on different people in a real home environment, it is shown that the proposed fall detection system can successfully detect different types of falls (falls towards different orientations at different positions in a real home environment) with small false alarms.},

In this paper, a novel method for ship detection using satellite images is proposed. First the preprocessing is carried out to remove the noise from the images using Ship Detection and Tracking (SDT) filter. Then, the land masking (sea-land area separation) and cloud masking is carried out based on the gradient feature extraction using SDT edge detection, along with SDT segmentation. Finally, the ships are identified using the Machine Learning (ML) classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), KNN, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes-based classifier based on the features extracted from Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). The proposed work is cross validated using the Google earth data. Performance of our proposed method is evaluated using the recall and the precision values. Further, for tracking ships, an improved multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) algorithm is proposed and tested using the Kaggle dataset.},

These case images are quickly and accurately classified, the automatic classification of cases is completed in the city management system. ZCA (Zero-phase Component Analysis)-whitening is used to reduce the correlation between image data features, an eight-layer convolutional neural network model is built to classify the whitened images, and rectified linear unit (ReLU) is used in the convolutional layer to accelerate the training process, the dropout technology is used in the pooling layer, the algorithm is prevented from overfitting. Back Propagation (BP) algorithm is used for optimization in the network fine-tuning stage, the robustness of the algorithm is improved. Based on the above method, the two types of case images of road traffic and city appearance environment were subjected to two classification experiments. The accuracy has reached 97.5%, and the F1-Score has reached 0.98. The performance exceeded LSVM (Langrangian Support Vector Machine), SAE (Sparse autoencoder), and traditional CNN (Convolution Neural Network). At the same time, this method conducts four-classification experiments on four types of cases: electric vehicles, littering, illegal parking of motor vehicles, and mess around garbage bins.

Parameters on which the localization accuracy mostly depends are analyzed: localization algorithm, beacons’ density, deployment strategy, and noise in the BLE channels. An adaptive algorithm for pre-processing the signals from the beacons is proposed, which aims to reduce noise in beacon’s data and to capture visitor’s dynamics. The accuracy of five range-based localization algorithms in different use case scenarios is analyzed. Three of these algorithms are specially designed to be less sensitive to noise in radio channels and require little computing power. Experiments conducted in a simulated and real environment show that using proposed algorithms the localization accuracy less than 1 m can be obtained.},

These services can improve life quality, minimize environmental impacts, improve health service, improve security, and bear the increasing number of people in the cities. Life quality encompasses many subjects, and accessibility for People with Disabilities (PwD) is one. In this article, smart cities focused on helping PwD are called Assistive Smart Cities (ASCs). In this sense, the article proposes a Model for Assistive Smart Cities called MASC. Related works do not cover geographically broad areas, such as cities and metropolitan regions. Moreover, they are not generic in terms of disabilities and are usually intended only for one type of disability. Given this scenario, the MASC covers large regions and supports various disabilities, such as hearing, visual impairment, and limitation of lower limb movements. Unlike the related works, MASC uses the interactions of PwD to compose histories of contexts offered as services. MASC proposes an ontology-based on ubiquitous accessibility concepts. The model evaluation focused on performance, functionality, and usability. Performance and functionality evaluations were performed using data generated by a context simulator called Siafu and data from the Open Street Maps (OSM) platform. Usability was evaluated using a smart wheelchair prototype. The results of usability show 96% acceptance regarding ease of use and 98% regarding system utility. The results indicate that the model supports massive applications, managing information to generate trails. Besides, MASC provides services for different types of users, namely PwD, healthcare professionals, and public administration.},

The core service of assistive living technology is to monitor elders’ activities through wearable devices, ambient sensors, and vision systems. Vision systems are among the best solutions, as their implementation and maintenance costs are the lowest. However, current vision systems are limited in their ability to handle cluttered environments, occlusion, illumination changes throughout the day, and monitoring without illumination. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a 24/7 monitoring system for elders that uses retroreflective tape fabricated as part of conventional clothing, monitored through low-cost infrared (IR) cameras fixed in the living environment. IR camera records video even when there are changes in illumination or zero luminance. For classification among clutter and occlusion, the tape is considered as a blob instead of a human silhouette; the orientation angle, fitted through ellipse modeling, of the blob in each frame allows classification that detects falls without pretrained data. System performance was tested using subjects in various age groups and “fall” or “non-fall” were detected with 99.01% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {A smart home inhabitant performs a unique pattern or sequence of tasks repeatedly. Thus, a machine learning approach will be required to build an intelligent network of home appliances, and the algorithm should respond quickly to execute the decision. This study proposes a decision tree-based machine learning approach for predicting the activities using different appliances such as state, locations and time. A noise filter is employed to remove unwanted data and generate task sequences, and dual state properties of a home appliance are utilized to extract episodes from the sequence. An incremental decision tree approach was taken to reduce execution time. The algorithm was tested using a well-known smart home dataset from MavLab. The experimental results showed that the algorithm successfully extracted 689 predictions and their location at 90% accuracy, and the total execution time was 94 s, which is less than that of existing methods. A hardware prototype was designed using Raspberry Pi 2 B to validate the proposed prediction system. The general-purpose input-output (GPIO) interfaces of Raspberry Pi 2 B were used to communicate with the prototype testbed and showed that the algorithm successfully predicted the next activities.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, smart applications are increasing day by day to improve the standard of living in smart cities. A modern-day smart city is characterized by the presence of numerous smart Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-enabled services such as automated healthcare, automatic building monitoring, home automation, smart parking, traffic management, data security, among others. Such cities employ multitudes of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to collect and share data between trusted users by means of a centralized intermediary for monitoring and control of the myriad automatic activities. However, a centralized intermediary is plagued by issues such as single point of failure, risk of data loss, man-in-the-middle attack, and so forth. Blockchain-based smart contracts for automated control in smart cities provide a decentralized and secure alternative. In this paper, an Ethereum based system design for decentralized applications in smart cities has been proposed that enables systems to share data without an intermediary between trusted and non-trusted stakeholders using Ethereum based self-executing contracts. Such contracts allow automated multi-step workflows for smart applications. Two use cases, have been considered namely smart healthcare and smart building monitoring, as proof of stake of the proposed Ethereum based contract. The performance of the proposed scheme for these use cases has been presented with Keccack 256 transaction hash, the total number of transactions, gas consumed by each contract. Such an attempt is a worthwhile addition to state of the art as evident from the results presented herein. The modeling simulation and analysis of hashing power shows that for hashing power greater than 55% the probability of double spending attack reaches to 42% maximum. So it is concluded that the probability of double spending increases with the increase of transaction values.},

These new smart systems are adopted for energy efficiency, demand and response, management and control, fault recovery, reliability and quality of services. With various benefits, smart grids have vulnerabilities due to open communication systems, and open infrastructures. Smart grids systems are based on real-time services, where privacy and security id one of the major challenge. In order to address these challenges and deal with security and privacy issues, we proposed a Trust Evaluation Model for Smart Grids (TEMSG) for secure data aggregation in smart grids and smart cities. This model tackles privacy and security issues such as data theft, denial of services, data privacy and inside and outside attacks and malware attacks. Machine learning methods are used to gather trust values and then estimate the imprecise information to secure the data aggregation in smart grids. Experiments are conducted to evaluate and analyze the proposed model in terms of detection rate, trustworthiness, and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, cities are intended to change to a smart city. According to recent studies, the use of data from contributors and physical objects in many cities play a key element in the transformation towards a smart city. The ‘smart city’ standard is characterized by omnipresent computing resources for the observing and critical control of such city’s framework, healthcare management, environment, transportation, and utilities. Mist computing is considered a computing prototype that performs IoT applications at the edge of the network. To maintain the Quality of Service (QoS), it is impressive to employ context-aware computing as well as fog computing simultaneously. In this article, the author implements an optimization strategy applying a dynamic resource allocation method based upon genetic algorithm and reinforcement learning in combination with a load balancing procedure. The proposed model comprises four layers i.e. IoT layer, Mist layer, Fog layer, and Cloud layer. Authors have proposed a load balancing technique called M2F balancer which regulates the traffic in the network incessantly, accumulates the information about each server load, transfer the incoming query, and disseminate them among accessible servers equally using dynamic resources allocation method. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm makespan, resource utilization, and the degree of imbalance (DOI) are considered as the scheduling parameter. The proposed method is being compared with the Least count, Round Robin, and Weighted Round Robin. In the end, the results demonstrate that the solutions enhance QoS in the mist assisted cloud environment concerning maximization resource utilization and minimizing the makespan. Therefore, M2FBalancer is an effective method to utilize the resources efficiently by ensuring uninterrupted service. Consequently, it improves performance even at peak times.},

  abstract     = {The world of computation has shown wide variety of wonders in the past decade with Internet of Things (IoT) being one of the most promising technology. Emergence of IoT brings a lot of good to the technology pool with its capability to provide intelligent services to the users. With ease to use, IoT is backed by a strong Cloud based infrastructure which allows the sensory IoT devices to perform specific functions. Important features of cloud are its reliability and security where the latter must be dealt with proper care. Cloud centric systems are susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks wherein the cloud server is subjected to an overwhelming number of incoming requests by a malicious device. If the same attack is carried out by a network of devices such as IoT devices then it becomes a Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack. A DDoS attack may render the server useless for a long period of time causing the services to crash due to extensive load. This paper proposes a lightweight, efficient and robust method for DDoS attack by detecting the compromised node connected to the Fog node or edge devices before it reaches the cloud by taking advantage of the Fog layer and prevent it from harming any information recorded or from increasing the unnecessary traffic in a network. The chosen technology stack consists of languages and frameworks which allow proposed approach to works in real time complexity for faster execution and is flexible enough to work on low level systems such as the Fog nodes. The proposed approach uses mathematical models for forecasting data points and therefore does not rely on a computationally heavy approach such as neural networks for predicting the expected values. This approach can be easily modelled into the firmware of the system and can help make cloud services more reliable by cutting off rogue nodes that try to attack the cloud at any given point of time.},

  abstract     = {In the popular field of cloud computing, millions of job requests arrive at the data centre for execution. The job of the data centre is to optimally allocate virtual machines (VMs) to these job requests in order to use resources efficiently. In the future smart cities, huge amount of job requests and data will be generated by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices which will influence the designing of optimum resource management of smart cloud environments. The present paper analyses the performance efficiency of the data centre with and without job request consolidation. First, the work load performance of the data centre was analysed without job request consolidation, exhibiting that the job requests to VM assignment was highly imbalanced, and only 5% of VMs were running with a load factor of more than 70%. Then, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution-based VM selection algorithm was applied, which was able to select the best VM using parameters such as the provisioned or available central processing unit capacity, provisioned or available memory capacity, and state of machine (running, hibernated, or available). The Bitbrains dataset consisting of 1750 VMs was used to analyse the performance of the proposed methodology. The analysis concluded that the proposed methodology was capable of serving all job requests using less than 24% VMs with improved load efficiency. The fewer number of VMs with an improved load factor guarantees energy saving and an increase in the overall running efficiency of the smart data centre environment.},

  abstract     = {Smart manufacturing is a challenging trend being fostered by the Industry 4.0 paradigm. In this scenario Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are particularly elected for modeling such types of intelligent, decentralised processes, thanks to their autonomy in pursuing collective and cooperative goals. From a human perspective, however, increasing the confidence in trustworthiness of MAS based Cyber-physical Production Systems (CPPS) remains a significant challenge. Manufacturing services must comply with strong requirements in terms of reliability, robustness and latency, and solution providers are expected to ensure that agents will operate within certain boundaries of the production, and mitigate unattended behaviours during the execution of manufacturing activities. To address this concern, a Manufacturing Agent Accountability Framework is proposed, a dynamic authorization framework that defines and enforces boundaries in which agents are freely permitted to exploit their intelligence to reach individual and collective objectives. The expected behaviour of agents is to adhere to CPPS workflows which implicitly define acceptable regions of behaviours and production feasibility. Core contributions of the proposed framework are: a manufacturing accountability model, the representation of the Leaf Diagrams for the governance of agent behavioural autonomy, and an ontology of declarative policies for the identification and avoidance of ill-intentioned behaviours in the execution of CPPS services. We outline the application of this enhanced trustworthiness framework to an agent-based manufacturing use-case for the production of a variety of hand tools.},

  abstract     = {In the current health care scenario, security is the major concern in IoT-WSN with more devices or nodes. Attack or anomaly detection in the IoT infrastructure is increasing distress in the field of medical IoT. With the enormous usage of IoT infrastructure in every province, threats and attacks in these infrastructures are also mounting commensurately. This paper intends to develop a security mechanism to detect and prevent the black hole and selective forwarding attack from medical IoT-WSN. The proposed secure strategy is developed in five stages: First is selecting the cluster heads, second is generating k-routing paths, third is security against black hole attack, fourth is security against the selective forwarding attack, and the last is optimal shortest route path selection. Initially, a topology is developed for finding the cluster heads and discovering the best route. In the next phase, the black hole attacks are detected and prevented by the bait process. For detecting the selective forwarding attacks, the packet validation is done by checking the transmitted packet and the received packet. For promoting the packet security, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)-based hashing function is deployed. As the main contribution of this paper, optimal shortest route path is determined by the proposed hybrid algorithm with the integration of Deer Hunting Optimization Algorithm (DHOA), and DragonFly Algorithm (DA) termed Dragonfly-based DHOA (D-DHOA) by concerting the parameters like trust, distance, delay or latency and packet loss ratio in the objective model. Hence, the entire phases will be very active in detecting and preventing the two fundamental attacks like a black hole and selective forwarding from IoT-WSN in the health care sector.},

Despite improving operations in essential areas such as health, there are still concerns associated with ubiquitous monitoring. For benefits associated with ubiquitous monitoring to be fully realized, there is the need to understand the role of user perceptions. This study investigates the factors that influence user perceptions of ubiquitous monitoring devices by drawing samples from a developing country. Users’ response on seven recurring ubiquitous monitoring perceptions were collected using a survey questionnaire. The relationships among these factors were analysed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling. The results suggest a significant relationship between Perceived Natural Border Crossing and Perceived Privacy Invasion. Also Perceived Affordance, Perceived Coverage and Perceived Privacy Invasion predicted Perceived Trust. The findings imply that more emphasis must be given to educating and familiarizing users with ubiquitous monitoring devices. Future studies are expected to replicate the study in other developing societies to validate these claims.},

Acquiring high-quality , detailed, continuous annotations is a challenging task. In this paper, we explore the solution space on sharing annotated activities across different datasets in order to enhance the recognition accuracies. The main challenge is to resolve heterogeneity in feature and activity space between datasets; that is, each dataset can have a different number of sensors in heterogeneous sensing technologies and deployed in diverse environments and record various activities on different users. To address the challenge, we have designed and developed sharing data and sharing classifiers algorithms that feature the knowledge model to enable computationally-efficient feature space remapping and uncertainty reasoning to enable effective classifier fusion. We have validated the algorithms on three third-party real-world datasets and demonstrated their effectiveness in recognising activities only with annotations from as little as 0.1% of each dataset.},

  abstract     = {With the pervasiveness of GPS-enabled devices, a considerable number of GPS traces are accumulating continuously and unobtrusively in online communities. However, almost all current applications directly use raw GPS data, such as coordinates and time stamps, without interpreting these data. Thus far, online communities cannot offer much support to users in terms of recommending geospatial locations. Furthermore, because the data sets involved are large, users cannot browse each GPS trajectory individually. Therefore, users’ GPS trajectories must be mined and then classified as positive or negative. When the number of ratings for a place exceeds a certain threshold, the place is considered suitable for the user. By contrast, when the ratings for a place are mostly negative, this place is considered unsuitable for the user. When a user searches for the best place, the recommender system determines the user’s location (latitude, longitude) and then sends the best-rated destinations and the shortest routes between the user’s location and the destination to the user’s mobile device. Experiments were conducted in this study to determine the requisite similarity for GPS data points, the user’s information, and the best route for the user.},

  abstract     = {The development of Road Information Acquisition Systems (RIASs) based on the Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) paradigm has been widely studied for the last years. In that sense, most of the existing MCS-based RIASs focus on urban road networks and assume a car-based scenario. However, there exist a scarcity of approaches that pay attention to rural and country road networks. In that sense, forest paths are used for a wide range of recreational and sport activities by many different people and they can be also affected by different problems or obstacles blocking them. As a result, this work introduces SAMARITAN, a framework for rural-road network monitoring based on MCS. SAMARITAN analyzes the spatio-temporal trajectories from cyclists extracted from the fitness application Strava so as to uncover potential obstacles in a target road network. The framework has been evaluated in a real-world network of forest paths in the city of Cieza (Spain) showing quite promising results.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the development of advanced mobile applications, people’s various daily behavior data, such as geographic location, social information, hobbies, are more easily collected. To process these data, data cross-boundary fusion has become a key technology, and there are some challenges, such as solving the problems of the cross-boundary business integrity, cross-boundary value complementarity and so on. Mobile Services Recommendation requires improved recommendation accuracy. User trust is an effective measure of information similarity between users. Using trust can effectively improve the accuracy of recommendations. The existing methods have low utilization of general trust data, sparseness of trust data, and lack of user trust characteristics. Therefore, a method needs to be proposed to make up for the shortcomings of explicit trust relationships and improve the accuracy of user interest feature completion. In this paper, a recommendation model is proposed to mine the implicit trust relationships from user data and integrate the explicit social information of users. First, the rating prediction model was improved using the traditional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) model, and the implicit trust relationships were mined from the user’s historical data. Then, they were fused with the explicit social trust relationships to obtain a crossover data fusion model. We tested the model using three different orders of magnitude. We compared the user preference prediction accuracies of two models: one that does not integrate social information and one that integrates social information. The results show that our model improves the user preference prediction accuracy and has higher accuracy for cold start users. On the three data sets, the average error is reduced by 2.29%, 5.44% and 4.42%, suggesting that it is an effective data crossover fusion technology.},

  abstract     = {Although spatial and temporal information has often been considered to improve recommendation performances, existing multi-criteria recommender systems often neglect to leverage spatial and temporal information. Also, it is a non-trivial task to simultaneously apply such information to recommendation services since the factors have interrelations to each other. In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria tensor model combining spatial and temporal information. The auxiliary information is categorized by several features and applied into the model. In particular, the spatial information of users’ countries is grouped into seven continents to reduce response times for learning the model. The single model enables to us keep the inherent structure of and the interrelations between multi-criteria and spatial/temporal information. To predict user preferences, tensor factorization based on Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition is exploited. Experimental results with a TripAdvisor dataset show that the proposed method outperforms other baseline methods based on a 2-dimensional rating matrix, tensor model, and other multi-criteria recommendation, in terms of RMSE and MAE. Furthermore, several experiments reveal the influences of the individual factors (i.e., multi-criteria, spatial and temporal information) and their consolidations, on restaurant recommendation. A comparative analysis of the multi-criteria elements shows that their influences relate to their correlations.},
