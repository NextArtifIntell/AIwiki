  abstract     = {Let π be the occupancy density of an obliquely reflected Brownian motion in the half plane and let (ρ,α) be the polar coordinates of a point in the upper half plane. This work determines the exact asymptotic behavior of π(ρ,α) as ρ→∞ with α∈(0,π). We find explicit functions a, b, c such that π(ρ,α)∼ρ→∞a(α)ρb(α)e−c(α)ρ. This closes an open problem first stated by Professor J. Michael Harrison in August 2013. We also compute the exact asymptotics for the tail distribution of the boundary occupancy measure and we obtain an explicit integral expression for π. We conclude by finding the Martin boundary of the process and giving all of the corresponding harmonic functions satisfying an oblique Neumann boundary problem.},

This leads to generic approximation and stability theorems in the spirit of classical martingale problem theory. We also prove uniqueness and path regularity of solutions under additional hypotheses.

Here we obtain universality of this fact: For asymmetric disorder given by i.i.d. variables of zero mean, unit variance and exponential or better tail decay, at every temperature, the empirical law of sample paths of the Langevin-like dynamics in a fixed time interval has the same a.s. limit μ⋆.},

For this, an original construction of the Hawkes process as a functional of a Poisson point process is derived from the immigration-birth representation, and the independence properties of the Poisson point process are exploited to exhibit regeneration times which are anticipative and not even measurable w.r.t. the Hawkes process. The regeneration time is interpreted as the renewal time at zero of an M/G/∞ queue, which yields a formula for its Laplace transform. When the transfer function has exponential moments, we stochastically dominate the cluster length by exponential random variables with computable parameters. This provides explicit bounds on the Laplace transform of the regeneration time in terms of simple integrals or of special functions, which yields an explicit negative upper-bound on its abscissa of convergence. The power of the regenerative properties is showcased by being applied to long-time asymptotic results for a class of sliding window statistical estimators, using coupling and sample-path decomposition techniques.},

The process can be designed to have an arbitrary Gibbs type marginal probability density for its position coordinate, which makes it suitable for Monte Carlo simulation of continuous probability distributions. An important question in assessing the efficiency of this method is how fast the empirical measure converges to the stationary distribution of the process. In this paper we provide a partial answer to this question by characterizing the large deviations of the empirical measure from the stationary distribution. Based on the Feng–Kurtz approach, we develop an abstract framework aimed at encompassing piecewise deterministic Markov processes in position-velocity space. We derive explicit conditions for the zig-zag process to allow the Donsker–Varadhan variational formulation of the rate function, both for a compact setting (the torus) and one-dimensional Euclidean space. Finally we derive an explicit expression for the Donsker–Varadhan functional for the case of a compact state space and use this form of the rate function to address a key question concerning the optimal choice of the switching rate of the zig-zag process.},

Our goal is to infer M∗, exactly or approximately, from the edge weights. In this paper we take P=exp(λ) and Q=exp(1/n), in which case the maximum-likelihood estimator of M∗ is the minimum-weight matching Mmin. We obtain precise results on the overlap between M∗ and Mmin, that is, the fraction of edges they have in common. For λ≥4 we have almost perfect recovery, with overlap 1−o(1) with high probability. For λ&lt;4 the expected overlap is an explicit function α(λ)&lt;1: we compute it by generalizing Aldous’ celebrated proof of the ζ(2) conjecture for the unplanted model, using local weak convergence to relate Kn,n to a type of weighted infinite tree, and then deriving a system of differential equations from a message-passing algorithm on this tree.},

  abstract     = {The bouncy particle sampler is a Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on a nonreversible piecewise deterministic Markov process. In this scheme, a particle explores the state space of interest by evolving according to a linear dynamics which is altered by bouncing on the hyperplane perpendicular to the gradient of the negative log-target density at the arrival times of an inhomogeneous poisson process (PP) and by randomly perturbing its velocity at the arrival times of a homogeneous PP. Under regularity conditions, we show here that the process corresponding to the first component of the particle and its corresponding velocity converges weakly towards a randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RHMC) process as the dimension of the ambient space goes to infinity. RHMC is another piecewise deterministic nonreversible Markov process where a Hamiltonian dynamics is altered at the arrival times of a homogeneous PP by randomly perturbing the momentum component. We then establish dimension-free convergence rates for RHMC for strongly log-concave targets with bounded Hessians using coupling ideas and hypocoercivity techniques. We use our understanding of the mixing properties of the limiting RHMC process to choose the refreshment rate parameter of BPS. This results in significantly better performance in our simulation study than previously suggested guidelines.},

The submodularity assumption has a number of interesting consequences. First, it allows us to prove existence of solutions via an application of Tarski’s fixed point theorem, covering cases with discontinuous dependence on the measure variable. Second, it ensures that the set of solutions enjoys a lattice structure: in particular, there exist minimal and maximal solutions. Third, it guarantees that those two solutions can be obtained through a simple learning procedure based on the iterations of the best-response-map. The mean field game is first defined over ordinary stochastic controls, then extended to relaxed controls. Our approach also allows us to prove existence of a strong solution for a class of submodular mean field games with common noise, where the representative player at equilibrium interacts with the (conditional) mean of its state’s distribution.},

It turns out that this is directly related with the tail asymptotics of the exit time of the random walk x+S(n) from the quadrant, so that the main part of this paper is devoted to an analysis of that exit time in relation with the drift vector, that is, the expectation of X.},

Starting from a random configuration, similar states gather in increasingly large clusters; asymptotically, any finite region is filled with a uniform state that is, after some time, driven out by its predator, each state taking its turn in dominating the region (heteroclinic cycles). We consider the situation where each site in the initial configuration is chosen independently at random with a different probability for each state. We prove that the asymptotic probability that a state dominates a finite region corresponds to the initial probability of its prey.

A large deviation principle (LDP) for the occupancy process is established, as n→∞, in a suitable infinite-dimensional path space. Model features that present technical challenges include, Markovian dynamics with discontinuous statistics, a diminishing rate property of the transition probability rates, and an infinite-dimensional state space. The difficulty is in the proof of the Laplace lower bound which requires establishing the uniqueness of solutions of certain infinite-dimensional systems of controlled ordinary differential equations. The LDP gives information on the rate of decay of probabilities of various types of rare events associated with the system. We illustrate this by establishing explicit exponential decay rates for probabilities of long queues. In particular, denoting by Ejn(T) the event that there is at least one queue with j or more jobs at some time instant over [0,T], we show that, in the critical case, for large n and T, P(Ejn(T))≈exp[−n(j−2)24T].},

Next we prove existence of delocalized gradient Gibbs measures, under natural conditions on Q.

However, the intractability of certain covariance terms has so far precluded applications to heterogeneous models. Here we demonstrate that the existence of an appropriate coupling can be exploited to bypass this limitation effortlessly. Our main result is a dimension-free modified log-Sobolev inequality for zero-range processes on the complete graph, under the only requirement that all rate increments lie in a compact subset of (0,∞). This settles an open problem raised by Caputo and Posta (Probab. Theory Related Fields 139 (2007) 65–87) and reiterated by Caputo, Dai Pra and Posta (Ann. Inst. Henri Poincaré Probab.

We establish the correspondence of the initial problem with a possibly infinite dimensional Markovian one in a Banach space, which allows us to identify the Markovian controlled state variables. Using a refined martingale verification argument combined with a squares completion technique, we prove that the value function is of linear quadratic form in these state variables with a linear optimal feedback control, depending on nonstandard Banach space valued Riccati equations. Furthermore, we show that the value function of the stochastic Volterra optimization problem can be approximated by that of conventional finite dimensional Markovian linear-quadratic problems, which is of crucial importance for numerical implementation.},

Central limit theorems for the final size (number of initial susceptibles that become infected) of such an epidemic as the population size n tends to infinity, with explicit, easy to compute expressions for the asymptotic variance, are proved assuming that the degrees are bounded. The results are obtained for both the Molloy–Reed random graph, in which the degrees of individuals are deterministic, and the Newman–Strogatz–Watts random graph, in which the degrees are independent and identically distributed. The central limit theorems cover the cases when the number of initial infectives either (a) tends to infinity or (b) is held fixed as n→∞. In (a) it is assumed that the fraction of the population that is initially infected converges to a limit (which may be 0) as n→∞, while in (b) the central limit theorems are conditional upon the occurrence of a large outbreak (more precisely one of size at least logn). Central limit theorems for the size of the largest cluster in bond percolation on Molloy–Reed and Newman–Strogatz–Watts random graphs follow immediately from our results, as do central limit theorems for the size of the giant component of those graphs.

  abstract     = {Kingman’s (1978) representation theorem (J. Lond. Math. Soc. (2) 18 (1978) 374–380) states that any exchangeable partition of ℕ can be represented as a paintbox based on a random mass-partition. Similarly, any exchangeable composition (i.e., ordered partition of ℕ) can be represented as a paintbox based on an interval-partition (Gnedin (1997) Ann. Probab. 25 (1997) 1437–1450). Our first main result is that any exchangeable coalescent process (not necessarily Markovian) can be represented as a paintbox based on a random nondecreasing process valued in interval-partitions, called nested interval-partition, generalizing the notion of comb metric space introduced in Lambert and Uribe Bravo (2017) (p-Adic Numbers Ultrametric Anal. Appl. 9 (2017) 22–38) to represent compact ultrametric spaces. As a special case, we show that any Λ-coalescent can be obtained from a paintbox based on a unique random nested interval partition called Λ-comb, which is Markovian with explicit transitions. This nested interval-partition directly relates to the flow of bridges of Bertoin and Le Gall (2003) (Probab. Theory Related Fields 126 (2003) 261–288). We also display a particularly simple description of the so-called evolving coalescent (Pfaffelhuber and Wakolbinger (2006) Stochastic Process. Appl. 116 (2006) 1836–1859) by a comb-valued Markov process. Next, we prove that any ultrametric measure space U, under mild measure-theoretic assumptions on U, is the leaf set of a tree composed of a separable subtree called the backbone, on which are grafted additional subtrees, which act as star-trees from the standpoint of sampling. Displaying this so-called weak isometry requires us to extend the Gromov-weak topology of Greven, Pfaffelhuber and Winter (2009) (Probab. Theory Related Fields 145 (2009) 285–322), that was initially designed for separable metric spaces, to nonseparable ultrametric spaces. It allows us to show that for any such ultrametric space U, there is a nested interval-partition which is (1) indistinguishable from U in the Gromov-weak topology; (2) weakly isometric to U if U has a complete backbone; (3) isometric to U if U is complete and separable.},

  abstract     = {We obtain several quantitative bounds on the mixing properties of an “ideal” Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) Markov chain for a strongly log-concave target distribution π on Rd. Our main result says that the HMC Markov chain generates a sample with Wasserstein error ϵ in roughly O(κ2log(1ϵ)) steps, where the condition number κ=M2 m2 is the ratio of the maximum M2 and minimum m2 eigenvalues of the Hessian of −log(π). In particular, this mixing bound does not depend explicitly on the dimension d. These results significantly extend and improve previous quantitative bounds on the mixing of ideal HMC, and can be used to analyze more realistic HMC algorithms. The main ingredient of our argument is a proof that initially “parallel” Hamiltonian trajectories contract over much longer steps than would be predicted by previous heuristics based on the Jacobi manifold.},

  abstract     = {Consider a spiked random tensor obtained as a mixture of two components: noise in the form of a symmetric Gaussian p-tensor for p≥3 and signal in the form of a symmetric low-rank random tensor. The latter is defined as a linear combination of k independent symmetric rank-one random tensors, referred to as spikes, with weights referred to as signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The entries of the vectors that determine the spikes are i.i.d. sampled from general probability distributions supported on bounded subsets of R. This work focuses on the problem of detecting the presence of these spikes, and establishes the phase transition of this detection problem for any fixed k≥1. In particular, it shows that for a set of relatively low SNRs it is impossible to distinguish between the spiked and nonspiked Gaussian tensors. Furthermore, in the interior of the complement of this set, where at least one of the k SNRs is relatively high, these two tensors are distinguishable by the likelihood ratio test. In addition, when the total number of low-rank components, k, of the p-tensor of size N grows in the order o(N(p−2)/4) as N tends to infinity, the problem exhibits an analogous phase transition. This theory for spike detection is also shown to imply that recovery of the spikes by the minimum mean square error exhibits the same phase transition. The main methods used in this work arise from the study of mean field spin glass models, where the phase transition thresholds are identified as the critical inverse temperatures distinguishing the high and low-temperature regimes of the free energies. In particular, our result formulates the first full characterization of the high temperature regime for vector-valued spin glass models with independent coordinates.},

  abstract     = {Horizontal gene transfer consists in exchanging genetic materials between microorganisms during their lives. This is a major mechanism of bacterial evolution and is believed to be of main importance in antibiotics resistance. We consider a stochastic model for the evolution of a discrete population structured by a trait taking finitely many values, with density-dependent competition. Traits are vertically inherited unless a mutation occurs, and can also be horizontally transferred by unilateral conjugation with frequency dependent rate. Our goal is to analyze the trade-off between natural evolution to higher birth rates on one side, and transfer which drives the population towards lower birth rates on the other side. Simulations show that evolutionary outcomes include evolutionary suicide or cyclic re-emergence of small populations with well-adapted traits. We focus on a parameter scaling where individual mutations are rare but the global mutation rate tends to infinity. This implies that negligible subpopulations may have a strong contribution to evolution. Our main result quantifies the asymptotic dynamics of subpopulation sizes on a logarithmic scale. We characterize the possible evolutionary outcomes with explicit criteria on the model parameters. An important ingredient for the proofs lies in comparisons of the stochastic population process with linear or logistic birth–death processes with immigration. For the latter processes, we derive several results of independent interest.},

Possible models are all those under which the assets’ region E and instantaneous covariation c are known, and where the assets are stable with an exogenously given limiting density p, in that their occupancy time measures converge to a law governed by p. This latter assumption is motivated by the observed stability of ranked relative market capitalizations for equity markets. We seek to identify the robust optimal growth rate, as well as a trading strategy which achieves this rate in all models. Under minimal assumptions upon (E,c,p), which in particular allow for an arbitrary number of assets, we identify the robust growth rate with the Donsker–Varadhan rate function from occupancy time large deviations theory. We also explicitly obtain the optimal trading strategy. We apply our results to the case of drift uncertainty for ranked relative market capitalizations. Here, assuming regularity under symmetrization for the covariance and limiting density of the ranked capitalizations, we explicitly identify the robust optimal trading strategy.},

Nevertheless, we provide an explicit formula for all eigenvalues of the shuffle by demonstrating a useful correspondence between eigenvalues and standard Young tableaux. This allows us to prove the existence of a total-variation cutoff for the one-sided transposition shuffle at time nlogn.

We show that, in the large-population-size limit and with an appropriate scaling of time, the evolution of the associated adjacency matrix converges to a random process in the space of graphons, driven by the type-connection matrix and the underlying Fisher–Wright diffusion on the multi-type simplex. In the limit as the number of types tends to infinity, the limiting process is driven by the type-connection kernel and the underlying Fleming–Viot diffusion.},

  abstract     = {Over the last three decades, there has been a considerable effort within the applied probability community to develop techniques for bounding the convergence rates of general state space Markov chains. Most of these results assume the existence of drift and minorization (d&amp;m) conditions. It has often been observed that convergence rate bounds based on single-step d&amp;m tend to be overly conservative, especially in high-dimensional situations. This article builds a framework for studying this phenomenon. It is shown that any convergence rate bound based on a set of d&amp;m conditions cannot do better than a certain unknown optimal bound. Strategies are designed to put bounds on the optimal bound itself, and this allows one to quantify the extent to which a d&amp;m-based convergence rate bound can be sharp. The new theory is applied to several examples, including a Gaussian autoregressive process (whose true convergence rate is known), and a Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm. The results strongly suggest that convergence rate bounds based on single-step d&amp;m conditions are quite inadequate in high-dimensional settings.},

This model, inspired by the smoothed complexity analysis introduced in computational geometry (J. Comput. Geom. 7 (2016) 101–144; J.

We show that the perturbed point process, after rescaling, converges in the scaling limit to one of five Poisson point processes according to whether α belongs to one of five regimes. The intensity measure of the limit Poisson point process undergoes a transition at the values α=−2d−1 and α=2d+1 and it gives rise to four rescalings for the k-face functional on perturbed data. These rescalings are used to establish explicit expectation asymptotics for the number of k-dimensional faces of the convex hull of either perturbed binomial or Poisson data. In the case of Poisson input, we establish explicit variance asymptotics and a central limit theorem for the number of k-dimensional faces. Finally, it is shown that the rescaled boundary of the convex hull of the perturbed point process converges to the boundary of a parabolic hull process.},

This is accompanied with a universality result which allows us to replace the Bernoulli distribution with a large class of other discrete distributions.

  abstract     = {We study the following preferential attachment variant of the classical Erdős–Rényi random graph process. Starting with an empty graph on n vertices, new edges are added one-by-one, and each time an edge is chosen with probability roughly proportional to the product of the current degrees of its endpoints (note that the vertex set is fixed). We determine the asymptotic size of the giant component in the supercritical phase, confirming a conjecture of Pittel from 2010. Our proof uses a simple method: we condition on the vertex degrees (of a multigraph variant), and use known results for the configuration model.},

  abstract     = {We establish the average-case hardness of the algorithmic problem of exact computation of the partition function associated with the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model of spin glasses with Gaussian couplings and random external field. In particular, we establish that unless P=#P, there does not exist a polynomial-time algorithm to exactly compute the partition function on average. This is done by showing that if there exists a polynomial time algorithm, which exactly computes the partition function for inverse polynomial fraction (1/nO(1)) of all inputs, then there is a polynomial time algorithm, which exactly computes the partition function for all inputs, with high probability, yielding P=#P. The computational model that we adopt is finite-precision arithmetic, where the algorithmic inputs are truncated first to a certain level N of digital precision. The ingredients of our proof include the random and downward self-reducibility of the partition function with random external field; an argument of Cai et al. (In STACS 99 (Trier) (1999) 90–99 Springer) for establishing the average-case hardness of computing the permanent of a matrix; a list-decoding algorithm of Sudan (In 37th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (Burlington, VT, 1996) (1996) 164–172 IEEE Comput. Soc. Press), for reconstructing polynomials intersecting a given list of numbers at sufficiently many points; and near-uniformity of the log-normal distribution, modulo a large prime p. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first one establishing a provable hardness of a model arising in the field of spin glasses. Furthermore, we extend our result to the same problem under a different real-valued computational model, for example, using a Blum–Shub–Smale machine (In [Proceedings 1988] 29th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (1988) 387–397 IEEE) operating over real-valued inputs. We establish that, if there exists a polynomial time algorithm which exactly computes the partition function for 34+1nO(1) fraction of all inputs, then there exists a polynomial time algorithm, which exactly computes the partition function for all inputs, with high probability, yielding P=#P. Our proof uses the random self-reducibility of the partition function, together with a control over the total variation distance for log-normal random variables in presence of a convex perturbation, and the Berlekamp–Welch algorithm.},

This method is known to perform well when the transition rates satisfy some form of scaling behaviour. In a similar spirit to tau leaping, we propose a new method for approximate simulation of spin systems which approximates the evolution of spin at each site between sampling epochs as an independent two-state Markov chain. When combined with fast summation methods, our method offers considerable improvement in speed over the standard Doob–Gillespie algorithm. We provide a detailed analysis of the error incurred for both the number of sites incorrectly labelled and for linear functions of the state.},

Then X:=Y+Z is the unique solution to the stochastic Cahn–Hilliard equation, where Z is the corresponding O-U process. Moreover, we use the Dirichlet form approach in (Probab.

By clarifying the precise relation between the two solutions, we also get the restricted Markov uniqueness of the generator and the uniqueness of the martingale solutions to the equation (1.1).

Under some moment conditions on the conductance, we prove that the scaling limit of the Markov process is a symmetric α-stable Lévy process on Rd. The well-known corrector method in homogenization theory does not seem to work in this setting. Instead, we utilize probabilistic potential theory for the corresponding jump processes. Two essential ingredients of our proof are the tightness estimate and the Hölder regularity of caloric functions for nonelliptic α-stable-like processes on graphs. Our method is robust enough to apply not only for Zd but also for more general graphs whose scaling limits are nice metric measure spaces.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops tools to obtain robust probabilistic estimates for queueing models at the large deviations (LD) scale. These tools are based on the recently introduced robust Rényi bounds, which provide LD estimates (and more generally risk-sensitive (RS) cost estimates) that hold uniformly over an uncertainty class of models, provided that the class is defined in terms of Rényi divergence with respect to a reference model and that estimates are available for the reference model. One very attractive quality of the approach is that the class to which the estimates apply may consist of hard models, such as highly non-Markovian models and ones for which the LD principle is not available. Our treatment provides exact expressions as well as bounds on the Rényi divergence rate on families of marked point processes, including as a special case renewal processes. Another contribution is a general result that translates robust RS control problems, where robustness is formulated via Rényi divergence, to finite dimensional convex optimization problems, when the control set is a finite dimensional convex set. The implications to queueing are vast, as they apply in great generality. This is demonstrated on two non-Markovian queueing models. One is the multiclass single-server queue considered as a RS control problem, with scheduling as the control process and exponential weighted queue length as cost. The second is the many-server queue with reneging, with the probability of atypically large reneging count as performance criterion. As far as LD analysis is concerned, no robust estimates or non-Markovian treatment were previously available for either of these models.},

A standard way to address this problem is to apply adaptive sequential Monte Carlo (ASMC) methods, which consist in exploiting the information given by the history of the sample to tune the parameters. This article is concerned with variance estimation in such ASMC methods. Specifically, we focus on the case where the asymptotic variance coincides with the one of the “limiting” sequential Monte Carlo algorithm as defined by Beskos et al. (Ann. Appl. Probab. 26 (2016) 1111–1146). We prove that, under natural assumptions, the estimator introduced by Lee and Whiteley (Biometrika 105 (2018) 609–625) in the nonadaptive case (i.e., SMC) is also a consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance for ASMC methods. To do this, we introduce a new estimator that is expressed in terms of coalescent tree-based measures, and explain its connection with the previous one. Our estimator is constructed by tracing the genealogy of the associated interacting particle system. The tools we use connect the study of particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and the variance estimation problem in SMC methods. As such, they may give some new insights when dealing with complex genealogy-involved problems of interacting particle systems in more general scenarios.},

  abstract     = {For sufficiently smooth targets of product form it is known that the variance of a single coordinate of the proposal in RWM (random walk Metropolis) and MALA (Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm) should optimally scale as n−1 and as n−13 with dimension n, and that the acceptance rates should be tuned to 0.234 and 0.574. We establish counterexamples to demonstrate that smoothness assumptions of the order of C1(R) for RWM and C3(R) for MALA are indeed required if these scaling rates are to hold. The counterexamples identify classes of marginal targets for which these guidelines are violated, obtained by perturbing a standard normal density (at the level of the potential for RWM and the second derivative of the potential for MALA) using roughness generated by a path of fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent H. For such targets there is strong evidence that RWM and MALA proposal variances should optimally be scaled as n−1H and as n−12+H and will then obey anomalous acceptance rate guidelines. Useful heuristics resulting from this theory are discussed. The paper develops a framework capable of tackling optimal scaling results for quite general Metropolis–Hastings algorithms (possibly depending on a random environment).},

At each birth event, with probability 1−ρNR the offspring copies one parent’s chromosome, and with probability ρNR she inherits a chromosome that is a mosaic of both parental chromosomes. We assume that at time 0 each individual has her chromosome painted in a different color and we study the color partition of the chromosome that is asymptotically fixed in a large population, when we look at a portion of the chromosome such that ρ:=limN→∞ρNN 2→∞. To do so, we follow backwards in time the ancestry of the chromosome of a randomly sampled individual. This yields a Markov process valued in the color partitions of the half-line, that was introduced by Esser, Probst and Baake (J. Math. Biol. 73 (2016) 161–197), in which blocks can merge and split, called the partitioning process. Its stationary distribution is closely related to the fixed chromosome in our Moran model with recombination. We are able to provide an approximation of this stationary distribution when ρ≫1 and an error bound. This allows us to show that the distribution of the (renormalised) length of the leftmost block of the partition (i.e., the region of the chromosome that carries the same color as 0) converges to an exponential distribution. In addition, the geometry of this block can be described in terms of a Poisson point process with an explicit intensity measure.},

We give straightforward conditions for the process to possess a central limit theorem, and additional conditions for uniform ergodicity and for a coupling from the past construction to hold, enabling exact sampling from the invariant distribution.

The implicit metric of the approximation theorem captures the sizes and locations of the masses, and so also yields bounds on the approximation between the masses of the measure of interest and the Poisson–Dirichlet distribution. We apply the result to bound the error in the approximation of the stationary distribution of types in the finite Wright–Fisher model with infinite-alleles mutation structure (not necessarily parent independent) by the Poisson–Dirichlet distribution. An important consequence of our result is an explicit upper bound on the total variation distance between the random partition generated by sampling from a finite Wright–Fisher stationary distribution, and the Ewens sampling formula. The bound is small if the sample size n is much smaller than N1/6log(N)−1/2, where N is the total population size. Our analysis requires a result of separate interest, giving an explicit bound on the second moment of the number of types of a finite Wright–Fisher stationary distribution. The general approximation result follows from a new development of Stein’s method for the Dirichlet process, which follows by viewing the Dirichlet process as the stationary distribution of a Fleming–Viot process, and then applying Barbour’s generator approach.},

For scale-free networks with unbounded degree fluctuations, we obtain the asymptotics of the number of times a small connected graph occurs as a subgraph or as an induced subgraph. We obtain these results by analyzing the configuration model with degree exponent τ∈(2,3) and introducing a novel class of optimization problems. For any given subgraph, the unique optimizer describes the degrees of the vertices that together span the subgraph. We find that subgraphs typically occur between vertices with specific degree ranges. In this way, we can count and characterize all subgraphs. We refrain from double counting in the case of multi-edges, essentially counting the subgraphs in the erased configuration model.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with a stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control problem in a finite time horizon, where the coefficients of the control system are allowed to be random, and the weighting matrices in the cost functional are allowed to be random and indefinite. It is shown, with a Hilbert space approach, that for the existence of an open-loop optimal control, the convexity of the cost functional (with respect to the control) is necessary; and the uniform convexity, which is slightly stronger, turns out to be sufficient, which also leads to the unique solvability of the associated stochastic Riccati equation. Further, it is shown that the open-loop optimal control admits a closed-loop representation. In addition, some sufficient conditions are obtained for the uniform convexity of the cost functional, which are strictly more general than the classical conditions that the weighting matrix-valued processes are positive (semi-) definite.},

The process was defined through an original type of interaction kernel which involved, in a singular way, all its past time marginal distributions. In the present paper, we study this McKean–Vlasov representation in the two-dimensional case. In this setting, there exists a possibility of a blow-up in finite time for the Keller–Segel system if some parameters of the model are large. Indeed, we prove the global in time well-posedness of the McKean–Vlasov process under some constraints involving a parameter of the model and the initial datum. Under these constraints, we also prove the global well-posedness for the Keller–Segel model in the plane.},

When a vertex fires, one of the edges incident to that vertex is selected. The edge selection is biased towards edges that have been selected many times previously, and a parameter α governs the strength of this bias. We show that for various graphs (including all graphs of bounded degree), if α≫1 (the very strong reinforcement regime) then the random subgraph consisting of edges that are ever selected by this process does not percolate (all connected components are finite). Combined with results appearing in a companion paper, this proves that on these graphs, with α sufficiently large, all connected components are in fact trees. If the Poisson firing rates are constant over the vertices, then these trees are of diameter at most 3. The proof of nonpercolation relies on coupling with a percolation-type model that may be of interest in its own right.},

  abstract     = {The majority vote process was one of the first interacting particle systems to be investigated. It can be described briefly as follows. There are two possible opinions at each site of a graph G. At rate 1−ε, the opinion at a site aligns with the majority opinion at its neighboring sites and, at rate ε, the opinion at a site is randomized due to noise, where ε∈[0,1] is a parameter. Despite the simple dynamics of the majority vote process, its equilibrium behavior is difficult to analyze when the noise rate is small but positive. In particular, when the underlying graph is G=Zn with n≥2, it is not known whether the process possesses more than one equilibrium. This is surprising, especially in light of the close analogy between this model and the stochastic Ising model, where much more is known. Here, we study the majority vote process on the infinite tree Td with vertex degree d. For d≥5 and small noise, we show that there are uncountably many mutually singular equilibria, with convergence to such an equilibrium occurring exponentially quickly from nearby initial states. Our methods are quite flexible and extend to a broader class of models, consensus processes. This class includes the stochastic Ising model and other processes in which the dynamics at a site depend on the number of neighbors holding a given opinion. All of our proofs are carried out in this broader context.},

It is well known that for ordinary differential equations with proper conditions on the regularity of the coefficients, the Crank–Nicolson scheme achieves a convergence rate of n−2, regardless of the dimension. In this paper we show that, due to the interactions between the driving processes, the corresponding Crank–Nicolson scheme for m-dimensional SDEs has a slower rate than for one-dimensional SDEs. Precisely, we shall prove that when the fBm is one-dimensional and when the drift term is zero, the Crank–Nicolson scheme achieves the convergence rate n−2H, and when the drift term is nonzero, the exact rate turns out to be n−12−H. In the general multidimensional case the exact rate equals n12−2H. In all these cases the asymptotic error is proved to satisfy some linear SDE. We also consider the degenerated cases when the asymptotic error equals zero.},

The estimators are robust to lower order perturbations of the underlying differential operator and achieve the parametric rate even in the nonparametric setup with a spatially varying coefficient. A numerical example illustrates the main results.},
