The proof follows the Armstrong–Smart program for stochastic homogenization of uniformly elliptic equations. Using simple random walk estimates, we prove an analogous result for the divisible sandpile and identify its scaling limit as exactly that of the averaged divisible sandpile. As a corollary, this gives a new quantitative proof of known results on the stabilizability of Abelian sandpiles.},

Additionally, we study the random walk on the three-dimensional uniform spanning tree, deriving its walk dimension (with respect to both the intrinsic and Euclidean metric) and its spectral dimension, demonstrating the tightness of its annealed law under rescaling, and deducing heat kernel estimates for any diffusion that arises as a scaling limit.},

  abstract     = {Mean-field spin glasses are families of random energy functions (Hamiltonians) on high-dimensional product spaces. In this paper, we consider the case of Ising mixed p-spin models,; namely, Hamiltonians HN:ΣN→R on the Hamming hypercube ΣN={±1}N, which are defined by the property that {HN(σ)}σ∈ΣN is a centered Gaussian process with covariance E{HN(σ1)HN(σ2)} depending only on the scalar product ⟨σ1,σ2⟩. The asymptotic value of the optimum maxσ∈ΣNHN(σ) was characterized in terms of a variational principle known as the Parisi formula, first proved by Talagrand and, in a more general setting, by Panchenko. The structure of superlevel sets is extremely rich and has been studied by a number of authors. Here, we ask whether a near optimal configuration σ can be computed in polynomial time. We develop a message passing algorithm whose complexity per-iteration is of the same order as the complexity of evaluating the gradient of HN, and characterize the typical energy value it achieves. When the p-spin model HN satisfies a certain no-overlap gap assumption, for any ε&gt;0, the algorithm outputs σ∈ΣN such that HN(σ)≥(1−ε)maxσ′HN(σ′), with high probability. The number of iterations is bounded in N and depends uniquely on ε. More generally, regardless of whether the no-overlap gap assumption holds, the energy achieved is given by an extended variational principle, which generalizes the Parisi formula.},

Sampling convergence generalizes left convergence to sparse graphs, and describes the limit in terms of a graphex. We introduce a notion of sampling convergence for sequences of multigraphs, and establish the graphex limit for the configuration model, a preferential attachment model, the generalized random graph and a bipartite variant of the configuration model. The results for the configuration model, preferential attachment model and bipartite configuration model provide necessary and sufficient conditions for these random graph models to converge. The limit for the configuration model and the preferential attachment model is an augmented version of an exchangeable random graph model introduced by Caron and Fox (J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B. Stat.

Recall that a Liouville quantum gravity sphere is a priori naturally parameterized by the Euclidean sphere S2. Previous work in this series used quantum Loewner evolution (QLE) to construct a metric dQ on a countable dense subset of S2. Here, we show that dQ a.s. extends uniquely and continuously to a metric d‾Q on all of S2. Letting d denote the Euclidean metric on S2, we show that the identity map between (S2,d) and (S2,d‾Q) is a.s. Hölder continuous in both directions. We establish several other properties of (S2,d‾Q), culminating in the fact that (as a random metric measure space) it agrees in law with the Brownian map. We establish analogous results for the Brownian disk and plane. Our proofs involve new estimates on the size and shape of QLE balls and related quantum surfaces, as well as a careful analysis of (S2,d‾Q) geodesics.},

  abstract     = {For a unimodular random graph (G,ρ), we consider deformations of its intrinsic path metric by a (random) weighting of its vertices. This leads to the notion of the conformal growth exponent of (G,ρ), which is the best asymptotic degree of volume growth of balls that can be achieved by such a reweighting. Under moment conditions on the degree of the root, we show that the conformal growth exponent of a unimodular random graph bounds its almost sure spectral dimension. This has interesting consequences for many low-dimensional models. The consequences in dimension two are particularly strong. It establishes that models like the uniform infinite planar triangulation (UIPT) and quadrangulation (UIPQ) almost surely have spectral dimension at most two. It also establishes a conjecture of Benjamini and Schramm (Electron. J. Probab. 6 (2001) no. 23) by extending their recurrence theorem from planar graphs to arbitrary families of H-minor-free graphs. More generally, it strengthens the work of Gurel-Gurevich and Nachmias (Ann. of Math. (2) 177 (2013) 761–781) who established recurrence for distributional limits of planar graphs when the degree of the root has exponential tails. We further present a general method for proving subdiffusivity of the random walk on a large class of models, including UIPT and UIPQ, using only the volume growth profile of balls in the intrinsic metric.},

This geometric point of view allows us in particular to highlight a new relation between the Aldous–Pitman fragmentation of the Brownian continuum random tree and minimal factorizations of the n-cycle, that is, factorizations of the permutation (12⋯n) into a product of (n−1) transpositions, proving this way a conjecture of Féray and Kortchemski.

We consider the case where the unperturbed reaction–diffusion equation features multiple asymptotically stable equilibria. When the system is exposed to small stochastic perturbations, it is likely to stay near one equilibrium for a long period of time but will eventually transition to the neighborhood of another equilibrium. We are interested in studying the exit time from the full domain of attraction (in a function space) surrounding an equilibrium and, therefore, do not assume that the domain of attraction features uniform attraction to the equilibrium. This means that the boundary of the domain of attraction is allowed to contain saddles and limit cycles. Our method of proof is purely infinite dimensional, that is, we do not go through finite dimensional approximations. In addition, we address the multiplicative noise case, and we do not impose gradient type of assumptions on the nonlinearity. We prove large deviations logarithmic asymptotics for the exit time and for the exit shape, also characterizing the most probable set of shapes of solutions at the time of exit from the domain of attraction.},

Devroye (J. Assoc. Comput. Mach. 33 (1986) 489–498) proved that the height of such trees is asymptotically of order c∗logn, where c∗=4.311… is the unique solution of clog((2e)/c)=1 with c≥2. In this paper, we study the structure of binary search trees Tn,q built from Mallows permutations. A Mallows(q) permutation is a random permutation of [n]={1,…,n} whose probability is proportional to qInv(σ), where Inv(σ)=|{iσ(j)}|. This model generalizes random binary search trees, since Mallows(q) permutations with q=1 are uniformly distributed. The laws of Tn,q and Tn,q−1 are related by a simple symmetry (switching the roles of the left and right children), so it suffices to restrict our attention to q≤1. We show that, for q∈[0,1], the height of Tn,q is asymptotically (1+o(1))(c∗logn+n(1−q)) in probability. This yields three regimes of behaviour for the height of Tn,q, depending on whether n(1−q)/logn tends to zero, tends to infinity or remains bounded away from zero and infinity. In particular, when n(1−q)/logn tends to zero, the height of Tn,q is asymptotically of order c∗logn, like it is for random binary search trees. Finally, when n(1−q)/logn tends to infinity, we prove stronger tail bounds and distributional limit theorems for the height of Tn,q.},

In a recent paper (Probab. Theory Related Fields 178 (2020) 289–326), Marêché and two of the present authors proved that if U has an infinite number of “stable directions,” then on a doubly logarithmic scale the above divergence is twice the one in the corresponding U-bootstrap percolation. Here, we prove instead that, contrary to previous conjectures (Comm. Math. Phys. 369 (2019) 761–809), in the complementary case the two divergences are the same. In particular, we establish the full universality partition for critical U. The main novel contribution is the identification of the leading mechanism governing the motion of infected critical droplets. It consists of a peculiar hierarchical combination of mesoscopic East-like motions.},

If λ=0, the interface separating the plus and minus phases is diffusive, having O( N) height fluctuations, and the model is fully wetted. Under an order one field, the interface fluctuations are O(1), and the interface is only partially wetted, being pinned to its southern boundary. We study the critical prewetting regime of λN↓0, where the height fluctuations are expected to scale as λ−1/3 and the rescaled interface is predicted to converge to the Ferrari–Spohn diffusion. Velenik (Probab. Theory Related Fields 129 (2004) 83–112) identified the order of the area under the interface up to logarithmic corrections. Since then, more refined features of such interfaces have only been identified in simpler models of random walks under area tilts. In this paper we resolve several conjectures of Velenik regarding the refined features of the Ising interface in the critical prewetting regime. Our main result is a sharp bound on the one-point height fluctuation, proving e−Θ(x3/2) upper tails reminiscent of the Tracy–Widom distribution, capturing a tradeoff between the locally Brownian oscillations and the global field effect. We further prove a concentration estimate for the number of points above which the interface attains a large height. These are used to deduce various geometric properties of the interface, including the order and tails of the area it confines and the polylogarithmic prefactor governing its maximum height fluctuation. Our arguments combine classical inputs from the random-line representation of the Ising interface with novel local resampling and coupling schemes.},

All edges in a connected component are deleted when any of its vertices is struck by lightning. We consider the asymptotic regime of lightning rates for which the model displays self-organized criticality. The age of a vertex increases at unit rate, but it is reset to zero at each burning time. We show that the empirical age distribution converges as a process to a deterministic solution of an autonomous measure-valued differential equation. The main technique is to observe that, conditioned on the vertex ages, the graph is an inhomogeneous random graph in the sense of Bollobás, Janson and Riordan. We then study the evolution of the ages via the multitype Galton–Watson trees that arise as the limit in law of the component of an identified vertex at any fixed time. These trees are critical from the gelation time onwards.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider domino tilings of the Aztec diamond with doubly periodic weightings. In particular, a family of models which, for any k∈N, includes models with k smooth regions is analyzed as the size of the Aztec diamond tends to infinity. We use a nonintersecting paths formulation and give a double integral formula for the correlation kernel of the Aztec diamond of finite size. By a classical steepest descent analysis of the correlation kernel, we obtain the local behavior in the smooth and rough regions, as the size of the Aztec diamond tends to infinity. From the mentioned limit the macroscopic picture, such as the arctic curves and, in particular, the number of smooth regions, is deduced. Moreover, we compute the limit of the height function, and, as a consequence, we confirm in the setting of this paper that the limit in the rough region fulfills the complex Burgers’ equation, as stated by Kenyon and Okounkov.},

We show that the limit distribution of the squared singular values of every word of length m is a Fuss–Catalan distribution with parameter m+1. This generalizes previous results concerning powers of a complex Ginibre matrix and products of independent Ginibre matrices. In addition, we find other combinatorial parameters of the word that determine the second-order limits of the spectral statistics. For instance, the so-called coperiod of a word characterizes the fluctuations of the eigenvalues. We extend these results to words of general non-Hermitian matrices with i.i.d. entries under moment-matching assumptions, band matrices, and sparse matrices. These results rely on the moments method and genus expansion, relating Gaussian matrix integrals to the counting of compact orientable surfaces of a given genus. This allows us to derive a central limit theorem for the trace of any word of complex Ginibre matrices and their conjugate transposes, where all parameters are defined topologically.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the joint upper and lower tail large deviations of the edge eigenvalues of an Erdős–Rényi random graph Gn,p, in the regime of p where the edge of the spectrum is no longer governed by global observables, such as the number of edges, but rather by localized statistics, such as high degree vertices. Going beyond the recent developments in mean-field approximations of related problems, this paper provides a comprehensive treatment of the large deviations of the spectral edge in this entire regime, which notably includes the well-studied case of constant average degree. In particular, for r≥1 fixed, we pin down the asymptotic probability that the top r eigenvalues are jointly greater/less than their typical values by multiplicative factors bigger/smaller than 1, in the regime mentioned above. The proof for the upper tail relies on a novel structure theorem, obtained by building on estimates in (Combin. Probab. Comput. 12 (2003) 61–72), followed by an iterative cycle removal process, which shows, conditional on the upper tail large deviation event, with high probability the graph admits a decomposition in to a disjoint union of stars and a spectrally negligible part. On the other hand, the key ingredient in the proof of the lower tail is a Ramsey-type result which shows that if the Kth largest degree of a graph is not atypically small (for some large K depending on r), then either the top eigenvalue or the rth largest eigenvalue is larger than that allowed by the lower tail event on the top r eigenvalues, thus forcing a contradiction. The above arguments reduce the problems to developing a large deviation theory for the extremal degrees which could be of independent interest.},

We show that the limiting law of any such entry is non-Gaussian, given by the product of a normal distribution with another random variable that depends on the location of the corresponding eigenvalue. Although the latter random variable is typically nonexplicit, for the median eigenvector it is given by the inverse of a one-sided stable law. Moreover, we show that different entries of the same eigenvector are asymptotically independent, but that there are nontrivial correlations between eigenvectors with nearby eigenvalues. Our findings contrast sharply with the known eigenvector behavior for Wigner matrices and sparse random graphs.},

  abstract     = {We prove that the Tutte embeddings (a.k.a. harmonic/barycentric embeddings) of certain random planar maps converge to γ-Liouville quantum gravity (γ-LQG). Specifically, we treat mated-CRT maps, which are discretized matings of correlated continuum random trees, and γ ranges from 0 to 2 as one varies the correlation parameter. We also show that the associated space-filling path on the embedded map converges to space-filling SLEκ for κ=16/γ2 (in the annealed sense) and that simple random walk on the embedded map converges to Brownian motion (in the quenched sense). This work constitutes the first proof that a discrete conformal embedding of a random planar map converges to LQG. Many more such statements have been conjectured. Since the mated-CRT map can be viewed as a coarse-grained approximation to other random planar maps (the UIPT, tree-weighted maps, bipolar-oriented maps, etc.), our results indicate a potential approach for proving that embeddings of these maps converge to LQG as well. To prove the main result, we establish several (independently interesting) theorems about LQG surfaces decorated by space-filling SLE. There is a natural way to use the SLE curve to divide the plane into “cells” corresponding to vertices of the mated-CRT map. We study the law of the shape of the origin-containing cell, in particular proving moments for the ratio of its squared diameter to its area. We also give bounds on the degree of the origin-containing cell and establish a form of ergodicity for the entire configuration. Ultimately, we use these properties to show (with the help of a general theorem proved in a separate paper) that random walk on these cells converges to a time change of Brownian motion, which in turn leads to the Tutte embedding result.},

In the second model, the centers of the cells move according to (independent) long range stable Lévy processes but the colors do not evolve in time.

There has been a great deal of progress over the years on the large-scale behaviour of XH, but the more challenging problem of understanding the small-ball probabilities has remained poorly understood until now. More precisely, how likely can it be that XH falls in some small interval or is equal to some particular value? In this paper, we prove the almost-optimal result that if H is connected then for any x∈N we have Pr(XH=x)≤n1−v(H)+o(1). Our proof proceeds by iteratively breaking XH into different components which fluctuate at “different scales”, and relies on a new anti-concentration inequality for random vectors that behave “almost linearly.”},

We apply this abstract result to three model problems: First, we study random walks with random conductances under the annealed law.

We establish a one-to-one correspondence between vertices of degree at least 2d and nontrivial (excluding the trivial top eigenvalue) eigenvalues of A/ d outside of the asymptotic bulk [−2,2]. This correspondence implies that the transition characterized by the appearance of the eigenvalues outside of the asymptotic bulk takes place at the critical value d=d∗=1log4−1logN. For dd∗, we show that no such eigenvalues exist. All of our estimates are quantitative with polynomial error probabilities. Our proof is based on a tridiagonal representation of the adjacency matrix and on a detailed analysis of the geometry of the neighbourhood of the large degree vertices. An important ingredient in our estimates is a matrix inequality obtained via the associated nonbacktracking matrix and an Ihara–Bass formula (Ann. Inst. Henri Poincaré Probab. Stat. 56 (2020) 2141–2161). Our argument also applies to sparse Wigner matrices, defined as the Hadamard product of A and a Wigner matrix, in which case the role of the degrees is replaced by the squares of the ℓ2-norms of the rows.},

This extends earlier results (Adv. Math. 218 (2008) 600–633; Israel J. Math. 227 (2018) 507–544) by removing the assumption of mean zero and identical distribution of the entries across the matrix as well as the recent result (Livshyts (2018)) where the matrix was required to have i.i.d. rows. Our model covers inhomogeneous matrices allowing different variances of the entries as long as the sum of the second moments is of order O(n2). In the past advances, the assumption of i.i.d. rows was required due to lack of Littlewood–Offord-type inequalities for weighted sums of non-i.i.d. random variables. Here, we overcome this problem by introducing the Randomized Least Common Denominator (RLCD) which allows to study anti-concentration properties of weighted sums of independent but not identically distributed variables. We construct efficient nets on the sphere with lattice structure and show that the lattice points typically have large RLCD. This allows us to derive strong anticoncentration properties for the distance between a fixed column of A and the linear span of the remaining columns and prove the main result.},

This more precise asymptotics is a key tool for proving distributional limit theorems which quantify the rate of convergence of the derivative martingale to its limit Z. The methodological novelty of the present paper is a three terms representation of a subharmonic function of, at most, linear growth for a killed centered random walk of finite variance. This yields the aforementioned asymptotics and should also be applicable to other models.},

  abstract     = {We study simple random walk on the class of random planar maps which can be encoded by a two-dimensional random walk with i.i.d.. increments or a two-dimensional Brownian motion via a “mating-of-trees” type bijection. This class includes the uniform infinite planar triangulation (UIPT), the infinite-volume limits of random planar maps weighted by the number of spanning trees, bipolar orientations, or Schnyder woods they admit, and the γ-mated-CRT map for γ∈(0,2). For each of these maps, we obtain an upper bound for the Green’s function on the diagonal, an upper bound for the effective resistance to the boundary of a metric ball, an upper bound for the return probability of the random walk to its starting point after n steps, and a lower bound for the graph-distance displacement of the random walk, all of which are sharp up to polylogarithmic factors. When combined with work of Lee (2017), our bound for the return probability shows that the spectral dimension of each of these random planar maps is a.s. equal to 2, that is, the (quenched) probability that the simple random walk returns to its starting point after 2n steps is n−1+on(1). Our results also show that the amount of time that it takes a random walk to exit a metric ball is at least its volume (up to a polylogarithmic factor). In the special case of the UIPT, this implies that random walk typically travels at least n1/4−on(1) units of graph distance in n units of time. The matching upper bound for the displacement is proven by Gwynne and Hutchcroft (Probab. Theory Related Fields 178 (2020) 567–611). These two works together resolve a conjecture of Benjamini and Curien (Geom. Funct. Anal. 23 (2013) 501–531) in the UIPT case. Our proofs are based on estimates for the mated-CRT map (which come from its relationship to SLE-decorated Liouville quantum gravity) and a strong coupling of the mated-CRT map with the other random planar map models.},

The purpose of this article is to describe a number of structural properties of this generalised model. First, it is shown that the samples of the model are in one-to-one correspondence with the perfect matchings of a hypergraph. This leads to a generalised Kasteleyn theory: the partition function of the model equals the Cayley hyperdeterminant of the adjacency hypermatrix of the hypergraph. Second, we prove an identity which relates the covariance matrix of the random height function directly to the random geometrical structure of the model. This identity is known in the planar case but is new for higher dimensions. It relies on a more explicit formulation of Sheffield’s cluster swap which is made possible by the structure of the honeycomb dimer model. Finally, we use the special properties of this explicit cluster swap to give a new and simplified proof of strict convexity of the surface tension in this case.},

We study the correlation of fluctuations at two different times. We show that, when the times are close to each other, the correlation approaches one at a power-law rate with exponent 2/3, while, when the two times are remote from each other, the correlation tends to zero at a power-law rate with exponent −1/3. We also prove exponential-type tail bounds for differences of the solution at two space-time points. Three main tools are pivotal to proving these results: (1) a representation for the two-time distribution in terms of two independent narrow wedge solutions, (2) the Brownian Gibbs property of the KPZ line ensemble and (3) recently proved one-point tail bounds on the narrow wedge solution.},

The construction has two steps. The first is a general construction of interval partition processes obtained previously by decorating the jumps of a Lévy process with independent excursions. Here, we focus on the second step which requires explicit transition kernels and, what we call, pseudo-stationarity. This allows us to study processes obtained from the original construction via scaling and time-change. In a sequel paper we establish connections to diffusions on decreasing sequences introduced by Ethier and Kurtz (Adv. in Appl. Probab. 13 (1981) 429–452) and Petrov (Funktsional. Anal. i Prilozhen. 43 (2009) 45–66). The latter diffusions are continuum limits of up-down Markov chains on Chinese restaurant processes. Our construction is also a step toward resolving longstanding conjectures by Feng and Sun on measure-valued Poisson–Dirichlet diffusions and by Aldous on a continuum-tree-valued diffusion.},

At low temperatures, Dobrushin (1972) showed that the interface separating the predominantly plus and predominantly minus regions is localized: its height above a fixed point has exponential tails. Recently, the authors proved a law of large numbers for the maximum height Mn of this interface: for every β large, Mn/logn→cβ in probability as n→∞. Here, we show that the laws of the centered maxima (Mn−E[Mn])n≥1 are uniformly tight. Moreover, even though this sequence does not converge, we prove that it has uniform upper and lower Gumbel tails (exponential right tails and doubly exponential left tails). Key to the proof is a sharp (up to O(1) precision) understanding of the surface large deviations. This includes, in particular, the shape of a pillar that reaches near-maximum height, even at its base, where the interactions with neighboring pillars are dominant.},

  abstract     = {This paper concerns the McKean–Vlasov stochastic differential equation (SDE) with common noise. An appropriate definition of a weak solution to such an equation is developed. The importance of the notion of compatibility in this definition is highlighted by a demonstration of its role in connecting weak solutions to McKean–Vlasov SDEs with common noise and solutions to corresponding stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). By keeping track of the dependence structure between all components in a sequence of approximating processes, a compactness argument is employed to prove the existence of a weak solution assuming boundedness and joint continuity of the coefficients (allowing for degenerate diffusions). Weak uniqueness is established when the private (idiosyncratic) noise’s diffusion coefficient is nondegenerate and the drift is regular in the total variation distance. This seems sharp when one considers using finite-dimensional noise to regularise an infinite dimensional problem. The proof relies on a suitably tailored cost function in the Monge–Kantorovich problem and representation of weak solutions via Girsanov transformations.},

These maximizing paths and their energies may be viewed via a coordinate system that respects these scalings. What emerges by doing so is a system indexed by $x,y\in \mathbb{R}$ and $s,t\in \mathbb{R}$ with $s&lt;t$ of unit order quantities $W_{n}(x,s;y,t)$ specifying the scaled energy of the maximizing path that moves in scaled coordinates between $(x,s)$ and $(y,t)$. The space-time Airy sheet is, after a parabolic adjustment, the putative distributional limit $W_{\infty }$ of this system as $n\to \infty $. The Airy sheet has recently been constructed in (Dauvergne, Ortmann and Virág (2020)) as such a limit of Brownian last passage percolation. In this article, we initiate the study of fractal geometry in the Airy sheet. We prove that the scaled energy difference profile given by $\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}:z\to W_{\infty }(1,0;z,1)-W_{\infty}(-1,0;z,1)$ is a nondecreasing process that is constant in a random neighbourhood of almost every $z\in \mathbb{R}$; and that the exceptional set of $z\in \mathbb{R}$ that violate this condition almost surely has Hausdorff dimension one-half. Points of violation correspond to special behaviour for scaled maximizing paths, and we prove the result by investigating this behaviour, making use of two inputs from recent studies of scaled Brownian LPP; namely, Brownian regularity of profiles, and estimates on the rarity of pairs of disjoint scaled maximizing paths that begin and end close to each other.},

When $n$ goes to infinity, Addario-Berry, Broutin and Goldschmidt (Probab. Theory Related Fields 152 (2012) 367–406) have shown that the collection of connected components, viewed as suitably normalized measured compact metric spaces, converges in distribution to a continuous limit $\mathcal{G}_{\lambda }$ made of random real graphs. In this paper, we consider notably the dynamical percolation on critical Erdos–Rényi random graphs. To each pair of vertices is attached a Poisson process of intensity $n^{-1/3}$, and every time it rings, one resamples the corresponding edge. Under this process, the collection of connected components undergoes coalescence and fragmentation. We prove that this process converges in distribution, as $n$ goes to infinity, toward a fragmentation-coalescence process on the continuous limit $\mathcal{G}_{\lambda }$. We also prove convergence of discrete coalescence and fragmentation processes and provide general Feller-type properties associated to fragmentation and coalescence.},

We prove that the survival threshold $\lambda_{1}$ for a Galton–Watson tree is strictly positive if and only if its offspring distribution $\xi$ has an exponential tail, that is, $\mathbb{E}e^{c\xi}0$, settling a conjecture by Huang and Durrett (2018). On the random graph with degree distribution $\mu$, we show that if $\mu$ has an exponential tail, then for small enough $\lambda$ the contact process with the all-infected initial condition survives for $n^{1+o(1)}$-time $\mathsf{whp}$ (short survival), while for large enough $\lambda$ it runs over $e^{\Theta(n)}$-time $\mathsf{whp}$ (long survival). When $\mu$ is subexponential, we prove that the contact process $\mathsf{whp}$ displays long survival for any fixed $\lambda&gt;0$.},

  abstract     = {Place an obstacle with probability $1-p$ independently at each vertex of $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, and consider a simple symmetric random walk that is killed upon hitting one of the obstacles. For $d\geq 2$ and $p$ strictly above the critical threshold for site percolation, we condition on the environment such that the origin is contained in an infinite connected component free of obstacles. It has previously been shown that, with high probability, the random walk conditioned on survival up to time $n$ will be localized in a ball of volume, asymptotically, $d\log _{1/p}n$. In this work we prove that this ball is free of obstacles, and we derive the limiting one-time distributions of the random walk conditioned on survival. Our proof is based on obstacle modifications and estimates on how such modifications affect the probability of the obstacle configurations as well as their associated Dirichlet eigenvalues which is of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {We consider the algorithmic problem of finding a near ground state (near optimal solution) of a $p$-spin model. We show that for a class of algorithms broadly defined as Approximate Message Passing (AMP), the presence of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP), appropriately defined, is a barrier. We conjecture that, when $p\ge 4$, the model does indeed exhibit OGP (and prove it for the space of binary solutions). Assuming the validity of this conjecture, as an implication the AMP fails to find near ground states in these models, per our result. We extend our result to the problem of finding pure states by means of Thouless, Anderson and Palmer (TAP) based iterations which is yet another example of AMP type algorithms. We show that such iterations fail to find pure states approximately, subject to the conjecture that the space of pure states exhibits the OGP, appropriately stated, when $p\ge 4$.},

  abstract     = {We prove that independent families of permutation invariant random matrices are asymptotically free with amalgamation over the diagonal, both in expectation and in probability, under a uniform boundedness assumption on the operator norm. We can relax the operator norm assumption to an estimate on sums associated to graphs of matrices, further extending the range of applications (e.g., to Wigner matrices with exploding moments and the sparse regime of the Erdős–Rényi model). The result still holds even if the matrices are multiplied entrywise by random variables satisfying a certain growth condition (e.g., as in the case of matrices with a variance profile and percolation models). Our analysis relies on a modified method of moments based on graph observables.},

  abstract     = {In this work we focus on the two-dimensional anisotropic KPZ (aKPZ) equation, which is formally given by \begin{equation*}\partial _{t}h=\frac{\nu }{2}\Delta h+\lambda \bigl((\partial _{1}h)^{2}-(\partial _{2}h)^{2}\bigr)+\nu ^{\frac{1}{2}}\xi ,\end{equation*} where $\xi $ denotes a noise which is white in both space and time, and $\lambda $ and $\nu $ are positive constants. Due to the wild oscillations of the noise and the quadratic nonlinearity, the previous equation is classically ill posed. It is not possible to linearise it via the Cole–Hopf transformation and the pathwise techniques for singular SPDEs (the theory of regularity structures by M. Hairer or the paracontrolled distributions approach of M. Gubinelli, P. Imkeller, N. Perkowski) are not applicable. In the present work we consider a regularised version of aKPZ which preserves its invariant measure. We prove the existence of subsequential limits once the regularisation is removed, provided $\lambda $ and $\nu $ are suitably renormalised. Moreover, we show that, in the regime in which $\nu $ is constant and the coupling constant $\lambda $ converges to $0$ as the inverse of the square root logarithm, any limit differs from the solution to the linear equation obtained by simply dropping the nonlinearity in aKPZ.},

  abstract     = {We study Coulomb gases in any dimension $\mathsf{d}\geq2$ and in a broad temperature regime. We prove local laws on the energy, separation and number of points down to the microscopic scale. These yield the existence of limiting point processes after extraction, generalizing the Ginibre point process for arbitrary temperature and dimension. The local laws come together with a quantitative expansion of the free energy with a new explicit error rate in the case of a uniform background density. These estimates have explicit temperature dependence, allowing to treat regimes of very large or very small temperature, and exhibit a new minimal lengthscale for rigidity and screening, depending on the temperature. They apply as well to energy minimizers (formally zero temperature). The method is based on a bootstrap on scales and reveals the additivity of the energy modulo surface terms, via the introduction of subadditive and superadditive approximate energies.},

  abstract     = {We consider the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model of spin glasses with ferromagnetically biased couplings. For a specific choice of the couplings mean, the resulting Gibbs measure is equivalent to the Bayesian posterior for a high-dimensional estimation problem known as “${\mathbb{Z}}_{2}$ synchronization.” Statistical physics suggests to compute the expectation with respect to this Gibbs measure (the posterior mean in the synchronization problem), by minimizing the so-called Thouless–Anderson–Palmer (TAP) free energy, instead of the mean field (MF) free energy. We prove that this identification is correct, provided the ferromagnetic bias is larger than a constant (i.e., the noise level is small enough in synchronization). Namely, we prove that the scaled $\ell _{2}$ distance between any low energy local minimizers of the TAP free energy and the mean of the Gibbs measure vanishes in the large size limit. Our proof technique is based on upper bounding the expected number of critical points of the TAP free energy using the Kac–Rice formula.},
