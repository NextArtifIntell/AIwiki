  abstract     = {This monograph addresses operating characteristics for binary hypothesis testing in both classical and quantum settings and overcomplete quantum measurements for quantum binary state discrimination. We specifically explore decision and measurement operating characteristics defined as the tradeoff between probability of detection and probability of false alarm as parameters of the pre-decision operator and the binary decision rule are varied. In the classical case we consider in detail the Neyman-Pearson optimality of the operating characteristics when they are generated using threshold tests on a scalar score variable rather than threshold tests on the likelihood ratio. In the quantum setting, informationally overcomplete POVMs are explored to provide robust quantum binary state discrimination. We focus on equal trace rank one POVMs which can be specified by arrangements of points on a sphere that we refer to as an Etro sphere.},

  abstract     = {Imagine a coverage area where each mobile device is communicating with a preferred set of wireless access points (among many) that are selected based on its needs and cooperate to jointly serve it, instead of creating autonomous cells. This effectively leads to a user-centric post-cellular network architecture, which can resolve many of the interference issues and service-quality variations that appear in cellular networks. This concept is called User-centric Cellfree Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) and has its roots in the intersection between three technology components: Massive MIMO, coordinated multipoint processing, and ultra-dense networks. The main challenge is to achieve the benefits of cell-free operation in a practically feasible way, with computational complexity and fronthaul requirements that are scalable to enable massively large networks with many mobile devices. This monograph covers the foundations of User-centric Cell-free Massive MIMO, starting from the motivation and mathematical definition. It continues by describing the state-of-the-art signal processing algorithms for channel estimation, uplink data reception, and downlink data transmission with either centralized or distributed implementation. The achievable spectral efficiency is mathematically derived and evaluated numerically using a running example that exposes the impact of various system parameters and algorithmic choices. The fundamental tradeoffs between communication performance, computational complexity, and fronthaul signaling requirements are thoroughly analyzed. Finally, the basic algorithms for pilot assignment, dynamic cooperation cluster formation, and power optimization are provided, while open problems related to these and other resource allocation problems are reviewed. All the numerical examples can be reproduced using the accompanying Matlab code.},
