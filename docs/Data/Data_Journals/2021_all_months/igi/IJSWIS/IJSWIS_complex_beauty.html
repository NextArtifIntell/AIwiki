  abstract     = {Abstract This paper proposes a novel algorithm based on reinforcement learning-entitled asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C). Overflow queries are optimized to crawl the ranked deep web. A3C assigns the reward and penalty to the various queries. Queries are derived from the domain-based taxonomy that helps to fill the search forms. Overflow queries are the collection of queries that match with more than k number of results and only top k matched results are retrieved. Low ranked documents beyond k results are not accessible and lead to low coverage. Overflow queries are optimized to convert into non-overflow queries based on the proposed technique and lead to more coverage. As of yet, no research work has been explored by using A3C with taxonomy in the domain of ranked deep web. The experimental results show that the proposed technique outperforms the three other techniques (i.e., document frequency, random query, and high frequency) in terms of average improvement metric by 26%, 69%, and 92%, respectively.

However, the cloud server is unreliable, and the secure data of users may be disclosed. Therefore, a secure data sharing mechanism is developed in this research using the proposed session password, data access key, and circular interpolation (SKC)-based data-sharing approach for the secure sharing of PHR in the cloud. The proposed SKC-based data sharing approach provides high efficiency and high-security guarantee. It effectively satisfies various security properties, such as tamper resistance, openness, and decentralization. The proposed SKC-based data sharing approach is the reliable mechanism created for the doctors to share the PHR and to access the patient historical data while meeting the privacy preservation.

It is possible to control the temperature, the brightness, the sound system, and even the security of the house via a smartphone, at the request of the inhabitant or by scheduling it. This growing number of “things” must deal with material constraints such as home network infrastructure, but also applicative due to the number of proposed services. The heterogeneity of users&#39; preferences often creates conflicts between them like turn on and off light or using a heater and an air conditioner in the same time. To manage these conflicts, the authors proposed a solution based on linked open data (LOD). The LOD allows defining the relation between the different services and things in the house and a better exploitation of the attributes of the inhabitant&#39;s profile and services. It consists to find inconsistency relation between the equipment using the antonym thesaurus. Request access from your librarian to read this article&#39;s full text.},

This research work focuses on finding learners&#39; frustration levels during learning. Motivating the learners appropriately can enhance their learning experiences. Therefore, the authors also bring in a strategy to respond to learners&#39; affective states in order to motivate them. This work uses Behavioral theory for goal generation, and frustration index is calculated. Based on the frustration level of the learner, motivational messages are displayed to the learners using Regulatory fit theory. The authors evaluated the model using t-test by collecting learners&#39; data from MoodleCloud. The results of the evaluation demonstrate that 80% of the learners&#39; performance significantly increases statistically as an impact of motivational messages provided in response to the learners&#39; frustration.

First, latent semantic analysis is applied to extract the main research themes from the subject matter literature, which are considered as potential curriculum components. Next, the revised Bloom&#39;s taxonomy is applied to develop a questionnaire for establishing the learning objectives. Finally, the study uses the modified Delphi method to verify the eligibility of these curriculum components, concluding that the most effective approach for imparting knowledge and skills regarding new product development is to adopt a capstone course and equip students with creativity and advanced technology and design for sustainability through a project-based learning approach.

However, graph-based approaches are computationally expensive for open-domain datasets. In this paper, the authors overcome these problems by presenting an RDF embedding-based seq2seq entity linking method in specific domains. They filter candidate entities of mentions having similar meanings by using the domain information of the annotated pairs. They resolve high ambiguous pairs by using Bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and attention mechanism for the entity disambiguation. To evaluate the system with baseline methods, they generate a dataset including book, music, and movie categories. They achieved 0.55 (Mi-F1), 0.586 (Ma-F1), 0.846 (Mi-F1), and 0.87 (Ma-F1) scores for high and low ambiguous datasets. They compare the method by using recent (WNED-CWEB) datasets with existing methods. Considering the domain-specificity of the proposed method, it tends to achieve competitive results while using the domain-oriented datasets.

This paper proposes an approach to represent and reason about quantitative time intervals and points and qualitative relations between them. It is suitable to handle certain and uncertain temporal data. It includes three parts. (1) The authors extend the 4D-fluents approach with certain components to represent certain and uncertain temporal data. (2) They extend the Allen&#39;s interval algebra to reason about certain and uncertain time intervals. They adapt these relations to relate a time interval and a time point, and two time points. All relations can be used for temporal reasoning by means of transitivity tables. (3) They propose a certain ontology based on the extensions. A prototype is implemented and integrated into an ontology-based memory prosthesis for Alzheimer&#39;s patients to handle uncertain data inputs. The evaluation proves the usefulness of the approach as all the inferences are well established and the precision results are promising.

Topic modeling provides a way to categorize these documents, where high dimensionality of the corpus affects the result of topic model, making it important to apply feature selection or information retrieval process for dimensionality reduction. The requirement for efficient topic modeling includes the removal of unrelated words that might lead to specious coexistence of the unrelated words. This paper proposes an efficient framework for the generation of better topic coherence, where term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and parsimonious language model (PLM) are used for the information retrieval task. PLM extracts the important information and expels the general words from the corpus, whereas TF-IDF re-estimates the weightage of each word in the corpus. The work carried out in this paper improved the topic coherence measure to provide a better correlation among the actual topic and the topics generated from PLM.

The traditional recommendation approach often uses collaborative filtering along with sequential pattern mining. Existing recommender systems also use ontology. However, these approaches have several limitations, including lack of availability of ratings at higher education level and lack of personalization based on student attributes. The proposed system intends to overcome these limitations by firstly extracting student personality and profile attributes and thereby generating a set of similar users by utilizing the versatile ontology. Secondly, it predicts courses based on a well-performing sequence prediction algorithm, the compact prediction tree (CPT). The results show that the proposed approach increases the accuracy in terms of precision to a tune of 0.97 and F1 measure to a tune of 0.58 when compared with existing systems which makes the proposed method more suitable for recommending courses.

  abstract     = {Abstract In the existing farming system, information is obtained manually, and most times, farmers act based on their discretion. Sometimes, farmers rely on information from experts and extension officers for decision making. In recent times, a lot of information systems are available with relevant information on organic farming practices; however, such information is scattered in different context, form, and media all over the internet, making their retrieval difficult. The use of ontology with the aid of a conceptual scheme makes the comprehensive and detailed formalization of any subject domain possible. This study is aimed at acquiring, storing, and providing organic farming-based information available to current and intending software developer who may wish to develop applications for farmers. It employs information extraction (IE) and ontology development techniques to develop an ontology-based information extraction (OBIE) system called ontology-based information extraction system for organic farming (OBIESOF). The knowledge base was built using protégé editor; Java was used for the implementation of the ontology knowledge base with the aid of the high-level application programming language for working web ontology language application program interface (OWL API). In contrast, HermiT was used to checking the consistencies of the ontology and for submitting queries in order to verify their validity. The queries were expressed in description logic (DL) query language. The authors tested the capability of the ontology to respond to user queries by posing instances of the competency questions from DL query interface. The answers generated by the ontology were promising and serve as positive pointers to its usefulness as a knowledge repository.

  abstract     = {Abstract The rapid growth of internet facilities has increased the comments, posts, blogs, feedback, etc., on a large scale on social networking sites. These social media data are available in an unstructured form, which includes images, text, and videos. The processing of these data is difficult, but some sentiment analysis, information retrieval, and recommender systems are used to process these unstructured data. To extract the opinion and sentiment of internet users from their written social media text, a sentiment analysis system is required to develop, which can work on both monolingual and bilingual phonetic text. Therefore, a sentiment analysis (SA) system is developed, which performs well on different domain datasets. The system performance is tested on four different datasets and achieved better accuracy of 3% on social media datasets, 1.5% on movie reviews, 1.35% on Amazon product reviews, and 4.56% on large Amazon product reviews than the state-of-art techniques. Also, the stemmer (StemVerb) for verbs of the English language is proposed, which improves the SA system&#39;s performance. Request access from your librarian to read this article&#39;s full text.},

This paper proposes the recurrent-Gaston (R-Gaston) algorithm for the frequent subgraph mining process by enhancing the existing Gaston algorithm. Moreover, the method uses support measures based on the frequency and page duration parameters in order to define the support for the proposed R-Gaston algorithm. The simulation of the proposed R-Gaston is carried out using the weblog and the MSNBC databases. The proposed R-Gaston has attained values of number of structures mined and the execution time as 184, and 1282ms for the MSNBC database, with 60 and 75ms for the weblog database, respectively.

  abstract     = {Abstract One hypothesis of 5G cellular networks architecture is using three tiers: Macro BS, Wi-Fi Pico BS, and Wi-Gig Femtocell. The challenge addressed in this paper is to associate the user requirement (UE) to the best BS/tier to achieve the optimal operation for the network and maximum data rate for all UE. There are two proposed types of association in this paper; the first one is to find the best BS in the three tiers and then associate the UE to one of them based on the association algorithm, and the second proposed type is to decide the best tier for the UE and then associate the UE to one of the BS of this tier based on the association algorithm. The opportunistic user association problem is worked out as an optimization problem which is solved by the Nash bargaining solution (NBS). The proposed algorithms presented in this paper achieve optimality, 7% and 2% increase in total system data rate (SDR) for the first and second proposed algorithms respectively. They also achieved 6% and 2% increase in total Jain&#39;s fairness index (JFI) for the first and second proposed algorithms respectively.

People are showing their emotions openly in their tweets on Twitter. It&#39;s very important to perform sentiment analysis on these tweets for finding COVID-19&#39;s impact on people&#39;s lives. Natural language processing, textual processing, computational linguists, and biometrics are applied to perform sentiment analysis to identify and extract the emotions. In this work, sentiment analysis is carried out on a large Twitter dataset of English tweets. Ten emotional themes are investigated. Experimental results show that COVID-19 has spread fear/anxiety, gratitude, happiness and hope, and other mixed emotions among people for different reasons. Specifically, it is observed that positive news from top officials like Trump of chloroquine as cure to COVID-19 has suddenly lowered fear in sentiment, and happiness, gratitude, and hope started to rise. But, once FDA said, chloroquine is not effective cure, fear again started to rise. Request access from your librarian to read this article&#39;s full text.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Ontologies, as semantic knowledge representation, have a crucial role in various information systems. The main pitfall of manually building ontologies is effort and time-consuming. Ontology learning is a key solution. Learning Non-Taxonomic Relationships of Ontologies (LNTRO) is the process of automatic/semi-automatic extraction of all possible relationships between concepts in a specific domain, except the hierarchal relations. Most of the research works focused on the extraction of concepts and taxonomic relations in the ontology learning process. This article presents the results of a systematic review of the state-of-the-art approaches for LNTRO. Sixteen approaches have been described and qualitatively analyzed. The solutions they provide are discussed along with their respective positive and negative aspects. The goal is to provide researchers in this area a comprehensive understanding of the drawbacks of the existing work, thereby encouraging further improvement of the research work in this area. Furthermore, this article proposes a set of recommendations for future research. Request access from your librarian to read this article&#39;s full text.},

In particular, as feedback provided by students is essential for determining the quality and direction of classes, instructors should interact with students who are currently participating in classes by exchanging feedback. This paper proposes a block editing model that can reflect student feedback. The block editing model is an interactive e-textbook editing model that is dynamically updated based on the feedback provided by students in real time without modifying the structure of digital textbooks. In particular, in order for even non-developers who do not know web programming languages to be able to produce interactive digital textbooks easily, the authors developed an editor that could help implement them based on Blockly, a visual programming language. This paper enables instructors to improve the direction and quality of classes depending on the learning achievement of students and understanding based on feedback information provided by students and feedback analysis.

  abstract     = {Abstract The link traversal strategies to query Linked Data over WWW can retrieve up-to-date results using a recursive URI lookup process in real-time. The downside of this approach comes with the query patterns having subject unbound (i.e. ?S rdf:type:Class). Such queries fail to start up the traversal process as the RDF pages are subject-centric in nature. Thus, zero-knowledge link traversal leads to the empty query results for these queries. In this paper, the authors analyze a large corpus of real-world SPARQL query logs and identify the Most Frequent Predicates (MFPs) occurring in these queries. The knowledge of these MFPs helps in finding and indexing a limited number of triples from the original data set. Additionally, the authors propose a Hybrid Query Execution (HQE) approach to execute the queries over this index for initial data source selection followed by link traversal process to fetch complete results. The evaluation of HQE on the latest real data benchmarks reveals that it retrieves at least five times more results than the existing approaches.

  abstract     = {Abstract Compliance to regulatory requirements is a critical concern in information system development projects. Managing this aspect is increasingly challenging while failures impose costly consequence on the organizations world-wide. However, how a legislation may or may not affect information system development projects is often not easily identifiable due to lack of clear understanding and guidelines. This paper presents compliant information system development (CISMET) ontology, exploiting concepts from 21 existing ontologies (regarding regulatory compliance and information system development). The key findings are the six parent classes in the CISMET ontology describing the system development goals, services, process, activities, artifacts, and resources. Also, there are 26 sub classes and 21 class properties that describe various concepts and their relationships in regulatory compliant information system development. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union has been instantiated in the proposed framework to indicate how regulatory requirements compliance concepts are mapped to system development projects. Thus, involved stakeholders (information system researchers and system developers) may identify dependencies and actions needed with relation to various rules in the regulation and their link to the system elements through a relevant software application. The latter enables users to easily submit queries towards the backend ontology through a specialized front-end application that can aid in formulating and submitting these queries.
