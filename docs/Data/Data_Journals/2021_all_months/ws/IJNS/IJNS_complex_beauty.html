  abstract     = {Network intrusion detection is becoming a challenging task with cyberattacks that are becoming more and more sophisticated. Failing the prevention or detection of such intrusions might have serious consequences. Machine learning approaches try to recognize network connection patterns to classify unseen and known intrusions but also require periodic re-training to keep the performances at a high level. In this paper, a novel continuous learning intrusion detection system, called Soft-Forgetting Self-Organizing Incremental Neural Network (SF-SOINN), is introduced. SF-SOINN, besides providing continuous learning capabilities, is able to perform fast classification, is robust to noise, and it obtains good performances with respect to the existing approaches. The main characteristic of SF-SOINN is the ability to remove nodes from the neural network based on their utility estimate. SF-SOINN has been validated on the well-known NSL-KDD and CIC-IDS-2017 intrusion detection datasets as well as on some artificial data to show the classification capability on more general tasks.},

  abstract     = {Echo state networks (ESNs), belonging to the family of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are suitable for addressing complex nonlinear tasks due to their rich dynamic characteristics and easy implementation. The reservoir of the ESN is composed of a large number of sparsely connected neurons with randomly generated weight matrices. How to set the structural parameters of the ESN becomes a difficult problem in practical applications. Traditionally, the design of the parameters of the ESN structure is performed manually. The manual adjustment of the ESN parameters is not convenient since it is an extremely challenging and time-consuming task. This paper proposes an ensemble of five particle swarm optimization (PSO) strategies to design the structure of ESN and then reduce the manual intervention in the design process. An adaptive selection mechanism is used for each particle in the evolution to select a strategy from the strategy candidate pool for evolution. In addition, leaky integration neurons are used as reservoir internal neurons, which are added within the adaptive mechanism for optimization. The root mean squared error (RMSE) is adopted as the evaluation criterion. The experimental results on Mackey–Glass time series benchmark dataset show that the proposed method outperforms other traditional evolutionary methods. Furthermore, experimental results on electrocardiogram dataset show that the proposed method on the ensemble of PSO displays an excellent performance on real-world problems.},

  abstract     = {Conventional rehabilitation strategies for stroke survivors become difficult when voluntary movements are severely disturbed. Combining passive limb mobilization, robotic devices and EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) systems might improve treatment and clinical follow-up of these patients, but detailed knowledge of neurophysiological mechanisms involved in functional recovery, which might help for tailoring stroke treatment strategies, is lacking. Movement-related EEG changes (EEG event-related desynchronization (ERD) in b e t a and a l p h a bands, an indicator of motor cortex activation traditionally used for BCI systems), were evaluated in a group of 23 paralyzed chronic stroke patients in two unilateral motor tasks alternating paretic and healthy hands ((i) passive movement, using a hand exoskeleton, and (ii) voluntary movement), and compared to nine healthy subjects. In tasks using unaffected hand, we observed an increase of contralesional hemisphere activation for stroke patients group. Unexpectedly, when using paralyzed hand, motor cortex activation was reduced or absent in severely affected group of patients, while patients with moderate motor deficit showed an activation greater than control group. Cortical activation was reduced or absent in damaged hemisphere of all the patients in both tasks. Significant differences related to severity of motor deficit were found in the time course of a l p h a - b e t a bands power ratio in EEG of contralesional hemisphere while moving affected hand. These findings suggest the presence of different compensation mechanisms in contralesional hemisphere of stroke patients related to the grade of motor disability, that might turn quantitative EEG during a movement task, obtained from a BCI system controlling a robotic device included in a rehabilitation task, into a valuable tool for monitoring clinical progression, evaluating recovery, and tailoring treatment of stroke patients.},

  abstract     = {Humans obtain characteristic information such as texture and weight of external objects, relying on the brain’s integration and classification of tactile information; however, the decoding mechanism of multi-level tactile information is relatively elusive from the temporal sequence. In this paper, nonvariant frequency, along with the variant pulse width of electrotactile stimulus, was performed to generate multi-level pressure sensation. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured to investigate the mechanism of whole temporal tactile processing. Five ERP components, containing P100–N140–P200–N200–P300, were observed. By establishing the relationship between stimulation parameters and ERP component amplitudes, we found the following: (1) P200 is the most significant component for distinguishing multi-level tactile sensations; (2) P300 is correlated well with the subjective judgment of tactile sensation. The temporal sequence of brain topographies was implemented to clarify the spatiotemporal characteristics of the tactile process, which conformed to the serial processing model in neurophysiology and cortical network response area described by fMRI. Our results can help further clarify the mechanism of tactile sequential processing, which can be applied to improve the tactile BCI performance, sensory enhancement, and clinical diagnosis for doctors to evaluate the tactile process disorders by examining the temporal ERP components.},

  abstract     = {Decoding brain intention from noninvasively measured neural signals has recently been a hot topic in brain-computer interface (BCI). The motor commands about the movements of fine parts can increase the degrees of freedom under control and be applied to external equipment without stimulus. In the decoding process, the classifier is one of the key factors, and the graph information of the EEG was ignored by most researchers. In this paper, a graph convolutional network (GCN) based on functional connectivity was proposed to decode the motor intention of four fine parts movements (shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand). First, event-related desynchronization was analyzed to reveal the differences between the four classes. Second, functional connectivity was constructed by using synchronization likelihood (SL), phase-locking value (PLV), H index (H), mutual information (MI), and weighted phase-lag index (WPLI) to acquire the electrode pairs with a difference. Subsequently, a GCN and convolutional neural networks (CNN) were performed based on functional topological structures and time points, respectively. The results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved a decoding accuracy of up to 92.81% in the four-class task. Besides, the combination of GCN and functional connectivity can promote the development of BCI.},

With the evolution of multi-channel sensor implementations, the employment of multi-channel techniques for the extraction of features arising from multi-channel dependency and mono-channel characteristics has become common. MSST has recently been proposed as a method for modeling the combined oscillatory mechanisms of multi-channel signals. It makes use of the concepts of instantaneous frequency (IF) and bandwidth. Electrophysiological data, like other nonstationary signals, necessitates both joint time–frequency analysis and independent time and frequency domain studies. The usefulness and effectiveness of a multi-variate, wavelet-based synchrosqueezing algorithm paired with a band extraction method are tested using electroencephalography data obtained from OCD patients and control groups in this research. The proposed methodology yields substantial results when analyzing differences between patient and control groups.},

Here, we propose the combination of corticomuscular coherence (CMC) and intermuscular coherence (IMC) as control features for a novel hybrid BCI for rehabilitation purposes. Multiple electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and surface electromyography (EMG) from 5 muscles per side were collected in 20 healthy participants performing finger extension (Ext) and grasping (Grasp) with both dominant and non-dominant hand. Grand average of CMC and IMC patterns showed a bilateral sensorimotor area as well as multiple muscles involvement. CMC and IMC values were used as features to classify each task versus rest and Ext versus Grasp. We demonstrated that a combination of CMC and IMC features allows for classification of both movements versus rest with better performance (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve, AUC) for the Ext movement (0.97) with respect to Grasp (0.88). Classification of Ext versus Grasp also showed high performances (0.99). All in all, these preliminary findings indicate that the combination of CMC and IMC could provide for a comprehensive framework for simple hand movements to eventually be employed in a hybrid BCI system for post-stroke rehabilitation.},

  abstract     = {Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) can be used in real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI NF) investigations to provide feedback on brain activity to enable voluntary regulation of the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal from localized brain regions. However, the temporal pattern of successful self-regulation is dynamic and complex. In particular, the general linear model (GLM) assumes fixed temporal model functions and misses other dynamics. We propose a novel data-driven analyses approach for rtfMRI NF using intersubject covariance (ISC) analysis. The potential of ISC was examined in a reanalysis of data from 21 healthy individuals and nine patients with post-traumatic stress-disorder (PTSD) performing up-regulation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). ISC in the PTSD group differed from healthy controls in a network including the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). In both cohorts, ISC decreased throughout the experiment indicating the development of individual regulation strategies. ISC analyses are a promising approach to reveal novel information on the mechanisms involved in voluntary self-regulation of brain signals and thus extend the results from GLM-based methods. ISC enables a novel set of research questions that can guide future neurofeedback and neuroimaging investigations.},

Traditional intention decoding methods, which obtain information from induced or spontaneous brain activity, have shortcomings in terms of performance, computational expense and usage burden. Here, a new methodology called prediction error decoding was used for motor imagery (MI) detection and compared with direct intention decoding. Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) was used to induce subliminal sensory feedback between the forehead and mastoids without any burden. Prediction errors were generated between the GVS-induced sensory feedback and the MI direction. The corresponding prediction error decoding of the front/back MI task was validated. A test decoding accuracy of 77.83–78.86% (median) was achieved during GVS for every 100 ms interval. A nonzero weight parameter-based channel screening (WPS) method was proposed to select channels individually and commonly during GVS. When the WPS common-selected mode was compared with the WPS individual-selected mode and a classical channel selection method based on correlation coefficients (CCS), a satisfactory decoding performance of the selected channels was observed. The results indicated the positive impact of measuring common specific channels of the BCI.},

Despite this rapid scientific progress, the range of successful clinical and societal applications remained limited, with some notable exceptions in the rehabilitation of chronic stroke and first steps towards BCI-based assisted verbal communication in paralysis. In this contribution, we focus on the effects of noninvasive and invasive BCI-based verbal communication on the quality of life (QoL) of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the locked-in state (LIS) and the completely locked-in state (CLIS). Despite a substantial lack of replicated scientific data, this paper complements the existing methodological knowledge and focuses future investigators’ attention on (1) Social determinants of QoL and (2) Brain reorganization and behavior. While it is not documented in controlled studies that the good QoL in these patients is a consequence of BCI-based neurorehabilitation, the proposed determinants of QoL might become the theoretical background needed to develop clinically more useful BCI systems and to evaluate the effects of BCI-based communication on QoL for advanced ALS patients and other forms of severe paralysis.},

These data were classified with four labels (Rest, Mouth open, Water injection, and Swallowing). Deep transfer learning was carried out using AlexNet, and power in the high- γ band (75–150 Hz) was the training set. Accuracy reached 74.01%, sensitivity reached 82.51%, and specificity reached 95.38%. However, using the raw ECoG signals, the accuracy obtained was 76.95%, comparable to that of the high- γ power. We demonstrated that a version of AlexNet pre-trained with visually meaningful images can be used for transfer learning of visually meaningless images made up of ECoG signals. Moreover, we could achieve high decoding accuracy using the raw ECoG signals, allowing us to dispense with the conventional extraction of high- γ power. Thus, the images derived from the raw ECoG signals were equivalent to those derived from the high- γ band for transfer deep learning.},

  abstract     = {The task of sentiment analysis tries to predict the affective state of a document by examining its content and metadata through the application of machine learning techniques. Recent advances in the field consider sentiment to be a multi-dimensional quantity that pertains to different interpretations (or aspects), rather than a single one. Based on earlier research, the current work examines the said task in the framework of a larger architecture that crawls documents from various online sources. Subsequently, the collected data are pre-processed, in order to extract useful features that assist the machine learning algorithms in the sentiment analysis task. More specifically, the words that comprise each text are mapped to a neural embedding space and are provided to a hybrid, bi-directional long short-term memory network, coupled with convolutional layers and an attention mechanism that outputs the final textual features. Additionally, a number of document metadata are extracted, including the number of a document’s repetitions in the collected corpus (i.e. number of reposts/retweets), the frequency and type of emoji ideograms and the presence of keywords, either extracted automatically or assigned manually, in the form of hashtags. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the semantic annotation of the retrieved keywords, since an ontology-based knowledge management system is queried, with the purpose of retrieving the classes the aforementioned keywords belong to. Finally, all features are provided to a fully connected, multi-layered, feed-forward artificial neural network that performs the analysis task. The overall architecture is compared, on a manually collected corpus of documents, with two other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving optimal results in identifying negative sentiment, which is of particular interest to certain parties (like for example, companies) that are interested in measuring their online reputation.},

Further, they give a solution for the Chow parameters problem. Second, convex cones are made of the nearest neighbor relations for the generation of the reduced variables. Then the edges of convex cones are compared for the discrimination of variables.

Currently, deep learning-based SISR approaches have been widely discussed in medical image processing, because of their potential to achieve high-quality, high spatial resolution images without the cost of additional scans. However, most existing methods are designed for scale-specific SR tasks and are unable to generalize over magnification scales. In this paper, we propose an approach for medical image arbitrary-scale super-resolution (MIASSR), in which we couple meta-learning with generative adversarial networks (GANs) to super-resolve medical images at any scale of magnification in ( 1 , 4 ] . Compared to state-of-the-art SISR algorithms on single-modal magnetic resonance (MR) brain images (OASIS-brains) and multi-modal MR brain images (BraTS), MIASSR achieves comparable fidelity performance and the best perceptual quality with the smallest model size. We also employ transfer learning to enable MIASSR to tackle SR tasks of new medical modalities, such as cardiac MR images (ACDC) and chest computed tomography images (COVID-CT). The source code of our work is also public. Thus, MIASSR has the potential to become a new foundational pre-/post-processing step in clinical image analysis tasks such as reconstruction, image quality enhancement, and segmentation.},

This paper is interested in recommending a suitable estimator for nonlinear regression modeling, particularly in recommending either the standard nonlinear least squares estimator or one of such available alternative estimators, which is highly robust with respect to the presence of outliers in the data. The authors hold the opinion that theoretical considerations will never be able to formulate such recommendations for the nonlinear regression context. Instead, metalearning is explored here as an original approach suitable for this task. In this paper, four different approaches for automatic method selection for nonlinear regression are proposed and computations over a training database of 643 real publicly available datasets are performed. Particularly, while the metalearning results may be harmed by the imbalanced number of groups, an effective approach yields much improved results, performing a novel combination of supervised feature selection by random forest and oversampling by synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). As a by-product, the computations bring arguments in favor of the very recent nonlinear least weighted squares estimator, which turns out to outperform other (and much more renowned) estimators in a quite large percentage of datasets.},

The plugging and locking of connectors is a class of tasks which is yet hard to be automatized with sufficiently high process stability. Due to the variation of plugging positions and external disturbances, e.g. occlusion due to cables, the quality assessment of plugging processes has emerged as a challenging task for image-based systems. For this reason, the proposed approach analyzes the inherent acoustic connector locking properties in combination with different neural network architectures in order to correctly identify connector locking signals and further to distinguish them from other machining events occurring in assembly plants. For this specific task, highly sensitive optical microphones have been applied for data acquisition. The proposed experiments are carried out under laboratory conditions as well as for the more complex situation in a real manufacturing environment. In this context, the usage of multimodal neural network architectures achieved highest levels in classification performance with accuracy levels close to 90%.},

Deep neural networks outperform traditional lexicon-based and machine learning methods by effectively exploiting contextual word embeddings to generate dense document representation. However, this representation model is not fully adequate to capture topical semantics and the sentiment polarity of words. To overcome these problems, a novel sentiment analysis model is proposed that utilizes richer document representations of word-emotion associations and topic models, which is the main computational novelty of this study. The sentiment analysis model integrates word embeddings with lexicon-based sentiment and emotion indicators, including negations and emoticons, and to further improve its performance, a topic modeling component is utilized together with a bag-of-words model based on a supervised term weighting scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using large datasets of Amazon product reviews and hotel reviews. Experimental results prove that the proposed document representation is valid for the sentiment analysis of product and hotel reviews, irrespective of their class imbalance. The results also show that the proposed model improves on existing machine learning methods.},

  abstract     = {Motor imagery (MI) based brain–computer interfaces help patients with movement disorders to regain the ability to control external devices. Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a popular algorithm for feature extraction in decoding MI tasks. However, due to noise and nonstationarity in electroencephalography (EEG), it is not optimal to combine the corresponding features obtained from the traditional CSP algorithm. In this paper, we designed a novel CSP feature selection framework that combines the filter method and the wrapper method. We first evaluated the importance of every CSP feature by the infinite latent feature selection method. Meanwhile, we calculated Wasserstein distance between feature distributions of the same feature under different tasks. Then, we redefined the importance of every CSP feature based on two indicators mentioned above, which eliminates half of CSP features to create a new CSP feature subspace according to the new importance indicator. At last, we designed the improved binary gravitational search algorithm (IBGSA) by rebuilding its transfer function and applied IBGSA on the new CSP feature subspace to find the optimal feature set. To validate the proposed method, we conducted experiments on three public BCI datasets and performed a numerical analysis of the proposed algorithm for MI classification. The accuracies were comparable to those reported in related studies and the presented model outperformed other methods in literature on the same underlying data.},

The neural and cardiovascular systems may exhibit critical slowing, which is measured by an increase in variance and autocorrelation of the system, when change from a normal state to an ictal state. To forecast seizures, the variance and autocorrelation of long-term continuous EEG and ECG data from 16 patients were used for analysis. The average period of recordings was 161.9 h, with an average of 9 electrographic seizures in an individual patient. The relationship between seizure onset times and phases of variance and autocorrelation in EEG and ECG data was investigated. The results of forecasting models using critical slowing features, seizure circadian features, and combined critical slowing and circadian features were compared using the receiver-operating characteristic curve. The results demonstrated that the best forecaster was patient-specific and the average area under the curve (AUC) of the best forecaster across patients was 0.68. In 50% of patients, circadian forecasters had the best performance. Critical slowing forecaster performed best in 19% of patients. Combined forecaster achieved the best performance in 31% of patients.

The system exploits information extracted from the temporal-domain and time-frequency-domain, as part of a hybrid strategy, to discriminate the temporal windows (i.e. EEG epochs) preceding hand sub-movements (open/close) and the resting state. To this end, for each EEG epoch, the associated cortical source signals in the motor cortex and the corresponding time-frequency (TF) maps are estimated via beamforming and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), respectively. Two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are designed: specifically, the first CNN is trained over a dataset of temporal (T) data (i.e. EEG sources), and is referred to as T-CNN; the second CNN is trained over a dataset of TF data (i.e. TF-maps of EEG sources), and is referred to as TF-CNN. Two sets of features denoted as T-features and TF-features, extracted from T-CNN and TF-CNN, respectively, are concatenated in a single features vector (denoted as TTF-features vector) which is used as input to a standard multi-layer perceptron for classification purposes. Experimental results show a significant performance improvement of our proposed hybrid-domain DL approach as compared to temporal-only and time-frequency-only-based benchmark approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 7 6 . 2 1 ± 3 . 7 7 %.},

The surface Laplacian has been applied to EEG to improve the spatial resolution and selectivity of the surface electrical activity recording. Tri-polar concentric ring electrodes (TCREs) were shown to estimate the Laplacian automatically with better spatial resolution than disc electrodes. For this work, movement-related potentials (MRPs) were recorded from four TCREs and disc electrodes while 13 subjects performed real and imaginary finger movements. The MRP signals recorded with the TCREs have significantly less mutual information and coherence between neighboring locations compared to disc electrodes. The results also show that signals from TCREs generated higher accuracy compared to disc electrodes. It further shows that TCREs using temporal EEG data as features yield an average accuracy of 7 0 . 0 ± 7 . 7 % and 6 3 . 3 ± 5 . 8 % for real and imaginary finger movements, respectively, which is significantly higher than utilizing EEG spectral power changes in α and β bands as features.

Most NAS algorithms make the assumption that the overall structure of the network is linear and focus solely on accuracy to assess the performance of candidate networks. This paper introduces a novel NAS algorithm based on a multi-objective modeling of the network design problem to design accurate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a small structure. The proposed algorithm makes use of a graph-based representation of the solutions which enables a high flexibility in the automatic design. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm includes novel ad-hoc crossover and mutation operators. We also propose a mechanism to accelerate the evaluation of the candidate solutions.

  abstract     = {A full-fledged neural network modeling, based on a Multi-layered Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Neural Network (NARX) architecture, is proposed for quasi-static and dynamic hysteresis loops, one of the most challenging topics for computational magnetism. This modeling approach overcomes drawbacks in attaining better than percent-level accuracy of classical and recent approaches for accelerator magnets, that combine hybridization of standard hysteretic models and neural network architectures. By means of an incremental procedure, different Deep Neural Network Architectures are selected, fine-tuned and tested in order to predict magnetic hysteresis in the context of electromagnets. Tests and results show that the proposed NARX architecture best fits the measured magnetic field behavior of a reference quadrupole at CERN. In particular, the proposed modeling framework leads to a percent error below 0.02% for the magnetic field prediction, thus outperforming state of the art approaches and paving a very promising way for future real time applications.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy diagnosis based on Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs) in scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs) is laborious and often subjective. Therefore, it is necessary to build an effective IED detector and an automatic method to classify IED-free versus IED EEGs. In this study, we evaluate features that may provide reliable IED detection and EEG classification. Specifically, we investigate the IED detector based on convolutional neural network (ConvNet) with different input features (temporal, spectral, and wavelet features). We explore different ConvNet architectures and types, including 1D (one-dimensional) ConvNet, 2D (two-dimensional) ConvNet, and noise injection at various layers. We evaluate the EEG classification performance on five independent datasets. The 1D ConvNet with preprocessed full-frequency EEG signal and frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta) with Gaussian additive noise at the output layer achieved the best IED detection results with a false detection rate of 0.23/min at 90% sensitivity. The EEG classification system obtained a mean EEG classification Leave-One-Institution-Out (LOIO) cross-validation (CV) balanced accuracy (BAC) of 78.1% (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.839) and Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) CV BAC of 79.5% (AUC of 0.856). Since the proposed classification system only takes a few seconds to analyze a 30-min routine EEG, it may help in reducing the human effort required for epilepsy diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy is one of the most common brain disorders worldwide. The most frequently used clinical tool to detect epileptic events and monitor epilepsy patients is the EEG recordings. There have been proposed many computer-aided diagnosis systems using EEG signals for the detection and prediction of seizures. In this study, a novel method based on Fourier-based Synchrosqueezing Transform (SST), which is a high-resolution time-frequency (TF) representation, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed to detect and predict seizure segments. SST is based on the reassignment of signal components in the TF plane which provides highly localized TF energy distributions. Epileptic seizures cause sudden energy discharges which are well represented in the TF plane by using the SST method. The proposed SST-based CNN method is evaluated using the IKCU dataset we collected, and the publicly available CHB-MIT dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields high average segment-based seizure detection precision and accuracy rates for both datasets (IKCU: 98.99% PRE and 99.06% ACC; CHB-MIT: 99.81% PRE and 99.63% ACC). Additionally, SST-based CNN approach provides significantly higher segment-based seizure prediction performance with 98.54% PRE and 97.92% ACC than similar approaches presented in the literature using the CHB-MIT dataset.},

  abstract     = {Epileptic seizure prediction is one of the most used therapeutic adjuvant strategies for drug-resistant epilepsy. Conventional methods usually adopt handcrafted features and manual parameter setting. The over-reliance on the expertise of specialists may lead to weak exploitation of features and low popularization of clinical application. This paper proposes a novel parameterless patient-specific method based on Fourier Neural Network (FNN), where the Fourier transform and backpropagation learning are synthesized to make the predictor more efficient and practical. The employment of FNN is the first attempt in the field of seizure prediction due to its automatic extraction of immanent spectra in epileptic signals. Despite the self-adaptive superiority of FNN, we introduce Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to further improve its search capability in high-dimensional feature spaces. The study also develops a multi-layer module to estimate spectral power ratios of raw recordings, which optimizes the prediction by enhancing feature diversity. Based on these modules, this paper proposes a two-channel deep neural network: Fourier Ratio Convolutional Neural Network (FRCNN). To demonstrate the reliability of the model, we explain the mathematical meaning of hidden-layer neurons in FRCNN theoretically. This approach is evaluated on both intracranial and scalp EEG datasets. It shows that the predictor achieved a sensitivity of 91.2% and a false prediction rate (FPR) of 0.06 h − 1 across intracranial subjects and a sensitivity of 85.4% and an FPR of 0.14 h − 1 over scalp subjects. The results indicate that FRCNN enables the convenience of epilepsy treatments while preserving a high degree of precision. In the end, a detailed comparison with the previous methods demonstrates that FRCNN has achieved higher performance and generalization ability.},

  abstract     = {Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are elicited from an epileptic brain, whereas they can also be due to other neurological abnormalities. The diversity in their morphologies, their strengths, and their sources within the brain cause a great deal of uncertainty in their labeling by clinicians. The aim of this study is therefore to exploit and incorporate this uncertainty (the probability of the waveform being an IED) in the IED detection system which combines spatial component analysis (SCA) with the IED probabilities referred to as SCA-IEDP-based method. For comparison, we also propose and study SCA-based method in which probability of the waveform being an IED is ignored. The proposed models are employed to detect IEDs in two different classification approaches: (1) subject-dependent and (2) subject-independent classification approaches. The proposed methods are compared with two other state-of-the-art methods namely, time–frequency features and tensor factorization methods. The proposed SCA-IEDP model has achieved superior performance in comparison with the traditional SCA and other competing methods. It achieved 79.9% and 63.4% accuracy values in subject-dependent and subject-independent classification approaches, respectively. This shows that considering the IED probabilities in designing an IED detection system can boost its performance.},

A low-complexity electroencephalography (EEG)-based seizure monitoring algorithm is critically important for daily use, especially for wearable monitoring platforms. This paper presents a personalized EEG feature selection approach, which is the key to achieve a reliable seizure monitoring with a low computational cost. We advocate a two-step, personalized feature selection strategy to enhance monitoring performances for each patient. In the first step, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is applied to find a few seizure-indicative channels. Then in the second step, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method is employed to select a discriminative subset of both frequency and time domain features (spectral powers and entropy). A personalization strategy is further customized to find the best settings (number of channels and features) that yield the highest classification scores for each subject. Experimental results of analyzing 23 subjects in CHB-MIT database are quite promising. We have achieved an average F-1 score of 88% with excellent sensitivity and specificity using not more than 7 features extracted from at most 3 channels.},

  abstract     = {EEG is the gold standard for seizure detection in the newborn infant, but EEG interpretation in the preterm group is particularly challenging; trained experts are scarce and the task of interpreting EEG in real-time is arduous. Preterm infants are reported to have a higher incidence of seizures compared to term infants. Preterm EEG morphology differs from that of term infants, which implies that seizure detection algorithms trained on term EEG may not be appropriate. The task of developing preterm specific algorithms becomes extra-challenging given the limited amount of annotated preterm EEG data available. This paper explores novel deep learning (DL) architectures for the task of neonatal seizure detection in preterm infants. The study tests and compares several approaches to address the problem: training on data from full-term infants; training on data from preterm infants; training on age-specific preterm data and transfer learning. The system performance is assessed on a large database of continuous EEG recordings of 575 h in duration. It is shown that the accuracy of a validated term-trained EEG seizure detection algorithm, based on a support vector machine classifier, when tested on preterm infants falls well short of the performance achieved for full-term infants. An AUC of 88.3% was obtained when tested on preterm EEG as compared to 96.6% obtained when tested on term EEG. When re-trained on preterm EEG, the performance marginally increases to 89.7%. An alternative DL approach shows a more stable trend when tested on the preterm cohort, starting with an AUC of 93.3% for the term-trained algorithm and reaching 95.0% by transfer learning from the term model using available preterm data. The proposed DL approach avoids time-consuming explicit feature engineering and leverages the existence of the term seizure detection model, resulting in accurate predictions with a minimum amount of annotated preterm data.},

  abstract     = {Decision response and feedback in gambling are interrelated. Different decisions lead to different ranges of feedback, which in turn influences subsequent decisions. However, the mechanism underlying the continuous decision-feedback process is still left unveiled. To fulfill this gap, we applied the hidden Markov model (HMM) to the gambling electroencephalogram (EEG) data to characterize the dynamics of this process. Furthermore, we explored the differences between distinct decision responses (i.e. choose large or small bets) or distinct feedback (i.e. win or loss outcomes) in corresponding phases. We demonstrated that the processing stages in decision-feedback process including strategy adjustment and visual information processing can be characterized by distinct brain networks. Moreover, time-varying networks showed, after decision response, large bet recruited more resources from right frontal and right center cortices while small bet was more related to the activation of the left frontal lobe. Concerning feedback, networks of win feedback showed a strong right frontal and right center pattern, while an information flow originating from the left frontal lobe to the middle frontal lobe was observed in loss feedback. Taken together, these findings shed light on general principles of natural decision-feedback and may contribute to the design of biologically inspired, participant-independent decision-feedback systems.},

In this work, we propose a novel feature optimization and outlier detection method for the CSP algorithm. Specifically, we use the minimum covariance determinant (MCD) to detect and remove outliers in the dataset, then we use the Fisher score to evaluate and select features. In addition, in order to prevent the emergence of new outliers, we propose an iterative minimum covariance determinant (IMCD) algorithm. We evaluate our proposed algorithm in terms of iteration times, classification accuracy and feature distribution using two BCI competition datasets. The experimental results show that the average classification performance of our proposed method is 12% and 22.9% higher than that of the traditional CSP method in two datasets ( p &lt; 0 . 0 5 ), and our proposed method obtains better performance in comparison with other competing methods.

  abstract     = {Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which aims at automatically designing neural architectures, recently draw a growing research interest. Different from conventional NAS methods, in which a large number of neural architectures need to be trained for evaluation, the one-shot NAS methods only have to train one supernet which synthesizes all the possible candidate architectures. As a result, the search efficiency could be significantly improved by sharing the supernet’s weights during the candidate architectures’ evaluation. This strategy could greatly speed up the search process but suffer a challenge that the evaluation based on sharing weights is not predictive enough. Recently, pruning the supernet during the search has been proven to be an efficient way to alleviate this problem. However, the pruning direction in complex-structured search space remains unexplored. In this paper, we revisited the role of path dropout strategy, which drops the neural operations instead of the neurons, in supernet training, and several interesting characters of the supernet trained with dropout are found. Based on the observations, a Hierarchically-Ordered Pruning Neural Architecture Search (HOPNAS) algorithm is proposed by dynamically pruning the supernet with a proper pruning direction. Experimental results indicate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.},

Moreover, data imbalance is common in seizure detection scenarios where the duration of nonseizure periods is much longer than the duration of seizures. To cope with the two challenges, a novel seizure detection method based on graph attention network (GAT) is presented. The approach acts on graph-structured data and takes the raw EEG data as input. The positional relationship between different EEG signals is exploited by GAT. The loss function of the GAT model is redefined using the focal loss to tackle data imbalance problem.

To address these issues, we acutely recorded speech-related signals from the frontal cortex of two human patients undergoing awake neurosurgery for brain tumors using three different micro-electrocorticographic ( μ ECoG) devices. First, we observed that, at the smallest investigated pitch (600 μ m), neighboring channels are highly correlated, suggesting that more closely spaced electrodes would provide some redundant information. Second, we trained a classifier to recognize speech-related motor preparation from high-gamma oscillations (70–150 Hz), demonstrating that these neuronal signals can be used to reliably predict speech onset.

  abstract     = {On-demand stimulation improves the efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in refractory epilepsy. The vagus nerve is the main peripheral parasympathetic connection and seizures are known to exhibit autonomic symptoms. Therefore, we hypothesized that seizure detection is possible through vagus nerve electroneurogram (VENG) recording. We developed a metric able to measure abrupt changes in amplitude and frequency of spontaneous vagus nerve action potentials. A classifier was trained using a “leave-one-out” method on a set of 6 seizures and 3 control recordings to utilize the VENG spike feature-based metric for seizure detection. We were able to detect pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) induced acute seizures in 6/6 animals during different stages of the seizure with no false detection. The classifier detected the seizure during an early stage in 3/6 animals and at the onset of tonic clonic stage of the seizure in 3/6 animals. EMG and motion artefacts often accompany epileptic activity. We showed the “epileptic” neural signal to be independent from EMG and motion artefacts. We confirmed the existence of seizure related signals in the VENG recording and proved their applicability for seizure detection. This detection might be a promising tool to improve efficacy of VNS treatment by developing new responsive stimulation systems.},

It has been debated whether harvesting signals from other brain areas that encode global cognitive variables, such as the allocation of attention and eye movement goals in a variety of spatial reference frames, may improve the outcome of iBCIs. Here, we explore the ability of LFP signals, sampled from the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) of macaque monkeys, to encode eye-movement intention during the pre-movement fixation period of a delayed saccade task. We use spectral dimensionality reduction to examine the spatiotemporal properties of the extracted non-rhythmic broadband activity and explore its usefulness in decoding saccade goals. The dynamics of the broadband signal in low spatial dimensions across the pre-movement fixation period uncovered saccade target separation; its discriminative potential was confirmed using support vector machine classifications. These findings reveal that broadband LFP from the LPFC can be used to decode intended saccade target location during pre-movement periods. We further provide a general workflow that can be implemented in iBCIs and it is relatively robust to the loss of spikes in individual electrodes.},

Emerging evidence suggests that although patients may not respond behaviorally to external stimuli during anesthesia, they may be aware of their surroundings. In this work, we investigated whether EEG based brain decoding could be used for detecting connected consciousness in the absence of behavioral responses during propofol infusion. A total of 14 subjects participated in our experiment. Subjects were asked to discriminate two types of auditory stimuli with a finger press during an ultraslow propofol infusion. We trained an EEG based brain decoding model using data collected in the awakened state using the same auditory stimuli and tested the model on data collected during the propofol infusion. The model provided a correct classification rate (CCR) of 7 8 . 7 4 ± 1 1 . 1 5 % when subjects were able to respond to the stimuli during the propofol infusion. The CCR dropped to 6 7 . 2 9 ± 8 . 2 1 % when subjects ceased responding and further decreased to 5 8 . 1 1 ± 8 . 1 5 % when we increased the propofol concentration by another 0.2 μ g/ml. After terminating the propofol infusion, we observed that the CCR rebounded to 6 5 . 3 1 ± 7 . 1 1 % before the subjects regained consciousness. With the classification results, we provided evidence that loss of consciousness is a gradual process and may progress from full consciousness to connected consciousness and then to disconnected consciousness.},

  abstract     = {Pathological slowing in the electroencephalogram (EEG) is widely investigated for the diagnosis of neurological disorders. Currently, the gold standard for slowing detection is the visual inspection of the EEG by experts, which is time-consuming and subjective. To address those issues, we propose three automated approaches to detect slowing in EEG: Threshold-based Detection System (TDS), Shallow Learning-based Detection System (SLDS), and Deep Learning-based Detection System (DLDS). These systems are evaluated on channel-, segment-, and EEG-level. The three systems perform prediction via detecting slowing at individual channels, and those detections are arranged in histograms for detection of slowing at the segment- and EEG-level. We evaluate the systems through Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation (CV) and Leave-One-Institution-Out (LOIO) CV on four datasets from the US, Singapore, and India. The DLDS achieved the best overall results: LOIO CV mean balanced accuracy (BAC) of 71.9%, 75.5%, and 82.0% at channel-, segment- and EEG-level, and LOSO CV mean BAC of 73.6%, 77.2%, and 81.8% at channel-, segment-, and EEG-level. The channel- and segment-level performance is comparable to the intra-rater agreement (IRA) of an expert of 72.4% and 82%. The DLDS can process a 30 min EEG in 4 s and can be deployed to assist clinicians in interpreting EEGs.},

  abstract     = {It is widely recognized that continuous sensory feedback plays a crucial role in accurate motor control in everyday life. Feedback information is used to adapt force output and to correct errors. While primary motor cortex contralateral to the movement (cM1) plays a dominant role in this control, converging evidence supports the idea that ipsilateral primary motor cortex (iM1) also directly contributes to hand and finger movements. Similarly, when visual feedback is available, primary visual cortex (V1) and its interactions with the motor network also become important for accurate motor performance. To elucidate this issue, we performed and integrated behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) measurements during isometric compression of a compliant rubber bulb, at 10% and 30% of maximum voluntary contraction, both with and without visual feedback. We used a semi-blind approach (functional source separation (FSS)) to identify separate functional sources of mu -frequency (8–13 Hz) EEG responses in cM1, iM1 and V1. Here for the first time, we have used orthogonal FSS to extract multiple sources, by using the same functional constraint, providing the ability to extract different sources that oscillate in the same frequency range but that have different topographic distributions. We analyzed the single-trial timecourses of mu power event-related desynchronization (ERD) in these sources and linked them with force measurements to understand which aspects are most important for good task performance. Whilst the amplitude of mu power was not related to contraction force in any of the sources, it was able to provide information on performance quality. We observed stronger ERDs in both contralateral and ipsilateral motor sources during trials where contraction force was most consistently maintained. This effect was most prominent in the ipsilateral source, suggesting the importance of iM1 to accurate performance. This ERD effect was sustained throughout the duration of visual feedback trials, but only present at the start of no feedback trials, consistent with more variable performance in the absence of feedback. Overall, we found that the behavior of the ERD in iM1 was the most informative aspect concerning the accuracy of the contraction performance, and the ability to maintain a steady level of contraction. This new approach of using FSS to extract multiple orthogonal sources provides the ability to investigate both contralateral and ipsilateral nodes of the motor network without the need for additional information (e.g. electromyography). The enhanced signal-to-noise ratio provided by FSS opens the possibility of extracting complex EEG features on an individual trial basis, which is crucial for a more nuanced understanding of fine motor performance, as well as for applications in brain-computer interfacing.},

  abstract     = {A reliable neural-machine interface is essential for humans to intuitively interact with advanced robotic hands in an unconstrained environment. Existing neural decoding approaches utilize either discrete hand gesture-based pattern recognition or continuous force decoding with one finger at a time. We developed a neural decoding technique that allowed continuous and concurrent prediction of forces of different fingers based on spinal motoneuron firing information. High-density skin-surface electromyogram (HD-EMG) signals of finger extensor muscle were recorded, while human participants produced isometric flexion forces in a dexterous manner (i.e. produced varying forces using either a single finger or multiple fingers concurrently). Motoneuron firing information was extracted from the EMG signals using a blind source separation technique, and each identified neuron was further classified to be associated with a given finger. The forces of individual fingers were then predicted concurrently by utilizing the corresponding motoneuron pool firing frequency of individual fingers. Compared with conventional approaches, our technique led to better prediction performances, i.e. a higher correlation ( 0 . 7 1 ± 0 . 1 1 versus 0 . 6 1 ± 0 . 0 9 ), a lower prediction error ( 5 . 8 8 ± 1 . 3 4 % MVC versus 7 . 5 6 ± 1 . 6 0 % MVC), and a higher accuracy in finger state (rest/active) prediction ( 8 8 . 1 0 ± 4 . 6 5 % versus 8 0 . 2 1 ± 4 . 3 2 %). Our decoding method demonstrated the possibility of classifying motoneurons for different fingers, which significantly alleviated the cross-talk issue of EMG recordings from neighboring hand muscles, and allowed the decoding of finger forces individually and concurrently. The outcomes offered a robust neural-machine interface that could allow users to intuitively control robotic hands in a dexterous manner.},

  abstract     = {Subjective effort can significantly affect the ability of humans to act optimally in dynamic manipulation tasks. In a previous study, we designed a complex object coupling manipulation task that required tight performance and induced high cognitive workload. We hypothesize that strong-effort-related physiological reactivity during the dynamic manipulation task improves the user performance in an undesired task feedback situation. To test this hypothesis, using the motor intentions’ discrimination from electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements, we evaluate the effort expended by 20 participants in a controlling task with constraints involving complex coupling objects. Specifically, the finer motor decisions are obtained from the controlling information in EEG by using two fingers from the same hand rather than two hands. The motor intention is decoded from a task-dependent EEG through a regularized discriminant analysis, and the area under the curve is ∼ 0 . 9 4 . Furthermore, we compare the undesired and desired task feedback conditions along with the individual’s effort dynamic adjustment, and investigate whether the undesired task feedback improved the discrimination of the motor activities. A stronger effort to attain the desired feedback state corresponds to improved motor activity discrimination from the EEG in the undesired task feedback scenario. The differences in the brain activities under the undesired and desired task feedback conditions are analyzed using brain-network-based topographical scalp maps. Our experiment provides preliminary evidence that inducing strong effort can improve discrimination performance during highly demanding tasks. This finding can advance our understanding of human attention, potentially improve the accuracy of intention recognition, and may inspire better EEG acquisition contexts.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) plays an important role in recording brain activity to diagnose epilepsy. However, it is not only laborious, but also not very cost effective for medical experts to manually identify the features on EEG. Therefore, automatic seizure detection in accordance with the EEG recordings is significant for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. Here, a new method for detecting seizures using tensor distance (TD) is proposed. First, the time–frequency characteristics of EEG signals are obtained by wavelet transformation, and the tensor representation of EEG signals is then obtained. Tucker decomposition is used to obtain the principal components of the EEG tensor. After, the distances between different categories of EEG tensors are calculated as the EEG features. Finally, the TD features are classified through the Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis (Bayesian LDA) classifier. The performance of this method is measured by the sensitivity, specificity, and recognition accuracy. Results indicate 95.12% sensitivity, 97.60% specificity, 97.60% recognition accuracy, and a false detection rate of 0.76 per hour in the invasive EEG dataset, which included 566.57 h of EEG recording data from 21 patients. Taken together, the results show that TD has a good detection effect for seizure classification and that this method has high computational speed and great potential for real-time diagnosis.},

In this paper, a high-resolution time-frequency (TF) representation called Synchrosqueezing Transform (SST) is used to detect epileptic seizures. Two different EEG data sets, the IKCU data set we collected, and the publicly available CHB-MIT data set are analyzed to test the performance of the proposed model in seizure detection. The SST representations of seizure and nonseizure (pre-seizure or inter-seizure) EEG segments of epilepsy patients are calculated. Various features like higher-order joint TF (HOJ-TF) moments and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based features are calculated using the SST representation. By using single and ensemble machine learning methods such as k -Nearest Neighbor ( k NN), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Boosted Trees (BT), and Subspace k NN (S- k NN), EEG features are classified. The proposed SST-based approach achieved 95.1% ACC, 96.87% PRE, 95.54% REC values for the IKCU data set, and 95.13% ACC, 93.37% PRE, 90.30% REC values for the CHB-MIT data set in seizure detection.

  abstract     = {The diagnosis of epilepsy often relies on a reading of routine scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs). Since seizures are highly unlikely to be detected in a routine scalp EEG, the primary diagnosis depends heavily on the visual evaluation of Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs). This process is tedious, expert-centered, and delays the treatment plan. Consequently, the development of an automated, fast, and reliable epileptic EEG diagnostic system is essential. In this study, we propose a system to classify EEG as epileptic or normal based on multiple modalities extracted from the interictal EEG. The ensemble system consists of three components: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based IED detector, a Template Matching (TM)-based IED detector, and a spectral feature-based classifier. We evaluate the system on datasets from six centers from the USA, Singapore, and India. The system yields a mean Leave-One-Institution-Out (LOIO) cross-validation (CV) area under curve (AUC) of 0.826 (balanced accuracy (BAC) of 76.1%) and Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) CV AUC of 0.812 (BAC of 74.8%). The LOIO results are found to be similar to the interrater agreement (IRA) reported in the literature for epileptic EEG classification. Moreover, as the proposed system can process routine EEGs in a few seconds, it may aid the clinicians in diagnosing epilepsy efficiently.},

  abstract     = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a largely prevalent neurodevelopmental condition with a big social and economical impact affecting the entire life of families. There is an intense search for biomarkers that can be assessed as early as possible in order to initiate treatment and preparation of the family to deal with the challenges imposed by the condition. Brain imaging biomarkers have special interest. Specifically, functional connectivity data extracted from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) should allow to detect brain connectivity alterations. Machine learning pipelines encompass the estimation of the functional connectivity matrix from brain parcellations, feature extraction, and building classification models for ASD prediction. The works reported in the literature are very heterogeneous from the computational and methodological point of view. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive computational exploration of the impact of the choices involved while building these machine learning pipelines. Specifically, we consider six brain parcellation definitions, five methods for functional connectivity matrix construction, six feature extraction/selection approaches, and nine classifier building algorithms. We report the prediction performance sensitivity to each of these choices, as well as the best results that are comparable with the state of the art.},

  abstract     = {Spasticity is a common post-stroke syndrome that imposes significant adverse impacts on patients and caregivers. This study aims to improve the efficiency of botulinum toxin (BoNT) in managing spasticity, by utilizing a three-dimensional innervation zone imaging (3DIZI) technique based on high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) recordings. Stroke subjects were randomly assigned to two groups: the control group ( n = 6 ) which received standard ultrasound-guided injections, and the experimental group ( n = 6 ) which received 3DIZI-guided injections. The amount of BoNT given was consistent for all subjects. The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and muscle activation volume (MAV) from bilateral biceps brachii muscles were obtained at the baseline, 3 weeks, and 3 months after injection. Intra-group and inter-group comparisons of MAS, CMAP amplitude and MAV were performed. An overall improvement in MAS of spastic elbow flexors was observed during the 3-week visit ( p &lt; 0 . 0 1 ), yet no statistically significant difference found with intra-group or inter-group analysis. Compared to the baseline, a significant reduction of CMAP amplitude and MAV were observed in the spastic biceps muscles of both groups at 3-week post-injection, and returned to approximate baseline value at 12-week post injection. A significantly higher reduction was found in CMAP amplitude ( 3 4 . 7 1 ± 5 . 4 2 % versus 2 0 . 9 2 ± 6 . 7 3 %, p &lt; 0 . 0 1 ) and MAV ( 7 1 . 5 1 ± 8 . 2 0 % versus 4 4 . 3 3 ± 2 1 . 8 1 %, p &lt; 0 . 0 5 ) in the experimental group compared to the control group. The study has demonstrated preliminary evidence that precisely directing BoNT to the innervation zones (IZs) localized by 3DIZI leads to a significantly higher treatment efficiency improvement in spasticity management. Results have also shown the feasibility of developing a personalized BoNT injection technique for the optimization of clinical treatment for post-stroke spasticity using proposed 3DIZI technique.},

It may be due to the fact that human beings have a relatively poor tactile perception. This study investigated the influence of visual attention on the performance of a tactile P300 BCI. We designed our paradigms based on a novel cheeks-stim paradigm which attached the stimulators on the subject’s cheeks. Two paradigms were designed as follows: a paradigm with no visual attention and another paradigm with visual attention to the target position. Eleven subjects were invited to perform the two paradigms. We also recorded and analyzed the eyeball movement data during the paradigm with visual attention to explore whether the eyeball movement would have an effect on the BCI classification. The average online accuracy was 89.09% for the paradigm with visual attention, which was significantly higher than that of the paradigm with no visual attention (70.45%). Significant difference in ITR was also found between the two paradigms ( p &lt; 0 . 0 5 ). The results demonstrated that visual attention was an effective method to improve the performance of tactile P300 BCI. Our findings suggested that it may be feasible to complete an efficient tactile BCI system by adding visual attention.},

  abstract     = {Very fast ripples (VFRs, 500–1000 Hz) are considered more specific than high-frequency oscillations (80–500 Hz) as biomarkers of epileptogenic zones. Although VFRs are frequent abnormal phenomena in epileptic seizures, their functional roles remain unclear. Here, we detected the VFRs in the hippocampal network and tracked their roles during status epilepticus (SE) in rats with pilocarpine-induced temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). All regions in the hippocampal network exhibited VFRs in the baseline, preictal, ictal and postictal states, with the ictal state containing the most VFRs. Moreover, strong phase-locking couplings existed between VFRs and slow oscillations (1–12 Hz) in the ictal and postictal states for all regions. Further investigation indicated that during VFRs, the build-up of slow oscillations in the ictal state began from the temporal lobe and then spread through the whole hippocampal network via two different pathways, which might be associated with the underlying propagation of epileptiform discharges in the hippocampal network. Overall, we provide a functional description of the emergence of VFRs in the hippocampal network during SE, and we also establish that VFRs may be the physiological representation of the pathological alterations in hippocampal network activity during SE in TLE.},

  abstract     = {Magnesium (Mg 2 + ) is an essential mineral for several cellular functions. The concentration of this ion below the physiological concentration induces recurrent neuronal discharges both in slices of the hippocampus and in neuronal cultures. These epileptiform discharges are initially sensitive to the application of N -methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, but these antagonists may lose their effectiveness with prolonged exposure to low [Mg 2 + ], when extracellular Ca 2 + reduction occurs, typical of ictal periods, indicating the absence of synaptic connections. The study herein presented aimed at investigating the effect of reducing the [Mg 2 + ] during the induction of Nonsynaptic Epileptiform Activities (NSEA). As an experimental protocol, NSEA were induced in rat hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), using a bath solution containing high-K + and zero-added-Ca 2 + . Additionally, computer simulations were performed using a mathematical model that represents electrochemical characteristics of the tissue of the DG granular layer. The experimental results show that the reduction of [Mg 2 + ] causes an increase in the duration of the ictal period and a reduction in the interictal period, intensifying epileptiform discharges. The computer simulations suggest that the reduction of the Mg 2 + level intensifies the epileptiform discharges by a joint effect of reducing the surface charge screening and reducing the activity of the Na/K pump.},

The attempt is also to reduce variability and noise of MI-BCI, which could be affected by a large number of EEG channels. The relation between selected channels and MI-BCI performance is therefore analyzed. The proposed method is able to select acquisition channels common to all subjects, while achieving a performance compatible with the use of all the channels. Results are reported with reference to a standard benchmark dataset, the BCI competition IV dataset 2a. They prove that a performance compatible with the best state-of-the-art approaches can be achieved, while adopting a significantly smaller number of channels, both in two and in four tasks classification. In particular, classification accuracy is about 77–83% in binary classification with down to 6 EEG channels, and above 60% for the four-classes case when 10 channels are employed. This gives a contribution in optimizing the EEG measurement while developing non-invasive and wearable MI-based brain-computer interfaces.},

However, those studies focused on healthy subjects, and failed to examine the group-level comparisons during music listening. Here, we combined group-level spatial Fourier ICA with acoustic feature extraction, to enable group comparisons in frequency-specific brain networks of musical feature processing. It was then applied to healthy subjects and subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). The music-induced oscillatory brain patterns were determined by permutation correlation analysis between individual time courses of Fourier-ICA components and musical features. We found that (1) three components, including a beta sensorimotor network, a beta auditory network and an alpha medial visual network, were involved in music processing among most healthy subjects; and that (2) one alpha lateral component located in the left angular gyrus was engaged in music perception in most individuals with MDD. The proposed method allowed the statistical group comparison, and we found that: (1) the alpha lateral component was activated more strongly in healthy subjects than in the MDD individuals, and that (2) the derived frequency-dependent networks of musical feature processing seemed to be altered in MDD participants compared to healthy subjects. The proposed pipeline appears to be valuable for studying disrupted brain oscillations in psychiatric disorders during naturalistic paradigms.},

Deep neural networks have successfully been applied to address time series forecasting problems, which is a very important topic in data mining. They have proved to be an effective solution given their capacity to automatically learn the temporal dependencies present in time series. However, selecting the most convenient type of deep neural network and its parametrization is a complex task that requires considerable expertise. Therefore, there is a need for deeper studies on the suitability of all existing architectures for different forecasting tasks. In this work, we face two main challenges: a comprehensive review of the latest works using deep learning for time series forecasting and an experimental study comparing the performance of the most popular architectures. The comparison involves a thorough analysis of seven types of deep learning models in terms of accuracy and efficiency. We evaluate the rankings and distribution of results obtained with the proposed models under many different architecture configurations and training hyperparameters. The datasets used comprise more than 50,000 time series divided into 12 different forecasting problems. By training more than 38,000 models on these data, we provide the most extensive deep learning study for time series forecasting. Among all studied models, the results show that long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional networks (CNN) are the best alternatives, with LSTMs obtaining the most accurate forecasts. CNNs achieve comparable performance with less variability of results under different parameter configurations, while also being more efficient.},

  abstract     = {In contrast to the previous artificial neural networks (ANNs), spiking neural networks (SNNs) work based on temporal coding approaches. In the proposed SNN, the number of neurons, neuron models, encoding method, and learning algorithm design are described in a correct and pellucid fashion. It is also discussed that optimizing the SNN parameters based on physiology, and maximizing the information they pass leads to a more robust network. In this paper, inspired by the “center-surround” structure of the receptive fields in the retina, and the amount of overlap that they have, a robust SNN is implemented. It is based on the Integrate-and-Fire (IF) neuron model and uses the time-to-first-spike coding to train the network by a newly proposed method. The Iris and MNIST datasets were employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed network whose accuracy, with 60 input neurons, was 96.33% on the Iris dataset. The network was trained in only 45 iterations indicating its reasonable convergence rate. For the MNIST dataset, when the gray level of each pixel was considered as input to the network, 600 input neurons were required, and the accuracy of the network was 90.5%. Next, 14 structural features were used as input. Therefore, the number of input neurons decreased to 210, and accuracy increased up to 95%, meaning that an SNN with fewer input neurons and good skill was implemented. Also, the ABIDE1 dataset is applied to the proposed SNN. Of the 184 data, 79 are used for healthy people and 105 for people with autism. One of the characteristics that can differentiate between these two classes is the entropy of the existing data. Therefore, Shannon entropy is used for feature extraction. Applying these values to the proposed SNN, an accuracy of 84.42% was achieved by only 120 iterations, which is a good result compared to the recent results.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this study is to quantify acrophobia and provide safety advices for high-altitude workers. Considering that acrophobia is a fuzzy quantity that cannot be accurately evaluated by conventional detection methods, we propose a comprehensive solution to quantify acrophobia. Specifically, this study simulates a virtual reality environment called High-altitude Plank Walking Challenge, which provides a safe and controlled experimental environment for subjects. Besides, a method named Granger Causality Convolutional Neural Network (GCCNN) combining convolutional neural network and Granger causality functional brain network is proposed to analyze the subjects’ noninvasive scalp EEG signals. Here, the GCCNN method is used to distinguish the subjects with severe acrophobia, moderate acrophobia, and no acrophobia in a three-class classification task or no acrophobia and acrophobia in a two-class classification task. Compared with the mainstream methods, the GCCNN method achieves better classification performance, with an accuracy of 98.74% for the two-class classification task (no acrophobia versus acrophobia) and of 98.47% for the three-class classification task (no acrophobia versus moderate acrophobia versus severe acrophobia). Consequently, our proposed GCCNN method can provide more accurate quantitative results than the comparative methods, making it to be more competitive in further practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Deception detection is a relevant ability in high stakes situations such as police interrogatories or court trials, where the outcome is highly influenced by the interviewed person behavior. With the use of specific devices, e.g. polygraph or magnetic resonance, the subject is aware of being monitored and can change his behavior, thus compromising the interrogation result. For this reason, video analysis-based methods for automatic deception detection are receiving ever increasing interest. In this paper, a deception detection approach based on RGB videos, leveraging both facial features and stacked generalization ensemble, is proposed. First, a face, which is well-known to present several meaningful cues for deception detection, is identified, aligned, and masked to build video signatures. These signatures are constructed starting from five different descriptors, which allow the system to capture both static and dynamic facial characteristics. Then, video signatures are given as input to four base-level algorithms, which are subsequently fused applying the stacked generalization technique, resulting in a more robust meta-level classifier used to predict deception. By exploiting relevant cues via specific features, the proposed system achieves improved performances on a public dataset of famous court trials, with respect to other state-of-the-art methods based on facial features, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this work, a novel mechanism for separately describing the integrate-and-fire behavior of neurons and the distribution of produced spikes, and a novel variant of the SNP systems, named evolution-communication SNP (ECSNP) systems, is proposed. More precisely, the integrate-and-fire behavior of neurons is achieved by spike-evolution rules, and the distribution of produced spikes is achieved by spike-communication rules. Then, the computational power of ECSNP systems is examined. It is demonstrated that ECSNP systems are Turing universal as number-generating devices. Furthermore, the computational power of ECSNP systems with a restricted form, i.e. the quantity of spikes in each neuron throughout a computation does not exceed some constant, is also investigated, and it is shown that such restricted ECSNP systems can only characterize the family of semilinear number sets. These results manifest that the capacity of neurons for information storage (i.e. the quantity of spikes) has a critical impact on the ECSNP systems to achieve a desired computational power.},

  abstract     = {The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) is a well-known model organism in neuroscience. The relative simplicity of its nervous system, made up of few hundred neurons, shares some essential features with more sophisticated nervous systems, including the human one. If we are able to fully characterize the nervous system of this organism, we will be one step closer to understanding the mechanisms underlying the behavior of living things. Following a recently conducted electrophysiological survey on different C. elegans neurons, this paper aims at modeling the three non-spiking RIM, AIY and AFD neurons (arbitrarily named with three upper case letters by convention). To date, they represent the three possible forms of non-spiking neuronal responses of the C. elegans . To achieve this objective, we propose a conductance-based neuron model adapted to the electrophysiological features of each neuron. These features are based on current biological research and a series of in-silico experiments which use differential evolution to fit the model to experimental data. From the obtained results, we formulate a series of biological hypotheses regarding currents involved in the neuron dynamics. These models reproduce experimental data with a high degree of accuracy while being biologically consistent with state-of-the-art research.},

An important contribution of this work is to consider the geometric processing in the modeling of feed-forward neural networks. Since quaternions are well suited to represent 3D rotations, it is then well justified to extend real-valued neural networks to quaternion-valued neural networks for task of perception and control of robot manipulators. This work presents the quaternion spiking neural networks which are able to control robots, where the examples confirm that these artificial neurons have the capacity to adapt on-line the robot to reach the desired position. Also, we present the quaternionic quantum neural networks for pattern recognition using just one quaternion neuron.

  abstract     = {The deterioration of specific topological network measures that quantify different features of whole-brain functional network organization can be considered a marker for awareness impairment. Such topological measures reflect the functional interactions of multiple brain structures, which support the integration of different sensorimotor information subtending awareness. However, conventional, single-layer, graph theoretical analysis (GTA)-based approaches cannot always reliably differentiate patients with Disorders of Consciousness (DoC). Using multiplex and multilayer network analyses of frequency-specific and area-specific networks, we investigated functional connectivity during resting-state EEG in 17 patients with Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS) and 15 with Minimally Conscious State (MCS). Multiplex and multilayer network metrics indicated the deterioration and heterogeneity of functional networks and, particularly, the frontal-parietal (FP), as the discriminant between patients with MCS and UWS. These data were not appreciable when considering each individual frequency-specific network. The distinctive properties of multiplex/multilayer network metrics and individual frequency-specific network metrics further suggest the value of integrating the networks as opposed to analyzing frequency-specific network metrics one at a time. The hub vulnerability of these regions was positively correlated with the behavioral responsiveness, thus strengthening the clinically-based differential diagnosis. Therefore, it may be beneficial to adopt both multiplex and multilayer network analyses when expanding the conventional GTA-based analyses in the differential diagnosis of patients with DoC. Multiplex analysis differentiated patients at a group level, whereas the multilayer analysis offered complementary information to differentiate patients with DoC individually. Although further studies are necessary to confirm our preliminary findings, these results contribute to the issue of DoC differential diagnosis and may help in guiding patient-tailored management.},

  abstract     = {Optimization Spiking Neural P System (OSNPS) is the first membrane computing model to directly derive an approximate solution of combinatorial problems with a specific reference to the 0/1 knapsack problem. OSNPS is composed of a family of parallel Spiking Neural P Systems (SNPS) that generate candidate solutions of the binary combinatorial problem and a Guider algorithm that adjusts the spiking probabilities of the neurons of the P systems. Although OSNPS is a pioneering structure in membrane computing optimization, its performance is competitive with that of modern and sophisticated metaheuristics for the knapsack problem only in low dimensional cases. In order to overcome the limitations of OSNPS, this paper proposes a novel Dynamic Guider algorithm which employs an adaptive learning and a diversity-based adaptation to control its moving operators. The resulting novel membrane computing model for optimization is here named Adaptive Optimization Spiking Neural P System (AOSNPS). Numerical result shows that the proposed approach is effective to solve the 0/1 knapsack problems and outperforms multiple various algorithms proposed in the literature to solve the same class of problems even for a large number of items (high dimensionality). Furthermore, case studies show that a AOSNPS is effective in fault sections estimation of power systems in different types of fault cases: including a single fault, multiple faults and multiple faults with incomplete and uncertain information in the IEEE 39 bus system and IEEE 118 bus system.},

Considering the length of axons and the information transmission speed on synapses, SN P systems with delay on synapses (SNP-DS systems) are proposed in this work. Unlike the traditional SN P systems, where all the postsynaptic neurons receive spikes at the same instant from their presynaptic neuron, the postsynaptic neurons in SNP-DS systems would receive spikes at different instants, depending on the delay time on the synapses connecting them. It is proved that the SNP-DS systems are universal as number generators. Two small universal SNP-DS systems, with standard or extended rules, are constructed to compute functions, using 56 and 36 neurons, respectively. Moreover, a simulator has been provided, in order to check the correctness of these two SNP-DS systems, thus providing an experimental validation of the universality of the systems designed.},
