  abstract     = {In the medical image-processing field brain tumor segmentation is aquintessential task. Thereby early diagnosis gives us a chance of increasing survival rate. It will be way much complex and time consuming when comes to processing large amount of MRI images manually, so for that we need an automatic way of brain tumor image segmentation process. This paper aims to gives a comparative study of brain tumor segmentation, which are MRI-based. So recent methods of automatic segmentation along with advanced techniques gives us an improved result and can solve issue better than any other methods. Therefore, this paper brings comparative analysis of three models such as Deformable model of Fuzzy C-Mean clustering (DMFCM), Adaptive Cluster with Super Pixel Segmentation (ACSP) and Grey Wolf Optimization based ACSP (GWO_ACSP) and these are tested on CANCER IMAGE ACHRCHIEVE which is a preparation information base containing High Grade and Low-Grade astrocytoma tumors. Here boundaries including Accuracy, Dice coefficient, Jaccard score and MCC are assessed and along these lines produce the outcomes. From this examination the test consequences of Grey Wolf Optimization based ACSP (GWO_ACSP) gives better answer for mind tumor division issue.},

  abstract     = {The modern Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm enables creating small devices that can provide sensor, process, and connect, facilitating sensors, embedded devices, and other “things” ready for understanding the environment. Physical education and physical activity can improve both the physical and mental health of practitioners. However, there are many issues or accidents occurred to the athletes during training and tournament. In addition, lack of awareness during a match or game could lead to injuries and dropping the competition or match. This study proposes an IoT-based Wearable Intelligent Health Monitoring system (IoTW-IHMS) for the physical teaching system and athletes’ health monitoring. This study intends to collect and track data on player rates, body temperature, and response time to stimulation while using compact wearable devices and microprocessors as the main device to relay them wirelessly. Multiple sensors tracked the heart rate, current body temperature, and response time of the athlete. The simulation analysis shows that the proposed IoTW-IHMS method enhances the accuracy (93.6%), response time ratio (95.4%), sensitivity ratio (97.5%), performance ratio (91.3%), and prediction ratio (96.8%) compared to other popular methods.},

Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) is a psychotherapeutic process used for the individual’s emotional, cognitive, and physical integration. To automatically synthesize dance movements according to the music, it needs to solve some computational challenges. This paper proposes the Artificial Intelligence assisted Dance Movement Therapy (AIDMT) to predict an individual’s psychological condition. The complete aim of this paper is to analyze the effects of recreational/general dance and dance movement therapy (DMT) on well-being, anxiety, and depression by a convolution neural network (CNN). The research results support the potential usefulness of DMT as a multi-faceted intervention for enhancing different facets of functioning in adolescence with diminishing cognitive abilities. The absence of advantageous effects for our long-term DMT and exercise intervention effects discover the requirement to preserve persistent activity levels with sufficient duration and intensity. Conclusion — The experimental result suggests that AIDMT achieves the highest classification accuracy of 98.03%.},

In this paper, three interpolation approaches are compared with subjective and objective criterion based on both simulation and clinical cases. Our results have shown an improvement from the original images. As for the comparison with NRMSD and MAD. For the execution time, the L-MAR possesses the shortest time with S-MAR time being the slowest among the interpolation-based methods. For NRMSD and MAD, the digits from small to large are P-MAR, S-MAR, L-MAR and original. This shows that among interpolation-based methods the image corrected by P-MAR approach is the closest to the ideal image, followed by S-MAR correction, L-MAR correction, and the gap between the original image and the ideal image is the largest.},

Traditional methods use hand-crafted features to characterize pedestrians. In this work, we have pro-posed a new hand-crafted feature extraction method that concatenates shape, color and texture features; which is then classified by using Support Vector Machine (SVM). As in recent years, deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become an eminent state of the art in detection challenges, which unlike the manually designed feature extraction mechanism, results in more accuracy. Therefore, we have also proposed a CNN network, a modification of the pre-trained ResNet-18 named as Multi-layer Feature Fused-ResNet (MF2-ResNet). We have used the proposed modification for (1) feature extraction; which is then classified by using Support Vector Machine (SVM); (2) End-to-End feature extraction and classification by the CNN network and (3) MF2-ResNet based Faster-RCNN to include region proposals in the detection pipeline. To evaluate the proposed method, it is compared with existing pre-trained CNNs. The MF2-ResNet based Faster R-CNN is compared with state-of-the-art detection methods.

  abstract     = {Time series change point detection can identify the locations of abrupt points in many dynamic processes. It can help us to find anomaly data in an early stage. At the same time, detecting change points for long, periodic, and multiple input series data has received a lot of attention recently, and is universally applicable in many fields including power, environment, finance, and medicine. However, the performance of classical methods typically scales poorly for such time series. In this paper, we propose CPMAN, a novel prediction-based change point detection approach via multi-stage attention networks. Our model consists of two key modules. First, in the time series prediction module, we employ the multi-stage attention-based networks and integrate the multi-series fusion mechanism. This module can adaptively extract features from the relevant input series and capture the long-term temporal dependencies. Secondly, in the change point detection module, we use the wavelet analysis-based algorithm to detect change points efficiently and identify the change points and outliers. Extensive experiments are conducted on various real-world datasets and synthetic datasets, proving the superiority and effectiveness of CPMAN. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by up to 12.1% on the F1 Score.},

  abstract     = {Topological data analysis is a relatively new branch of machine learning that excels in studying high-dimensional data, and is theoretically known to be robust against noise. Meanwhile, data objects with mixed numeric and categorical attributes are ubiquitous in real-world applications. However, topological methods are usually applied to point cloud data, and to the best of our knowledge there is no available framework for the classification of mixed data using topological methods. In this paper, we propose a novel topological machine learning method for mixed data classification. In the proposed method, we use theory from topological data analysis such as persistent homology, persistence diagrams and Wasserstein distance to study mixed data. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by experiments on a real-world heart disease dataset. Experimental results show that our topological method outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms in the prediction of heart disease.},

This paper presents a framework designed to distill actionable tweets. The framework tackles the diversity, large volume, and noise of tweets for providing users live information for quick responses. To do that, our framework first retrieves a large number of tweets to ensure the diversity. It next removes irrelevant and indirect tweets for reducing the volume, divides informative tweets into predefined classes for quick navigation, and groups tweets in a class into topics to preserve the diversity. Finally, it ranks tweets in each topic to extract important tweets for the user’s quick scan. For ranking, the framework utilizes event extraction to enrich the semantics and reduce the noise of tweets. After that, the framework builds event graphs for ranking to find out important tweets. To validate the efficiency of our framework, we took Twitter as a case study. Experimental results on five disaster datasets show that our framework achieves promising results compared to strong methods in disaster scenarios.},

Consequently, they have trouble to detect the semantic meaning of the data (e.g., formation pattern). To handle this problem, a high-level framework has been recently proposed to the MLL task, in which the high-level features are extracted using the analysis of complex network measures. In this paper, we extend that work by evaluating different combinations of four complex networks measures, namely clustering coefficient, assortativity, average degree and average path length. Experiments conducted over seven real-world data sets showed that the low-level techniques often can have their predictive performance improved after being combined with high-level ones, and also demonstrated that there is no a unique measure that provides the best results, i.e., different problems may ask for different network properties in order to have their high-level patterns efficiently detected.},

Most approaches that aim at unraveling the gene regulation mechanisms in a data-driven way, analyze gene expression datasets to score potential regulatory links between transcription factors and target genes. So far, three major families of approaches have been proposed to score regulatory links. These methods rely respectively on correlation measures, mutual information metrics, and regression algorithms. In this paper we present a new family of data-driven inference methods. This new family, inspired by the regression-based paradigm, relies on the use of classification algorithms. This paper assesses and advocates for the use of this paradigm as a new promising approach to infer gene regulatory networks. Indeed, the development and assessment of five new inference methods based on well-known classification algorithms shows that the classification-based inference family exhibits good results when compared to well-established paradigms.},

The MABWiser library is designed to be user-friendly and supports custom bandit algorithms for specific applications. Our design provides built-in parallelization to speed up training and testing for scalability with special attention given to ensuring the reproducibility of results. The API makes hybrid strategies possible that combine non-parametric policies with parametric ones, an area that is not explored in the literature. As a practical application, we demonstrate using the library in both batch and online simulations for context-free, parametric and non-parametric contextual policies with the well-known MovieLens data set.

  abstract     = {Most pattern mining techniques almost singularly focus on identifying frequent patterns and very less attention has been paid to the generation of rare patterns. However, in several domains, recognizing less frequent but strongly related patterns have greater advantage over the former ones. Identification of compelling and meaningful rare associations among such patterns may proved to be significant for air quality management that has become an indispensable task in today’s world. The rare correlations between air pollutants and other parameters may aid in restricting the air pollution to a manageable level. To this end, efficient and competent rare pattern mining techniques are needed that can generate the complete set of rare patterns, further identifying significant rare association rules among them. Moreover, a notable issue with databases is their continuous update over time due to the addition of new records. The users requirement or behavior may change with the incremental update of databases that makes it difficult to determine a suitable support threshold for the extraction of interesting rare association rules. This paper, presents an efficient rare pattern mining technique to capture the complete set of rare patterns from a real environmental dataset. The proposed approach does not restart the entire mining process upon threshold update and generates the complete set of rare association rules in a single database scan. It can effectively perform incremental mining and also provides flexibility to the user to regulate the value of support threshold for generating the rare patterns. Significant rare association rules representing correlations between air pollutants and other environmental parameters are further extracted from the generated rare patterns to identify the substantial causes of air pollution. Performance analysis shows that the proposed method is more efficient than existing rare pattern mining approaches in providing significant directions to the domain experts for air pollution monitoring.},

A mathematical formulation of DMCHBAP, based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), is proposed and used within the framework of commercial CPLEX 12.3 solver. As the speed of finding high-quality solutions is of crucial importance for an efficient and reliable decision support system in container terminal, two population-based metaheuristic approaches to DMCHBAP are proposed: combined Genetic Algorithm ( c GA) and improvement-based Bee Colony Optimization (BCOi). Both c GA and BCOi are evaluated and compared against each other and against state-of-the-art solution methods for DMCHBAP on five sets of problem instances. The conducted computational experiments and statistical analysis indicate that population-based metaheuristic methods represent promising approaches for DMCHBAP and similar problems in maritime transportation.},

In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of imbalanced learning from a nearest-neighbor (NN) classification perspective, where the minority examples typically belong to the class of interest. Based on simple geometrical ideas, we introduce an algorithm that rescales the distance between a query sample and any positive training example. This leads to a modification of the Voronoi regions and thus of the decision boundaries of the NN classifier. We provide a theoretical justification about this scaling scheme which inherently aims at reducing the False Negative rate while controlling the number of False Positives. We further formally establish a link between the proposed method and cost-sensitive learning. An extensive experimental study is conducted on many public imbalanced datasets showing that our method is very effective with respect to popular Nearest-Neighbor algorithms, comparable to state-of-the-art sampling methods and even yields the best performance when combined with them.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous transfer clustering contributes to improve the performance of target domain by using the co-occurrence data from different domains without any supervision. Existing works usually use a large of complete co-occurrence data to learn the projection functions mapping heterogeneous data to a common latent feature subspace. Given that in the real-world problems, complete and abundant co-occurrence data in the form of homogeneous transfer learning between the soured domain and target domain are hard to achieve, a heterogeneous transfer clustering method for partial co-occurrence data (HTCPC) is proposed here, to perform unsupervised learning to map the partial information obtained from the source domain onto objects in the target domain. Furthermore, to maximize the useful information to improve the clustering performance in target domain, the proposed HTCPC uses the deep matrix decomposition framework to maintain the multi-layer hidden feature representation and retain the complexity of the data hierarchy by adding the approximate orthogonal constraints, which can effectively strengthen the independence and minimal redundancy. From a series of experiments conducted on four datasets [Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP), Devanagari Handwritten Character (DHC), Columbia University Image Library (COIL), and Notting-Hill (NH)], the results show that HTCPC outperforms the peers in the following aspects: our method constructs the hierarchical structure in the multi-layer latent representations and the proposed algorithm can reduce the redundancy and extract more useful knowledge for target domain.},

Tremor, rigidity, depression, anxiety etc. are among the symptoms. Clinical diagnosis of PD is usually based on appearance of motor features. Additionally, different empirical tests were proposed by scholars for early detection of the disease. It is known that people with PD have speech impairments. Therefore, voice tests are used for early detection of the disease. In this study, an automated machine learning system was proposed for high accuracy classification of the speech signals of PD patients. The system includes feature reduction methods and classification algorithms. Feature reductions and classifications were performed for all participants, males, and females separately. Contributions of feature sets to classification accuracy were discussed. Experimental results were evaluated with different performance metrics. The proposed system obtained state of the art results in all categories. We acquired better performances for gender based classifications.},

  abstract     = {Healthcare studies prove that heart disease has increased in recent decades and the growth of patients suffering from heart problems does not stop. In this regard, various data mining techniques have been used by machine learning researchers to support health professionals in the decision-making of this disease. Many of these techniques are based on basic machine learning classifiers, others integrate these classifiers in streaming systems in order to accelerate the execution time. However, some heart situations demand early detection to reduce the chance of having a dangerous illness and the existing machine learning solutions are not appropriate for real-time analysis, because we need to accelerate the algorithms themselves. In this paper, an online algorithm called Enhanced Hoeffding Anytime Tree (EHATT) is proposed to efficiently predict heart disease. EHATT is based on Hoeffding Anytime Tree (HATT), the last version of incremental decision trees. The amelioration that was made by EHATT on HATT, is the change of the node splitting evaluation function with another more suitable for split measures. To examine the performance of EHATT, four metrics are evaluated: classification accuracy, time, memory, and tree size. The experiment results show that EHATT achieves good performance to predict heart disease.},

Each node of the network corresponds to a MOO metaheuristic and interconnections between the nodes represent the flow of subpopulation elements in a feed-forward direction. The proposed method runs in consecutive sessions such that a session starts with the assignment of subpopulations to each of the individual nodes, proceeds with execution of node metaheuristics within their algorithmic framework and ends with feeding the improved subpopulations to the connected forward nodes. The network architecture is dynamic in the sense that nodes change their layers at the end of each session. At the end of each session, elements of the improved subpopulations are fed forward to nodes in subsequent layers which update their own subpopulations using uniform random sampling. The proposed method is evaluated on CEC2009, ZDT, DTLZ, WFG benchmarks and several real-world MOO problems using the experimental framework described for these problem instances. Comparative evaluations against a large set of state-of-the-art algorithms exhibited that the proposed method with its novel dynamic network architecture and subpopulation assignment strategy is promising both in the quality of the extracted Pareto fronts and in leading future research on ensembles of MOO algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Clustering ensemble has been progressively popular in the ongoing years by combining several base clustering methods into a most likely better and increasingly robust one. Nonetheless, fuzzy clustering dependability (durability) has been unnoticed within the majority of the proposed clustering ensemble approach. This makes them weak against low-quality fuzzy base clusters. In spite of a few endeavors made to the clustering methods, it appears that they consider each base-clustering separately without considering its local diversity. In this paper, to compensate for the mentioned weakness a new fuzzy clustering ensemble approach has been proposed using a weighting strategy at fuzzy cluster level. Indeed, each fuzzy cluster has a contribution weight computed based on its reliability (dependability/durability). After computing fuzzy cluster dependability (reliability/durability), dependability based fuzzy cluster-wise weighted matrix (DFCWWM) is computed. As a final point, the final clustering is obtained by applying the FCM traditional clustering algorithm over DFCWWM. The time complexity of the proposed approach is linear in terms of the number of data-points. The proposed approach has been assessed on 15 various standard datasets. The experimental evaluation has indicated that the proposed method has better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.},

Different models have been proposed where options were manually predefined or semi-automatically discovered. However, the automatic discovery of options has become a real challenge for research in hierarchical reinforcement learning and the new proposed approaches are very greedy in learning time or space. Thus we opt for a faster and less consuming approach. In this paper we propose an automatic option discovery method for hierarchical reinforcement learning, that we call FAOD (Fast Automatic Option Discovery). We take inspiration from robot learning methods to categorize the sensorimotor flow during navigation. Here, the agent moves along the walls to discover the rooms’ contour, closed spaces, doors and bottleneck regions to define terminate states for options. The FAOD method is evaluated on different classical maze problems, demonstrating fast and promising results.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, lung disease is a major global problem in the world. Many of the lung diseases are untreatable and reduce the life span of the individual. Initial diagnosis of these diseases can help to completely cure the illness and reduce disease progression. Diagnosis of lung disease is often made based on CT scan images of the lungs. But the diagnosis of lung disease in CT images is a complicated and challenging task. Such a challenge is due to the noise of imaging, the lack of transparency of the image, the intensity of the lighting of some components, and so on. Eliminating these issues makes it easy to diagnose the disease for specialized physicians as well as existing automated diagnostic systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for lung CT image segmentation that solves some of these challenges. Also, correct accurate segmentation of these images can help to automatically detect lung diseases. The correct segmentation means a precise determination of the intensity of each area’s brightness, the exact location of the pixels in each area and the preservation of the original image. We employed a reinforcement-based approach for our image segmentation. The proposed method produces the image without noise, and the image components are split with the best accuracy. To evaluate our approach, we manually generated 200 labelled lung CT images. After that, the proposed method, along with two recently published approaches is evaluated against our generated dataset. This comparative evaluation is conducted in two qualitative and quantitative ways. For the qualitative comparison, we employed the consultation of two ultrasound radiologists for evaluating the results of our approach. We also used a similarity measurement to quantitatively evaluate the performance of our proposed segmentation method. In both evaluation approaches, the proposed algorithm provides better performance compared to the other methods. The proposed method provides an accuracy of more than 90% for lung image segmentation, which shows around 5% increase in the accuracy comparing to the state of the art. The high accuracy of this method is due to its fitness to the application.},

CNN is a class of multilayer perceptrons, but unlike common multilayer perceptrons that it is not usually fully connected networks. It can acquire more general image features and make the image processing computationally manageable through filtering the connections by proximity. In this paper, we utilize the deep features generated by CNNs and the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm for image sequence place recognition. We propose a novel image similarity measurement, which is derived from cosine distance and can better distinguish match and mismatch. Meanwhile, we improve the DTW algorithm to design a local matching method that can reduce time complexity from O ( n 3 ) to O ( n ). To test the proposed method, four datasets (Nordland, Gardens Point, St. Lucia, and UoA datasets) are used as benchmarks; using two traverses in each dataset with one for reference and the other for testing. The results show high precision-recall characteristics of our method in the cases of severe appearance changes. Besides, our method achieves substantial improvements over the methods using the deep feature representations of a single image for recognition, which reflects that the spatiotemporal information contained in the image sequence is significant for the task of visual place recognition. Moreover, the proposed method also shows to outperform the classical sequence-based method SeqSLAM.},

  abstract     = {Managing the container yard operations can be challenging as a result of various uncertainties associated with storing and retrieving containers from the yard. These associated uncertainties occur because the arrival of a truck to pick up the container is random, so the departure time of the container is unknown. The problem investigated in this paper emerges when newly arrived containers of different sizes, types and weights require storage operation in the same yard where other containers have already been stored. This situation becomes more challenging when the time of departure of existing container is not known. This study develops a new Fuzzy Knowledge-Based optimisation system named ‘FKB_GA’ for optimal storage and retrieval of containers in a yard that contains long stay pre-existing containers. The containers’ duration of stay factor is considered along with two other factors such as the similarity (containers with same customer) and the quantity of containers per stack. A new Multi-Layered Genetic Algorithm module is proposed which identifies the optimal fuzzy rules required for each set of fired rules to achieve a minimum number of container re-handlings when selecting a stack. An industrial case study is used to demonstrate the applicability and practicability of the developed system.},

In many cases, people who are living in rural areas need a critical, for their healthy, commuting time to a Medical Center (Hospital). In addition, human physicians have limited capability for offering their services to large number of emergencies or medical cases. Thus, there is a need for the medical technologies to take the advantage of the advanced IT and Engineering for the design and development of Virtual Doctor Diagnoses Systems to facilitate such needs. This paper presents the components needed for the development of such an intelligent system, called e-IATROS, and its Virtual Doctor (VDr) dialogue systems. The e-IATROS system has the potential to simultaneously talk to a large number of human patients without humans to detect that they are talking to a computer based system. This is a necessary feature for convincing human patients to trust the machine and express their issues. To do so, the e-IATROS has to use the voice of the actual human doctor for each human patient. Each VDr dialogue system mainly interacts with a patient extracting non-measurable and measurable symptoms to contribute to the generation of possible prognosis. The e-IATROS system is presented with its capabilities recognizing the patient emotion and learning through the process.},

By using the threshold function in locally competitive algorithm (LCA), subgradient at a nondifferential point is equivalently replaced with the difference of the neuronal state and its mapping. The efficacy of the proposed approach is substantiated by reconstructing three compressed images.},

  abstract     = {A method of classifying network security data based on multi-featured extraction is proposed to address instability of a nonlinear time series in a network security threat. Cybersecurity information is divided in line with the principle of acquiring multiple attributes. On this basis, an adaptive adaptation estimation technology is optimized in analogue. With the proposed method, a cybersecurity information classification system is constructed according to the phase interval reconstruction principle so that a dynamic and autonomous adaptation estimation of the cybersecurity threat can be completed to ensure the feasibility of cybersecurity information classification. The experimental result proves that the cybersecurity information classification technology based on multi-attribute extraction can effectively guide chaos into adjacent orbits and reasonably control the training scale. Moreover, the accuracy of the estimation is guaranteed and the cybersecurity threat is estimated because of its high-speed convergence and strong proximity. Therefore, the proposed classification technology can assist professionals and backstage managers in guaranteeing security by facilitating receipt of information in a timely manner.},

  abstract     = {As one of the biometric information based authentication technologies, finger vein recognition has received increasing attention due to its safety and convenience. However, it is still a challenging task to design an efficient and robust finger vein recognition system because of the low quality of the finger vein images, lack of sufficient number of training samples with image-level annotated information and no pixel-level finger vein texture labels in the public available finger vein databases. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN-based finger vein recognition approach with bias field correction, spatial attention mechanism and a multistage transfer learning strategy to cope with the difficulties mentioned above. In the proposed method, the bias field correction module is to remove the unbalanced bias field of the original images by using a two-dimensional polynomial fitting algorithm, the spatial attention module is to enhance the informative vein texture regions while suppressing the other less informative regions, and the multistage transfer learning strategy is to solve the problem caused by insufficient training for CNN-based model due to lack of labeled training samples in the public finger vein databases. Moreover, several measures, including a label smoothing scheme and data augmentation, are exploited to improve the performance of the proposed method. Extensive experiments have been conducted in the work on three public databases, and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The maximum clique problem (MCP) is a famous NP-hard problem, which is difficult for the exact algorithm to solve when the dimension is large. In this paper, we applied the pointer network based method to solve this problem. First, we illustrated how to train the network with supervised learning strategy to obtain the solution to the maximum clique problem. We then further trained the pointer network with reinforcement learning strategy to obtain the vertices from the graph. For both strategies, backtracking algorithm is used to reselect the vertices. From the experimental results, we can see that both supervised learning and reinforcement learning work well. Promising results can be obtained up to 100 dimensions. This illustrates that the deep neural network based algorithms have great potentials for solving the maximum clique problem effectively and efficiently.},

Each local convex cost function in the network is accessed only by each unit. To be able to reduce the amount of computation and get the desired result in an accelerated way, we put forward a fresh accelerated decentralized event-triggered algorithm, named as A-DETA, for the optimization problem. A-DETA combines gradient tracking and two momentum accelerated terms, adopts nonuniform step-sizes and emphasizes that each unit interacts with neighboring units independently only at the sampling time triggered by the event. On the premise of assuming the smoothness and strong convexity of the cost function, it is proved that A-DETA can obtain the exact optimal solution linearly in the event of sufficiently small positive step-size and momentum coefficient. Moreover, an explicit linear convergence speed is definitely shown. Finally, extensive simulation example validates the usability of A-DETA.},

In daily consumption, they are hard to perform the transactions solely. They need to be assisted by other people in daily life, especially in purchasing, since they cannot recognize the different products with similar shapes and sizes. Also, in processing payment, visually impaired people are hard to differentiate the denominations (values) of banknotes. And many derived problems, such as cheating and providing the improper products, are being occurred. In this paper, an intelligent recognition system has been developed for visually impaired people in Hong Kong. The application system can help the users recognize canned foods and differentiate the nominal values of the banknotes so as to complete the monetary transactions efficiently and effectively. The application can be installed in smartphones with voice and vibration. By applying neural networks with assistive technology, the accuracies of recognizing banknotes and canned food are over 95% and 75%, respectively.},

Currently, there is short of real-time algorithms for solving such problems. Therefore, in this paper, a continuous-time neurodynamic approach is proposed for solving a class of fuzzy chance-constrained optimization problems. Firstly, an equivalent deterministic problem with inequality constraint is discussed, and then a continuous-time neurodynamic approach is proposed. Secondly, a sufficient and necessary optimality condition of the considered optimization problem is obtained. Thirdly, the boundedness, global existence and Lyapunov stability of the state solution to the proposed approach are proved. Moreover, the convergence to the optimal solution of considered problem is studied. Finally, several experiments are provided to show the performance of proposed approach.},
