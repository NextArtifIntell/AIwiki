  abstract     = {This paper describes a deep learning-based method for long-term video interpolation that generates intermediate frames between two music performance videos of a person playing a specific instrument. Recent advances in deep learning techniques have successfully generated realistic images with high-fidelity and high-resolution in short-term video interpolation. However, there is still room for improvement in long-term video interpolation due to lack of resolution and temporal consistency of the generated video. Particularly in music performance videos, the music and human performance motion need to be synchronized. We solved these problems by using human poses and music features essential for music performance in long-term video interpolation. By closely matching human poses with music and videos, it is possible to generate intermediate frames that synchronize with the music. Specifically, we obtain the human poses of the last frame of the first video and the first frame of the second video in the performance videos to be interpolated as key poses. Then, our encoder–decoder network estimates the human poses in the intermediate frames from the obtained key poses, with the music features as the condition. In order to construct an end-to-end network, we utilize a differentiable network that transforms the estimated human poses in vector form into the human pose in image form, such as human stick figures. Finally, a video-to-video synthesis network uses the stick figures to generate intermediate frames between two music performance videos. We found that the generated performance videos were of higher quality than the baseline method through quantitative experiments.},

  abstract     = {Building good 3D maps is a challenging and expensive task, which requires high-quality sensors and careful, time-consuming scanning. We seek to reduce the cost of building good reconstructions by correcting views of existing low-quality ones in a post-hoc fashion using learnt priors over surfaces and appearance. We train a convolutional neural network model to predict the difference in inverse-depth from varying viewpoints of two meshes — one of low-quality that we wish to correct, and one of high-quality that we use as a reference. Our full model runs at 11.3 Hz when aggregating four input views. In contrast to previous work, we pay attention to the problem of excessive smoothing in corrected meshes. We address this with a suitable network architecture, and introduce a loss-weighting mechanism that emphasizes edges in the prediction. Furthermore, smooth predictions result in geometrical inconsistencies. To deal with this issue, we present a loss function which penalizes re-projection differences that are not due to occlusions. Future applications of this work will incorporate semantic scene understanding in a multi-task learning setting. We explore the efficacy of the proposed system in terms of gross error correction and generalization capability by showing its performance in practice on a subset of the Kitti Odometry dataset, complete with a component-wise ablation study. We evaluate correctness and completeness measures of surface reconstruction across viewpoints and show that the proposed system is introspective in regions lacking sufficient high-quality supervision — indeed, models trained with geometric consistency loss create a lot more surface in areas that were not supervised, in one case filling in 67.97% or 8010 m 2 of an unlabeled input region. Finally, we assess the practical applicability of our method at large-scale by experiments over the full scope of the Kitti Odometry dataset. Broadly, as a measure of effectiveness, our model reduces gross errors by 45.3–77.5%, up to five times more than previous work. We also assess the practical applicability of our method to 3D reconstruction at large scales and find that compared to the baseline our model shows better stability in correctness when improving completeness of surfaces, and is effective in reducing median total error by up to 21.8 cm.},

However, extracting value from this data is challenging, especially for tasks that involve human images, such as face recognition and person re-identification. Annotation of this kind of data is a challenging and expensive task. In this work, we propose a domain adaptation workflow to allow CNNs that were trained in one domain to be applied to another domain without the need for annotated target data. Our method uses AlignedReID++ as the baseline, trained using a Triplet loss with batch hard. Domain adaptation is done in an unsupervised manner by clustering unlabeled data to generate pseudo-labels in the target domain. Our results show that domain adaptation really improves the performance of the CNN when applied in the target domain.},

  abstract     = {Event cameras are biologically-inspired sensors that gather the temporal evolution of the scene. They capture pixel-wise brightness variations and output a corresponding stream of asynchronous events. Despite having multiple advantages with respect to conventional cameras, their use is limited due to the scarce compatibility of asynchronous event streams with traditional data processing and vision algorithms. In this regard, we present a framework that synthesizes RGB frames from the output stream of an event camera and an initial or a periodic set of color key-frames. The deep learning-based frame synthesis framework consists of an adversarial image-to-image architecture and a recurrent module. Two public event-based datasets, DDD 17 and MVSEC , are used to obtain qualitative and quantitative per-pixel and perceptual results. In addition, we converted into event frames two additional well-known datasets, namely Kitti and Cityscapes , in order to present semantic results, in terms of object detection and semantic segmentation accuracy. Extensive experimental evaluation confirms the quality and the capability of the proposed approach of synthesizing frame sequences from color key-frames and sequences of intermediate events.},

  abstract     = {Gatherings of thousands to millions of people frequently occur for an enormous variety of educational, social, sporting, and political events, and automated counting of these high-density crowds is useful for safety, management, and measuring significance of an event. In this work, we show that the regularly accepted labeling scheme of crowd density maps for training deep neural networks may not be the most effective one. We propose an alternative inverse k-nearest neighbor (i k NN) map mechanism that, even when used directly in existing state-of-the-art network structures, shows superior performance. We also provide new network architecture mechanisms that we demonstrate in our own MUD-i k NN network architecture, which uses multi-scale drop-in replacement upsampling via transposed convolutions to take full advantage of the provided i k NN labeling. This upsampling combined with the i k NN maps further improves crowd counting accuracy. We further analyze several variations of the i k NN labeling mechanism, which apply transformations on the k NN measure before generating the map, in order to consider the impact of camera perspective views, image resolutions, and the changing rates of the mapping functions. To alleviate the effects of crowd density changes in each image, we also introduce an attenuation mechanism in the i k NN mapping. Experimentally, we show that inverse square root k NN map variation (iR k NN) provides the best performance. Discussions are provided on computational complexity, label resolutions, the gains in mapping and upsampling, and details of critical cases such as various crowd counts, uneven crowd densities, and crowd occlusions.},

The paired memory test was selected as a subtask, and data on driving trajectory, speed, and steering angle were collected and analyzed under three task conditions (baseline, easy task, and difficult task). The results showed that the newly added indicators such as lane offset times, initial lane-changing distance, and correct lane-changing ratio could reflect the new driving characteristics from the aspects of the times of lateral deviation over threshold events, driver response, error proportion, etc. Subjects with different driving states were grouped into the lane-keeping indicator and lane-changing indicator. By using the C4.5 decision tree, classification accuracies of 85.2% and 91.3% were achieved, respectively, which indicated a high accuracy rate of task state discrimination.

To tackle LSMOPs, we first design a new reference points selection strategy to enhance the diversity of algorithms and avoid the algorithm falling into local minima. The strategy selects not only a part of nondominated solutions with the largest crowding distance, but also a part of relatively uniformly distributed solutions as the reference points. In this way, much better diversity and convergence can be obtained. Second, we propose a direction-guided offspring generation strategy, where a type of potential directions is designed to generate the promising solutions which can balance the convergence and diversity of the obtained solutions and improve the effectiveness of the algorithm significantly. Based on the two proposed strategies, we propose a new effective algorithm for LSMOPs. Numerical experiments are executed on two widely used large-scale multi-objective benchmark problem sets with 200, 500 and 1000 decision variables and a comparison with five state-of-the-art algorithms is made. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm is effective and can obtain significantly better solutions than the compared algorithms.},

In many cases, these mobile devices cannot conveniently connect to the Internet, for various reasons. To overcome this obstacle, one solution is to let the mobile devices cooperate with each other through a D2D-enabled network, forming a mobile community that, as a whole, may be able to autonomously execute the tasks requested by its members. To maximize the overall benefits of mobile communities, this paper proposes a novel task allocation approach, EDTG (Energy-aware and Deadline-constrained Task allocation using Game theory). In mobile communities, energy consumption is responsible for the largest part of the cost. Energy management can lead to performance degradation and even be perceived as a bottleneck, while load balancing between devices can improve service performance and resource utilization to the largest extent. EDTG has considered both the inevitable performance constraints at each device and a method based on the connectivity of graph theory, in order to narrow down the search scope of optimal target mobile devices where requested tasks can be executed. The “Bargaining Game” method is designed and exploited to obtain the final task allocation solution. Final experimental results demonstrate that compared to existing approaches, EDTG ensures high-performance task execution and reaches the goal of maximizing the overall benefits to some extent, by achieving better energy savings and exploiting load balancing between devices.},

  abstract     = {In the intelligently processing of the tongue image, one of the most important tasks is to accurately segment the tongue body from a whole tongue image, and the good quality of tongue body edge processing is of great significance for the relevant tongue feature extraction. To improve the performance of the segmentation model for tongue images, we propose an efficient tongue segmentation model based on U-Net. Three important studies are launched, including optimizing the model’s main network, innovating a new network to specially handle tongue edge cutting and proposing a weighted binary cross-entropy loss function. The purpose of optimizing the tongue image main segmentation network is to make the model recognize the foreground and background features for the tongue image as well as possible. A novel tongue edge segmentation network is used to focus on handling the tongue edge because the edge of the tongue contains a number of important information. Furthermore, the advantageous loss function proposed is to be adopted to enhance the pixel supervision corresponding to tongue images. Moreover, thanks to a lack of tongue image resources on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), some special measures are adopted to augment training samples. Various comparing experiments on two datasets were conducted to verify the performance of the segmentation model. The experimental results indicate that the loss rate of our model converges faster than the others. It is proved that our model has better stability and robustness of segmentation for tongue image from poor environment. The experimental results also indicate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in aspects of the two most important tongue image segmentation indexes: IoU and Dice. Moreover, experimental results on augmentation samples demonstrate our model have better performances.},

Their application on land-cover image segmentation has attracted significant attention during recent years. With the help of satellites, scientists and researchers can collect and store high-resolution image data that can be further be processed, segmented, and classified. However, these research results have not yet been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the effect of variant land-cover segmentation processes. In this paper, we present a novel model that augments segmentation using smaller networks to segment individual classes. The combined network is trained on the same data but with the masks, combined and trained using categorical cross entropy. Experimental results show that the proposed method produces the highest mean IoU (Intersection of Union) as compared against several existing state-of-the-art models on the DeepGlobe dataset.},

  abstract     = {Text-guided image editing (TIE) seeks to manipulate images by the guidance of language. However, the existing TIE methods always overlook the target-irrelevant pixels and the editing may make the background discolored, distorted, or partially disappear. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel TIE method named FocusGAN, which edits the text-relevant pixels precisely as well as keeps the background invariant. Specifically, we build a network of two stages. In each stage, we first construct a channel-wise subject focusing attention to make the generator focus on the sub-region that best matches each word. Then, the word-level discriminator provides fine-grained feedback by correlating words with image areas, so that the generator can manipulate specific visual attributes without affecting the background. Last, we propose a background-keeping cyclic loss to further improve the invariance of the background and to encourage the edit of the subject that matches the given text. Experiments on CUB and Oxford datasets demonstrate that our approach can effectively keep the background invariant in manipulating images using natural language descriptions.},

A two-factor experimental design was used to collect data from Generation Z consumers. Four experimental combination scenarios were designed based on consumer attribute benefits (hedonic or utilitarian) and message direction (positive or negative messages). A total of 160 valid samples were obtained, and the influence of variable-final purchase intention was analyzed. The results showed that the combination of product attributes and message direction has a significant impact on purchase intention and that hedonic products should be recommended to process-benefit consumers through positive messages. However, chatbots should choose utilitarian products and negative messages to effectively improve consumers’ purchase intention and willingness. In practical application, by finding out the best correspondence method of message transmission and providing the AI chatbot with a reference for the logical construction of content transmission, the communication efficiency between merchants and consumers can be enhanced, and the scientific and technological service capability of merchants can be improved.},

ITS (Intelligent Transportation System) can record the state of traffic and predict the future traffic state, then reasonably optimize the travel scheme, so as to achieve the purpose of alleviating traffic congestion. Meanwhile, traffic flow prediction can provide data support for ITS, so many researchers have done a lot of research on traffic flow prediction. Many researchers take the traffic network as an undirected graph, and use the GCN (Graph Convolution Network) model to study the traffic flow prediction, and have achieved good prediction results. However, the traffic network is directed, and the traffic network is regarded as an undirected graph, which loses the direction information of the road network. Therefore, this inspires us to propose a graph convolution operator DGCN (Directed GCN), which can make full use of the in degree and out degree information of each station in the traffic network. The experimental results show that the graph convolution neural network based on this operator has better prediction accuracy than the state-of-the-art models.},

Specially, the anchor generator is not fixed but learned from the hand-designed anchors, which means that our anchor generator is able to work well in various scenes. In the inference time, the weights of anchor generator are estimated by a simple network where the input is some hand-designed anchor. In addition, in order to make the difference between the number of positive and negative samples smaller, we use an adaptive IOU threshold related to the object size to solve this problem. At the same time, we proved that our proposed method is effective and conducted a lot of experiments on the COCO dataset. Experimental results show that after replacing the anchor generation method in the previous object detectors (such as SSD, mask RCNN, and Retinanet) with our proposed method, the detection performance of the model has been greatly improved compared to before the replacement, which proves our method is effective.},

To address these problems, this paper increases the receptive field, conducts multi-scale fusion and changes the weight of different sensitive channels, so as to improve the feature discrimination and maintain or restore spatial detail information. Furthermore, the deep neural network FCN is used to build the base model of semantic segmentation.

There are two challenges to improve CS-MRI methods, i.e. designing an under-sampling algorithm to achieve optimal sampling, as well as designing fast and small deep neural networks to obtain reconstructed MR images with superior quality. To improve the reconstruction quality of MR images, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture for CS-MRI named MRCSNet. The MRCSNet consists of three sub-networks, a compressive sensing sampling sub-network, an initial reconstruction sub-network, and a refined reconstruction sub-network. Experimental results demonstrate that MRCSNet generates high-quality reconstructed MR images at various under-sampling ratios, and also meets the requirements of real-time CS-MRI applications. Compared to state-of-the-art CS-MRI approaches, MRCSNet offers a significant improvement in reconstruction accuracies, such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM). Besides, it reduces the reconstruction error evaluated by the Normalized Root-Mean-Square Error (NRMSE). The source codes are available at https://github.com/TaihuLight/MRCSNet .},

  abstract     = {Similarity/distance measures play a key role in many machine learning, pattern recognition, and data mining algorithms, which leads to the emergence of the metric learning field. Many metric learning algorithms learn a global distance function from data that satisfies the constraints of the problem. However, in many real-world datasets, where the discrimination power of features varies in the different regions of input space, a global metric is often unable to capture the complexity of the task. To address this challenge, local metric learning methods are proposed which learn multiple metrics across the different regions of the input space. Some advantages of these methods include high flexibility and learning a nonlinear mapping, but they typically achieve at the expense of higher time requirements and overfitting problems. To overcome these challenges, this research presents an online multiple metric learning framework. Each metric in the proposed framework is composed of a global and a local component learned simultaneously. Adding a global component to a local metric efficiently reduces the problem of overfitting. The proposed framework is also scalable with both sample size and the dimension of input data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first local online similarity/distance learning framework based on Passive/Aggressive (PA). In addition, for scalability with the dimension of input data, Dual Random Projection (DRP) is extended for local online learning in the present work. It enables our methods to run efficiently on high-dimensional datasets while maintaining their predictive performance. The proposed framework provides a straightforward local extension to any global online similarity/distance learning algorithm based on PA. Experimental results on some challenging datasets from machine vision community confirm that the extended methods considerably enhance the performance of the related global ones without increasing the time complexity.},

In this manuscript, a semi-supervised FE method, locality preserving projection in the probabilistic framework (LPPPF), to find a sufficient number of reliable and unmixed unlabeled samples from all classes and constructing an optimal projection matrix is proposed. The LPPPF has two main steps. In the first step, a number of reliable unlabeled samples are selected based on the training samples, spectral features, and spatial information in the probabilistic framework. In this way, the spectral and spatial probability distribution function is calculated for each unlabeled sample. Therefore, the spectral features and spatial information are integrated together with a joint probability distribution function. Finally, a sufficient number of unlabeled samples with the highest joint probability distribution are selected. In the second step, the selected unlabeled samples are applied to construct the transformation matrix based on the spectral and spatial information of the unlabeled samples. The adjacency graph is improved by using new weights based on spectral and spatial information. This method is evaluated on three data sets: Indian Pines, Pavia University, and Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and compared with some recent and well-known supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised FE methods. Various experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the LPPPF in comparison with the other FE methods. LPPPF has also considerable performance with limited training samples.},

In this system, an improved face detection method is used to detect the driver’s face from the image obtained by a charge coupled device (CCD) camera. Then, the feature points of the eyes and mouth are located by an ensemble of regression trees. Next, fatigue characteristic parameters are calculated by the improved percentage of eyelid closure over the pupil over time algorithm. Finally, the state of drivers is evaluated by using a fuzzy neural network. The system can effectively monitor and remind the state of drivers so as to significantly avoid or decrease the occurrence of traffic accidents.

  abstract     = {A multi-feature broad learning system (MFBLS) is proposed to improve the image classification performance of broad learning system (BLS) and its variants. The model is characterized by two major characteristics: multi-feature extraction method and parallel structure. Multi-feature extraction method is utilized to improve the feature-learning ability of BLS. The method extracts four features of the input image, namely convolutional feature, K-means feature, HOG feature and color feature. Besides, a parallel architecture that is suitable for multi-feature extraction is proposed for MFBLS. There are four feature blocks and one fusion block in this structure. The extracted features are used directly as the feature nodes in the feature block. In addition, a “stacking with ridge regression” strategy is applied to the fusion block to get the final output of MFBLS. Experimental results show that MFBLS achieves the accuracies of 92.25%, 81.03%, and 54.66% on SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, respectively, which outperforms BLS and its variants. Besides, it is even superior to the deep network, convolutional deep belief network, in both accuracy and training time on CIFAR-10.

  abstract     = {In order to analyze the feasibility of integrating Sunan music into children’s music teaching through research, a knowledge-based system for children’s music teaching strategies based on case-based reasoning is proposed. The system can collect sufficient data and information, the exact orientation of piano learning, and the exact choice of teaching modes by questionnaires. Research data show that the vast majority of children like music teaching, and they like 76% more than they do not like, and more parents who express an indifferent attitude to music are 84% more than those who feel important. This experimental study shows that most teachers hold a positive attitude toward the development and use of folk music education resources in kindergartens, and parents do not have enough knowledge about folk music. The infiltration of excellent local culture in children’s music activities can improve students’ cultural literacy, let the new generation understand the tradition and the classics, and let children understand the local culture of southern Jiangsu and inherit the excellent culture of the Chinese nation through the understanding, feeling, and understanding of the local culture of southern Jiangsu. This is the new idea of local cultural heritage in southern Jiangsu and also the responsibility of kindergarten education.},

(1) Based on the DVR technology, this paper presented some theoretical research on MVIS, including the classification of virtual entities, communication pattern of entities, and the behavioral consistency research. Furthermore, a Multiplayer Earliest Deadline First (MEDF) program was proposed in order to guarantee the consistency of entities. (2) A prototype algorithm experiment system, called Multiplayer Graph-algorithm Intelligent System (MGIS), was designed. MGIS not onlyefficiently solves many problems in traditional computer algorithm teaching, such as high-abstraction, difficulty to understand, and lack of interaction mechanism; but also extends the application of DVR to cultural tourism, because MGIS is developed on the 3D scene of Lushan Mountain, which is one of the notable tourist attractions in China, and was included in the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1996. What i’s more, MGIS illustrates the ability of expression, applicability and generality of the theoretical research about MVIS.},

  abstract     = {Various UNet architecture-based image change detection algorithms promote the development of image change detection, but there are still some defects. First, under the encoder–decoder framework, the low-level features are extracted many times in multiple dimensions, which generates redundant information; second, the relationship between each feature layer is not modeled so sufficiently that it cannot produce the optimal feature differentiation representation. This paper proposes a remote image change detection algorithm based on the multi-feature self-attention fusion mechanism UNet network, abbreviated as MFSAF UNet (multi-feature self-attention fusion UNet). We attempt to add multi-feature self-attention mechanism between the encoder and decoder of UNet to obtain richer context dependence and overcome the two above-mentioned restrictions. Since the capacity of convolution-based UNet network is directly proportional to network depth, and a deeper convolutional network means more training parameters, so the convolution of each layer of UNet is replaced as a separated convolution, which makes the entire network to be lighter and the model’s execution efficiency is slightly better than the traditional convolution operation. In addition to these, another innovation point of this paper is using preference to control loss function and meet the demands for different accuracies and recall rates. The simulation test results verify the validity and robustness of this approach.},

  abstract     = {Exploration algorithms based on the Boustrophedon path seldom consider the impacts of a robot turning at corners on the exploration time. This paper proposes the Forecast-Island and Bidding A*-Euclidean Selecting Boustrophedon Coordination (FIBA*ESBC) algorithm to calculate the turning time at corners in the overall exploration time and introduces a method to estimate the walking time in the Boustrophedon paths in order to determine the directions for path execution. Typically, in bidding-based exploration tasks, the cost is the Euclidean distance between the current position of the robot and the target point. When there is an obstacle between two points, the cost is set to infinity. Therefore, the selected target point is sometimes not optimal. The FIBA*ESBC algorithm is based on the exploration cost of a combination of the Euclidean distance and A* algorithm walking path, which can effectively solve this problem. Because the bidding is based on a greedy algorithm, the robot has a small unexplored island in the later exploration stage; therefore, full exploration is not possible or requires a long time with several repeated paths. The FIBA*ESBC algorithm prioritizes the exploration and estimation of hidden and existing unexplored islands. It can realize complete exploration and decrease the exploration time. Through simulation experiments conducted using Gazebo and RViz, the feasibility of the FIBA*ESBC algorithm is verified. Moreover, a simulation experiment is conducted in MATLAB for comparison with other algorithms. The analysis of the experimental data shows that the proposed algorithm has a relatively short exploration time.},

  abstract     = {Anesthesiology aims to make anesthesia safer and increase the precision of prognoses. Correct assessment of the anesthesia depth is crucial to its safety. At present, intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is the primary mode of anesthesia depth monitoring and judgment. However, most clinical anesthesiologists rely on commercial anesthesia depth monitors to judge anesthesia depth, such as bispectral index (BIS) and patient state index (PSI). This may lack an understanding of associated changes in brain wave quantization. Therefore, this study conducts quantitative analyses of EEG signals during anesthesia induction. EEG signals are processed within specific time windows and extracted brainpower density spectrum arrays with different frequency bands, brain electrical signal spectra, source frequencies and other key indicators. Analysis and comparison of these indicators clarifies patterns of variation in EEG signals during early anesthesia induction. The spectral edge frequencies (SEFs) of EEG signals within different time windows can be modeled accurately, from which the specific time points of EEG signal changes are derived. Furthermore, the relationship between patient age and the effect of anesthetic drugs is preliminarily investigated by analyzing the SEF variations of different age groups. This study quantifies changes in the EEG signals of patients at the initial stage of anesthesia induction and drug-related effects are observed, which opens a way for further exploration of EEG changes in patients under general anesthesia.},

Lately, a major chunk of the World population has been infected with serious respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Early recognition of lung health abnormalities can facilitate early intervention, and decrease the mortality rate of the infected population. Research has shown that it is possible to automatically monitor lung health abnormalities through respiratory sounds. In this paper, we propose an approach that employs filter bank energy-based features and Random Forests to classify lung problem types from respiratory sounds. The adventitious sounds, crackles and wheezes appear distinct to the human ear. Moreover, different sounds are characterized by different frequency ranges that are dominant. The proposed approach attempts to distinguish the adventitious sounds (crackles and wheezes) by modeling the human auditory perception of these sounds. Specifically, we propose a respiratory sounds representation technique capable of modeling the dominant frequency range present in such sounds. On a publicly available dataset (ICBHI) of size 6898 cycles spanning over 5 h, our results can be compared with the state-of-the-art results, in distinguishing two different types of adventitious sounds: crackles and wheezes.},

This research work has optimized the facial features by employing the improved quantum-inspired gravitation search algorithm (IQI-GSA). The improvement to the quantum-inspired gravitational search algorithm (QIGSA) is conducted to handle the local optima trapping. The QIGSA is the amalgamation of the quantum computing and gravitational search algorithm that owns the overall strong global search ability to handle the optimization problems in comparison with the gravitational search algorithm. In spite of global searching ability, the QIGSA can be trapped in local optima in the later iterations. This work has adapted the IQI-GSA approach to handle the local optima, stochastic characteristics and maintaining balance among the exploration and exploitation. The IQI-GSA is utilized for the optimized features selection from the set of extracted features using the LGBP (a hybrid approach of local binary patterns with the Gabor filter) method. The system performance is analyzed for the application of automated facial expressions recognition with the classification technique of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). The extensive experimentation evaluation is conducted on the benchmark datasets of Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE), Radboud Faces Database (RaFD) and Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF). To determine the effectiveness of the proposed facial expression recognition system, the results are also evaluated for the feature optimization with GSA and QIGSA.

With today’s popularity of mobile phones with portrait mode, accurate defocus blur detection has received more and more attention. There are many challenges that we currently confront, such as blur boundaries of defocus regions, interference of messy backgrounds and identification of large flat regions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new deep neural network with both global and local pathways for defocus blur detection. In global pathway, we locate the objects on focus by semantical search. In local pathway, we refine the predicted blur regions via multi-scale supervisions. In addition, the refined results in local pathway are fused with searching results in global pathway by a simple concatenation operation. The structure of our new network is developed in a feasible way and its function appears to be quite effective and efficient, which is suitable for the deployment on mobile devices. It takes about 0.2 s per image on a regular personal laptop. Experiments on both CUHK dataset and our newly proposed Defocus400 dataset show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning is a popular topic among machine learning researchers nowadays, with great strides being made in recent years to develop robust artificial neural networks for faster convergence to a reasonable accuracy. Network architecture and hyperparameters of the model are fundamental aspects of model convergence. One such important parameter is the initial values of weights, also known as weight initialization. In this paper, we perform two research tasks concerned with the weights of neural networks. First, we develop three novel weight initialization algorithms inspired by the neuroscientific construction of the mammalian brains and then test them on benchmark datasets against other algorithms to compare and assess their performance. We call these algorithms the lognormal weight initialization, modified lognormal weight initialization, and skewed weight initialization. We observe from our results that these initialization algorithms provide state-of-the-art results on all of the benchmark datasets. Second, we analyze the influence of training an artificial neural network on its weight distribution by measuring the correlation between the quantitative metrics of skewness and kurtosis against the model accuracy using linear regression for different weight initializations. Results indicate a positive correlation between network accuracy and skewness of the weight distribution but no affirmative relation between accuracy and kurtosis. This analysis provides further insight into understanding the inner mechanism of neural network training using the shape of weight distribution. Overall, the works in this paper are the first of their kind in incorporating neuroscientific knowledge into the domain of artificial neural network weights.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous improvement and development of cameras network, surveillance video has become the data source of the column stream, which greatly promotes the development of cross-camera person re-identification (Re-ID). However, supervised learning requires a lot of effort to manually label cross-cameras pairwise training data, which is lack of scalability and practical in actual video surveillance because there is a lack of well-labeled pairs of positive and negative samples under each camera. For addressing these negative effects, we set judgment conditions by using the association ranking method to self-discover positive and negative track-lets pairs of anchors with none of the pairwise ID labels, thereby defining a triplet loss. In order to optimize association loss for learning effective discriminative feature, the triplet loss adds adaptive weights according to the degree of easy-hard samples to generate an Adaptive Weighted Conditional Triplet Loss. Besides, for increasing the accuracy of self-discovering cross-camera anchors independently, which means successfully mine mutually best-matched track-lets and merge them under cross-camera, we use the top-rank from the intra-camera ranking list as a self-matched query sample which can double verify the matched-degree between top-rank. And eventually, we establish a new Association Loss and Self-Discovery Learning (ALSL) model with a complete end-to-end manner. We use three standard datasets, PRID2011, iLIDS-VID and MARS, to train the model and the experimental results prove that ALSL rank-1 is better than some superior video-based unsupervised person Re-ID methods.},

  abstract     = {Human–computer interaction systems have been developed in large numbers and quickly applied to sports. Badminton is the best sport for applying robotics because it requires quick recognition and fast movement. For the development of badminton recognition and tracking systems, it is important to accurately identify badminton, venues, and opponents. In this paper, we designed and developed a badminton recognition and tracking system using two 2 000 000-pixel high-speed cameras. The badminton tracking system has a transmission speed of 250 fps and the maximum speed of the badminton resonator is 300 km/h. The system uses the camera link interface Camera Link to capture images of high-speed cameras and process all captured images in real time using different regions of interest settings. In order to improve accuracy, we propose a new method for judging the center point of badminton. We have proposed a detector that detects the four corner points of the field by using the contour information of the badminton court when the approximate position of the badminton court is known. We set the sensing area according to the approximate position of the badminton court and use the histogram in the sensing area to select the point closest to the contour. Specify the intersection of the line as the corner point of the badminton court. The proposed angle detector has a high detection rate. It is more than 10 times more accurate than traditional detectors. The moving badminton is detected by an elliptical detector. We propose a method to find the center of the correct ellipse from the four candidates by selecting the four candidate contours of the ellipse. Compared to conventional circular detectors and points on three-dimensional coordinates, the proposed elliptical detector reduces the error by about 3 mm.},

The time information of the node can be encoded at the Mac layer and then sent and received in the form of pulse waves. During the exchange of time information between a pair of nodes, one node will adjust its own clock information according to certain rules after receiving the pulse time signal of the other node. This process is repeated in the entire wireless sensor network. Under certain environmental and estimated parameter conditions, all nodes in the network can finally converge to a coherent frequency and phase, thus realizing time synchronization. The relationship between time synchronization and coupling coefficient was proved theoretically, and the optimal coupling coefficient was derived. An optimized algorithm was proposed after the optimization of the protocol. Finally, the correctness of the proposed protocol and its optimized algorithm was verified by data simulation.},

  abstract     = {Optimal disassembly sequencing is an NP-hard problem and has always been an ambition for industry production. In the context of increasing public concerns over environmental impacts, in addition to the feasibility of a disassembly sequence, dismantling enterprises have to consider the relationship between potential profits and the impacts. Thus, an ideal disassembly sequence should weight these three factors comprehensively. Up to now, an appropriate ELV disassembly sequence still mainly relies on people’s intuitive experience and seeking an optimal disassembly sequencing method assumes enormous importance. This paper aims to address the optimal disassembly sequencing problem of ELVs by means of an improved genetic algorithm, in which a matrix coding mechanism and an elite strategy are employed. The weight of different factors can be adjusted according to the actual conditions of factories. The paper gives a case and a series of Pareto fronts are obtained. The effects of population size and maximum evolutionary time on the Pareto solutions were investigated. Ultimately, the optimal Pareto disassembly sequence corresponding to balanced profit and environmental impact is achieved, thereby providing an appropriate disassembly depth defined by the aforementioned disassembly sequence. This can contribute to timely disassembly decisions for end-of-life vehicle (ELV) dismantling enterprises, achieving a cost-effective disassembly process for survival in the context of growing environmental concerns. This paper seeks to offer a viable decision-making approach prior to real disassembly of ELVs by detailing a Pareto disassembly depth and sequence.},

In this paper, aiming at the tree-shaped water injection pipe network system of large-scale oilfields, based on the energy equation for calculating the pressure drop Δ H of pipe section, a mathematical model of the pipeline unit and the node unit is established, and finally, a mathematical model of pipe network for the entire water injection system is established; then, the improved iterative algorithm is used to solve the simulation model of water injection system. In this way, we determine the boundary calculation conditions, take the water injection station as reference node, and use the maximum pressure of water injection well as the initial value of the reference node for calculation, which reduces the number of iterations in model calculation; by comparing the simulation results of different iteration steps, 0.01 is selected as the iteration step size due to its higher calculation accuracy; and the calculation process has also been optimized. The process of solving the characteristic matrix K is combined with the process of calculating the pressure drop Δ H of pipe section, and placed outside the algorithm loop, thereby shortening the calculation time of a single cycle and reducing the calculation amount of the algorithm. The application cases show that the proposed optimization algorithm for water injection system pipe network simulation can be used as an effective method to improve the solution speed and calculation accuracy of the simulation algorithm of tree-shaped water injection system in large-scale oilfields.},

Since even if an area is in an earthquake-prone zone, the proportion of days with earthquakes per year is still a minority. The general method is to generate more artificial data for the minority class that is the earthquake occurrence data. But the most popular oversampling methods generate synthetic samples along line segments that join minority class instances, which is not suitable for earthquake precursor data. In this paper, we propose a Safe Zone Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SZ-SMOTE) oversampling method as an enhancement of the SMOTE data generation mechanism. SZ-SMOTE generates synthetic samples with a concentration mechanism in the hyper-sphere area around each selected minority instances. The performance of SZ-SMOTE is compared against no oversampling, SMOTE and its popular modifications adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN) and borderline SMOTE (B-SMOTE) on six different classifiers. The experiment results show that the quality of earthquake prediction using SZ-SMOTE as oversampling algorithm significantly outperforms that of using the other oversampling algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The ellipsoidal magnetization model has a wide range of application scenarios. For example, in aviation magnetic field prospecting, mineral prospecting, seabed prospecting, and UXO (unexploded ordnance) detection. However, because the existing ellipsoid magnetization formula is relatively complicated, the detection model is usually replaced by a dipole. Such a model increases the error probability and poses a significant challenge for subsequent imaging and pattern recognition. Based on the distribution of ellipsoid gravity potential and magnetic potential, the magnetic anomaly field distribution equation generated by the ellipsoid is deduced by changing the aspect ratio, making the ellipsoid equivalent to a sphere. The result of formula derivation shows that the two magnetic anomaly fields are consistent. This paper uses COMSOL finite element software to model UXO, ellipsoids, and spheres and analyzes magnetic anomalies. The conclusion shows that the ellipsoid model can completely replace the UXO model when the error range of 1nT is satisfied. Finally, we established two sets of ellipsoids and calculated the magnetic anomalous field distributions on different planes using deduction formulas and finite element software. We compared the experimental results and found that the relative error of the two sets of data was within ± 0 . 2 5 ‰. Error analysis found that the error distribution is standardized and conforms to the normal distribution. The above mathematical analysis and finite element simulation prove that the calculation method is simple and reliable and provides a magnetic field distribution equation for subsequent UXO inversion.},

In this study, a scene text detection database for bilingual Tibetan-Chinese is constructed using a manually labeled method and an automatic synthesis method, and a text detection method is proposed. First, we predict a text rectangular region and the text center region for each text instance and simultaneously learned the expansion distance of the text center region. Second, based on the classification score of the text center region and the text rectangular region, we obtain the final confidence of each text instance and then filter out the text center region with lower confidence. Third, through the learned expansion distance, the full-text instance from the remaining text center region is recovered. The results show that our method obtains good detection performance; it achieves an accuracy of up to 75.47% during the text detection phase, laying the foundation for scene text recognition in the subsequent step.},

Conventionally, these approaches utilize higher or lower eigenvalued principal components (PCs) for data transformation; but the higher eigenvalued PCs may split the target class, whereas lower eigenvalued PCs do not contribute significant information and wrong selection of PCs leads to performance degradation. Considering these facts, the present research offers a novel target class-guided feature extraction method. In this approach, initially, the eigendecomposition is performed on variance–covariance matrix of only the target class samples, where the higher- and lower-valued eigenvectors are rejected via statistical analysis, and the selected eigenvectors are utilized to extract the most promising feature subspace. The extracted feature-subset gives a more tighter description of the CoI with enhanced associativity among target class samples and ensures the strong separation from nontarget class samples. One-class support vector machine (OCSVM) is evaluated to validate the performance of learned features. To obtain optimized values of hyperparameters of OCSVM a novel N -ary search-based autonomous method is also proposed. Exhaustive experiments with a wide variety of datasets are performed in feature-space (original and reduced) and eigenspace (obtained from original and reduced features) to validate the performance of the proposed approach in terms of accuracy, precision, specificity and sensitivity.},

  abstract     = {The max–min ant system (MMAS) is a modified ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. Its convergence speed is effectively improved by setting the upper and lower bounds of the pheromone and updating it in the optimal path. However, MMAS still has drawbacks, such as long search time and local extremums. In this paper, the hybrid max–min ant system (HMMAS) is proposed to deal with the shortcomings of MMAS. Employing Levy flight strategy, HMMAS can dynamically adjust the parameters to increase the diversity of solutions and expand the search range. Besides, HMMAS uses the OBL strategy to generate opposite solutions in the early stage. In this way, the convergence is accelerated. When HMMAS falls into a local extremum, the path reorganization strategy is utilized. With its help, HMMAS can redistribute the pheromone in each path and achieve global optimum. To verify the effectiveness, HMMAS is first compared with the three conventional ACO algorithms of AS, ACS, and MMAS in 20 sets of experiments. The results indicate that the average results of HMMAS in the 19 sets of TSP instances are better than the other three algorithms, and the standard deviation in the 14 sets of calculation instances is the smallest. Then, HMMAS is compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms, and the results show that HMMAS is better than other comparison algorithms, either by the minimum or the average value.},

  abstract     = {Imaging sensors with higher resolution and higher frame rates are becoming more popular for wide-area video surveillance (VS) and other applications as technology advances Using Mask-RCNN, we proposed Multiple-Object Detection and Segmentation in High-Resolution Video based on Deep Learning. The ResNet-50 ResNet-101 is used as the backbone in the proposed R-CNN Mask FPN model. The deep residual network’s design overcomes the problem of lower learning efficiency due to the network’s deepening. To reach the objective of the smallest overall error, the deep residual network divided the training series into one training block, minimizing the error of each block. It is roughly divided into five convolutional layer stages. The output scale is cut in half at each point. We used mixed precision FP16 and FP32 for training the model and achieved great speed in training time reduction in inference time for object. The COCO 2014 data set is used to train and validate the proposed model with mixed precision, leading to faster performance. The results of the experiments show that the proposed model can run at 30–48 frames per second with 85% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Current state-of-the-art detectors achieved impressive performance in detection accuracy with the use of deep learning. However, most of such detectors cannot detect objects in real time due to heavy computational cost, which limits their wide application. Although some one-stage detectors are designed to accelerate the detection speed, it is still not satisfied for task in high-resolution remote sensing images. To address this problem, a lightweight one-stage approach based on YOLOv3 is proposed in this paper, which is named Squeeze-and-Excitation YOLOv3 (SE-YOLOv3). The proposed algorithm maintains high efficiency and effectiveness simultaneously. With an aim to reduce the number of parameters and increase the ability of feature description, two customized modules, lightweight feature extraction and attention-aware feature augmentation, are embedded by utilizing global information and suppressing redundancy features, respectively. To meet the scale invariance, a spatial pyramid pooling method is used to aggregate local features. The evaluation experiments on two remote sensing image data sets, DOTA and NWPU VHR-10, reveal that the proposed approach achieves more competitive detection effect with less computational consumption.},

  abstract     = {Aerial image-based target detection has problems such as low accuracy in multiscale target detection situations, slow detection speed, missed targets and falsely detected targets. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a detection algorithm based on the improved You Only Look Once (YOLO)v3 network architecture from the perspective of model efficiency and applies it to multiscale image-based target detection. First, the K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster an aerial dataset and optimize the anchor frame parameters of the network to improve the effectiveness of target detection. Second, the feature extraction method of the algorithm is improved, and a feature fusion method is used to establish a multiscale (large-, medium-, and small-scale) prediction layer, which mitigates the problem of small target information loss in deep networks and improves the detection accuracy of the algorithm. Finally, label regularization processing is performed on the predicted value, the generalized intersection over union (GIoU) is used as the bounding box regression loss function, and the focal loss function is integrated into the bounding box confidence loss function, which not only improves the target detection accuracy but also effectively reduces the false detection rate and missed target rate of the algorithm. An experimental comparison on the RSOD and NWPU VHR-10 aerial datasets shows that the detection effect of high-efficiency YOLO (HE-YOLO) is significantly improved compared with that of YOLOv3, and the average detection accuracies are increased by 8.92% and 7.79% on the two datasets, respectively. The algorithm not only shows better detection performance for multiscale targets but also reduces the missed target rate and false detection rate and has good robustness and generalizability.},

This work addresses this problem by proposing a new framework based on the automatic features extraction of partial discharge signal. The method first applies a sliding time window to convert partial discharge signals in the time domain into two-dimensional images that serve directly as the input to the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Then a nonlinear encoder is employed to automatically extract the features of the partial discharge image data as the input of CNNs for classification. In addition, we address the overfitting problem associated with the few-shot by applying a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to augment the original training dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm; it increases the classification accuracy by 4.18% relative to that achieved with manually extracted features; the overall accuracy of the proposed algorithm training with the augmented dataset is 3.175% higher than that with the original experimental dataset.},

Learning from CPPM requires using Riemannian manifolds (R-manifolds) of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. DPs can be used to build a Grassmann manifold (G-manifold). Experimental results show that classifier ensembles and their cascades built using R-manifolds are less dependent on some properties of individual classifiers (e.g. depth of decision trees in random forests (RFs) or extra trees (ETs)) in comparison to G-manifolds and Euclidean geometry. More independent individual classifiers allow obtaining R-manifolds with better properties for classification. Generally, the accuracy of classification in nonlinear geometry is higher than in Euclidean one. For multi-class problems, G-manifolds perform similarly to stacking-based classifiers built on R-manifolds of SPD matrices in terms of classification accuracy.},

To prevent illicit activities, this paper presents a new method for detecting altered text in document images. The proposed method explores the relationship between positive and negative coefficients of DCT to extract the effect of distortions caused by tampering by fusing reconstructed images of respective positive and negative coefficients, which results in Positive-Negative DCT coefficients Fusion (PNDF). To take advantage of spatial information, we propose to fuse R, G, and B color channels of input images, which results in RGBF (RGB Fusion). Next, the same fusion operation is used for fusing PNDF and RGBF, which results in a fused image for the original input one. We compute a histogram to extract features from the fused image, which results in a feature vector. The feature vector is then fed to a deep neural network for classifying altered text images. The proposed method is tested on our own dataset and the standard datasets from the ICPR 2018 Fraud Contest, Altered Handwriting (AH), and faked IMEI number images. The results show that the proposed method is effective and the proposed method outperforms the existing methods irrespective of image type.},

  abstract     = {Achieving a better recognition rate for text in action video images is challenging due to multiple types of text with unpredictable actions in the background. In this paper, we propose a new method for the classification of caption (which is edited text) and scene text (text that is a part of the video) in video images. This work considers five action classes, namely, Yoga, Concert, Teleshopping, Craft, and Recipes, where it is expected that both types of text play a vital role in understanding the video content. The proposed method introduces a new fusion criterion based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Fourier coefficients to obtain the reconstructed images for caption and scene text. The fusion criterion involves computing the variances for coefficients of corresponding pixels of DCT and Fourier images, and the same variances are considered as the respective weights. This step results in Reconstructed image-1. Inspired by the special property of Chebyshev-Harmonic-Fourier-Moments (CHFM) that has the ability to reconstruct a redundancy-free image, we explore CHFM for obtaining the Reconstructed image-2. The reconstructed images along with the input image are passed to a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) for classification of caption/scene text. Experimental results on five action classes and a comparative study with the existing methods demonstrate that the proposed method is effective. In addition, the recognition results of the before and after the classification obtained from different methods show that the recognition performance improves significantly after classification, compared to before classification.},

  abstract     = {In vision-driven Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) where cameras play a vital role, accurate detection and re-identification of vehicles are fundamental demands. Hence, recent approaches have employed a wide range of algorithms to provide the best possible accuracy. These methods commonly generate a vehicle detection model based on its visual appearance features such as license plate, headlights, or some other distinguishable specifications. Among different object detection approaches, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have the advantage of magnificent detection accuracy in case a huge amount of training data is provided. In this paper, a robust approach for license plate detection (LPD) based on YOLO v.3 is proposed which takes advantage of high detection accuracy and real-time performance. The mentioned approach can detect the license plate location of vehicles as a general representation of vehicle presence in images. To train the model, a dataset of vehicle images with Iranian license plates has been generated by the authors and augmented to provide a wider range of data for test and train purposes. It should be mentioned that the proposed method can detect the license plate area as an indicator of vehicle presence with no Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithm to distinguish characters inside the license plate. Experimental results have shown the high performance of the system with a precision 0.979 and recall 0.972.},

  abstract     = {Reading and interpreting the medical image still remains the most challenging task in radiology. Through the important achievement of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in the context of medical image classification, various clinical applications have been provided to detect lesions from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans. In the diagnosis process for the liver cancer from Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), radiologists consider three phases during contrast injection: before injection, arterial phase, and portal phase for instance. Even if the contrast agent helps in enhancing the tumoral tissues, the diagnosis may be very difficult due to the possible low contrast and pathological tissues surrounding the tumors (cirrhosis). Alongside, in the medical field, ontologies have proven their effectiveness to solve several clinical problems such as offering shareable terminologies, vocabularies, and databases. In this article, we propose a multi-label CNN classification approach based on a parallel preprocessing algorithm. This algorithm is an extension of our previous work cited in the International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (ICPRAI) 2020. The aim of our approach is to ameliorate the detection of HCC lesions and to extract more information about the detected tumor such as the stage, the localization, the size, and the type thanks to the use of ontologies. Moreover, the integration of such information has improved the detection process. In fact, experiments conducted by testing with real patient cases have shown that the proposed approach reached an accuracy of 93% using MRI patches of 6 4 × 6 4 pixels, which is an improvement compared with our previous works.},

We evaluate the RETAIN model on the type-2 IDIAB and the type-1 OhioT1DM datasets by comparing its statistical and clinical performances against two deep models and three models based on decision trees. We show that the RETAIN model offers a very good compromise between accuracy and interpretability, being almost as accurate as the LSTM and FCN models while remaining interpretable. We show the usefulness of its interpretable nature by analyzing the contribution of each variable to the final prediction. It revealed that signal values older than 1 h are not used by the RETAIN model for 30 min ahead of time prediction of glucose. Also, we show how the RETAIN model changes its behavior upon the arrival of an event such as carbohydrate intakes or insulin infusions. In particular, it showed that the patient’s state before the event is particularly important for the prediction. Overall the RETAIN model, thanks to its interpretability, seems to be a very promising model for regression or classification tasks in healthcare.},

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a smart home privacy protection method combining DES encryption and the improved Least Significant Bit (LSB) information hiding algorithm, changing the practice of directly exposing smart home secret information to the Internet, first, using Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption to encrypt the smart home information and second, the improved LSB information hiding algorithm is used to hide the ciphertext, so that the adversary cannot detect the smart home secret information. The goal of the scheme is to provide a double protection for the secure transmission of the smart home secret information. If an attacker wants to carry out an attack, it has to break through at least two defense lines, which seems impossible to do. Experiment results show that the improved LSB algorithm is more robust than the existing algorithms, and it is very safe. Therefore, the scheme proposed in this paper is very practical for protecting the smart home secret information.},

  abstract     = {In this extended version of this paper, an automatic video diagnosis system for dementia classification is presented. Starting from video recordings of patients and control subjects, performing sit-to-stand test, the designed system is capable of extracting relevant patterns for binary discern patients with dementia from healthy subjects. The original system achieved an accuracy 0.808 by using the rigorous inter-patient separation scheme especially suited for medical purposes. This separation scheme provides the use of some people for training and others, different, people for testing. The implementation of features from the kinematic theory of rapid human movement and its sigma-lognormal model together with classic features increased the overall accuracy of the system to 0.947 F1 score. In addition, multi-class classification was performed with the aim of classifying neurodegenerative disease severities. This work is an original and pioneering work on sit-to-stand video classification for neurodegenerative diseases, its novelties are on phases segmentation, experimental setup and the application of kinematic theory of rapid human movements to sit-to-stand videos for neurodegenerative disease assessment.},

  abstract     = {Automatic analysis of facial beauty has become an emerging computer vision problem in recent years. Facial beauty prediction (FBP) aims at developing a human-like model that automatically makes facial attractiveness predictions. In this study, we present and evaluate a face attractiveness prediction approach using facial parts as well as a multi-task learning scheme. First, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on massive face datasets is utilized for face attractiveness prediction, which is capable of automatic learning of high-level face representations. Next, we extend our deep model to other facial attribute recognition tasks. Hence, a multi-task learning scheme is leveraged by our deep model to learn optimal shared features for three correlated tasks (i.e. facial beauty assessment, gender recognition as well as ethnicity identification). To further enhance the attractiveness computation accuracy, specific regions of face images (i.e. left eye, nose and mouth) as well as the whole face are fed into multi-stream CNNs (i.e. three two-stream networks). Each two-stream network adopts a facial part as well as the full face as input. Extensive experiments are conducted on the SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark dataset, where our approach indicates significant improvement in accuracy over the other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Image time series, such as Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) or MRI functional sequences in the medical domain, carry both spatial and temporal information. In many pattern recognition applications such as image classification, taking into account such rich information may be crucial and discriminative during the decision making stage. However, the extraction of spatio-temporal features from image time series is difficult to handle due to the complex representation of the data cube. In this paper, we present a strategy based on Random Walk to build a novel segment-based representation of the data, passing from a 2D + t dimension to a 2D one, more easily manipulable and without losing too much spatial information. Such new representation is then used to feed a classical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in order to learn spatio-temporal features with only 2D convolutions and to classify image time series data for a particular classification problem. The influence of the way the 2D + t data are represented, as well as the impact of the network architectures on the results, are carefully studied. The interest of this approach is highlighted on a remote sensing application for the classification of complex agricultural crops.},

This dissertation puts forward a novel trajectory planning framework for intelligent vehicles to generate safe and optimal driving trajectories. First, we design a spatiotemporal occupancy framework to deal with all kinds of elements in the complex driving environment based on the Frenét frame. This framework unifies various constraints on the road in the three-dimensional spatiotemporal representation and clearly describes the collision-free configuration space. Then we use the convex approximation method to construct a time-varying convex feasible region based on the above accurate temporal and spatial description. We formulate the trajectory planning problem as a standard quadratic programming formulation with collision-free and dynamics constraints. Finally, we apply the iterative convex optimization algorithm to solve the quadratic programming problem in the time-varying convex feasible region. Moreover, we design several typical experimental scenarios and have verified that the proposed method has good effectiveness and real-time.},

Concrete icons (flame and snowflake) or Chinese characters (暖 and 凉) with opposite semantics were used as target carriers, and colors (red and blue) and speeches (热 and 冷) were used as audio-visual intervention stimuli. In the experiment, target carrier and audio-visual intervention were presented in a random combination, and the subjects needed to determine whether the semantics of the two matched quickly. By comparing the overall cognitive performance of two carriers, it was found that the brain had a more significant inhibition effect on audio-visual intervention stimuli with different semantics (SBH/LBH and SRC/LRC) relative to the same semantics (SRH/LRH). The semantic mismatch caused significant N400, indicating that semantic interference in the interface information would trigger the brain’s inhibition effect. Therefore, the more complex the semantic matching of interface information was, the higher the amplitude of N400 became. The results confirmed that the semantic relationship between target carrier and audio-visual intervention was the key factor affecting the cognitive inhibition effect. Moreover, under different intervention stimuli, the ERP’s negative activity caused by Chinese characters in frontal and parietal-occipital regions was more evident than that by concrete icons, indicating that concrete icons had a lower inhibition effect than Chinese characters. Therefore, we considered that this inhibition effect was based on the semantic constraints of the target carrier itself, which might come from the knowledge learning and intuitive experience stored in the human brain.},

By exploring the influence of adding residual blocks at different positions in the 3D U-Net, we establish a novel and effective 3D residual U-Net. In addition, to address the challenges of pixel imbalance, vessel boundary segmentation, and small vessel segmentation, we develop a new weighted Dice loss function with a better effect than the weighted cross-entropy loss function. When training the model, we adopted a two-stage method from coarse-to-fine. In the fine stage, a local segmentation method of 3D sliding window is added. In the model testing phase, we used the 3D fixed-point method. Furthermore, we employ the 3D morphological closed operation to smooth the surfaces of vessels and volume analysis to remove noise blocks. To verify the accuracy and stability of our method, we compare our method with FCN, 3D DenseNet, and 3D U-Net. The experimental results indicate that our method has higher accuracy and better stability than the other studied methods and that the average Dice coefficients for hepatic veins and portal veins reach 71.7% and 76.5% in the coarse stage and 72.5% and 77.2% in the fine stage, respectively.

To reduce the computational cost, and meantime, to preserve the performance of the trained deep CNN, we propose a new filter pruning method using an additional dataset derived by downsampling the original dataset. Our method takes advantage of the fact that information in high-resolution images is lost in the downsampling process. Each trained convolutional filter reacts differently to this information loss. Based on this, the importance of the filter is evaluated by comparing the gradient obtained from two different resolution images. We validate the superiority of our filter evaluation method using a VGG-16 model trained on CIFAR-10 and CUB-200-2011 datasets. The pruned network with our method shows an average of 2.66% higher accuracy in the latter dataset, compared to existing pruning methods when about 75% of the parameters are removed.},

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial network (GAN) is the most important natural image synthesis method, and one of GAN major challenges is the adversarial learning stability. Usually, GAN directly optimizes a single divergence via the two-player zero-sum game of generator and discriminator. Because the parameter updating of generator and discriminator is complex and changeable, directly optimizing the single divergence is easy to fall into local optimal solution, which affects the adversarial learning stability. To improve the adversarial learning stability and convergence accuracy, the same solution constraints GAN (SSC-GAN) is proposed. In this novel GAN, a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) is constructed by training set probability density function, which is the same solution problem of GAN optimization problem, and its constraint conditions are given to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the ODE solution. These constraints are used to guide the GAN parameter updating to improve the adversarial learning stability, thereby getting better training effects. In CELEBA and CIFAR10, the experimental results show that the novel GAN is better than the classic GAN models. In CELEBA, CIFAR10 and LSUN-BEDROOM, the proposed SSC-GAN is also better than two state-of-the-art GAN models, SAGAN and SNGAN.},

  abstract     = {Real-time and accurate measurement of coal quantity is the key to energy-saving and speed regulation of belt conveyor. The electronic belt scale and the nuclear scale are the commonly used methods for detecting coal quantity. However, the electronic belt scale uses contact measurement with low measurement accuracy and a large error range. Although nuclear detection methods have high accuracy, they have huge potential safety hazards due to radiation. Due to the above reasons, this paper presents a method of coal quantity detection and classification based on machine vision and deep learning. This method uses an industrial camera to collect the dynamic coal quantity images of the conveyor belt irradiated by the laser transmitter. After preprocessing, skeleton extraction, laser line thinning, disconnection connection, image fusion, and filling, the collected images are processed to obtain coal flow cross-sectional images. According to the cross-sectional area and the belt speed of the belt conveyor, the coal volume per unit time is obtained, and the dynamic coal quantity detection is realized. On this basis, in order to realize the dynamic classification of coal quantity, the coal flow cross-section images corresponding to different coal quantities are divided into coal type images to establish the coal quantity data set. Then, a Dense-VGG network for dynamic coal classification is established by the VGG16 network. After the network training is completed, the dynamic classification performance of the method is verified through the experimental platform. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy reaches 94.34%, and the processing time of a single frame image is 0.270 s.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence is developing rapidly in the direction of intellectualization and humanization. Recent studies have shown the vulnerability of many deep learning models to adversarial examples, but there are fewer studies on adversarial examples attacking facial expression recognition systems. Human–computer interaction requires facial expression recognition, so the security demands of artificial intelligence humanization should be considered. Inspired by facial expression recognition, we want to explore the characteristics of facial expression recognition adversarial examples. In this paper, we are the first to study facial expression adversarial examples (FEAEs) and propose an adversarial attack method on facial expression recognition systems, a novel measurement method on the adversarial hardness of FEAEs, and two evaluation metrics on FEAE transferability. The experimental results illustrate that our approach is superior to other gradient-based attack methods. Finding FEAEs can attack not only facial expression recognition systems but also face recognition systems. The transferability and adversarial hardness of FEAEs can be measured effectively and accurately.},

In this paper, we propose a gesture recognition method with sEMG signals based on a deep multi-parallel convolutional neural network (CNN), which solves the problem that traditional machine learning methods may lose too much useful information during feature extraction. CNNs provide an efficient way to constrain the complexity of feedforward neural networks by weight sharing and restriction to local connections. Sophisticated feature extraction is to be avoided and hand gestures are to be classified directly. A multi-parallel and multi-convolution layer convolution structure is proposed to classify hand gestures.

Since it is essential for the learning to avoid the case-base degradation, this work aims to build and maintain a quality case base while overcoming the difficulty of assembling labeled case bases, traditionally assumed to exist or determined by human experts. The proposed approach takes advantage of large volumes of unlabeled data to select valuable cases to add to the case base while monitoring retention to avoid performance degradation and to build a compact quality case base. We use machine learning techniques to cope with this challenge: an Active Semi-Supervised Learning approach is proposed to overcome the bottleneck of scarcity of labeled data. In order to acquire a quality case base, we target its performance criterion. Case selection and retention are assessed according to three combined sampling criteria: informativeness, representativeness, and diversity. We support our approach with empirical evaluations using different benchmark data sets. Based on experimentation, the proposed approach achieves good classification accuracy with a small number of retained cases, using a small training set as a case base.},

For this approach, an accurate target tracking model is built on the basis of extended Kalman filter (EKF). Using the information collected by radar seeker including distance, velocity and angle, it could achieve the accurate tracking of the target and determine the motion state of the target accurately. On this basis, the orthogonality of innovation in the process of Kalman filtering is utilized to detect any mutation of the motion state of the target, so that the existence of centroid jamming is detected when there is any mutation of the law of motion at the tracking point in the process of chaff centroid jamming. This offers a new solution for remote beyond-visual-range (BVR) anti-ship missile against centroid jamming.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, two novel approaches for unsupervised feature selection are proposed based on the spectral clustering. In the first proposed method, spectral clustering is employed over the features and the center of clusters is selected as well as their nearest-neighbors. These features have a minimum similarity (redundancy) between themselves since they belong to different clusters. Next, samples of data sets are clustered employing spectral clustering so that to the samples of each cluster a specific pseudo-label is assigned. After that according to the obtained pseudo-labels, the information gain of the features is computed that secures the maximum relevancy. Finally, the intersection of the selected features in the two previous steps is determined that simultaneously guarantees both the maximum relevancy and minimum redundancy. Our second proposed approach is very similar to the first one whose only but significant difference with the first method is that it selects one feature from each cluster and sorts all the features in terms of their relevancy. Then, by appending the selected features to a sorted list and ignoring them for the next step, the algorithm continues with the remaining features until all the features to be appended into the sorted list. Both of our proposed methods are compared with state-of-the-art methods and the obtained results confirm the performance of our proposed approaches especially the second one.},

These features are also evaluated by means of Representation Entropy (RE), Fisher’s ratio (FR) and Mahalanobis distance (MD), and the results are fused with Dempster–Shafer (D-S) evidence theory and the corresponding feature subsets are formed according to the fusion result. The support vector machine (SVM) is used as the classifier to recognize the defect signal, and the subsequent classification results are integrated by D-S evidence theory, which leads to the final recognition results. On this basis, a series of experiments were carried out to compare the performance of the developed model with that of the models using single feature sets and single feature evaluation criterion. Meanwhile, the principal component analysis (PCA) was also involved in the corresponding comparative analysis. The experimental results showed that this model is suitable for the identification and diagnosis of pipeline defects, and its classification accuracy could be reached up to 96.29% with stronger robustness and stability.},

Usually, the weights for the interactions are learned as a low rank weight matrix, which is formulated as an inner product of two low rank matrices. This low rank matrix can help improve the generalization ability of Factorization Machine. However, to choose the rank properly, it usually needs to run the algorithm for many times using different ranks, which clearly is inefficient for some large-scale datasets. To alleviate this issue, we propose an Adaptive Boosting framework of Factorization Machine (AdaFM), which can adaptively search for proper ranks for different datasets without re-training. Instead of using a fixed rank for FM, the proposed algorithm will gradually increase its rank according to its performance until the performance does not grow. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method on multiple large-scale datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can be more effective than the state-of-the-art Factorization Machines.},

  abstract     = {As an important tool to study the microstructure and properties of materials, High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) images can obtain the lattice fringe image (reflecting the crystal plane spacing information), structure image and individual atom image (which reflects the configuration of atoms or atomic groups in crystal structure). Despite the rapid development of HTTEM devices, HRTEM images still have limited achievable resolution for human visual system. With the rapid development of deep learning technology in recent years, researchers are actively exploring the Super-resolution (SR) model based on deep learning, and the model has reached the current best level in various SR benchmarks. Using SR to reconstruct high-resolution HRTEM image is helpful to the material science research. However, there is one core issue that has not been resolved: most of these super-resolution methods require the training data to exist in pairs. In actual scenarios, especially for HRTEM images, there are no corresponding HR images. To reconstruct high quality HRTEM image, a novel Super-Resolution architecture for HRTEM images is proposed in this paper. Borrowing the idea from Dual Regression Networks (DRN), we introduce an additional dual regression structure to ESRGAN, by training the model with unpaired HRTEM images and paired nature images. Results of extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than the most resent SISR methods with both quantitative and visual results.},

  abstract     = {Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained on the pixel-level annotated images have achieved improvements in semantic segmentation. Due to the high cost of labeling training data, their applications may have great limitation. However, weakly supervised segmentation approaches can significantly reduce human labeling efforts. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to generate high-quality initial pixel-level annotations. By using a hierarchical image segmentation algorithm to predict the boundary map, we select the optimal scale of high-quality hierarchies. In the initialization step, scribble annotations and the saliency map are combined to construct a graphic model over the optimal scale segmentation. By solving the minimal cut problem, it can spread information from scribbles to unmarked regions. In the training process, the segmentation network is trained by using the initial pixel-level annotations. To iteratively optimize the segmentation, we use a graphical model to refine segmentation masks and retrain the segmentation network to get more precise pixel-level annotations. The experimental results on Pascal VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms most of weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance, which is 6 9 . 3 % mIoU.},

This framework is composed of Detection Stream, Judge Stream and Fusion Stream. In the Detection Stream, loss balance factor (LBF) is raised to improve the region proposal network (RPN). To predict the global text segmentation map, the algorithm combines regression strategy and case segmentation method. In the Judge Stream, a classification of the samples is proposed based on the Judge Map and the corresponding tags to calculate the overlap rate. As a support of Detection Stream, feature pyramid network is utilized in the algorithm to extract Judge Map and calculate LBF. In the Fusion Stream, a new fusion algorithm is raised. By fusing the output of the two streams, we can position the text area in the natural scene accurately. Finally, the algorithm is experimented on the standard data sets ICDAR 2015 and ICDAR2017-MLT. The test results show that the F values are 87.8% and 67.57%, respectively, superior to the state-of-the art models. This proves that the algorithm can solve the robustness issues under the unbalance between scale transformation and training data.},

Bibliometric analyses were conducted on 1103 papers of 20 traditional Chinese medicine journals from 2011 to 2020 by retrieving for the China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database (CAJD) in China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). SPSS 17.0 software was used to analyze the correlation between the citation frequency and the download frequency via conducting regression fitting and establishing the mathematical models. The results showed that the total citations of the 1103 papers were 93051 times and the average citations were 84.36 times per paper. The total downloads of the 1103 papers were 2058442 times, and the average downloads were 1866.22 times per paper. China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica ranked first according to the number of papers, total citations and total downloads. The citations of Journal of Chinese Medicinal Materials ranked first based on the number of citations per paper. One of Li’s paper had been cited the most (983 times). There were 629 (57.03%) papers whose first author was from universities. The scopes of the first authors were distributed in 29 regions and 2 special administrative regions (Macao, Hong Kong) in China. The authors from Beijing published 283 (25.66%) papers, ranking number one. The number of papers supported by funds was 882 (79.96%).

  abstract     = {The Chenopodiaceae species are ecologically and financially important, and play a significant role in biodiversity around the world. Biodiversity protection is critical for the survival and sustainability of each ecosystem and since plant species recognition in their natural habitats is the first process in plant diversity protection, an automatic species classification in the wild would greatly help the species analysis and consequently biodiversity protection on earth. Computer vision approaches can be used for automatic species analysis. Modern computer vision approaches are based on deep learning techniques. A standard dataset is essential in order to perform a deep learning algorithm. Hence, the main goal of this research is to provide a standard dataset of Chenopodiaceae images. This dataset is called ACHENY and contains 27030 images of 30 Chenopodiaceae species in their natural habitats. The other goal of this study is to investigate the applicability of ACHENY dataset by using deep learning models. Therefore, two novel deep learning models based on ACHENY dataset are introduced: First, a lightweight deep model which is trained from scratch and is designed innovatively to be agile and fast. Second, a model based on the EfficientNet-B1 architecture, which is pre-trained on ImageNet and is fine-tuned on ACHENY. The experimental results show that the two proposed models can do Chenopodiaceae fine-grained species recognition with promising accuracy. To evaluate our models, their performance was compared with the well-known VGG-16 model after fine-tuning it on ACHENY. Both VGG-16 and our first model achieved about 80% accuracy while the size of VGG-16 is about 16 × larger than the first model. Our second model has an accuracy of about 90% and outperforms the other models where its number of parameters is 5 × than the first model but it is still about one-third of the VGG-16 parameters.},

To effectively tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a cascaded deeply supervised convolutional networks (CDS-Net). The cascaded deep supervision (CDS) mechanism uses auxiliary losses to construct a cascaded segmentation method in a single network, focusing the network attention on pixels that are more difficult to classify, so that the network can segment the lesion more effectively. CDS mechanism can be easily integrated into standard CNN models and it helps to increase the model sensitivity and prediction accuracy. Based on CDS mechanism, we propose a cascaded deep supervised ResUNet, which is an end-to-end liver lesion segmentation network. We conduct experiments on LiTS and 3DIRCADb dataset. Our method has achieved competitive results compared with other state-of-the-art ones.},

  abstract     = {A fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning (RL) is how to achieve efficient exploration in initially unknown environments. Most state-of-the-art RL algorithms leverage action space noise to drive exploration. The classical strategies are computationally efficient and straightforward to implement. However, these methods may fail to perform effectively in complex environments. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy named reward space noise (RSN) for farsighted and consistent exploration in RL. By introducing the stochasticity from reward space, we are able to change agent’s understanding about environment and perturb its behaviors. We find that the simple RSN can achieve consistent exploration and scale to complex domains without intensive computational cost. To demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method, we implement a deep Q-learning agent with reward noise and evaluate its exploratory performance on a set of Atari games which are challenging for the naive ϵ -greedy strategy. The results show that reward noise outperforms action noise in most games and performs comparably in others. Concretely, we found that in the early training, the best exploratory performance of reward noise is obviously better than action noise, which demonstrates that the reward noise can quickly explore the valuable states and aid in finding the optimal policy. Moreover, the average scores and learning efficiency of reward noise are also higher than action noise through the whole training, which indicates that the reward noise can generate more stable and consistent performance.},

  abstract     = {Existing methods for dynamic scene recognition mostly use global features extracted from the entire video frame or a video segment. In this paper, a trajectory-based dynamic scene recognition method is proposed. A trajectory is formed by a pixel moving across consecutive frames of a video segment. The local regions surrounding the trajectory provide useful appearance and motion information about a portion of the video segment. The proposed method works at several stages. First, dense and evenly distributed trajectories are extracted from a video segment. Then, the fully-connected-layer features are extracted from each trajectory using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) model, forming a feature sequence. Next, these feature sequences are fed into a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) network to learn their temporal behavior. Finally, by aggregating the information of the trajectories, a global representation of the video segment can be obtained for classification purposes. The LSTM is trained using synthetic trajectory feature sequences instead of real ones. The synthetic feature sequences are generated with a series of generative adversarial networks (GANs). In addition to classification, category-specific discriminative trajectories are located in a video segment, which help reveal what portions of a video segment are more important than others. This is achieved by formulating an optimization problem to learn discriminative part detectors for all categories simultaneously. Experimental results on two benchmark dynamic scene datasets show that the proposed method is very competitive with six other methods.},

  abstract     = {To improve the robustness of the shearer cutting part and reduce the manufacturing cost, in this study, the gear transmission system of a shearer’s cutting unit can be divided into three basic components: single-gear-on-one-shaft form, the planetary reduction form, and double-gears-on-one-shaft form. The dynamic differential equations of each structure are established in this study, and the volume functions of the three basic components are obtained. The characteristics of the internal excitation of the gear transmission system are analyzed, and a scheme for solving the motion parameters of each component is formulated based on the harmonic balance method. Based on the parameters, such as tooth width, tooth number, and modulus, as optimized variables, a robust optimization method minimizing the multi-parameter evaluation function, which is weighted linearly by dimensionless vibration and volume of the gear transmission system, is presented. The gear transmission system of a sample shearer’s cutting unit is optimized using the proposed method. The results show that the transmission system’s size decreases by 5.4%, the drum’s maximum torsional acceleration decreases by 17.8%, and the first gear’s maximum torsional acceleration decreases by 9.6%. Thus, we conclude that the optimum design method decreases a shearer’s manufacturing cost and decreases the cutting unit’s failure rate.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, dual-active-bridge (DAB) DC/DC converter is widely used for its high power density and flexible operation mode. However, complex control variables and high reflux power are the main disadvantages of the system, which have become its development bottleneck. In view of this, this paper presents an in-depth analysis of the impacts of three phase-shifting degrees of freedom on the transmission power and effective values of the inductive current based on the triple-phase-shift (TPS) control strategy by deducing the relationship equations between the three degrees of freedom and the other two variables in the TPS control system. Based on the equations, the method of using the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to optimize three phase shift angles is proposed, which cannot only improve the convergence speed of the optimal phase shift angle but also be ideal for solving nonlinear problems. The experimental results show that this method can improve the transmission power and reduce the effective value of inductive current.},

Due to the limitations of traditional centralized system structure, it is necessary to optimize the design of rail station signal monitoring system to make the system possess these functions. In this research, the novel concept of Role on Autonomous Decentralized System (RoADS) is adopted to optimize the design of rail signal monitoring system. On the one hand, RoADS has the characteristic of role dynamic conversion which is essential to realize the special function of online-expansion, online maintenance and fault tolerance. On the other hand, RoADS also can support the basic function of data collection. In order to verify the validity of the proposed method, a case study has been performed on ZPW-2000 track circuit monitoring system which is the subsystem of rail signal system mainly responsible to monitor the track circuit. The results clearly indicate that the optimized system based on RoADS can not only realize the function of data collection, but also possess the function of online-expansion, online maintenance and fault tolerance. Consequently, the proposed method based on RoADS can improve the safety level of rail transit and reduce the cost operation which is of great significance for maintaining the sustainable urban development of rail transit.},

This study presents a highly accurate facial recognition method that uses high-speed transformation and facial morphing using region-limited log-polar transformation based on a center point calculated from the coordinates of both eyes and corners of the mouth. Log-polar transformation is limited to the region, so that the region including the feature can be suppressed to the minimum range, thereby facilitating high-speed transformation. Additionally, after facial morphing, the shapes of the eyes and mouth are altered based on the outline of the face, enabling high-precision facial recognition. The efficacy of the proposed method is verified experimentally. Therefore, we can confirm that 91.72% of images using the color FERET database and 96% of images using the FEI face database can be recognized using our method.},

Our method is multi-staged, where first, we employ the Harris corner detector to identify the uncertainties of all image corners. Then, for each detected corner, we apply a linear optimization, and finally, we calibrate the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the binocular vision setup by employing a nonlinear optimization scheme. We confirm the validity of our technique by analyzing the factors influencing the camera calibration accuracy and confirm the experimental conditions.

In this paper, the framework we introduced is called AttentionNet, exploring the weak region-wise annotations as attention clues to improve the retrieval performance. Specifically, we integrate the semantic and recognition tasks using shared convolutional neural networks by multi-task learning. Semantic attention mechanism is used to explicitly re-weight the feature map for emphasizing the foreground. To prevent overfitting in few-shot training, we adopt a variant of the triplet loss to perform deep metric learning with an online hard triplet mining strategy. Once trained, AttentionNet identifies a probe image by computing its embedding’s cosine distance with images in the gallery. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in image search. For instance, we obtain 82.9% Rank-1 score on the MVB dataset, dramatically outperforming the currently existing methods.},

For evaluation, two qualitative and quantitative assessments are used along with an application of multiview facial expression recognition as a case study.

In order to achieve high performance, these networks need to provide a large amount of training data in the form of feature engineering corpus and lexicons. Chinese NER is very challenging because of the high contextual relevance of Chinese characters, that is, Chinese characters and phrases may have many possible meanings in different contexts. To this end, we propose a model that leverages a pre-trained and bi-directional encoder representations-from-transformers language model and a joint bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and conditional random fields (CRF) model for Chinese NER. The underlying network layer embeds Chinese characters and outputs character-level representations. The output is then fed into a bidirectional long short-term memory to capture contextual sequence information. The top layer of the proposed model is CRF, which is used to take into account the dependencies of adjacent tags and jointly decode the optimal chain of tags. A series of extensive experiments were conducted to research the useful improvements of the proposed neural network architecture on different datasets without relying heavily on handcrafted features and domain-specific knowledge. Experimental results show that the proposed model is effective, and character-level representation is of great significance for Chinese NER tasks. In addition, through this work, we have composed a new informal conversation message corpus called the autonomous bus information inquiry dataset, and compared to the advanced baseline, our method has been significantly improved.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive Radio (CR) is the hottest network paradigm, which permits the Secondary Users (SUs) like wireless devices/users for intelligent accessing of unallocated radio spectrum. Such accessing happens by enabling interference-free transmission of Primary Users (PUs), who are allotted with some deserved radio spectrum portions. This radio communication paradigm has effective usage in vehicular networks, where communication should be established from vehicles to static stations (vehicle-to-infrastructure) or within vehicles (vehicle-to-vehicle), without allotting dedicated frequencies. Nevertheless, the major issue in designing CR is that it must be built to aid in efficient transmitting and sensing of data through the available radio spectrum channels. This paper proposes a Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based prediction model, via a Deep Learning approach. Here, a Deep Belief Network (DBN) allows in predicting the PU transmission state as idle or busy. Moreover, this paper comes out with a new optimization concept that achieves more accurate and precise prediction. The weight of DBN is optimally selected to pave way for effective performance. Further, a new hybrid algorithm named as Cuckoo Search-Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (CS-GOA) is proposed. The performance of the proposed model is compared over the other conventional models, in terms of channel utilization and back off, and proved for supremacy. The throughput of the proposed model, even at 50 SUs is better, when compared to other methods. CS-GOA achieved better channel utilization and backoff rate, as compared to ProMAC and NN, when the numbers of SUs and PUs in the architecture are varied with time.},

Under a biconvex optimization strategy for CDL, we propose to diagonally precondition the system matrices in the filter learning sub-problem that can be solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). This method leads to the substitution of matrix inversion ( 𝒪 ( n 3 ) ) and matrix multiplication ( 𝒪 ( n 3 ) ) involved in ADMM with an element-wise operation ( 𝒪 ( n ) ) , which significantly reduces the computational complexity as well as the memory requirement. Numerical experiments validate the performance advantage of the proposed method over the state-of-the-arts.

Through this inclusion, physical channels are capable of providing consumers with more favorable experience and interaction, and brick-and-mortar store owners can obtain a more accurate understanding of consumer behaviors of store consumers. Information acquired through this system can be provided to store owners to serve as reference for merchandise placement, arrangement of display shelves, and consumer circulation path planning. This study used the technique of image processing to locate the Region of Interest and applied object tracking to get the consumer’s trajectory which successfully implemented the consumer-tracking characteristics of online platforms in a physical channel while retaining the unique experience of the physical channel. This results in a win–win scenario for businesses and consumers.},

In this paper, a rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on eigenvalue selection and dimensionality reduction is presented. This is suitable for analyzing fault signals with nonstationary characteristics, and it has a good recognition rate. The characteristic quantity of vibration signals in the time domain and the frequency domain is calculated, and the characteristic quantity is selected by calculating the degree of difference. A dimension reduction algorithm is proposed, which is based on a neural network and ISOMAP. Its performance is compared using PCA, LTSA, and ISOMAP algorithms. Fault diagnosis is carried out by using KNN and SVM classification algorithms, and good recognition results are obtained.},

Terminal voltage, active and reactive power of SG were selected as input variables for a novel prediction model based on the ν -SVR, and field current was selected as an output variable of the prediction model. The structures and parameters of the field current prediction model were optimized with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and training samples, then the prediction model was established and the field current prediction got under way. By comparing the predicted field current with the corresponding online measured field current, inter-turn short-circuit of rotor winding in SG could be detected sensitively once its absolute value of the prediction relative error exceeded a specific threshold. The micro-synchronous generator dynamic simulation indicated that the proposed online detecting approach based on the ν -SVR machine overcame the shortage of the back-propagation (BP) diagnosis method for misdiagnosis, and its accuracy, sensitivity and threshold setting range of the diagnosis method was the most prominent among these diagnosis methods such as the BP diagnosis method, the Bayesian regularization back-propagation (BRBP) diagnosis method and the ε -support vector regression ( ε -SVR) diagnosis method.},

  abstract     = {For solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs), an effective constraint-handling technique (CHT) is of great importance. Recently, many CHTs have been proposed for solving CMOPs. However, no single CHT can outperform all kinds of CMOPs. This paper proposes an algorithm, namely, ACHT-M2M, which adaptively allocates the existing CHTs in an M2M framework for solving CMOPs. To be more specific, a CMOP is first decomposed into several constrained multi-objective optimization subproblems by ACHT-M2M. Each subproblem has a subpopulation in a subregion. CHT for each subregion is adaptively allocated according to a proposed composite performance measure. Population for the next generation is selected from subregions by selection operators with different CHTs and the obtained nondominated feasible solutions in each generation are used to update a predefined archive. ACHT-M2M assembles the advantages of different CHTs and makes them cooperate with each other. The proposed ACHT-M2M is finally compared with the other 12 representative algorithms on benchmark CMOPs and the experimental results further confirm the effectiveness of ACHT-M2M for solving CMOPs.},

For this purpose, a hybrid strategy has been proposed based on spatio-temporal covariance model which combined the spatio-temporal ordinary kriging (STOK) technology with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) regression smoothing method. This is because wind speed time series exhibits a long-term dependency. In the case study, both STOK method and ARIMA method are employed and their performances are compared. The ARIMA model can obtain a necessary and sufficient smoothing condition for them to be smoothed. Meanwhile, further theoretical analysis is provided to discuss why the STOK method is potentially more accurate than the ARIMA method for wind speed time series prediction. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the Non-Sep-Gneiting model by 9% and 7.2% in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE).},

This paper focuses on three different evaluation factors of ecological environment, economic development and public service to construct an evaluation model of environmental quality of livable cities. Then particle swarm optimization (PSO) is introduced to optimize the parameters of support vector machine (SVM), and a SVM algorithm based on PSO (PSO-SVM) is proposed to solve the livable city evaluation model.

In this paper, we introduce a distributed HetNet architecture in which the renewable-powered small cell BSs collaboratively exchange information and allocate the spectrum and power resources by themselves. Considering the uncertainty of the available spectrum, renewable energy supply and traffic loads, a stochastic optimization problem is formulated to maximize the energy efficiency for distributed small cell BSs. A distributed resource allocation algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal spectrum and power allocating strategies for each small cell.

  abstract     = {The unreasonable setting of urban bus stops is a common problem in real life, which seriously affects people’s happiness, sense of belonging and brand in the city. However, the existing related research on the above problems generally has the defects of high technical complexity and high cost. Therefore, we aim to propose a way to optimize the setting of urban public transportation stations and reduce the technical complexity and high cost of existing public transportation station optimization by using artificial intelligence algorithms. First, we extract and integrate bus GPS data and bus card swipe data in the business system and perform exploratory analysis on the pre-processed data. Second, the original k-NN algorithm is improved, and an ik-NN algorithm is proposed to determine the cardholder’s boarding point. Then, we divide the upstream and downstream lines to calculate the total number of upstream and downstream passengers. Third, we propose an algorithm for calculating the number of passengers getting off at bus stations and calculating the number of passengers getting on and off at each bus station. Finally, according to the number of passengers getting on and off at each bus station, the OD matrix is constructed, the residents’ travel rules are analyzed, and optimization suggestions for the setting of urban bus stations are proposed. This paper selects the public transit GPS data set and swipe card data set of Shenzhen, China for experiments. The experimental results show that: (1) Compared with K-means, the ik-NN algorithm we proposed can effectively determine the actual car station of each cardholder, and the algorithm is less sensitive to feature dimensions. At the same time, the ik-NN algorithm has a high operating efficiency and is less affected by the “ k ” value. (2) The calculation algorithm for the number of passengers getting off at bus stations can effectively use the existing data of the business system to determine the number of passengers getting off at each bus station. Therefore, the calculation times of this algorithm are low, and the accuracy is high. (3) The optimization suggestions for bus stations based on the OD matrix analysis of residents’ travel rules meet the needs of urban development and have certain reference value.},

  abstract     = {With the limitation of air traffic and the rapid increase in the number of flights, flight delay is becoming more frequent. Flight delay leads to financial and time losses for passengers and increases operating costs for airlines. Therefore, the establishment of an accurate prediction model for flight delay becomes vital to build an efficient airline transportation system. The air transportation system has a huge amount of data and complex operation modes, which is suitable for analysis by using machine learning methods. This paper discusses the factors that may affect the flight delay, and presents a new flight delay prediction model. The five warning levels are defined based on flight delay database by using K-means clustering algorithm. After extracting the key factors related to flight operation by the grey relational analysis (GRA) algorithm, an improved machine learning algorithm called GRA — Genetic algorithm (GA) — back propagation neural network, GRA-GA-BP, is introduced, which is optimized by GA. The calculation results show that, compared with models before optimization and other two algorithms in previous papers, the proposed prediction model based on GRA-GA-BP algorithm shows a higher prediction accuracy and more stability. In terms of operation efficiency and memory consumption, it also has good performance. The analysis presented in this paper indicates that this model can provide effective early warnings for flight delay, and can help airlines to intervene in flights with abnormal trend in advance.},

In this paper, we propose a Low-Rank Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (LR-NMF) method, which only uses the degraded underwater image as input to generate the more clear and realistic image. According to the underwater image formation model, the degraded underwater image could be separated into three parts, the directed component, the back and forward scattering components. The latter two parts can be considered as scattering. The directed component is constrained to have a low rank. After that, the restored underwater image is obtained. The quantitative and qualitative analyses illustrate that the proposed method performed equivalent or better than the state-of-the-art methods. Yet, it’s simple to implement without the training process.},

  abstract     = {Binary neural networks (BNNs) have drawn much attention because of the most promising techniques to meet the desired memory footprint and inference speed requirements. However, they still suffer from the severe intrinsic instability of the error convergence, resulting in increase in prediction error and its standard deviation, which is mostly caused by the inherently poor representation with only two possible values of − 1 and + 1. In this work, we have proposed a cost-aware layer-wise ensemble method to address the above issue without incurring any excessive costs, which is characterized by (1) layer-wise bagging and (2) cost-aware layer selection for the bagging. One of the experimental results has shown that the proposed method reduces the error and its standard deviation by 15% and 54% on CIFAR-10, respectively, compared to the BNN serving as a baseline. This paper demonstrated and discussed such error reduction and stability performance with high versatility based on the comparison results under the various cases of combinations of the network base model with the proposed and the state-of-the-art prior techniques while changing the network sizes and datasets of CIFAR-10, SVHN, and MNIST for the evaluation.},

  abstract     = {Detecting anomalous patterns in data is a relevant task in many practical applications, such as defective items detection in industrial inspection systems, cancer identification in medical images, or attacker detection in network intrusion detection systems. This paper focuses on detection of anomalous images, this is images that visually deviate from a reference set of regular data. While anomaly detection has been widely studied in the context of classical machine learning, the application of modern deep learning techniques in this field is still limited. We here propose a capsule-based network for anomaly detection in an extremely imbalanced fully supervised context: we assume that anomaly samples are available, but their amount is limited if compared to regular data. By using a variant of the standard CapsNet architecture, we achieved state-of-the-art results on the MNIST, F-MNIST and K-MNIST datasets.},

  abstract     = {The graph edit distance (GED) is a flexible distance measure which is widely used for inexact graph matching. Since its exact computation is 𝒩 𝒫 -hard, heuristics are used in practice. A popular approach is to obtain upper bounds for GED via transformations to the linear sum assignment problem with error-correction (LSAPE). Typically, local structures and distances between them are employed for carrying out this transformation, but recently also machine learning techniques have been used. In this paper, we formally define a unifying framework LSAPE-GED for transformations from GED to LSAPE. We also introduce rings, a new kind of local structures designed for graphs where most information resides in the topology rather than in the node labels. Furthermore, we propose two new ring-based heuristics RING and RING-ML , which instantiate LSAPE-GED using the traditional and the machine learning-based approach for transforming GED to LSAPE, respectively. Extensive experiments show that using rings for upper bounding GED significantly improves the state of the art on datasets where most information resides in the graphs’ topologies. This closes the gap between fast but rather inaccurate LSAPE-based heuristics and more accurate but significantly slower GED algorithms based on local search.},

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel center feature learning scheme to improve the update strategies of the traditional EM design for unsupervised RE-ID problems. First, the EM module is regarded as a center feature of a cluster of images, then the goal is transformed into pulling the similar images close to while pushing the dissimilar images away from the center feature space. Second, in order to provide effective guidelines on reducing static errors, we propose an error-memory module to improve the central feature learning performances. In addition, an error-prediction module is designed as well to ensure the stability of convergence. Besides, a camera-invariance learning strategy is also introduced to further improve the proposed algorithm. Finally, extensive comparative experiments are conducted on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and improvements of the proposed method over existing results.

Be that as it may, due to the fine-grained actions and objects in the real scene and the coexistence of multiple interactions in one scene, the problem is far from being solved. This paper differs from prior approaches, which focused only on the features of instances, by proposing a method that utilizes a four-stream CNNs network for human-object interaction (HOI) detection. More detailed visual features, spatial features and pose features from human-object pairs are extracted to solve the challenging task of detection in images. Specially, the core idea is that the region where people interact with objects contains important identifying cues for specific action classes, and the detailed cues can be fused to facilitate HOI recognition. Experiments on two large-scale HOI public benchmarks, V-COCO and HICO-DET, are carried out and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Short-term wind speed prediction is an essential task for wind resource and wind energy planning. However, most of this literature does not take into account the spatio-termporal correlation of wind data from the geographical field. For this reason, we propose an integrated spatio-temporal kriging and functional kriging strategy to exploit such spatio-temporal correlation into the wind speed prediction. First, the deterministic trend component in wind data is estimated to be removed. The residuals are used for spatio-temporal modeling and prediction. Based on the spatio-temporal kriging framework, four spatio-temporal covariance models (product-sum model, separable exponential product model, separable and nonseparable Gneiting models) are considered which describe the spatio-temporal correlation of wind data. In particular, the flexibility of using the nonseparable Gneiting model is highlighted. More specifically, four spatio-temporal random fields are modeled from the 12 wind monitoring stations over Ireland. We also use an involved weighted least squares method for estimating parameters of the four covariance models involved in the spatio-temporal kriging strategy. We apply the fitted covariance models to generate day-ahead wind speed predictions at both observed and nonobserved locations where wind station already exist but also to nearby locations. Leave-one-out cross-validation is applied to check the significance of the difference among the four models, these spatio-temporal ordinary kriging (STOK), functional ordinary kriging (FOK) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) methods are compared for day-ahead wind speed predictions. Forecasting results indicate that the predicting accuracy is improved almost 33.5% using FOK compared with three approaches which confirm the effectiveness of the functional kriging method in the paper.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal multiobjective problems (MMOPs) exist in scientific research and practical projects, and their Pareto solution sets correspond to the same Pareto front. Existing evolutionary algorithms often fall into local optima when solving such problems, which usually leads to insufficient search solutions and their uneven distribution in the Pareto front. In this work, an improved membrane algorithm is proposed for solving MMOPs, which is based on the framework of P system. More specifically, the proposed algorithm employs three elements from P system: object, reaction rule, and membrane structure. The object is implemented by real number coding and represents a candidate solution to the optimization problem to be solved. The function of the reaction rule of the proposed algorithm is similar to the evolution operation of the evolutionary algorithm. It can evolve the object to obtain a better candidate solution set. The membrane structure is the evolutionary logic of the proposed algorithm. It consists of several membranes, each of which is an independent evolutionary unit. This structure is used to maintain the diversity of objects, so that it provides multiple Pareto sets as output. The effectiveness verification study was carried out in simulation experiments. The simulation results show that compared with other experimental algorithms, the proposed algorithm has a competitive advantage in solving all 22 multimodal benchmark test problems in CEC2019.},

Latest advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning have opened the path for the success of numerous medical image analysis tasks, including the recognition of brain tumors. In this paper, we propose a simple architecture based on deep learning that results in strong generalization without needing much preprocessing. The proposed Multi-modal Squeeze and Excitation model (MSENet) receives multiple representations of a given tumor image, learns end-to-end and effectively predicts the severity level of tumor. Convolution feature descriptors from multiple deep pre-trained models are used to effectively describe the tumor images and are supplied as input to the proposed MSENet. The squeeze and excitation blocks of the MSENet allow the model to prioritize tumor regions while giving less emphasis to the rest of the image, serving as an attention mechanism in the model. The proposed model is evaluated on the benchmark brain tumor dataset that is publicly accessible from the Figshare repository. Experimental studies reveal that in terms of model parameters, the proposed approach is simple and leads to competitive performance compared to those of existing complex models. By increasing complexity, the proposed model leads to generalize better and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.05% on Figshare dataset. Compared to the existing models, the proposed model neither uses segmentation nor uses augmentation techniques and without much pre-processing achieves competitive performance.},

Based on tiny YOLOv3 algorithm, this paper realizes the detection of face with mask and face without mask, and proposes an improvement to the algorithm. First, the loss function of the bounding box regression is optimized, and the original loss function is optimized as the Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) loss. Second, the network structure is improved, the residual unit is introduced into the backbone to increase the depth of the network and the detection of two scales is expanded to three. Finally, the size of anchor boxes is clustered based on k -means algorithm.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we tackle the task of natural language video localization (NLVL): given an untrimmed video and a description language query, the goal is to localize the temporal segment within the video that best describes the natural language description. NLVL is challenging at the intersection of language and video understanding because a video may contain multiple segments of interests and the language may describe complicated temporal dependencies. Though existing approaches have achieved good performance, most of them did not fully consider the inherent differences between language and video modalities. Here, we propose Moment Relation Network (MRN) to reduce the divergence of the probability distribution of these two modalities. Specifically, MRN trains video and language subnets, and then uses transfer learning techniques to map the extracted features into an embedding-shared space where we calculate the similarity of two modalities using Mahalanobis distance metric, which is used to localize moments. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed MRN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art under the widely used metrics by a large margin.},

  abstract     = {The fact that the existing traffic sign images are easily affected by external factors, and the traffic signs are generally small targets on the images at different scales, has made it difficult in feature extraction when doing traffic sign detection. To achieve better detection results, a multi-target traffic sign detection method with channel attention and feature fusion network (CAFFNet in short) is proposed. This method effectively learns the correlation between feature channels through a lightweight channel attention network, realizes local cross-channel interaction without dimensionality reduction, and enhances the representation ability of the network. The feature pyramid network is used to achieve feature fusion and generate high-resolution multiscale semantic information. The dilated convolution is utilized to capture the multiscale context information to narrow the difference between features and improve the detection effect of the model. The experimental results show that the proposed method on the two datasets GTSDB and CTSD has achieved superior performance in the evaluation criteria compared with the existing detection algorithms.},

First, a 3D convolutional neural networks (3D CNN) model which performs pre-training operation and fine-tuning strategy is employed to extract the spatiotemporal features of videos. It is first pre-trained on UCF-101 datasets to train model with initial parameters. Then, a small new dataset is employed to fine-tune the initial model for the training of the new model. Once features are extracted by the final CNNs model, distance measure can be adopted to calculate the similarities between the query video and the test dataset for the video search. The searched video is returned and ranked according to the priority when it has higher similarity with the query video. The comparison results in the experiment shows that the search method using fine-tuning obtains better performance than the method without using fine-tuning. Second, the classification results based on the 3D CNN model using fine-tuning are also presented for the consideration of a query by keyword. Accuracy result obtained using the model with the help of fine-tuning is approximately 2.8% higher than that without using fine-tuning.},

To achieve real-time inference, we implement the proposed model on the GPU as a natural choice for the implementation of deep learning-based models. Also, we build large traffic signs detection dataset. The dataset contains 10 000 images captured from the Chinese roads under real-world factors like lightning, occlusion, complex background, etc. 73 traffic sign classes were considered in this dataset.

This work proposes an Improved Ring Radius Transform (IRRT) for reconstructing impaired characters through medial axis prediction. At first, the technique proposes a novel idea based on the Tangent Vector (TV) concept that identifies each actual pair of end pixels caused by gaps in impaired character components. Next, the actual direction to predict medial axis pixels using IRRT for each pair of end pixels is proposed with a new normal vector concept. The process of prediction repeats iteratively to find all the medial axis pixels for every gap in question. Further, medial axis pixels with their radii are used to reconstruct the shapes of impaired characters. The proposed technique is tested on benchmark datasets consisting of video, natural scenes, objects and multi-lingual data to demonstrate that it reconstructs shapes well, even for heterogeneous data. Comparative studies with different binarization and character recognition methods show that the proposed technique is effective, useful and outperforms existing methods.},

It also an integral component during life processes of various organisms, for instance, DNA recombination, replication, and so on. Recognition of such proteins helps medical researchers pinpoint the cause of disease. Traditional techniques of identifying DNA-binding proteins are expensive and time-consuming. Machine learning methods can identify these proteins quickly and efficiently. However, the accuracies of the existing related methods were not high enough. In this paper, we propose a framework to identify DNA-binding proteins. The proposed framework first uses PseKNC (ps), MomoKGap (mo), and MomoDiKGap (md) methods to combine three algorithms to extract features. Further, we apply Adaboost weight ranking to select optimal feature subsets from the above three types of features. Based on the selected features, three algorithms (k-nearest neighbor (knn), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)) are applied to classify it. Finally, three predictors for identifying DNA-binding proteins are established, including ps + mm , ps + md , ps + mm + md . We utilize benchmark and independent datasets to train and evaluate the proposed framework. Three tests are performed, including Jackknife test, 10-fold cross-validation and independent test. Among them, the accuracy of ps+md is the highest. We named the model with the best result as psmdDBPs and applied it to identify DNA-binding proteins.},

According to its influence on the performance of the algorithm, the time factor is varied with population diversity parameters to balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the particle swarm, so as to adjust the convergence speed of the algorithm, then it follows that a better convergence performance will be obtained.

Currently, PVC schemes incorporating the just noticeable distortion (JND) model can obtain better performance gain in all PVC schemes. To further accelerate the JND computation for real-time video coding applications (e.g. surveillance video coding and conference video coding), this paper proposes a fast perceptual surveillance video coding (PSVC) scheme based on background model-driven JND estimation method. First, to utilize the surveillance scene characteristics, the computation complexity of JND estimation can be significantly decreased by reusing the content complexity of background regions. Then we apply the perceptive video coding scheme into the background modeling-based surveillance video codec. The proposed scheme adopts background modeling frame as background anchor. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can yield remarkable time saving of 42.33% maximum and on average 34.76% with approximate bitrate reductions and similar subjective quality, compared to HEVC and other state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {With rapid development of intelligent video surveillance systems based on cloud computing devices and edge computing devices in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems, massive surveillance video data has brings enormous challenge for video storage and transmission. However, existing surveillance video coding approaches hardly utilize intelligent video analysis results for improving video coding. This paper proposed a surveillance video coding scheme for traffic scene based on vehicle knowledge and shared library by cloud-edge computing in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems. Firstly, in order to provide the object library for synchronous application at the encode and decode side offline, a generation method of shared long-term foreground reference object library is proposed by using the existing large-scale monitoring vehicle object datasets. Then, to meet the requirement of low complexity and high-performance coding, a virtual foreground reference picture generation method with coding-oriented object retrieval is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can obtain the satisfactory effect of the virtual foreground reference picture. Also, it can yield remarkable bit rate reductions, compared to HEVC.},

  abstract     = {In order to discover the difference among dual strategies, we propose an alternating primal-dual algorithm (APDA) that can be considered as a general version for minimizing problem which is multiple-summed separable convex but not necessarily smooth. First, the original multiple-summed problem is transformed into two subproblems. Second, one subproblem is solved in the primal space and the other is solved in the dual space. Finally, the alternating direction method is executed between the primal and the dual part. Furthermore, the classical alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is extended to solve the primal subproblem which is also multiple summed, therefore, the extended ADMM can be seen as a parallel method for the original problem. Thanks to the flexibility of APDA, different dual strategies for image restoration are analyzed. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method performs better than some existing algorithms in terms of both speed and accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Recognition of hand activities of daily living (hand-ADL) is useful in the areas of human–computer interactions, lifelogging, and healthcare applications. However, developing a reliable human activity recognition (HAR) system for hand-ADL with only a single wearable sensor is still a challenge due to hand movements that are typically transient and sporadic. Approaches based on deep learning methodologies to reduce noise and extract relevant features directly from raw data are becoming more promising for implementing such HAR systems. In this work, we present an ARMA-based deep autoencoder and a deep recurrent network (RNN) using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for recognition of hand-ADL using signals from a single IMU wearable sensor. The integrated ARMA-based autoencoder denoises raw time-series signals of hand activities, such that better representation of human hand activities can be made. Then, our deep RNN-GRU recognizes seven hand-ADL based upon the output of the autoencoder: namely, Open Door, Close Door, Open Refrigerator, Close Refrigerator, Open Drawer, Close Drawer, and Drink from Cup. The proposed methodology using RNN-GRU with autoencoder achieves a mean accuracy of 84.94% and F1-score of 83.05% outperforming conventional classifiers such as RNN-LSTM, BRNN-LSTM, CNN, and Hybrid-RNNs by 4–10% higher in both accuracy and F1-score. The experimental results also showed the use of the autoencoder improves both the accuracy and F1-score of each conventional classifier by 12.8% in RNN-LSTM, 4.37% in BRNN-LSTM, 15.45% CNN, 14.6% Hybrid RNN, and 12.4% for the proposed RNN-GRU.},

Sorting images are not very clear due to factors such as the enclosed environment and the weak lighting conditions of the warehouse. First, the dual tree complex wavelet transform is used to preprocess the sorting image for noise reduction and other image preprocessing. Second, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed. On the basis of Alexnet neural network, parameters of convolutional layer, ReLU layer and pooling layer of CNN are redefined to accelerate the learning speed of neural network. Lastly, according to the new image classification task, the last three layers of the neural network, the full connection layer, the softmax layer and the classification output layer are defined to adapt to the new image recognition. The proposed fast sorting image recognition technology based on deep learning has higher training speed and recognition accuracy in the face of more complicated sorting image recognition, which can meet the experimental requirements.

Subsequently, the concept of mean impact value (MIV) is defined and the influence degree of input variables on output variables for SVM network based on MIV is calculated. The importance weights of the features described with MIV are sorted by descending order. Finally, the SVM classifier is used to implement feature selection according to the classification accuracy of feature combination which takes MIV order of feature as a reference. The simulation experiments are carried out with three standard data sets of UCI, and the results show that this method can not only effectively reduce the feature dimension and high classification accuracy, but also ensure good robustness.},

This paper intends to find an admissible solution for these challenges. The solution suggested in this paper applies the support vector data descriptor (SVDD) for sampling both minority and majority classes. After determining the optimal number of base classifiers, the selected samples are utilized to adjust base classifiers. Finally, genetic algorithm optimization is used in order to find the optimum weights of each base classifier in the voting stage. The proposed method is compared with some existing algorithms.

Considering the large volume, high dimensionality and continuous accumulation features of time series, there is limited capability to perform in-depth similarity searching directly on the raw time series data. Therefore, time series representation, which can provide the dimension reduction-based approximate results for the raw data, should be utilized in the first step for streaming TSR. However, the existing representation-based TSR methods mainly have two limitations: on the one hand, the representation efficiency of the current methods is too slow to adapt for real-time streaming time series representation; on the other hand, the retrieval efficiency of them is also not ideal, and thus fails to recognize the specific given sequence patterns on the streaming data effectively. In this paper, we present an efficient retrieval method on streaming time series. Concretely, our method can incrementally represent the features of streaming data to automatically prune the corresponding dissimilar sequences and retain the most similar candidates for efficient one-pass searching. Extensive experiments on real world datasets have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our method.},

  abstract     = {White blood cells (WBCs) play a main role in identifying the health condition and disease characteristics of a normal person. An automated classification system is capable of recognizing white blood cells that may help doctors to diagnose several diseases like malaria, anemia, leukemia, etc. Automated blood cell analysis allows fast and accurate outcomes and often involves broad data without performance negotiation. The state-of-the-art systems use a lot of different stages (feature extraction, segmentation, pre-processing, etc.) to provide the automated blood cell analysis using blood smear images which is a lengthy process. To overcome these problems, this paper presents an efficient peripheral blood cell image recognition and classification using a combination of the salp swarm algorithm and the cat swarm optimization (SSPSO) algorithm-based optimized convolutional neural networks (SSPSO-CNN) method. This paper uses the CNN approach to classify five peripheral blood cells such as eosinophil, basophil, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils without any human intervention. The other objective of this paper is to propose an improved version of salp swarm optimizer (SSO) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to attain competitive classification performance over the database of the blood cell images. In this paper, the CNN uses VGG19 architecture for training purposes. The accuracy of the classification achieved with VGG19 models is 98%. The proposed model based on the CNN approach optimized by SSPSO achieves high classification accuracy and provides automatic peripheral blood cell classification. This method establishes the fine-tuning process to develop a classifier trained using 10 674 images obtained from medical practice. The proposed method augmented the performance in terms of high precision and F 1-score and obtained an overall classification accuracy of 99%.},

  abstract     = {In order to enhance the sense of reality haptic display based on image, it is widely expected to express various characteristics of the objects in the image using different kinds of haptic feedback. To this end, a multi-mode haptic display method of image was proposed in this paper, including the multi-feature extraction of image and the image expression with various types of haptic rendering. First, the device structure integrating force and vibrotactile feedbacks was designed for multi-mode haptic display. Meanwhile, the three-dimensional geometric shape, detail texture and outline of the object in the image were extracted by various image processing algorithms. Then, a rendering method for the object in the image was proposed based on the psychophysical experiments on the piezoelectric ceramic actuator. The 3D geometric shape, detail texture and outline of the object were rendered by force and vibration tactile feedbacks, respectively. Finally, these three features of the image were haptic expressed simultaneously by the integrated device. Haptic perception experiment results show that the multi-mode haptic display method can effectively improve the authenticity of haptic perception.},

However, there are still issues in terrain synthesis where synthesis results are difficult to control and not realistic enough. To address these problems, this paper proposes an interactive terrain elevation map generation method based on the synthesis of a single sample terrain elevation map. First, we propose a method to extract the skeleton from a terrain elevation map and a user sketch. Second, we construct a skeleton sample feature map based on the terrain elevation map and the user sketch. Finally, we propose a matching cost function to match image patches of the terrain sample and the user sketch. The proposed method can obtain a synthesis result containing the features of both the terrain sample and the user sketch, and then generates a synthetic terrain elevation map. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, where the synthesized results can meet the needs of users.},

The problem of particle degradation could be always found in traditional particle filtering, and a large number of particles are additionally required for accurate estimation. It is difficult to meet the requirements of a modern infrared imaging guidance system for accurate target tracking. To solve the problem of particle degradation and improve the performance of infrared target tracking, the extended Kalman filter and genetic algorithm are introduced into particle filtering, and an improved algorithm for infrared target tracking is proposed in this paper. In the framework of a particle filter algorithm, the Gaussian distribution for each particle is generated and propagated by a separate extended Kalman filter to improve the sampling accuracy and effectiveness of the probability density function of particles. Genetic algorithm is used to perform a resampling process to solve particle degradation and ensure the diversity of particle states in particle swarm. Simulation results show that the improved tracking algorithm based on improved particle filtering proposed in this paper can effectively solve the phenomenon of particle degradation and track the infrared target.},

  abstract     = {Recent research has shown that features obtained from pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models can be promptly applied to a variety of problems they were not originally designed to solve. This concept, often referred to as Transfer Learning (TL), is a common practice when labeled data is limited. In some fields, such as video anomaly detection, TL is still an underexplored subject in the sense that it is not clear whether the architecture of the pretrained CNN model impacts on the video anomaly detection performance. In order to clarify this issue, we perform an extensive benchmark using 12 different pretrained CNN models on ImageNet as feature extractors and apply the features obtained to seven video anomaly detection benchmark datasets. This work presents some interesting findings about video anomaly detection using TL. The highlights of our findings were revealed by our experiments, which have shown that a simple classification process using One-Class Support Vector Machines yields similar results to state-of-the-art models. Moreover, a statistical analysis suggests that architectural differences are negligible when choosing a pretrained model for video anomaly detection, since all models presented similar performance. At last, we present an in-depth visual analysis of the Avenue dataset, and reveal several aspects that may be limiting the performance of state-of-the-art video anomaly detection methods.},

The key challenge of cross-modal retrieval is to learn more discriminative representations between different category, as well as expand to an unseen class retrieval in the open world retrieval task. To tackle the above problem, in this paper, we propose a prototype learning-based discriminative feature learning (PLDFL) to learn more discriminative representations in a common space. First, we utilize a prototype learning algorithm to cluster these samples labeled with the same semantic class, by jointly taking into consideration the intra-class compactness and inter-class sparsity without discriminative treatments. Second, we use the weight-sharing strategy to model the correlations of cross-modal samples to narrow down the modality gap. Finally, we apply the prototype to achieve class-incremental learning to prove the robustness of our proposed approach. According to our experimental results, significant retrieval performance in terms of mAP can be achieved on average compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.},

Ocean is an improvement over conventional algorithms regarding both distance metric and the clustering mechanism. Ocean defines the distance between two categories as the difference in the relative densities of categories. Unlike existing approaches, Ocean neither assigns the same distance to all pairs of categories, nor assigns arbitrary weights to matches and mismatches between categories that can lead to clustering errors. Ocean uses density ratios of adjacent regions in multidimensional space to detect the edges of the clusters. Ocean is robust against clusters of identical patterns. Unlike conventional approaches, Ocean neither makes any assumption regarding the data distribution within clusters, nor requires tuning of free parameters. Empirical evaluations demonstrate improved performance of Ocean over existing approaches.},

Already known methods for detecting defects on such inhomogeneous, voluminous surfaces use mainly supervised methods based on deep neural networks and require lots of labeled training data. In contrast, we present a novel unsupervised method, based on SURF keypoints, that does not require any training data. We propose using their location, number and orientation in order to group them into geographically close clusters. Keypoint clusters also indicate the exact position of the defect at the same time. We furthermore compared our approach to supervised methods using deep learning. The presented processing pipeline shows how normalization and classification methods need to be combined, in order to reliably detect fiber defects such as cuts and holes. We evaluate the performance of our system in real-world settings with images of piles of textiles, taken in stereo vision. Our results show that our novel unsupervised classification method using keypoint clustering achieves comparable results to other supervised methods.},

Since detection of bare hand is affected by nonideal conditions, multiple color-texture features are analyzed in this study. In the second stage of the system, 18 new ASCII characters are introduced and analyzed along with the existing 40 characters (alphabets, numbers, and arithmetic operators). New 15 dimensional features are introduced along with the existing features to enhance the classification accuracy of the gestures. Significance of features statistically tested using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Kruskal–Wallis and Friedman test, which are sequentially ranked and evaluated using incremental feature selection (IFS) method. Performance of the proposed hand detection system is observed to be 12.5% higher than the existing hand detection system under clean conditions, while 46.4% higher under the nonideal conditions. Performance of 58 gestures classification model has improved by 12.08% (Naïve Bayes), 8.86% (ELM), 10.83% (SVM), 8.02% ( k NN), and 6.61% (ANN) after using the new features.

Moreover, the recognition rate of most current flight posture information methods is low. In this paper, the principle of vibration haptic coding is optimized. A combined coding scheme of “vibration position + vibration mode + vibration sequence” is used to recognize pilot’s flight posture. A novel triangular coding scheme is proposed for the first time. Compared to other commonly used coding schemes such as “needle scheme“ and “rectangle scheme”, experimental results show that the triangular coding scheme is 1.5% more accuracy with response time reduced by nearly 1.25s in recognition pilots’ flight posture information.},

In detail, first we design an experiment scheme by connecting the pneumatic artificial muscle to the differential pressure sensor through two pressure tubes; then the axial and radial impact signals are acquired via the impact experiments under different work conditions (impact strength, internal pressure, load, and impact position); finally, the identification of the axial and radial impact signals are achieved based on the autocorrelation technique with a well-selected threshold.

In this study, the prediction model of heat transfer and heat resistance of the heat pipe intercooler is established based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Then the performance of the heat pipe intercooler from heat transfer and heat resistance aspects is investigated. The average relative error between the heat transfer prediction model and the test value is 3.6%, and the average relative error between the resistance prediction model and the test value is 12.68%, which shows that the prediction model can predict the thermal performance of heat pipe intercooler more accurately. Finally, the proposed model is applied to optimize the structural parameters of the heat pipe intercooler, and the optimal parameters are obtained accordingly.

First, we identify a list of Indonesian phonemes according to the initial-final structure of Chinese language. Based on this, we add zero-initials that match the Indonesian acoustic performance and HTS, which can make the synthesized speech natural and smooth. Second, we consider Indonesian phonemes as synthetic units to synthesize speech through the triphone and full-context lab. In addition, we design context properties of the full-context lab and the corresponding question set to train the acoustic model, which can eliminate machine sounds. Experimental results suggest that the accuracy of phoneme segmentation (PSA) and the naturalness of speech synthesis (SSN) are significantly improved via PFHTS-IDSS. Especially, the PSA of selecting phonemes as synthetic units reaches 88.3% and the corresponding SSN based on full-context lab is 4.1. The results demonstrated by PFHTS-IDSS presented in this paper may be used in multilingual free interactive system to promote better communication in terms of voice navigation, intelligent speaker and question-answering system.},

  abstract     = {Brain tumors have high morbidity and may lead to highly lethal cancer. In clinics, accurate segmentation of tumors is the means for diagnosis and determination of subsequent treatment options. Due to the irregularity and blurring of tumor boundaries, accurately segmenting the tumor lesions has received extensive attention in medical image analysis. In view of this situation, this paper proposed a brain tumor segmentation method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). The GAN architecture consists of a densely connected three-dimensional (3D) U-Net used for segmentation and a classification network for discrimination, both of which use 3D convolutions to fuse multi-dimensional context information. The densely connected 3D U-Net model introduces a dense connection to accelerate network convergence, extracting more detailed information. The adversarial training makes the distribution of segmentation results closer to that of labeled data, which enables the network to segment some unexpected small tumor subregions. Alternately, train two networks and finally achieve a highly accurate classification of each voxel. The experiments conducted on BraTS2017 brain tumor MRI dataset show that the proposed method has higher accuracy in brain tumor segmentation.},

In Document Image Analysis (DIA), selecting threshold is not trivial since it differs from one problem (dataset) to another. Instead of trying several different thresholds for one dataset to another, we consider noise inherency of document images in our proposed binarization scheme. The proposed stochastic architecture implements the local thresholding technique: Niblack’s binarization algorithm. We introduce a stochastic comparator circuit that works on unipolar stochastic numbers. Unlike the conventional stochastic circuit, it is simple and easy to deploy. We implemented it on the Xilinx Virtex6 XC6VLX760-2FF1760 FPGA platform and received encouraging experimental results. The complete set of results are available upon request.

Firstly, six color channels from RGB model and HSV model were obtained, and six channels of all pixels were laid out to six columns. Then one of these channels was regarded as label and the others were regarded as sample features. These data were grouped for linear discrimination analysis, and the mapping values of the other five channels were applied to the eigen vector space according to the first three big eigen values. Secondly, the mapping value was used as the input data for K-means and the points with minimum and maximum pixel values were used as the initial cluster center, which overcame the randomness for selecting the initial cluster center in K-means. And the segmented pixels were changed into background and foreground, so that the proposed segmentation method became the clustering of two classes for background and foreground. Finally, the experimental result showed that the segmentation effect of the proposed LDA mapping-based method is better than those of K-means, ExR and CIVE methods.},

  abstract     = {The annotation-free word spotting method that is proposed in this paper makes document images searchable without requiring any labeled training data. Thus, our method supports the exploration of a document collection directly without demanding any manual efforts from the users for the preparation of a training dataset. Our method works in the query-by-example scenario where the user selects an exemplary occurrence of the query word. Afterwards, the entire collection of document images is searched according to visual similarity to the query. The proposed method requires only minimal assumptions about the visual appearance of text. This is achieved by processing document images as a whole without requiring a given segmentation of the images on word level or on line level. Therefore, the method is also segmentation-free . Word size variabilities can be handled by representing the sequential structure of text with a statistical sequence model. In order to make the computationally costly application of the sequence model feasible in practice, regions are retrieved according to approximate similarity with an efficient model decoding algorithm. Re-ranking these regions according to the visual similarity obtained with the sequence model leads to highly accurate word spotting results. The method is evaluated on five benchmark datasets. In the segmentation-free query-by-example scenario where no annotated training data is available, the method outperforms all other methods that have been evaluated on any of these five benchmarks.},

The DLAE has definite advantage over the baseline Autoencoders. During the training phase, the proposed DLAE reconstructs the phonological features in an unsupervised fashion and the latent bottleneck features are extracted from the Encoder.

First, the VAE model is used to obtain the distribution of the original normal sample data represented by the low-dimensional code; the reconstruction error of the VAE model is merged into the new input. Then, using OCSVM’s hinge-loss objective function and the random Fourier feature fitting radial basis function (RBF) kernel method, the OCSVM model is represented and solved using the deep neural network and gradient descent method. Finally, the decision function of the OCSVM model is constructed by using the solved parameter information to realize the detection of abnormal data.

A flag array is created to avoid repeated calculation in the termination strategy. The subpixel positioning accuracy is ensured by applying the surface fitting method. The robustness of the algorithm is ensured by applying the zero-mean normalized cross correlation. Simulation results demonstrate that the average extraction error of the improved PSO algorithm is less than 1%. Compared with the commonly used three-step search algorithm, diamond search algorithm, and local search algorithm, the improved PSO algorithm consumes the least number of search points. Moreover, tests on real-world image sequences show good estimation accuracy at very low computational cost.

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to objectively present the development and trend of international MOOC research. Metadata taken from 660 literature records is used to visualize the state of MOOC research. The records were published between 2008 and 2018, and Citespace software is employed to visualize key data about the research contained on the SCI and SSCI platform. It has the following findings. First, since 2012, the number of international MOOC research papers and cited frequency has shown an upward trend. The research force was mainly concentrated in North America, Europe and Asia, and the publishing institutions were mainly concentrated in Universities of various countries, and formed a more obvious international cooperation network. Second, journals such as ≪ INT REV RES OPEN DIS ≫ and ≪ COMPUTERS &amp; EDUCATION ≫ are the foundational literatures of MOOC research. George Siemens, Stephen Downes, John Daniel and others have made important contributions to the foundation research of MOOC. Third, Breslow, Liyanagunawardena et al. were cited more frequently and formed eight research clusters such as teaching interaction, relativism/behaviorism theory, individualized learning and diversified education. Fourth, distance education, online learning, learning situation analysis, curriculum construction and platform construction are the hot topics of international MOOC research in the recent decade. Fifth, the development of international MOOC has spread to various disciplines and promoted the interdisciplinary research of environment, biology, medicine, philosophy, psychology and other disciplines.},

For a large dataset, the number of clusters may be huge, and it is a great challenge to explore in this huge space. People usually have a more comprehensive understanding of some data. For example, they think that data A is better than data B, but they do not know which attributes are important. Therefore, a powerful interactive analysis tool can help people greatly improve the effectiveness of exploratory clustering analysis. This paper provides a visual analysis method for sorting and classifying multivariate data. It can determine the weight of each attribute through user’s interaction, thus, generating sorting, and then complete classification according to sorting results. Through visual display, users can understand the characteristics of data as well as category characteristics intuitively and quickly, and it helps users improve sorting and classification results.},

  abstract     = {Innovative applications in rapidly evolving domains such as robotic navigation and autonomous (driverless) vehicles rely on binocular computer vision systems that meet stringent response time and accuracy requirements. A key problem in these vision systems is stereo matching, which involves matching pixels from two input images in order to construct the output, a 3D map. Building upon the existing local stereo matching algorithms, this paper proposes a novel stereo matching algorithm that is based on a weighted guided filtering foundation. The proposed algorithm consists of three main steps; each step is designed with the goal of improving accuracy. First, the matching costs are computed using a unique combination of complementary methods (absolute difference, Census, and gradient algorithms) to reduce errors. Second, the costs are aggregated using an adaptive weighted guided image filtering method. Here, the regularization parameters are adjusted adaptively using the Canny method, further reducing errors. Third, a disparity map is generated using the winner-take-all strategy; this map is subsequently refined using a densification method to reduce errors. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm provides a higher level of accuracy in comparison to a collection of the existing state-of-the-art local algorithms.},

First, focusing on the “staircase effect”, a nonconvex functional was introduced into the energy functional model for smooth denoising. Second, the validity and accuracy of the model were established by proving that there was no global minimum in the solution space of the nonconvex energy functional model; the improved model was then used to obtain a smooth and clear image edge while maintaining the edge integrity. Third, the smooth image obtained from the nonconvex energy functional model was combined with the level set model to obtain the anisotropic diffusion gray level set model. The optimal outline of the target was obtained by calculating the minimum value of the energy functional. Finally, an anisotropic diffusion equation with nonconvex energy functional model was built in this algorithm to segment noise image accurately and quickly. A series of comparative experiments on the proposed algorithm and similar algorithms were conducted. The results showed that the proposed algorithm had strong noise resistance and provided precise segmentation for noise image.},

  abstract     = {Underwater image capturing is a challenging task due to attenuation of light in water. Scattering and absorption are the results of light attenuation which lead to faded colors and reduced contrast of images, respectively. To deal with these issues and to provide better visual quality image, various enhancement methods have been proposed. This paper proposes the Dual Domain-based Underwater Image Enhancement (DDUIE) method. DDUIE method provides contrast stretching in approximation band of discrete wavelet transformed image followed by intensity adjustment of different color channels in spatial domain. To further improve the color quality, the image is processed in HSV (Hue–Saturation–Value) color space. Result analysis indicates better results for DDUIE method over state-of-the-art methods. Subjective results of DDUIE method show minimization of the bluish-green effect and reduction of nonuniform illumination up to a certain extent. These lead to enhanced color and image details. Quantitative results show that the Underwater Image Quality Measure (UIQM) and Underwater Color Image Quality Evaluation (UCIQE) values between 1 and 2 and between 0 and 1 have been achieved, respectively, which significantly illustrate that images have been enhanced efficiently and also entropy values between 7 and 8 depict the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of image details.},

This paper proposes a supervoxel-based point cloud segmentation algorithm in region growing principle to solve the issues of inaccurate boundaries and nonsmooth segments in the existing methods. To begin with, the input point cloud is voxelized and then pre-segmented into sparse supervoxels by flow constrained clustering, considering the spatial distance and local geometry between voxels. Afterwards, plane fitting is applied to the over-segmented supervoxels and seeds for region growing are selected with respect to the fitting residuals. Starting from pruned seed patches, adjacent supervoxels are merged in region growing style to form the final segments, according to the normalized similarity measure that integrates the smoothness and shape constraints of supervoxels. We determine the values of parameters via experimental tests, and the final results show that, by voxelizing and pre-segmenting the point clouds, the proposed algorithm is robust to noises and can obtain smooth segmentation regions with accurate boundaries in high efficiency.},

Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a kernel method whereby nonlinear mapping relationships in data can be learned. However, the traditional Gaussian kernel function used in GPR is isotropic and fails to capture complex image structures. Accordingly, the structure information of image patches, termed steering kernel coefficients (SKCs), is extracted by a steering kernel function. After patches with similar structure are clustered according to their SKCs, an anisotropic automatic-relevance-determination (ARD) kernel function is used to learn the model for each cluster. Aiming at learning a structure-sensitive GPR model, we integrate the SKCs and ARD to achieve improved performance for GPR-based SR. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively capture the structural relevance of image patches and yield promising results.},

However, the learning strategy is ineffective when dealing with highly complex problems. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization algorithm based on a multidimensional mean learning strategy is proposed. In this algorithm, an opposition-based learning strategy is utilized to initialize the population to enhance the exploitation capability. Furthermore, the historical best positions of all the particles are reconstructed in a vertical crossover manner that is based on the mean information of multiple optimal dimensions to generate the guiding particles. Additionally, an improved inertia weight is used to further guide all the particle movements to balance the capability of the proposed algorithm for global exploration and local exploitation. The proposed algorithm is tested on 12 benchmark functions and is compared with some well-known PSO algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm obtains more competitive optimal solution compared with other PSO algorithms when solving high-dimensional complex problems.},

The doctors generally utilize chest X-rays and Computed Tomography (CT) scans to diagnose pneumonia, lung inflammation, abscesses, and/or enlarged lymph nodes. Since COVID-19 attacks the epithelial cells that line our respiratory tract, therefore, X-ray images are utilized in this paper, to classify the patients with infected (COVID-19 + ve) and uninfected (COVID-19 − ve) lungs. Almost all hospitals have X-ray imaging machines, therefore, the chest X-ray images can be used to test for COVID-19 without utilizing any kind of dedicated test kits. However, the chest X-ray-based COVID-19 classification requires a radiology expert and significant time, which is precious when COVID-19 infection is increasing at a rapid rate. Therefore, the development of an automated analysis approach is desirable to save the medical professionals’ valuable time. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approach is designed and implemented. Besides, the hyper-parameters of CNN are tuned using Multi-objective Adaptive Differential Evolution (MADE). Extensive experiments are performed by considering the benchmark COVID-19 dataset. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed technique outperforms the competitive machine learning models in terms of various performance metrics.},

Through the statistical analysis of the real historical traffic data obtained in a city scale spanning across multiple months, this paper makes an in-depth study of the temporal characteristics and behavior rules of the model data traffic. Considering that the time series data show different changing rules under the different time dimensions, spatial dimensions and independent dimensions, a multi-dimensional recurrent neural network (MDRNN) prediction model is established to predict the future cell traffic volume over various temporal and spatial dimensions. The data of this paper are trained and tested over real data of a city, and the granularity of the proposed prediction model can be drilled down to the cell level. Compared with the traditional trend fitting method, the proposed model achieves mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) reduction of 6.56%, and provides guidance for energy efficiency optimization and power consumption reduction of base stations in various temporal and spatial dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Being a class of effective feature descriptors for action recognition, action representations based on skeleton sequences have yielded excellent recognition results. Most methods used to construct these action representations are based on the information from all the joint positions in actions. Unfortunately, some joints in the actions do not improve the accuracy of action recognition, and may even cause unnecessary inter-class errors. In this study, the authors propose a new method for action recognition by selecting active joints which are closely related to the movement of the body as the first step. Further, a skeleton is characterized as a set of its active-joint positions, and the set can be mapped to a point on pre-shape space to filter out the scale and translation variability. Then, a skeleton sequence (an action) can be regarded as points on the space. Because the timing-sequence relationship between skeletons is very valuable for action recognition, a tensor-based linear dynamical system (tLDS) is employed to model the temporal information of the action. To avoid using a finite-order sequence to estimate the infinite-order feature descriptor of a tLDS, the descriptor is mapped to a point on an infinite Grassmannian composed of the extended observability subspaces. The action is classified using sparse coding and dictionary learning (SCDL) on the infinite Grassmannian. Experimental results demonstrate that the recognition accuracies of the proposed method outperform state-of-the-art ones on four different action datasets.},

Knowing the relative site and size of a tumor within the skull is helpful to a doctor. The contours obtained by the segmentation method proposed in this study are quantitatively compared with the contours drawn by doctors on the same image set since the ground truth is unknown. The experimental results are impressive.},

  abstract     = {Electrophysiological signals can effectively reflect various physiological states of human body, and provide favorable basis for medical diagnosis. However, the correct analysis of electrophysiological signals requires professional medical diagnosis experience. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent diagnosis methods based on deep learning are gradually applied in the medical field in order to reduce the dependence of diagnosis results on medical experience. Deep learning has made remarkable achievements in the field of image processing, through which deeper information can be extracted than through time-series signals. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of 2DECG diagnosis based on Faster R-CNN (Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network). First, the time-series ECG signal is transformed into two-dimensional curve. Then, the Faster R-CNN model based on beat is obtained by using dataset training. Finally, three kinds of ECG diseases are diagnosed by the Faster R-CNN model. The test results show that compared with the effect of one-dimensional CNN, the method proposed in this paper has high diagnosis accuracy and can help doctors to diagnose diseases more intuitively.},

  abstract     = {Community detection is a well-established problem and nontrivial task in complex network analysis. The goal of community detection is to discover community structures in complex networks. In recent years, many existing works have been proposed to handle this task, particularly nonnegative matrix factorization-based method, e.g. HNMF, BNMF, which is interpretable and can learn latent features of complex data. These methods usually decompose the original matrix into two matrixes, in one matrix, each column corresponds to a representation of community and each column of another matrix indicates the membership between overall pairs of communities and nodes. Then they discover the community by updating the two matrices iteratively and learn the shallow feature of the community. However, these methods either ignore the topological structure characteristics of the community or ignore the microscopic community structure properties. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Modularized Deep NonNegative Matrix Factorization (MDNMF) for community detection, which preserves both the topology information and the instinct community structure properties of the community. The experimental results show that our proposed models can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches on several well-known dataset.},

Greenhouse electric working robots are industrial production tools with automatic control technology as the core, which affects the quality of industrial products and thus affects the profitability of the factory. According to the set programming work, the greenhouse electric working robot can realize the reproduction production and reduce the workload of the workers. In today’s era, the industrial production steps are more complicated, the production process is more flexible, and the robot’s unchanging posture and movement cannot meet the needs of modern industry, which restricts the development of the factory.

This paper established an active positioning machine vision system for precise positioning of robot parts greenhouse electric working stations.

This paper explains the importance of cyclic distribution by comparing APM-LDPC codes with QC-LDPC codes. Then a particular form of APM-LDPC codes is proposed and researched. The new codes can low down the cycle-distribution to larger extent. In the following research, an effective method, which constructs the new codes with fixed girth, is proposed.

To achieve discriminative information that is not sensitive to object appearance change, it combines dimensionality-reduced Histogram of Oriented Gradients features and Lab color features, which can be used to exploit the complementary characteristics robustly. Based on the idea of multi-resolution pyramid theory, a multi-scale model of the object is constructed, and the optimal scale for tracking the object is found according to the confidence maps’ response peaks of different sizes. For the case that tracking failure can easily occur when there exists inappropriate updating in the model, it detects occlusion based on whether the occlusion rate of the response peak corresponding to the best object state is less than a set threshold. At the same time, Kalman filter is used to record the motion feature information of the object before occlusion, and predict the state of the object disturbed by occlusion, which can achieve robust tracking of the object affected by occlusion influence. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling various internal and external interferences under challenging environments.},

Falling is the most common cause of accidents among the elders at home that poses a huge threat to their health and lives. In order to protect the privacy of the elders an accidental falling detection algorithm for the elders in the home has been proposed in this paper. First, contour-based infrared motion video images are used instead of high-definition cameras to collect the elderly behaviors to protect their privacy. Second, ellipse fitting is performed on the infrared video images of the five behaviors including standing, sitting, squatting, bending and falling. The five geometric characteristic variables of the contour-fitting ellipses including the number of ellipses, centroid positions, ellipsoidal areas, horizontal inclinations and long-short axis ratios of the images, have been extracted. Next, an LSTM model is established using the above variables as inputs for feature extraction and classification. Finally, infrared video images of different types of active behaviors of the elders aged from 50 to 70 years have been selected as IFD database for classification detection. Sixty percent of the IFD images are used as training datasets, and 40% of the IFD images are used as test datasets, and compared with the classification detection of URFD datasets which contains optical RGB HD video images of the different behaviors. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed in this paper which combines the contour ellipse fitting of the infrared video images and the LSTM feature extraction. The average correct classification rate of the normal and falling down behaviors of the elders is above 95%, which is comparable to the optical RGB datasets. The precision of behavior recognition can effectively protect the privacy of the elders, and provide protection for the accidental falling detection of the elders living alone.},

In this study, because IR images contain sparse and low-rank features in most scenarios, we propose an optimal IR patch-image (OIPI) model-based detection method to detect small targets in heavily cluttered IR images. First, the OIPI model was generated based on a conventional IR image model using a novel optimal patch size and sliding step adaptive selection algorithm. Secondly, the sparse and low-rank features of IR images were extracted and fused to generate an adaptive weighted parameter. Thirdly, the adaptive inexact augmented Lagrange multiplier (AIALM) algorithm was applied in the OIPI model to solve the robust principal component analysis (RPCA) optimization problem. Finally, an adaptive threshold method is proposed to segment and calibrate targets. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is capable of detecting small targets more stably and accurately, compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen an increasing trend in developing 3D action recognition methods. However, despite the advances, existing models still suffer from some major drawbacks including the lack of any provision for recognizing action sequences with some missing frames. This significantly hampers the applicability of these methods for online scenarios, where only an initial part of sequences are already provided. In this paper, we introduce a novel sequence-to-sequence representation-based algorithm in which a query sample is characterized using a collaborative frame representation of all the training sequences. This way, an optimal classifier is tailored for the existing frames of each query sample, making the model robust to the effect of missing frames in sequences (e.g. in online scenarios). Moreover, due to the collaborative nature of the representation, it implicitly handles the problem of varying styles during the course of activities. Experimental results on three publicly available databases, UTKinect, TST fall, and UTD-MHAD, respectively, show 95.48%, 90.91%, and 91.67% accuracy when using the beginning 75% portion of query sequences and 84.42%, 60.98%, and 87.27% accuracy for their initial 50%.},

Most of them focus on detection and recognition in star image with sidereal stare mode. However, in this research field, few researches are about detection and recognition in star image with track rate mode. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to recognize the moving target in single frame by machine learning method based on elliptical characteristic extraction of star points. The technical path about recognition of moving target in space is redesigned instead of traditional processing approaches. Elliptical characteristics of each star point can be successfully extracted from single image. Machine learning can achieve the classification goal in order to make sure that all moving targets can be extracted.

  abstract     = {Deep learning algorithms have shown superior performance than traditional algorithms when dealing with computationally intensive tasks in many fields. The algorithm model based on deep learning has good performance and can improve the recognition accuracy in relevant applications in the field of computer vision. TensorFlow is a flexible opensource machine learning platform proposed by Google, which can run on a variety of platforms, such as CPU, GPU, and mobile devices. TensorFlow platform can also support current popular deep learning models. In this paper, an image recognition toolkit based on TensorFlow is designed and developed to simplify the development process of more and more image recognition applications. The toolkit uses convolutional neural networks to build a training model, which consists of two convolutional layers: one batch normalization layer before each convolutional layer, and the other pooling layer after each convolutional layer. The last two layers of the model use the full connection layer to output recognition results. Batch gradient descent algorithm is adopted in the optimization algorithm, and it integrates the advantages of both the gradient descent algorithm and the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which greatly reduces the number of convergence iterations and has little influence on the convergence effect. The total training parameters of the toolkit model reach 1.7 million. In order to prevent overfitting problems, the dropout layer before each full connection layer is added and the threshold of 0.5 is set in the design. The convolution neural network model is trained and tested by the MNIST set on TensorFlow. The experimental result shows that the toolkit achieves the recognition accuracy of 99% on the MNIST test set. The development of the toolkit provides powerful technical support for the development of various image recognition applications, reduces its difficulty, and improves the efficiency of resource utilization.},

To improve these deficiencies, this paper recommends a fuzzy fitness prediction method based on fuzzy gray model FGM (1,1) with a precise number fitness. First of all, the relationship between fitness noise intensity and the fitness function is proposed. Then, it suggests a linear programming of fuzzy fitness set width under the restriction of minimum noise intensity, which can calculate the fuzzy fitness prediction parameters. Finally, the fuzzy gray model forecasts the fuzzy fitness. The proposed method uses new computation of individual’s dominance relation and crowding distance to realize NSGA–II. The experimental results verify that this method has advantages in improving optimization quality, alleviating user’s fatigue and improving efficiency in exploration.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an incoming Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for segmenting retinal blood vessels automatically from fundus images. Automatic segmentation performs a substantial role in computer-aided diagnosis of retinal diseases; it is of considerable significance as eye diseases as well as some other systemic diseases give rise to perceivable pathologic changes. Retinal blood vessel segmentation is challenging because of the excessive changes in the morphology of the vessels on a noisy background. Previous deep learning-based supervised methods suffer from the insufficient use of low-level features which is advantageous in semantic segmentation tasks. The proposed architecture makes use of both high-level features and low-level features to segment retinal blood vessels. The major contribution of the proposed architecture concentrates on two important factors; the first in its supplying of extremely modularized network architecture of aggregated residual connections which enable us to copy the learned layers from the shallower model and developing additional layers to identity mapping. The second is to improve the utilization of computing resources within the network. This is achieved through a skillfully crafted design that allows for increased depth and width of the network while maintaining the stability of its computational budget. Experimental results show the effectiveness of using aggregated residual connections in segmenting retinal vessels more accurately and clearly. Compared to the best existing methods, the proposed method outperformed other existing methods in different measures, comprised less false positives at fine vessels, and caressed more clear lines with sufficient details like the human annotator.},

The intensity factor can be used to distinguish the brightness level of a gray-scale image and to determine a threshold value for image segmentation. According to the intensity factor and the characteristic of human body in the gray-scale infrared image, a new algorithm of calculating the intensity-level threshold is designed which can be used for segmenting human body area in an infrared image. In the algorithm, based on the concept of intensity factor, a histogram of low brightness gray-scale image (LGIRI) is divided into three parts: a low-intensity region (0.25 L ), a medium-intensity region (0.25–0.75 L ), and a high-intensity region (0.75–1 L ), and then the intensity i which satisfies the L a M ( i ) = 0 . 5 k L L a is selected as an intensity-level value k h , and the intensity i which satisfies L M ( i ) = 0 . 5 k L L is selected as an intensity-level value t h , at last 0 . 5 ( t h + k h ) is the pixel classification threshold (the intensity-level threshold). It is noted that there is no preprocessing for image noise filtering and/or processing, and all images come from OTCBVS. Compared with the method of selecting trough points of the histogram as the intensity-level threshold, this algorithm avoids the problem of nonexistence of evident trough point at the high-intensity level of a histogram. Also, the experimental results show that the segmenting results of LGIRI processed by the algorithm are better than those of Otsu method.},

  abstract     = {The research of ECG diagnosis based on deep learning is a hot topic at present. ECG signals are collected from human body surface electrodes and electrocardiograms are obtained. The research process is to integrate engineering technology into the medical field, reflecting the new direction of interdisciplinary combination. This paper introduces the basic principle of ECG signal and the basic analysis method of ECG. The experimental results show that the application of one-dimensional convolutional neural network is more effective and accurate than the traditional methods. The design of the theoretical method has provided the technical support and theoretical basis for the further study of electrophysiological signals and the clinical diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Case retrieval is one of the key steps of case-based reasoning. The quality of case retrieval determines the effectiveness of the system. The common similarity calculation methods based on attributes include distance and inner product. Different similarity calculations have different influences on the effect of case retrieval. How to combine different similarity calculation results to get a more widely used and better retrieval algorithm is a hot issue in the current case-based reasoning research. In this paper, the granularity of quotient space is introduced into the similarity calculation based on attribute, and a case retrieval algorithm based on granularity synthesis theory is proposed. This method first uses similarity calculation of different attributes to get different results of case retrieval, and considers that these classification results constitute different quotient spaces, and then organizes these quotient spaces according to granularity synthesis theory to get the classification results of case retrieval. The experimental results verify the validity and correctness of this method and the application potential of granularity calculation of quotient space in case-based reasoning.},

  abstract     = {The depth image generated by Kinect sensor always contains vibration and shadow noises which limit the related usage. In this research, a method based on image fusion and fractional differential is proposed for the vibration filtering and shadow detection. First, an image fusion method based on pixel level is put forward to filter the vibration noises. This method can achieve the best quality of every pixel according to the depth images sequence. Second, an improved operator based on fractional differential is studied to extract the shadow noises, which can enhance the boundaries of shadow regions significantly to accomplish the shadow detection effectively. Finally, a comparison is made with other traditional and state-of-the-art methods and our experimental results indicate that the proposed method can filter out the vibration and shadow noises effectively based on the F -measure system.},

  abstract     = {In view of the fact that the existing intrusion detection system (IDS) based on clustering algorithm cannot adapt to the large-scale growth of system logs, a K-mediods clustering intrusion detection algorithm based on differential evolution suitable for cloud computing environment is proposed. First, the differential evolution algorithm is combined with the K-mediods clustering algorithm in order to use the powerful global search capability of the differential evolution algorithm to improve the convergence efficiency of large-scale data sample clustering. Second, in order to further improve the optimization ability of clustering, a dynamic Gemini population scheme was adopted to improve the differential evolution algorithm, thereby maintaining the diversity of the population while improving the problem of being easily trapped into a local optimum. Finally, in the intrusion detection processing of big data, the optimized clustering algorithm is designed in parallel under the Hadoop Map Reduce framework. Simulation experiments were performed in the open source cloud computing framework Hadoop cluster environment. Experimental results show that the overall detection effect of the proposed algorithm is significantly better than the existing intrusion detection algorithms.},
