AI is a simulation that is trained to learn and mimic human behaviour. These AI algorithms are capable of learning from their mistakes and doing tasks that are comparable to those performed by humans. AI will have a significant impact on our quality of life as it develops. The main aim of any tool and approach is to simplify human effort and aid us in making better decisions. Data Analytics helps in analyzing raw data in order to draw inferences from it.

  abstract     = {Modern organizations are keen to work towards their customer needs. To achieve this, analyzing their activities and identifying their interest in any entity becomes important. Every user has been identified as the most important factor in point of organization, and they never give up even a single user. Several approaches have been discussed earlier, which use artificial intelligence to mine the users and their interest in the problem. However, the deep learning algorithms are identified as most efficient in identifying the user interest but suffer to achieve higher performance. Towards this issue, an efficient multi-feature semantic similarity-based online social recommendation system has been proposed. The method uses Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to train and predict user interest in any topic. Each layer has been identified as a single interest, and neurons of the layers are initialized with huge data set. The neuron estimates the Multi-Feature Semantic Similarity (MFSS) towards each interest of the user. Finally, the method identifies the single interest for the user by ranking each interest to produce recommendations to the user. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of recommendation generation with less false ratio.},

  abstract     = {Agriculture faces several uncertain problems in terms of making the best use of its natural resources. As a result, and in light of the growing threat of changing weather conditions, we must closely track local soil conditions and meteorological data to expedite the adoption of culture-friendly decisions. In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, deploying Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) as a low-cost remote monitoring and management system for these types of features is a viable choice. However, the WSN is hampered by the motes’ insufficient energy sources, which reduces the network’s overall lifespan. Each mote collects the tracked feature regularly and sends the data to the sink for further analysis. This method of transmitting large amounts of data requires the sensor node to use a lot of energy and a lot of network bandwidth. We propose a lightweight lossless compression algorithm based on Differential Encoding (DE) and Huffman techniques in this paper, which is especially useful for IoT sensor nodes that track environmental features, especially those with limited computing and memory resources. Rather than attempting to create novel ad hoc algorithms, we show that, given a general understanding of the features to be monitored, classical Huffman coding can be used to effectively represent the same features that measure at different times and locations. Even though the proposed system does not achieve the theoretical limit, results using temperature measurements show that it outperforms standard methods built specifically for WSNs.},

  abstract     = {In today’s world, one of the most severe attacks that wireless sensor networks (WSNs) face is a Black-Hole (BH) attack which is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This attack blocks data and injects infected programs into a set of sensors in a group to capture packets before reached to the target. Therefore, raw data in the BH region is thwarted and is unable to reach its destination. The network is susceptible to various types of attacks as it is accessible to all types of users and minimizing the energy depletion without compromising the network lifetime is an NP-hard problem. Even though numerous protocols came into effect to overcome the BH attack and to enhance the security of packet delivery in WSNs, Simulated Annealing Black-hole attack Detection (SABD) based Enhanced Gravitational Search Algorithm (EGSA) is yet another implemented strategy to reduce the BH attacks. EGSA-SABD detects and isolates the BH infectors in WSNs. Initially, sensor nodes are hierarchically clustered using similar residual energy to reduce energy consumption. Then, the BH attack possibility in a deployed node is evaluated to find the existence of BH nodes in the region. In the end, EGSA-SABD is employed to detect and quarantine BH attackers in WSNs. The performance of EGSA-SABD is evaluated with certain metrics such as BH attack detection probability rate (BHatt_Prate), energy consumption ( E c ), Duration of BH attack detection (Attduration), Packet delivery ratio ( P dr ). Based on the experimental observations, the EGSA-SABD outperforms the BHatt_Prate by 13% and also reduces the energy consumption by 21%.},

The MCDM techniques, SDV (standard deviation) CRITIC (CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation), ARAS (Additive Ratio Assessment), MOORA (Multi-objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis) are applied to analyze the data and measure the performance of the banks. In MCDM techniques, different methods provide different weights of the criteria, and also different ranks are obtained by different methods. Sensitivity analysis was carried out by measuring the criteria weights by SDV and CRITIC and the alternatives are ranked using two MCDM techniques, ARAS and MOORA. The results of the study show that among the private banks, HDFC created a benchmark and leading while Yes bank has shown poor performance on the basis of annual reports of 2020.},

Parameters such as step factor and attractiveness have been kept constant in these algorithms, which affect the convergence rate and accuracy of the clustering process. Though fuzzy adaptive firefly algorithm tackled this problem by making those parameters an adaptive one, issues such as low convergence rate, and provision of non-optimal solutions are still there. To tackle these issues, this paper proposed a novel fuzzy adaptive fuzzy firefly algorithm that significantly improves the accuracy and convergence rate while comparing with the existing optimization algorithms. Further, the proposed algorithm fused with existing hybrid clustering algorithms involving fuzzy set, intuitionistic fuzzy set, and rough set resulted in eight novel hybrid clustering algorithms which lead to better performance in optimizing the selection of initial centroids. To validate the proposal, experimental studies have been conducted on datasets found in bench-marking data repositories such as UCI, and Kaggle. The performance and accuracy evaluation of proposed algorithms have been carried out with the aid of seven accuracy measures. Results clearly indicate the improved accuracy and convergence rate of the proposed algorithms.},

The use of relational reasoning via RN in neural networks has often been used in recent years. In these instances, RN is composed of various deep learning-based algorithms in simple plug-and-play modules. This is quite advantageous since it circumvents the need for features engineering. This paper surveys the emerging research of deep learning models that make use of RN in tasks such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Action Recognition, Temporal Relational Reasoning as well as Facial Emotion Recognition (FER). Since, RNs are easy to integrate they have been used in various tasks such as NLP, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Action Recognition, Image Analysis, Object Detection, Temporal Relational Reasoning, as well as for FER. This is due to the fact that RNs use bidirectional LSTM and CNN to solve relational reasoning problems at character and word level. In this paper a comparative review of all relational reasoning-based RN models using deep learning techniques is presented.},

  abstract     = {In a broad spectrum, software metrics play a vital role in attribute assessment, which successively moves software projects. The metrics measure gives many crucial facets of the system, enhancing the system quality of software developed. Moreover, maintenance is the correction process that works out in the software system once the software is initially made. The noteworthy characteristic of any software is ‘change,’ and as a result, additional concern ought to be taken in developing software. So, the software is expected to be modified effortlessly (maintainable). Predicting software maintainability is still challenging, and accurate prediction models with low error rates are required. Since there are so many modern programming languages on the horizon. To accurately measure software maintainability, new techniques have to been introduced. This paper proposes a maintainability index (MI) by considering various software metrics by which the error gets minimized. It also intends to adopt a renowned optimization algorithm, namely Firefly (FF), for the optimum result. The proposed Base Model-FF is compared to other traditional models like BM-Differential Evolution (BM-DE), BM-Artificial Bee Colony (BM-ABC), BM-Particle Swarm Optimization (BM-PSO), and BM-Genetic Algorithm (BM- GA) in terms of performance metrics like Differential ratio, correlation coefficient, and Random Mean Square Error (RMSE).},

In order to improve the attitude and heading measurement accuracy under dynamic complex environment, the AHRS system should also have numerical stability and calculation robustness. The AHRS system based on MEMS multi-sensor fusion can realize fusion processing of data measured by multiple sensors, so as to calculate and obtain the optimal carrier attitude and heading information, conduct real-time output, and improve the accuracy and reliability of attitude and heading measurement. For the AHRS system consisting of MEMS gyroscope, accelerometer and triaxial magnetometer, attitude and heading detection principle and algorithm based on MEMS multi-sensor fusion were proposed in this study: The information of the system itself was firstly used to discriminate motion state of the carrier within the filtering cycle, and then Kalman filtering was conducted using different measured information according to motion state to correct the attitude error angle caused by gyroscopic drift. On this basis, an attitude fusion algorithm based on extended Kalman filtering technology was designed for time update process of Kalman filtering, output information of accelerometer was taken as observed quantity under certain conditions to realize measurement updating process of Kalman filtering, and then attitude angle was calculated. In an optical fiber attitude and heading system project in practical engineering, a vehicle field test analysis was carried out simultaneously with the system using ordinary attitude algorithm, and the results showed that the extended Kalman filtering algorithm designed according to the simulation results could realize multi-sensor information fusion, improve measurement accuracy and realize accurate attitude positioning, so as to provide simpler and more flexible criteria for carrier motion status. The results have verified the accuracy and reliability of the algorithm, so it is feasible in practical engineering.},

A hybrid approach involving image processing and deep learning algorithms is proposed to detect automatic cracks in structures. As cracks are detected in the images they are segmented using a segmentation process. The proposed deep learning models include a hybrid architecture combining Mask R-CNN with single layer CNN, 3-layer CNN, and8-layer CNN. These models utilizes depth wise convolution with varying dilation rates for efficiently extracting diversified features from the crack images. Further, performance evaluation shows that Mask R-CNN with a single layer CNN achieves an accuracy of 97.5% on a normal dataset and 97.8% on a segmented dataset. The Mask R-CNN with 2-layer convolution resulted in an accuracy of 98.32% on a normal dataset and 98.39% on a segmented dataset. The Mask R-CNN with 8-layers convolution achieves an accuracy of 98.4% on a normal dataset and 98.75% on a segmented dataset. The proposed Mask R-CNN have proved its feasibility in detecting cracks in huge building and structures.},

  abstract     = {The high growth of vehicular travel in urban areas, in particular, requires a traffic control system that optimizes traffic flow efficiency. Traffic congestion can also occur by large de-lays in Red Light etc. The delay in lighting is difficult to code and does not rely on real traffic density. It follows that traffic controls are simulated and configured to better meet this rising demand. So, in order to avoid the traffic control problem, the Adaptive Intelligent Traffic Light control system (AITLCS) has been proposed based on OpenCV and Image processing technique. The system proposed is designed to ensure smooth and efficient traffic flow for daily life as well as emergency and public transportation safety. Based on the road density instead of the levels set the proposed system provides the timing for the traffic light signal so that a highly loaded side switched on over long periods compared with the other lanes. It can also be used at an intersection with traffic signs, which controls the traffic light signal at the intersection. If timers are smart to predict the exact time, the system is more efficient because it reduces the time spent on unintended green signal significantly. With the help of OpenCV software, this paper aims to have a signal management SMART solution that will be cost-effective at the end. The system consists of a camera facing a lane taking pictures of the route we want to travel and then the density of the pedestrian and vehicle is taken and compared with each image employing image processing. Such images are processed effectively to learn the density of traffic.},

In the scrambling operation: the first scrambling is aimed to block the clear text image scrambling; The second scrambling is the dynamic Arnold scrambling of the ciphertext after the first scrambling. In the diffusion operation, the scrambled ciphertext image was taken as the input, and the pseudo-random sequence generated by Tent mapping and Sine mapping was embedded. The sequence generated by Logistic mapping was used to select sub-blocks for block diffusion of the image. Tent-Sine mapping was applied to the second diffusion to obtain the final ciphertext image. The algorithm designed in this paper combines image block scrambling and dynamic Arnold scrambling, the scrambling degree of each layer of image pixels would be greatly improved, thus improving the security of color images. In the process of diffusion, chaos sequence is selected for diffusion operation, which increases the difficulty of decoding ciphertext. The simulation results show that the new algorithm has desirable encryption effect, strong key sensitivity and large key space, and complex encryption algorithm can effectively resist attacks, which certainly has value in image information security.},

This analysis helps to improve the precision of detection and requires complex-less time and processing instances. In this article, the regression model for retina feature filtering (RM-FF) is introduced to improve the accuracy of detecting hemorrhages. In this filtering, the complex image is simplified into smaller blocks for classification and conditional verification. Based on conditional verification, the training set is updated recursively to improve the specificity and sensitivity detection process.

It is the utmost important and intricate tasks in numerous medical-image applications since it typically involves a huge quantity of data. A lot of methods were applied in BT detection ranging as of image processing to examine the BT; however, the prevailing BT technique is tedious and less effective. So, this paper proposed the detection of the BT in MRI images utilizing optimized ANFIS classifier. Originally, the input MR image is preprocessed utilizing Gaussian Filter (GF) that removes the noise from the inputted image, additionally, the non-brain tissues (NBT) are removed using the technique of skull stripping (SS). After that, segmentation is performed wherein the tumor part is segmented utilizing CBAC technique and edema part is segmented utilizing HLSS segmentation technique. Then, GLCM in addition to GLRLM features are extracted afterward that extorted features is chosen by BFO algorithm. Finally, the selected features inputted to the optimized ANFIS classifier that classifies the tumor class types as Meningioma, Glioma, along with Pituitary. In ANFIS, the optimization procedure is achieved utilizing the PSO. The proposed system’s performance is contrasted to the prevailing systems regarding precision, recall, specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, together with F-Measure.},

The nature of the fuzzy set exhibits its role in handling the uncertainty of the data. The intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) is a generalization of a fuzzy set that makes the forecasting process more precise and accurate. This paper proposes a new fuzzy forecasting model based on IFS via the de-i-fuzzification approach, namely equal distribution of hesitancy. The proposed model consists of four main parts; the fuzzification of historical data; the establishment of the IFS; the de-i-fuzzification; and the defuzzification. For the fuzzification, the historical data is partitioned into 14 intervals using the frequency density-based method and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used to fuzzify the data. The data are then converted into IFS. The data in IFS form is reduced to fuzzy set using equally distributed with the degree of hesitancy approach. The arithmetic rules based on centroid defuzzification is used to calculate the forecasted output. The proposed model shows a better performance than the existing forecasting models based on IFS, indicating that the equal distribution of hesitancy de-i-fuzzification managed to handle the non-determinism in the forecasting with simplified procedure. In the future, an improved method will be proposed to defuzzify the IFS into crisp values without going through the de-i-fuzzification process, yet preserving the nature of IFS.},

Several intriguing discoveries and ideas paved the way for a new age of electronics, telecommunications, business, and medicinal innovation. Using less resources, greater changes in these domains can be achieved. As improving efficiency and productivity allow exponential development in some areas of the global economy, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is being adopted by a growing number of individuals, corporations, and governments. Since real-world scenarios influence imprecise and unpredictable situations, fuzzy systems have become an inescapable machine learning aspect. Thus, this research presents a qualitative analysis of the significance of fuzzy machine learning systems like fuzzy support vector machines (FSVM) in various physical domains. Based on this analysis, this research extends with the proposal of a fuzzy machine learning-based framework for two different physical domains: (1) intelligent transportation and (2) ecological risk handling. Thereby, this state-of-the-art approach presents fault detection using FSVM (FD-FSVM) model in the intelligent transportation domain. In ecological risk handling, this study proposes an improved FSVM for risk level classification (FSVM-RLC) approach, which uses the persistent organic pollutants data for training and validation. These two domains are chosen randomly to evaluate the classification performance of the fuzzy machine learning algorithms based on their mean absolute error, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Apart from this, the mean square error and mean absolute error are measured. Compared to existing machine learning models, the individual results of these two approaches show the highest performance. Furthermore, this fuzzy integrated machine learning technique kept consistency in both domains by giving 98.2% and 97.89% accuracy levels for FD-FSVM and FSVM-RLC, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a modern technology that is applicable almost everywhere nowadays. Everything is connected to the Internet in the modern digital era. IoT is a collection of things that are interconnected to share information. Devices connected to IoT networks have some limitations in performing heavy computational tasks because of the availability of less computational and battery power. Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is a modern public-key cryptographic technique that provides privacy with access control. The bilinear map is an expensive operation that is used in most of the ABE schemes. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an alternative for bilinear pairing to reduce the computation of encryption and decryption in ABE schemes. The process of encryption and decryption of ABE is a heavy computational task for resource-constrained devices. In this paper, an outsourcing-based decryption of ABE using ECC is proposed to reduce the decryption overhead of devices that have limited computational resources. Our scheme divides the computation of the decryption of ABE into two stages: first, the partial decryption of ciphertext in the cloud server, and second, the final decryption of partially decrypted ciphertext by the data user to retrieve the original message. This scheme is secure against the malicious cloud server by adding a blinding factor into the secret to be shared. The blinding factor is shared with intended users through attribute authority. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can reduce the decryption complexity and save the computational time of devices, compared to the existing schemes. Thus the proposed scheme is applicable for lightweight devices used in IoT.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the entire world is fighting against the Corona Virus (COVID-19). As of now, more than thirty lacs of people all over the world were died due to the COVID-19 till April 2021. A recent study conducted by China suggests that Chest CT and X-ray images can be used as a preliminary test for COVID detection. This paper propose a transfer learning-based mathematical COVID detection model, which integrates a pre-trained model with the Random Forest Tree (RFT) classifier. As the available COVID dataset is noisy and imbalanced so Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is used to extract most prominent features and balance the dataset respectively. The Bayesian Cross-Entropy Loss function is used to penalize the false detection differently according to the class sensitivity (i.e., COVID patient should not be classified as Normal or Pneumonia class). Due to the small dataset, a pre-trained model like VGGNet-19, ResNet50 and Inception_ResNet_V2 were chosen to extract features and then trained them over the RFT for the classification task. The experiment results showed that ResNet50 gives the maximum accuracy of 99.51%, 98.21%, and 97.2% for training, validation, and testing phases, respectively, and none of the COVID Chest X-ray images were classified as Normal or Pneumonia classes.},

  abstract     = {The object of this paper is to simulate and optimize small scale concentrating solar power tower (CSP) built and operationalized at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, through analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique. The aim is to facilitate cost effective integration of solar power coupled with energy generation technologies subjected to challenging climatic conditions; and also to present the effects of changing in parameters such as receiver, heliostats, storage tanks or power generation subsystem on the cost and system performance. This study adopts the AHP technique to obtain the most appropriate receiver shape out of three possible shapes; spherical, cubic, and cylindrical. The used criteria in this in this optimization are reliability, manufacturing in the vicinity, manufacturing cost, service and maintain cost, lower operation risks, and high performance. Based on the results of AHP analysis, square shape is selected. A finite element analysis via ANSYS is performed to compute the through analytic division of temperature in the receiver. The highest temperature from the simulation is 503°C. The thermal power, dispensed by the molten is 12.52 kW during the heat exchanger. However, 13 kW is the design thermal power; while about 3.7% is the percentage error in the thermal power. The findings of this research will provide the needed knowledge and scientific background to assist the authorities concerned in the energy sector in establishing a commercial-scale plant. At the end, Artificial Neural Network algorithms/Fuzzy system is modeled to optimize the process.},

Measuring satisfaction in transportation has been done quantitatively so far and, more importantly, the measurement process has not usually been scientific. This study aimed at an accurate scientific measurement. Because of ambiguity, this paper discusses how to use the intuitionistic fuzzy method, in which both membership and non-membership functions were expressed. Therefore, initially, considering the results of previous researches, as well as studying the references and standards, the characteristics and basic criteria, a researcher-made questionnaire with a reliability of 0.95 was first performed and then the weights were determined using the AHP intuitionistic fuzzy method. After performing the above steps, the intuitionistic fuzzy satisfaction value was calculated at different levels and using the method, the final number of satisfaction was defuzzified.},

In the current scenario, Coronavirus (COVID-19) infections are major challenging in the health care sector. The medical diagnosis for COVID-19 prediction is done with the support of X-ray images. Detection of COVID-19 with X-ray images is an effective method but it is critical for diagnosis, evaluation, and medication. Since the X-ray images are of low contrast, the accuracy will be low while using the traditional feature extraction in machine learning. The proposed method uses a novel technique by combining multiple CNN (Convolutional Neural network) for classification. The samples for multiple CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) are divided into n-subsets by using the bootstrap sampling method. The n-subset samples are finely tuned with Adaptive momentum technique (Adam) optimizer, the output of this layer is fed into CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model as input, still hyper-tuning at each layer with Bayesian optimizer. This technique avoids de-noising, and features are also enhanced when compared to conventional methods. Experimental results of this technique provide an accuracy of 97.35% for the prediction of COVID-19 from X-ray images.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning models have performed exceptionally well in detection of diabetic retinopathy. Most of these existing works either use Multi Layered Perceptron (MLP) or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based models. A significant drawback of these models is their inability to retain spatial dependencies as we go deeper into the network. Because of such issue, these models focus only on extraction of feature maps which help in classification or detection. In recent years’ transformers have shown enormous promise in both natural language processing and computer vision, due to which there have been significant work on transformer based techniques for image classification and object detection. One important model used in this research work is the Capsule Network which uses Set Transformers to perform vision tasks with high accuracy and has the capability to maintain spatial dependencies throughout the process. In this work, we leverage the power of capsules to the diabetic retinopathy classification and detection problem and trained capsules for classification of retinal fundus images are considered which were categorize into five different classes depending on the severity of retinopathy. Further, we also propose a sliding window based detector which can pinpoint the exact position of a blood burst in the retina which will ease the job for ophthalmologists while studying retinal fundus. From our experiments we found that capsules provide better results than existing convolutional neural network and multi layered perceptron based approaches in standard retinopathy datasets.},

Recently, the focus is given to two main issues (i.e.) overfitting because of the devoid of adequate training data as well as expression-unassociated variations, for instance, head pose, illumination, along with identity bias. Here, Brownian motion based Crow Search Algorithm for Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (BMCSA-ANFIS) is proposed for doing the FER of human images. It mostly concentrates on recognizing an individual’s Facial Expressions (FE) as of a single image. The proposed method comprises ‘4’ stages. Initially, the inputted facial images are taken from a database that is openly available. Then, the images (inputted) are pre-processed by performing filtering (noise removal) along with energy normalization. After that, the feature extraction is performed utilizing Local directional patterns (LDP) along with Appearances Model (AAM) centered Scale Invariants Features Transform (SIFT) that extracts the features as of the preprocessed images for doing FER. Then, the system utilizes the Information Gain based Linear Discriminants Analysis (IG-LDA) to lessen the extracted features (dimensionality reduction). Subsequent to Feature Reduction (FR), the reduced features are rendered to BMCSA-ANFIS for classification that classifies the result of the inputted images into ‘6’ fundamental emotions: happy, angry, disgust, surprise, sad, together with neutral by considering the reduced features. The experimentation’s outcomes are evaluated and that clearly exhibited that the proposed techniques perform superiorly to other existent algorithms for FER.},

The sources of uncertainties serve the basis for delineating the types as aleatory or epistemic. The probabilistic models can be considered as the most valuable strategies to deal with aleatory uncertainties, while convex models, possibility theory, evidence theory and Bayesian probability theory can be used to deal with epistemic uncertainty. However, when only scarce datasets are available and knowledge is incomplete, a more general framework, such as probability-box, is more appropriate to describe the uncertainty. Furthermore, analysis of complex and multi-dimensional structures is expensive and time consuming when numerical techniques are used. Therefore, simulation of such structures for many realisation of uncertain input becomes a challenging task in the uncertainty analysis. In this paper, complex structural systems with imprecise uncertain input are studied and evaluated efficiently by High Dimensional Model Representation based uncertainty analysis.},

The control gain is calculated by using least squares in such a way that the vector of the polynomial type-2 fuzzy system state vector follows the state of a stable reference system. In the simulation, the cart-pole system is considered. This nonlinear complex system first converts to a polynomial type-2 fuzzy model and then is well controlled by the proposed method.

For this purpose, first the concept of optimal solution is proposed by considering a partial ordering on fuzzy numbers space which is based on a new parametric representation for α -level set of fuzzy numbers. Using this partial ordering and parametric representation, the discussed fuzzy optimal control problems are reduced to general optimal control problems in parametric form. Then by Pontryagin’s principle, a candidate for the solution of the original problem is derived. The procedure of extracting candidate solution is illustrated for two experimental problems, which improve the recent results of Refs. 10 and 17.},

A nonfragile fuzzy-basis-dependent and mode-dependent controller is designed and a sufficient condition is developed to ensure that the resulting closed-loop system is robust asymptotically stable in mean square with guaranteed cost index not exceeding the specified upper bound. Subsequently, the controller gain and minimum upper bound of the guaranteed cost index can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Compared with the existing literature, this paper enormously reduces the conservatism of the result obtained.

  abstract     = {To improve the generalization performance, we develop a new technique for handling the impacts of outliers using Lagrangian twin bounded SVM (TBSVM) with kernel fuzzy membership values, which is termed kernel-target alignment-based fuzzy Lagrangian twin bounded support vector machine (KTA-FLTBSVM). Here, the objective functions are having L2-norm vectors of the slack variable that leads to the optimization problem more convex and yields a unique global solution. Also, the fuzzy membership values are employing the importance of data samples assigned to each sample to minimize the impacts of outlier and noise. Further, we have suggested a linearly convergent iterative approach to obtain the solution of the problem unlike in place to solve the quadratic programming problem in Twin SVM (TSVM) and TBSVM. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed KTA-FLTBSVM, the comprehensive experiments demonstrate with other reported models on artificial datasets along with benchmark real-life publicly available datasets. Our KTA-FLTBSVM outperforms to other models in terms of better classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Gradual emerging patterns (GEPs) are gradual item sets that occur less frequently in one data set and more frequently in another. For instance, let ‘ fan speed ’ and ‘ temperature ’ be attributes of two numerical data sets. A gradual item set “ the higher the speed, the lower the temperature ” (which correlates a data set’s attributes) becomes a GEP if it is less frequent (in terms of support as in frequent pattern mining) in one data set and more frequent in another. However, such patterns do not indicate how time gap impacts the emergence. Many correlations appear over time, for instance when phenomena appear after some meteorological situation due to latency. Previous works have not taken this temporal aspect into account. In this paper, we introduce temporal gradual emerging patterns (TGEPs) which are temporal gradual patterns (TGPs) whose frequency supports increase significantly between transformed data sets. For instance, a TGP “ the higher the speed, the lower the temperature, almost 3 minutes later ” becomes a TGEP if it occurs more frequently in one transformed data set than in another. Furthermore, we extend border manipulation to the case of mining TGEPs. In addition, we propose a more efficient ant colony optimization technique that exploits a heuristic approach to construct TGEPs.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems have emerged as a class of essential tools in the success of modern e-commerce applications. These applications typically handle large datasets and often face challenges like data sparsity and scalability. Clustering techniques help to reduce the computational time needed for recommendation as well as handle the sparsity problem more efficiently. Traditional clustering based recommender systems create partitions (clusters) of the user-item rating matrix and execute the recommendation algorithm in the clusters separately in order to decrease the overall runtime of the system. Each user or item generally belong to at most one cluster. However, it may so happen that some users (boundary users) present in a particular cluster exhibit higher similarity with the preferences of the users residing in the nearby clusters than the ones present in their own cluster. Therefore, we propose a clustering based scalable recommendation algorithm that has a provision for switching a user from its original cluster to another cluster in order to provide more accurate recommendations. For a user belonging to multiple clusters, we aggregate recommendations from those clusters to which the user belongs in order to produce the final set of recommendations to that user. In this work, we propose two types of clustering, one on the basis of rating and the other on the basis of frequency and then compare their performances. Finally, we explore the applicability of cluster ensembles techniques in the proposed method. Our aim is to develop a recommendation framework that can scale well to handle large datasets without much affecting the recommendation quality. The outcomes of our experiments clearly demonstrate the scalability as well as efficacy of our method. It reduces the runtime of the baseline CF algorithm by a minimum of 58% and a maximum of 90% for MovieLens-10M dataset, and a minimum of 42% and a maximum of 84% for MovieLens-20M dataset. The accuracies of recommendations in terms of F1, MAP and NDCG metrics are also better than the existing clustering based recommender systems.},

The first two models are both with two steps to carry out the aggregation processes, with one using two times of OWA operators and another considering evaluation matrix as a vector lattice. The last two models come from a whole perspective to direct the aggregation processes, with one arising from a global magnitude view and another based on staggered ordering using two specially defined collections of permutations.

  abstract     = {Occupancy grids are common tools used in robotics to represent the robot environment, and that may be used to plan trajectories, select additional measurements to acquire, etc. However, deriving information about those occupancy grids from sensor measurements often induce a lot of uncertainty, especially for grid elements that correspond to occluded or far away area from the robot. This means that occupancy information may be quite uncertain and imprecise at some places, while being very accurate at others. Modelling finely this occupancy information is essential to decide the optimal action the robot should take, but a refined modelling of uncertainty often implies a higher computational cost, a prohibitive feature for real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce the notion of credal occupancy grids, using the very general theory of imprecise probabilities to model occupancy uncertainty. We also show how one can perform efficient, real-time inferences with such a model, and show a use-case applying the model to an autonomous vehicle trajectory planning problem.},

In 2017, an effective synchronization clustering (ESynC) algorithm, inspired by SynC algorithm and a linear version of Vicsek model, was proposed. When facing complex data distributions, ESynC algorithm may regard an irregular and whole cluster as some micro-clusters. To conquer this shortcoming, a combined clustering algorithm based on ESynC algorithm and a merging judgement process of micro-clusters (CESynC) is presented. CESynC algorithm first uses ESynC algorithm to detect clusters or micro-clusters, then merges those conjoint micro-clusters by using a merging judgement process. For some datasets that ESynC and SynC cannot detect correct clusters, CESynC can capture natural clusters. From the simulation experiments, we observe that CESynC can get better (or the same) clustering results than (or as) that of ESynC in many cases. We also observe that the clustering results of CESynC and ESynC are often better than that of SynC. Therefore, we can say CESynC can often obtain better clustering quality than ESynC and SynC in some kinds of datasets. Further comparison experiments with some classical clustering algorithms demonstrate the clustering effect of CESynC.},

  abstract     = {When specifying user requirements, not only is it critical to ensure correct and unambiguous specification of functional requirements, but also that of Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs). A critical success factor in Requirements Engineering (RE) involves recognizing conflicts among NFRs specified by multiple stakeholders having differing concerns, priorities, and responsibilities. There indeed are numerous attempts made in the literature to resolve the conflicts between two NFRs, with the traditional view of considering the two NFRs different from each other e.g. security conflicting with the availability. In this paper, however, we propose that to introduce fine-grained conflict resolution – by also focusing on those situations where one NFR conflicts with another NFR of the same type. For ease of understanding, we propose to differentiate such conflicts by coining the term intra-conflicts . Thus, we propose fine-grained conflict resolution – by focusing on the notion of resolving conflicts between two NFRs of the same type. Needless to say, non-detection of any conflict between two NFRs – whether the NFRs are of the same type or not – at an early stage of RE, leads to higher costs for changes. The process of conflict resolution is essentially intuitive and hence is iterative. Our proposal hence is motivated by a view that differentiating the inter-conflicts with intra-conflicts, helps one in better focusing on the conflict resolution. We also propose an approach that allows a requirements analyst to semi-automatically identify intra-conflicts among NFRs at an early stage of RE using natural language processing, machine learning, and ontology-based semantic analysis. The controlled experiments, conducted on five publicly available datasets, achieve an average recall, precision, and F-measure of 0.57, 0.77, and 0.65 respectively.},

To alleviate a difficulty of transporting goods within nodes for long distances, we venture to formulate a transportation problem using bi-level criteria. Again, in this paper, we incorporate the real-life uncertain situation in bi-level transportation system through fuzziness. It produces a new class of transportation problem, namely fuzzy bi-level multi-objective transportation problem (FBMOTP). We solve FBMOTP with and without priority of the 1st level of transportation problem (TP) using the Vogal Approximation Method (VAM) which are called respectively Approach 1 and Approach 2. A special emphasis of this paper is to introduce a new approach namely Approach 3 for solving the FBMOTP in addition to the considered two approaches. In this regard, we incorporate an algorithm for Approach 3 to find compromise solution of the FBMOTP using VAM. Thereafter, the proposed algorithm is illustrated to show the usefulness by taking a numerical example. A comparative analysis with the existing studies is provided to understand the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. At last, conclusions are described with the lines of future study of the paper.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we reformulate the conventional DEA models as an imprecise DEA problem and propose a novel method for evaluating the DMUs when the inputs and outputs are fuzzy and/or ordinal or vary in intervals. For this purpose, we convert all data into interval data. In order to convert each fuzzy number into interval data, we use the nearest weighted interval approximation of fuzzy numbers by applying the weighting function, and we convert each ordinal data into interval one. In this manner, we could convert all data into interval data. The presented models determine the interval efficiencies for DMUs. To rank DMUs based on their associated interval efficiencies, we first apply the Ω -index that is developed for ranking of interval numbers. Then, by introducing an ideal DMU, we rank efficient DMUs to present a complete ranking. Finally, we use one example to illustrate the process and one real application in health care to show the usefulness of the proposed approach. For this evaluation, we consider interval, ordinal, and fuzzy data alongside the precise data to evaluate 38 hospitals selected by OIG. The results reveal the capabilities of the presented method to deal with the imprecise data.},

The aim of this paper is to investigate a new multiplicative consistency of IVIFPRs based on interval arithmetic, and propose goal programming approach to improve consistency and consensus. Based on analysis of the drawbacks of the existing consistency definitions of IVIFPR, new definition for multiplicative consistent IVIFPR is introduced. Based on the proposed multiplicative consistency and analysis of the relationship between interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weights and multiplicative consistent IVIFPR, goal programming-based model is developed for deriving interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weights from IVIFPR. To measure the multiplicative consistency degree of IVIFPRs, a consistency index is introduced and then an acceptable consistency is defined. For an IVIFPR with unacceptable consistency, a mathematical programming approach is proposed to improve its consistency. By considering the experts’ subjective and consensus weights, the experts’ comprehensive weights are determined. Some numerical examples illustrate the proposed models.},

A scenario in which the robot is moved to another position during its operation without being told, known as the kidnapped robot problem, complicates global localisation. In addition to that, sensor malfunction and external influences of the environment can cause unexpected errors, called outliers, that negatively affect the localisation process. This paper proposes a method based on the fusion of a particle filter with bounded-error localisation, which is able to deal with outliers in the measurement data. The application of our algorithm to solve the kidnapped robot problem using simulated data shows an improvement over conventional probabilistic filtering methods.},

These results can formalize the management of distributed uncertainty and can be used to invent novel distributed uncertain data processing algorithms.

  abstract     = {Optimization is an important and decisive task in science. Many optimization problems in science are naturally too complicated and difficult to be modeled and solved by the conventional optimization methods such as mathematical programming problem solvers. Meta-heuristic algorithms that are inspired by nature have started a new era in computing theory to solve the optimization problems. The paper seeks to find an optimization algorithm that learns the expected quality of different places gradually and adapts its exploration-exploitation dilemma to the location of an individual. Using birds’ classical conditioning learning behavior, in this paper, a new particle swarm optimization algorithm has been introduced where particles can learn to perform a natural conditioning behavior towards an unconditioned stimulus. Particles are divided into multiple categories in the problem space and if any of them finds the diversity of its category to be low, it will try to go towards its best personal experience. But if the diversity among the particles of its category is high, it will try to be inclined to the global optimum of its category. We have also used the idea of birds’ sensitivity to the space in which they fly and we have tried to move the particles more quickly in improper spaces so that they would depart these spaces as fast as possible. On the contrary, we reduced the particles’ speed in valuable spaces in order to let them explore those places more. In the initial population, the algorithm has used the instinctive behavior of birds to provide a population based on the particles’ merits. The proposed method has been implemented in MATLAB and the results have been divided into several subpopulations or parts. The proposed method has been compared to the state-of-the-art methods. It has been shown that the proposed method is a consistent algorithm for solving the static optimization problems.},

In this regard, spatial information, including the shortest path, is of particular importance due to the reduction of economic and environmental costs. Here, the constrained shortest path (CSP) problem which has an important application in location-based online services is considered. The aim of this problem is to find a path with the lowest cost where the traversal time of the path does not exceed from a predetermined time bound. Since precise prediction of cost and time of the paths is not possible due to traffic and weather conditions, this paper discusses the CSP problems with fuzzy cost and fuzzy time. After formulating the CSP problem an efficient algorithm for finding the constrained optimal path is designed. The application of the proposed model is presented on a location-based online service called Snap.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes fuzzy-based multi-objective design optimization approach for the optimal analysis of buried pipe based on the expected value of a fuzzy output variable when the membership function is computed. The design of pipe structures is usually associated with uncertainties. Therefore, the principle of fuzzy set and a multi-objective optimization algorithm is applied to account for the variabilities associated with the uncertain parameters to ensure an acceptable performance against the impact of uncertainties. Different methods such as deterministic and non-deterministic methods have been proposed to model the effect of uncertainties and analyse the performance of engineering structure in the literature. Herein, a fuzzy-based uncertainty modelling approach that employs the optimal performance of a hybrid GA-GAM for the analysis of a buried pipeline is proposed. The purpose of the strategy is to optimise the design variable while considering the adverse effect of the uncertain fuzzy variables and variability of the structural performance. The uncertain fuzzy variable is used in the analysis to take into account the subjective nature of the corrosion process, while the entropy of a fuzzy variable used as a global measure of variable dispersion is employed to measure the variability and sensitivity of the structural response. The outcome of the fuzzy-based multi-objective design optimization provides a set of optimal solution for the analysis of fuzzy structure. Finally, the applicability and characteristic of this method are demonstrated using a numerical example, and the outcome denotes acceptable analytical tools for design engineers and can be applied to analyse other engineering structures.},

However, the classical FTA has been widely criticized due to its ambiguity and vagueness in finding the probability of basic events (BEs), and accordingly, in computing the probability of top events (TEs). In this paper, we propose a new approach considering the integration of fuzzy set theory and evidence theory for handling both types of uncertainties, i.e., epistemic and aleatory. In addition, to estimate the probability of TEs alternatively, the normal distribution is applied. By performing a numerical example of risk assessment in a collapse case study for a common offshore facility platform, the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated. Finally, in this study, the sensitivity analysis is also performed to represent the vulnerability of the causes and the interaction of different inputs, meaning that the proposed model is highly reliable and effective for real applications.},

Then we investigate the limit, continuity and derivatives of intuitionistic fuzzy functions (IFFs) based on the Einstein operations. Furthermore and what is more, some infinite and definite integrals for the IFFs are discussed importantly, and an aggregation method based on the definite integral was introduced to solve some actual decision making problems, which focus on the original data and obtain better overall evaluations in information aggregation.},

  abstract     = {Different importance measures have been developed and widely utilized in system reliability analysis to measure the importance of system components. During operation period of a complex system, it becomes more difficult to collect exact failure data of system components i.e. the collected failure data may have some sort of uncertainties due to various reasons. Generally, triangular shaped fuzzy numbers or intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs) are used to quantify the various types of uncertainty in failure data of the system’s components and fuzzy arithmetic operations are utilized which computes each reliability index with wide range of prediction due to accumulating phenomenon of fuzziness. In this paper, different types of intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN) are used to quantify the failure data uncertainty of the system’s components while α, β-cut intervals and weakest t-norm (T w )-based arithmetic operations are employed to reduce the range of prediction for each reliability index. The objective of the present study is to develop T w -based importance measure for criticality analysis in intuitionistic fuzzy fault tree analysis (IF-FTA) of a system, when different types of uncertainties in crisp failure data of basic events are quantified by different types of membership and non-membership functions. The developed importance measure applies system fault tree, α-cut and β-cut intervals, different types of intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN) and weakest t-norm (T w ) based intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic operations. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed measure, a case study of liquefied natural gas terminal emergency shutdown system (LNG-ESD system) is performed. The IF-FTA of LNG-ESD system is presented to evaluate the fault intervals of the system at different levels using T w -based arithmetic operations on different types of IFNs. The developed importance measure is applied to identify and rank the critical basic events in IF-FTA of LNG-ESD system. The proposed measure is also compared with some existing importance measures.},

  abstract     = {Bi-Choquet Integrals based on bi-capacities are very powerful aggregation operators introduced by Grabisch and Labreuche, and they can generalize Choquet Integrals. Bi-capacities can model a lager range of preferences than capacities. However, there are few existent knowledge about constructing bi-capacities, and there lacks the practical and reasonable orness/andness definitions for bi-capacities to present an effective optimism/pessimism indicator. We present a convenient way to generate bi-capacities. As the main proposal of this study, we propose an orness/andness definition for bi-capacities. Although structurally complex in defining, with the help of one interesting proposition related to bi-Choquet Integral, its reasonability in the way of constructing further proves it can indeed serve as a perfect generalization of orness/andness for capacities.},

  abstract     = {Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a linear programming method to measure the relative efficiency of a set of decision-making units (DMUs) with multiple inputs and outputs. Some DEA models are used to allocate resources and to set targets. Previous studies in resource allocation and target setting have used deterministic data; however, in real problems resources and targets are not deterministic. In this paper, a type-II fuzzy DEA approach is developed for resource allocation and target setting. A numerical example and a real case study including 11 gas refineries with two inputs and three outputs are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently allocates resources and sets targets in presence of uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis is accomplished based on the variation of the value of targets and resources and the variation of the footprint of uncertainty (FOU) of resources and targets.},

  abstract     = {Random sets arise as distinguished models to study probability under imprecision. This work aims to determine the connectedness of a random set in terms of its capacity functional (the probability of hitting a set). This problem is linked to the celebrated Choquet–Kendall–Matheron theorem, which states that a random closed set is characterized by its capacity functional. Hence, such functional must also characterize any topological property of a random set, such as its connectedness. While the capacity functional of a random closed set operates over the large class of compact sets, we show that the determination of connectedness can be checked only over a simple family of sets.},

  abstract     = {The objective of time series analysis is to study the relationship between the data over time and to predict future values. Traditionally, statisticians assume that the observation data are precise, and we can get some exact values. However, in many cases, the imprecise observation data are available. We assume that these data are uncertain variables in the sense of uncertainty theory. In this paper, the ridge method is used to compute the unknown parameters in the uncertain autoregressive model. First, the ridge estimation of the parameters is given. The shrinkage parameter in the ridge estimation is obtained by ridge trace analysis. Based on the fitted autoregressive model, the forecast value and confidence interval of the future data are derived. Then two numerical examples are presented to verify the feasibility of this approach. Finally, the effectiveness of our model in reducing the influence of the outliers is shown by the comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {Prediction of river discharge is important for water resources management. Engineers have developed many physical and mathematical models for prediction of river discharge. The fact that physical hydrological models are site specific and include many parameters, has led researchers to work on mathematical black-box models. In this study, the fuzzy time series (FTS) method was used in the prediction of river discharge. The proposed method, which is employed for the first time in hydrology, allows to fast decision-making mechanism. The proposed algorithm, FTS, is used along with continuous wavelet transform (CWT) method to improve prediction performance. CWT, can be used as pre-treatment technique, is able decompose concerned time series into several bands at different scales which allows to predict much more homogeneous series rather than complex flow discharge series. By considering various statistical success criteria, the wavelet transformed time series (WFTS) method performed quite high accurate predictions compared to the classical fuzzy time series method. Combining FTS with wavelet transform opens a new window in the fuzzy time series method applications that has ability to improve the prediction performance.},

To further exploit benefits from the ubiquitous service, studying the influence of information dissemination in this kind of social network becomes a necessity. This paper proposes a mobile social network influence model with regard to multiple roles. In the model, the concept of group is adopted to analyze a user’s role in different contexts. Through the introduction of role’s level and group’s relativity, information dissemination can be investigated deeply, and then, with the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, information strength matrix is constructed to study each node’s influence and under-influence indexes in the network, in addition, the comprehensive influence under multi-role view is also expressed distinctly in the fuzzy form. The result of this research will help find out preferable information disseminators as a new business strategy in e-commerce. Furthermore, it is also useful for detecting gossips and controlling its dissemination in social management.},
