  abstract     = {Multilayer network analysis is a useful approach for studying networks of entities that interact with each other via multiple relationships. Classifying the importance of nodes and node-layer tuples is an important aspect of the study of multilayer networks. To do this, it is common to calculate various centrality measures, which allow one to rank nodes and node-layers according to a variety of structural features. In this paper, we formulate occupation, PageRank, betweenness, and closeness centralities in terms of node-occupation properties of different types of continuous-time classical and quantum random walks on multilayer networks. We apply our framework to a variety of synthetic and real-world multilayer networks, and we identify notable differences between classical and quantum centrality measures. Our computations give insights into the correlations between certain centralities that are based on random walks and associated centralities that are based on geodesic paths.},

  abstract     = {Glucose, insulin, and glucagon together form a complete endocrine metabolic feedback loop. Most existing modeling work pertaining to this loop focuses mainly on the regulations between glucose and insulin. The role of glucagon in these works is summarized by hepatic glucose production (HGP) dependent solely on insulin levels. In this paper, we carefully analyze the secretion of glucagon, its role in HGP, and its interactions with insulin. We then formulate a dynamical system model to further analyze its effects in balancing blood sugar levels. The presence of glucagon allows us to examine the impacts of HGP governed by insulin and glucagon separately. This reveals insight about how a very recent concept, glucagon resistance, can affect blood glucose levels and lead to rampant glucagon production and consequently blood sugar levels. We also show that a form of insulin resistance in hepatic cells can lead to excess insulin secretion, a characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus. An analytical result indicates that in the equilibrium point range, the HGP caused by glucagon should not be severely outweighed by glucose uptake so that a balance between HGP and overall glucose uptake must be met for oscillations to occur. Furthermore, this model provides a guideline for the design of a dual-pump artificial pancreas system, which is believed to be the ideal treatment for type 1 diabetes mellitus. In addition, the method employed to study the instability of the equilibrium point can be extended to study general delay differential equations.},

With a uniform flow the problem is proven to be always of the Fredholm type but is found to be well-posed only when considering a dissipative radiation problem. With a general shear flow, the Fredholm property is recovered for a weak enough shear and the dissipative radiation problem requires the introduction of extra conditions to be well-posed: enough dissipation, a large enough frequency, and nonintuitive conditions on the impedance value.},

  abstract     = {Reaction-diffusion PDEs and particle-based stochastic reaction-diffusion (PBSRD) models are commonly used approaches for modeling the spatial dynamics of chemical and biological systems. Standard reaction-diffusion PDE models ignore the underlying stochasticity of spatial transport and reactions and are often described as appropriate in regimes where there are large numbers of particles in a system. Recent studies have proven the rigorous large-population limit of PBSRD models, showing the resulting mean-field models (MFMs) correspond to nonlocal systems of partial-integro differential equations. In this work we explore the rigorous relationship between standard reaction-diffusion PDE models and the derived MFM. We prove that the former can be interpreted as an asymptotic approximation to the later in the limit that bimolecular reaction kernels are short-range and averaging. As the reactive interaction length scale approaches zero, we prove the MFMs converge at second order to standard reaction-diffusion PDE models. In proving this result we also establish local well-posedness of the MFM model in time for general systems and global well-posedness for specific reaction systems and kernels. Finally, we illustrate the agreement and disagreement between the MFM, SM, and underlying particle model for several numerical examples.},

We prove well-posedness for the time-harmonic acoustic scattering of plane waves from locally perturbed periodic surfaces. It will be shown that the scattered wave of an incoming plane wave is the sum of the scattered wave for the unperturbed periodic surface plus an additional scattered wave satisfying Sommerfeld&#39;s condition on the half-plane. Whereas the scattered wave for the unperturbed periodic surface has a far field consisting of a finite number of propagating plane waves, the additional field contributes to the far field by a far-field pattern defined in the half-plane directions similarly to the pattern known for bounded obstacles.},

The fluid is assumed to be described by the Stokes flow, while the particles are either paramagnetic or diamagnetic, for which the magnetization field is a linear function of the magnetic field. The coefficients of the corresponding partial differential equations are locally periodic. A one-way coupling between the fluid domain and the particles is also assumed. The homogenized or effective response of such a suspension is derived, and the mathematical justification of the obtained asymptotics is carried out. The two-scale convergence method is adopted for the latter. As a consequence, the presented result provides a justification for the formal asymptotic analysis of Lévy and Sanchez-Palencia [Fluid Mech., 13 (1983), pp. 63--78] for particulate steady-state Stokes flows.},

  abstract     = {A new mathematical connection is established between a class of two-dimensional viscous Marangoni flows driven by insoluble surfactant and the complex Burgers equation. It is shown that the Marangoni-driven dynamics of a bath of viscous fluid at zero Reynolds and capillary number, and with a linear equation of state, are described by the evolution of a lower-analytic function with nonnegative imaginary part on the real line satisfying the complex Burgers equation. Surface diffusion of surfactant plays the role of viscosity in the more familiar real-valued Burgers equation arising in gas dynamics. Using this mathematical connection it is shown that, at arbitrary surface Peclet number, the Marangoni dynamics is linearizable, and integrable, via a transformation of Cole--Hopf type. A new class of time-evolving exact solutions is identified for the Marangoni-induced fluid motion at any finite surface Peclet number. These are shown to be given by a class of evolving N-pole solutions which differ from, and generalize, known pole dynamics solutions to the real Burgers equation. Analogous meromorphic solutions describing spatially singly periodic Marangoni flows are also reported. For infinite surface Peclet number it is shown how a generalized method of characteristics leads to an implicit form of the general solution. For a special choice of initial condition it is demonstrated that this implicit solution can be made explicit and, from it, the formation at finite time of an instantaneous weak singularity is observed. Together these new solutions afford a mathematical view of the effect of surface diffusion on Marangoni flows via the evolution of complex singularities in a nonphysical region of the complex plane. The observations open up valuable new mathematical connections between viscous Marangoni flows and the theory of caloric functions, Calogero--Moser systems, random matrices, and Dyson diffusion where the complex Burgers equation also plays a role.},

An eigenvalue problem is considered for the bi-Schrödinger operator $\Delta^2 + V(x)$ on a ball which contains the support of the potential $V$. A Weyl-type law is proved for the upper bounds of spherical normal derivatives of both the eigenfunctions $\phi$ and their Laplacian $\Delta\phi$ corresponding to the bi-Schrödinger operator. These types of upper bounds was proved by Hassell and Tao [Math. Res. Lett., 9 (2012), pp. 289--305] for the Schrödinger operator. The meromorphic continuation is investigated for the resolvent of the bi-Schrödinger operator, which is shown to have a resonance-free region and an estimate of $L^2_{comp} - L^2_{loc}$ type for the resolvent. As an application, we prove a bound of the analytic continuation of the data with respect to the frequency. Finally, the stability estimate is derived for the inverse source problem. The estimate consists of the Lipschitz-type data discrepancy and the high-frequency tail of the source function, where the latter decreases as the upper bound of the frequency increases.},

However, rather than normal diffusion, anomalous subdiffusion is observed in many systems and is especially prevalent in cell biology. What are the reaction-subdiffusion equations describing a system that involves first-order reactions and subdiffusive motion? In this paper, we derive fractional reaction-subdiffusion equations describing an arbitrary number of molecular species that react at first-order rates and move subdiffusively. Importantly, different species may have different diffusivities and drifts, which contrasts previous approaches to this question that assume that each species has the same movement dynamics. We derive the equations by combining results on time-dependent fractional Fokker--Planck equations with methods of analyzing stochastically switching evolution equations. Furthermore, we construct the stochastic description of individual molecules whose deterministic concentrations follow these reaction-subdiffusion equations. This stochastic description involves subordinating a diffusion process whose dynamics are controlled by a subordinated jump process. We illustrate our results in several examples and show that solutions of the reaction-subdiffusion equations agree with stochastic simulations of individual molecules.},

  abstract     = {We consider the reconstruction of acoustic sources with multifrequency sparse scattered fields. Specifically, we shall use the multifrequency scattered fields at finitely many measurement points to prove some uniqueness results and introduce three numerical schemes. The underlying sources can be an extended source or a sum of monopoles and dipoles. At a fixed measurement point, we show that the spheres centered at the point passing through the point sources can be uniquely determined by the multifrequency scattered fields. For $M$ multipolar point sources, the uniqueness for locating the positions and recovering scattering strengths has been proved using multifrequency scattered fields for at most $6M+1$ measurement points. For an extended source, we show that the smallest annular containing the source centered at the measurement point can be uniquely determined by the multifrequency scattered field. Motivated by the uniqueness proofs, we then introduce three schemes for reconstructing the sources. Some numerical examples in three dimensions are presented to show the validity and robustness of the proposed numerical schemes.},

  abstract     = {In neuroscience, synaptic plasticity refers to the set of mechanisms driving the dynamics of neuronal connections, called synapses and represented by a scalar value, the synaptic weight. A spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule is a biologically based model representing the time evolution of the synaptic weight as a functional of the past spiking activity of adjacent neurons. A general mathematical framework has been introduced in [P. Robert and G. Vignoud, SIAM. J. Appl. Math., 81 (2021), pp. 1821--1846]. In this paper, we develop and investigate a scaling approach of these models based on several biological assumptions. Experiments show that long-term synaptic plasticity evolves on a much slower timescale than the cellular mechanisms driving the activity of neuronal cells, like their spiking activity or the concentration of various chemical components created/suppressed by this spiking activity. For this reason, a scaled version of the stochastic model of Robert and Vignoud [SIAM. J. Appl. Math., 81 (2021), pp. 1821--1846] is introduced and a limit theorem, an averaging principle, is stated for a large class of plasticity kernels. A companion paper [P. Robert and G. Vignoud, J. Stat. Phys. 183 (2021), 47] is entirely devoted to the tightness properties used to prove these convergence results. These averaging principles are used to study two important STDP models: pair-based rules and calcium-based rules. Our results are compared with the approximations of neuroscience STDP models. A class of discrete models of STDP rules is also investigated for the analytical tractability of its limiting dynamical system.},

  abstract     = {The Gardner equation is an integrable system which includes the Korteweg--de Vries (for quadratic nonlinearitry) and the modified Korteweg--de Vries equation (for cubic nonlinearity) as special cases. It is well known that shear waves in isotropic elasticity are usually attained by introducing cubic nonlinearities in the constitutive assumptions. Here, by considering different perturbative limits, within the classical Mooney--Rivlin energy, we obtain that for weakly dispersive materials in different perturbative limits, the resulting Boussinesq equations lead to the Gardner equation. Specifically this is attained in the three cases of prestrained, anisotropic, and when a substrate interaction is taken into account. This result allows us also to discuss the possible occurrence of flatons as solitary transverse waves.},

Through an approximation procedure, the standard ordinary differential equations are replaced by nonlocal evolution equations on the unit interval.Â  In this work, we adopt this methodology to prove the validity of the continuum limit of random walks, a largely studied model for diffusion on graphs. We focus on two classes of processes on dense weighted graphs, in discrete and in continuous time, whose dynamics are encoded in the transition matrix of the associated Markov chain or in the random-walk Laplacian. We further show that previous works on the discrete heat equation, associated to the combinatorial Laplacian, fall within the scope of our approach. Finally, we characterize the relaxation time of the process in the continuum limit.},

Recent work has advanced in the study of the orb-web as a sensor when it is subjected to small transverse vibrations, using a continuous membrane model for the orb-web. However, in-plane vibrations have not been investigated yet as data for the prey detection problem. In the present work, we develop the structure of the small in-plane vibratory response of an axially symmetric orb-web supported at the boundary. Additionally, we prove that knowledge of the in-plane dynamic response inside an annulus centered at the origin of the orb-web, where the spider is assumed to stay for a sufficiently large registration time, allows us to determine uniquely the in-plane distributed load simulating the prey&#39;s impact. The theoretical outcome is illustrated with a numerical implementation of the reconstruction method.},

Instead, one can use contour integrals, which is computationally a more reliable method than the classical root-finding approach. We also give the necessary and sufficient condition for the mean of the corresponding random variable, e.g., queue length, to be an additive function of the roots. In this case, the mean is found using one contour integral. Finally, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for the mean to be independent of the roots.},

We first discuss the model equations in the strong form, which describes the conservation of mass and Darcy&#39;s law in the continuum and network as well as the coupling between them. By introducing proper scaling, we propose a weak form that avoids degeneracy. Well-posedness of the weak form is shown through standard Babuška--Brezzi theory. We also develop the mixed formulation finite-element method and prove its well-posedness. A mass-lumping technique is introduced to derive the two-point flux approximation (TPFA) type discretization as well, due to its importance in applications. Based on the Babuška--Brezzi theory, error estimates can be obtained for both the finite-element scheme and the TPFA scheme. We also discuss efficient linear solvers for discrete problems. Finally, we present some numerical examples to verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the robustness of our proposed discretization schemes.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic discrete-time susceptible--infected--susceptible (SIS) and susceptible--infected--recovered (SIR) models of endemic diseases are introduced and analyzed. For the deterministic, mean-field model, the basic reproductive number $R_0$ determines their global dynamics. If $R_0\le 1$, then the frequency of infected individuals asymptotically converges to zero. If $R_0&gt;1$, then the infectious class uniformly persists for all time; conditions for a globally stable, endemic equilibrium are given. In contrast, the infection goes extinct in finite time with a probability of 1 in the stochastic models for all $R_0$ values. To understand the length of the transient prior to extinction as well as the behavior of the transients, the quasi-stationary distributions and the associated mean time to extinction are analyzed using large deviation methods. When $R_0&gt;1$, these mean times to extinction are shown to increase exponentially with the population size $N$. Moreover, as $N$ approaches $\infty$, the quasi-stationary distributions are supported by a compact set bounded away from extinction; sufficient conditions for convergence to a Dirac measure at the endemic equilibrium of the deterministic model are also given. In contrast, when $R_0&lt;1$, the mean times to extinction are bounded above $1/(1-\alpha)$, where $\alpha&lt;1$ is the geometric rate of decrease of the infection when rare; as $N$ approaches $\infty$, the quasi-stationary distributions converge to a Dirac measure at the disease-free equilibrium for the deterministic model. For several special cases, explicit formulas for approximating the quasi-stationary distribution and the associated mean extinction are given. These formulas illustrate how for arbitrarily small $R_0$ values, the mean time to extinction can be arbitrarily large, and how for arbitrarily large $R_0$ values, the mean time to extinction can be arbitrarily large.},

  abstract     = {The problem of deformation of a drop freely suspended in another fluid and subjected to an electric field has long been of theoretical and practical interest. In this problem, the velocity and electric fields are coupled through the boundary conditions, one of which corresponds to the nonlinear effect of surface charge convection. The balance between the electric stress and surface tension is characterized by electric capillary number ${Ca}_E$, whereas the effect of surface charge convection is characterized by electric Reynolds number ${Re}_E$ (the ratio of timescales for charge relaxation and convective flow). The drop experiences no deformation when ${Ca}_E=0$, and there is no surface charge convection when ${Re}_E=0$. Finding drop steady shape even when ${Re}_E=0$ is a computationally expensive iterative procedure with generally slow convergence. However, several experimental and theoretical studies show that when drop deformation is not large, the drop steady shape is close to spheroidal. This observation and the fact that ${Ca}_E^{-1}$ enters the boundary conditions linearly suggest to solve the inverse problem: Find ${Ca}_E$ for which a spheroidal shape with given axes ratio $d$ is as close to being steady as possible. The velocity and electric fields and ${Ca}_E$ are expanded into series with respect to a parameter proportional to ${Re}_E$, and the inverse problem is reduced to a system of successive linear problems which can be efficiently solved. Values of $({Ca}_E(d),d)$, obtained based on that system for various values of ${Re}_E$ and for various ratios of phases&#39; electric conductivities, dielectric constants, and viscosities, are in good agreement with existing results for nonsmall deformations and nonsmall ${Re}_E$.},

  abstract     = {To close the moment model deduced from kinetic equations, the canonical approach is to provide an approximation to the flux function not able to be depicted by the moments in the reduced model. In this paper, we propose a brand new closure approach with remarkable advantages over the canonical approach. Instead of approximating the flux function, the new approach closes the moment model by approximating the flux gradient. Precisely, we approximate the space derivative of the distribution function by an ansatz which is a weighted polynomial, and the derivative of the closing flux is computed by taking the moments of the ansatz. Consequently, the method provides us an improved framework to derive globally hyperbolic moment models, which preserve all those conservative variables in the low order moments. It is shown that the linearized system at the weight function, which is often the local equilibrium, of the moment model deduced by our new approach is automatically coincided with the system deduced from the classical perturbation theory, which cannot be satisfied by the previous hyperbolic regularization framework. Taking, the Boltzmann equation as an example, the linearlization of the moment model gives the correct Navier--Stokes--Fourier law, which is the same result as that which the Chapman--Enskog expansion gives. Most existing globally hyperbolic moment models are reproduced by our new approach, and several new models are proposed based on this framework.},

For a geometric matching, we propose a system of dynamical system for the evolution of centroids and rotations of polytopes to match the vertices under rigid-body motions which can be decomposed as a composition of translation and rotations. Our proposed dynamical system acts on the product space $({\mathbb R}^d \times SO(d))^N$. The evolution of centroids can be described by the coupled linear second-order dynamical system with diffusive linear couplings, whereas rotations for the matching of vertices are described by the Lohe matrix model on $SO(d)^N$. In particular, the Lohe matrix model has been derived from some set of physical principles compared to previous works in which the Lohe matrix model was employed as a system dynamics. This is a contrasted difference between earlier works on the Lohe matrix model which has been adopted a priori for an aggregate modeling of matrices. We also provide an analytical result leading to the complete shape matchings for an ensemble of congruent polytopes, and several numerical examples to illustrate analytical results visually.},

We develop a single, deterministic partial differential equation, in terms of number of people per area, that is a generalization of the Cahn--Hilliard equation in a manner that allows for future generalizations. The equation is numerically solved and demonstrates a plausible mass refugee movement under the influence of a perceived threat and nonuniform terrain conditions while moving in a group.},

After introducing the discourse sheaf model for communication in a social network, we develop a sheaf Laplacian in this context and show how to evolve both opinions and communications with diffusion dynamics over the network. Issues of controllability, reachability, bounded confidence, and harmonic extension are addressed using this framework, providing a rich class of analyzable examples.},

Examples include ice sheets, sea ice, and even shallow oceans and lakes. We address these problems as discrete-time sequences of continuous-space weak formulations, namely, (monotone) variational inequalities or complementarity problems, in which the conserved quantity is the layer thickness. Free boundaries wherein the thickness and mass flux both go to zero at the margin of the fluid layer generically arise in such models. After showing these problems are well-posed in several cases, we consider the limitations to discrete conservation in numerical schemes. A free boundary in a region of negative source---an ablation-caused margin---turns out to be a barrier to exact conservation in either a continuous- or discrete-space sense. We then propose computable a posteriori quantities which allow conservation-error bounds in finite volume and finite element schemes.},

  abstract     = {Any time-harmonic electromagnetic wave can be uniquely decomposed into left and right circularly polarized components. The concept of electromagnetic chirality (em-chirality) describes differences in the interaction of these two components with a scattering object or medium. Such differences can be quantified by means of em-chirality measures. These measures attain their minimal value zero for em-achiral objects or media that interact essentially in the same way with left and right circularly polarized waves. Scattering objects or media with positive em-chirality measure interact qualitatively differently with left and right circularly polarized waves, and maximally em-chiral scattering objects or media would not interact with fields of either positive or negative helicity. This paper examines a shape optimization problem, where the goal is to determine thin tubular structures consisting of dielectric isotropic materials that exhibit large measures of em-chirality at a given frequency. We develop a gradient based optimization scheme that uses an asymptotic representation formula for scattered waves due to thin tubular scattering objects. Numerical examples suggest that thin helical structures are at least locally optimal among this class of scattering objects.},

Nevertheless, numerical results for that equation, which use the data generated for that coefficient inverse problem, show a good reconstruction accuracy.

The goal of this paper is to give new evidence of these phenomena by considering an infinite set of independent neurons (a module) with Poisson statistics and periodic spread-out Gaussian tuning curves. This question of the existence of an optimal grid is transformed into a maximization problem among all possible unit density lattices for a Fisher information, which measures the accuracy of grid-cells representations in ${\mathbb R}^d$. This Fisher information has translated lattice theta functions as building blocks. We first derive asymptotic and numerical results showing the (non)maximality of the triangular lattice with respect to the Gaussian parameter and the size of the firing field. In a particular case where the size of the firing fields and the lattice spacing match with experiments, we have numerically checked that it is possible to find a value for the Gaussian parameter above which the triangular lattice is always optimal. In the case of a radially symmetric distribution of firing locations, we also characterize all the lattices that are critical points for the Fisher information at fixed scales belonging to an open interval. (We call these lattices, “volume stationary&quot;.) It allows us to compare the Fisher information of a finite number of lattices in dimension 2 and 3 and to give another move evidence of the optimality of the triangular and FCC lattices.},

This approach models infection-age-dependent infectivity and extends the classical SIR and SEIR models. We focus on the infectivity process (total force of infection at each time) and prove a functional law of large number (FLLN). In the deterministic limit of this FLLN, the joint evolution of the mean infectivity and of the proportion of susceptible individuals is determined by a two-dimensional deterministic integral equation. From its solutions, we then obtain expressions for the evolution of the proportions of exposed, infectious, and recovered individuals. For the early phase, we study the stochastic model directly by using an approximate (non-Markovian) branching process and show that the epidemic grows at an exponential rate on the event of nonextinction, which matches the rate of growth derived from the deterministic linearized equations. We also use these equations to derive the expression for the basic reproduction number $R_0$ during the early stage of an epidemic, in terms of the average individual infectivity function and the exponential rate of growth of the epidemic, and apply our results to the Covid-19 epidemic.},

In the spatially continuous case, the incorporation of diffusion can cause blow-up with respect to the $L^{\infty}$ norm, and criteria exist to determine whether the system is bounded for all time. However, no equivalent criteria exist for the discrete reaction-diffusion system. Due to the possible dynamical differences between these two system types and the advantage of using the spatially discrete representation to describe biological processes, it is worth examining the discrete system independently of the continuous system. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on determining sufficient conditions to guarantee that the discrete reaction-diffusion system is bounded for all time. We consider reaction-diffusion systems on a 1D domain with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and nonnegative initial data and solutions. We define a Lyapunov-like function and show that its existence guarantees that the discrete reaction-diffusion system is bounded. These results are considered in the context of four example systems for which Lyapunov-like functions can and cannot be found.},

  abstract     = {In neuroscience, learning and memory are usually associated with long-term changes in neuronal connectivity. In this context, synaptic plasticity refers to the set of mechanisms driving the dynamics of neuronal connections, called synapses and represented by a scalar value, the synaptic weight. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a biologically based model representing the time evolution of the synaptic weight as a functional of the past spiking activity of adjacent neurons. Although numerous models of neuronal cells have been proposed in the mathematical literature, few of them include a variable for the time-varying strength of the connection. A new, general, mathematical framework is introduced to study synaptic plasticity associated to different STDP rules. The system composed of two neurons connected by a single synapse is investigated, and a stochastic process describing its dynamical behavior is presented and analyzed. The notion of plasticity kernel is introduced as a key component of plastic neural networks models, generalizing a notion used for pair-based models. We show that a large number of STDP rules from neuroscience and physics can be represented by this formalism. Several aspects of these models are discussed and compared to canonical models of computational neuroscience. An important subclass of plasticity kernels with a Markovian formulation is also defined and investigated. In these models, the time evolution of cellular processes such as the neuronal membrane potential and the concentrations of chemical components created/suppressed by spiking activity has the Markov property.},

Our results cover situations in which the global attraction critically depends on the delay. From an applied point of view, this equation naturally appears in many biological situations, e.g., epidemic models with awareness and the production of platelets. In epidemiology, it is becoming clear that the different types of population awareness and the time delays of individuals&#39; responses to available information about the disease play a critical role in its spread. Using our theoretical results, we describe qualitative properties of the behavioral responses that prevent the presence of sustainable oscillations in the number of infected individuals.

To illustrate the utility of these equivalences, we calculate the equilibria of the scalar DDE, and compute the characteristic function---without calculating a determinant.

Previous studies of this model, restricted to flat redistribution schemes, have demonstrated the presence of a phase transition to a partially wealth-condensed state, or “partial oligarchy,” at the critical value of an order parameter. These studies have also indicated the presence of an exponential tail in wealth distribution precisely at criticality. Away from criticality, the tail was observed to be Gaussian. In this work, we generalize the flat redistribution within the affine wealth model to allow for an essentially arbitrary redistribution policy. We show that the exponential tail observed near criticality in prior work is, in fact, a special case of a much broader class of critical, slower-than-Gaussian decays that depend sensitively on the corresponding asymptotic behavior of the progressive redistribution model used. We thereby demonstrate that the functional form of the tail of the wealth distribution in a near-critical society is not universal in nature but rather entirely determined by the specifics of public policy decisions. This is significant because most major economies today are observed to be near-critical.},

  abstract     = {Søderberg electrodes feature prominently in the operation of metallurgical electrical furnaces. The electrode material must bake before entering the furnace; failure to bake will lower the efficiency of the process and may cause physical harm to the furnace itself through a soft breakage. As such, ensuring that the baking isotherm remains within the region of the electrode outside of the furnace is essential. We propose a mathematical model for a Søderberg electrode taking into account the heat, mass, and current transfer mechanisms at play, along with realistic boundary conditions on the outside of the electrode that are strongly heterogeneous in height. The resulting model describes a strongly heterogeneous cylindrical “thermistor&quot; which moves slowly downward and is acted on by current clamps which provide Joule heating. Although it is often ignored in the literature on thermistor problems, we find that the Péclet number resulting from the downward motion strongly influences the position of the baking isotherm. Aside from some specific reductions leading to analytical solutions, the general form of the model is complicated enough to require numerical simulations. Still, our modeling approach provides us with a qualitative understanding of many aspects of the Søderberg electrode baking process and permits us to identify three parameters of key importance to the positioning of the baking isotherm. In particular, our results suggest desired ranges for the lowering rate of the electrode (in terms of a Péclet number), the radius of the electrode, and the strength of the Joule heating due to an applied current, which are the three aspects which may be controlled (to varying degrees) in industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {We analyze an inverse boundary value problem in two-dimensional viscoelastic media with a generalized impedance boundary condition on the inclusion via boundary integral equation methods. The model problem is derived from a recent asymptotic analysis of a thin elastic coating as the thickness tends to zero [F. Caubet, D. Kateb, and F. Le Louër, J. Elasticity, 136 (2019), pp. 17--53]. The boundary condition involves a new second order surface symmetric operator with mixed regularity properties on tangential and normal components. The well-posedness of the direct problem is established for a wide range of constant viscoelastic parameters and impedance functions. Extending previous research in the Helmholtz case, the unique identification of the impedance parameters from measured data produced by the scattering of three independent incident plane waves is established. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical experiments generated by an inverse algorithm that simultaneously recovers the impedance parameters and the density solution to the equivalent boundary integral equation reformulation of the direct problem.},

The Coulomb correlation including the dielectric polarization is treated by solving a generalized Debye--Hückel equation which is a Green&#39;s function equation with the correlation energy of a test ion described by the self Green&#39;s function. The hard-sphere correlation is modeled through the modified fundamental measure theory. The resulting model is available for problems beyond the mean-field theory such as problems with variable dielectric media, multivalent ions, and strong surface charge density. We solve the generalized Debye--Hückel equation by the Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin approximation, and study the electrolytes between two parallel dielectric surfaces. In comparison to other modified models, the new model is shown to be more accurate in agreement with particle-based simulations and capturing the physical properties of ionic structures near interfaces.},

The same dynamical system also occurs in evolutionary game dynamics, in genetic selection, and as Lotka--Volterra equations of ecology. An arrow in a hyperchain encapsulates the enzymatic influence of one species on the autocatalytic replication of another. We show that the network topology of a hyperchain, which captures all such enzymatic influences, is intimately related to the dynamical properties of the mass action system it generates. Dynamical properties such as existence, uniqueness, and stability of a positive equilibrium, as well as permanence, are determined by graph-theoretic properties such as existence of a spanning linear subgraph, being unrooted, being cyclic, and Hamiltonicity.},

We investigate the population dynamics of the model in the habitat suitable for growth of both species for two cases: (i) one species is competitively stronger and has a slower spreading speed, and (ii) both species coexist. We obtain conditions under which the outcome of competition depends critically on a number $\overline{c}(\infty)$ given by the model parameters. We show that under appropriate conditions, if $\overline{c}(\infty)&gt;c$, then the species with the faster spreading speed spreads into the open space at its own speed and the species with the slower spreading speed spreads into its rival at speed $\overline{c}(\infty)$, and if $\overline{c}(\infty)&lt;c$, then the species with the slower spreading speed eventually dies out in space. Our results particularly demonstrate the possibility that a competitively weaker species with a faster spreading speed can drive a competitively stronger species with a slower spreading speed to extinction.

In this paper, we formulate a four-compartment model and its simplified version to explore how we should model the recruitment dynamics of workers in social insect colonies properly. Our four-compartment model has the components of the unalarmed patrollers, the alarmed patrollers, the alarmed recruiters, and the available workers, while its simplified version has three components where we combine the unalarmed patrollers and the alarmed patrollers into the patrollers. We perform complete mathematical and bifurcation analyses on both the full system and its simplified system. We have many interesting findings, including that (i) the simplified three-compartment system has only simple equilibrium dynamics, i.e., no periodic and chaotic dynamics; (ii) the four-compartment system has very complex dynamics; for example, it can have up to three subcritical Hopf bifurcations, two supercritical Hopf bifurcations, two limit point bifurcations, and a fold bifurcation of the limit cycle. Those important results provide theoretical guidance for modeling and studying recruitment dynamics of social insect colonies: It is critical to have proper compartments for biological systems as the number of compartments could lead to totally different dynamics, and hence affect policy-making.},

The FSI model is coupled to a set of advection-reaction-diffusion equations defined on moving domains so that we may study the interaction between the blood flow, a stented coronary artery, and time-dependent pharmacokinetics of drug absorption in drug-eluting stents. A monolithic approach is used to implement the proposed problem numerically within the context of finite element discretization. Nitsche&#39;s method is employed to enforce one of the coupling conditions at the moving fluid-poroelastic structure interface. Stability analysis is presented, providing conditions on Nitsche&#39;s penalty parameter under which the scheme is unconditionally stable. Using 3D simulations, five geometrically different metallic stent platforms are considered with two different pharmacokinetics to show how stent geometry and type of coating impact the biomechanical environment, the local hemodynamics, and the concentration of the pharmacological agents within the vascular wall and artery lumen. It is found that stent implantation changes the permeability properties of the arterial wall, as well as local hemodynamics, which may be responsible for the so-called edge effect, i.e., suboptimal reduction in restenosis rates near the edges of drug-eluting stents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of drug-eluting stents that takes into account fluid-poroelastic structure interaction with permeability depending on the volumetric change of the pore size, coupled to an advection-reaction-diffusion model defined on moving domains.},

  abstract     = {The adaptation of biological species to their environment depends on their traits. When various biological processes occur (survival, reproduction, migration, etc.), the trait distribution may change with respect to time and space. In the context of invasions, when considering the evolution of a heritable trait that encodes the dispersive ability of individuals, the trait distribution develops a particular spatial structure that leads to the acceleration of the front propagation. That phenomenon is known as spatial sorting. Many biological examples can be cited like the bush cricket in Britain, the cane toad invasion in Australia, or the common myna one in South Africa. Adopting this framework, recent mathematical studies have led to highlighting the influence of the reproductive mode on the front propagation. Asexual populations have been shown to spread with an asymptotic rate of $t^{3/2}$ in a minimal reaction-diffusion model, whereas the analogous rate for sexual populations is of $t^{5/4}$ (where $t$ denotes the time). However, the precise description of the behavior of the front propagation in the sexual case is still an open question. The aim of this paper is to give precise approximations for large times of its position, as well as some features of the local trait distribution at the front. To do so, we solve explicitly the asymptotic problem derived formally. Numerical simulations are shown to confirm these calculations.},

We consider a threshold contagion model on networks whose nodes are embedded in a manifold and which have both “geometric edges,” which respect the geometry of the underlying manifold, and “nongeometric edges,” which are not constrained by that geometry. Building on ideas from Taylor et al. [Nat. Commun., 6 (2015), 7723], we examine when a contagion propagates as a wave along a network whose nodes are embedded in a torus and when it jumps via long nongeometric edges to remote areas of the network. We build a “contagion map” for a contagion spreading on such a “noisy geometric network” to produce a point cloud, and we study the dimensionality, geometry, and topology of this point cloud to examine qualitative properties of this spreading process. We identify a region in parameter space in which the contagion propagates predominantly via wavefront propagation. We consider different probability distributions for constructing nongeometric edges---reflecting different decay rates with respect to the distance between nodes in the underlying manifold---and examine the effect of such choices on the qualitative properties of the spreading dynamics. Our work generalizes the analysis in Taylor et al. [Nat. Commun., 6 (2015), 7723] and consolidates contagion maps both as a tool for investigating spreading behavior on spatial networks and as a technique for manifold learning.},

  abstract     = {Exponential family random graph models (ERGMs) are widely used to model networks by parameterizing graph probability in terms of a set of user-selected sufficient statistics. Equivalently, ERGMs can be viewed as expressing a probability distribution on graphs arising from the action of competing social forces that make ties more or less likely, depending on the state of the rest of the graph. Such forces often lead to a complex pattern of dependence among edges, with non-trivial large-scale structures emerging from relatively simple local mechanisms. While this provides a powerful tool for probing macro-micro connections, much remains to be understood about how local forces shape global outcomes. One very simple question of this type is that of the conditions needed for social forces to stabilize a particular structure: that is, given a specific structure and a set of alternatives (e.g., arising from small perturbations), under what conditions will said structure remain more probable than the alternatives? We refer to this property as local stability and seek a general means of identifying the set of parameters under which a target graph is locally stable with respect to a set of alternatives. Here, we provide a complete characterization of the region of the parameter space inducing local stability, showing it to be the interior of a convex cone whose faces can be derived from the change scores of the sufficient statistics vis-à-vis the alternative structures. As we show, local stability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for more general notions of stability, the latter of which can be explored more efficiently by using the “stable cone” within the parameter space as a starting point. In addition to facilitating the understanding of model behavior, we show how local stability can be used to determine whether a fitted model implies that an observed structure would be expected to arise primarily from the action of social forces, versus by merit of the model permitting a large number of high probability structures, of which the observed structure is one (i.e., entropic effects). We also use our approach to identify the dyads within a given structure that are the least stable, and hence predicted to have the highest probability of changing under the current social forces. The utility of the “stable cone” for ERGM parameter optimization is then demonstrated on a physical model of amyloid fibril formation. This demonstration features a visualization of the stable region, whereby it is shown that the majority of the region of the model&#39;s parameter space where ERGM simulations produce the highest fibril yield lies within the “stable cone.”},

  abstract     = {This article investigates parametric sensitivities of rioting activity, based on a model of the 2005 French riots. Previously validated against a comprehensive data set, the aforementioned modeling efforts were multiscale in nature and applied at the provincial scale for all of France and the municipal scale in the Île-de-France region around Paris. The governing dynamics at the municipal scale include a bandwagon effect, observed in rioting activity wherein an outburst of activity occurs once a “tipping point” threshold is reached in the people engaging in the activity. This tipping point mechanism is modeled using a nonsmooth function, yielding a framework of nonsmooth ODEs, which makes conventional theory and methods unsuitable. In this article, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the municipal-scale model by adopting a recently developed tool in nonsmooth analysis called the lexicographic directional derivative. Numerical solutions are provided from which we can conclude the relative importance of different parameters in the model, in order to discover the underlying mechanisms that play a crucial role in driving the riot activities. It is shown that the exit/removal rate from rioting activity and geographic proximity have the greatest impact on the dynamics of the social contagion. On the other hand, the initial rioting activity and the tipping point seem less influential.},

The model is a six-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. In our study, we take into account the phenol and the hydrogen input concentrations as well as the maintenance terms. Moreover, we consider the case of a large class of growth rates, instead of specific kinetics. In this general case, a recent study shows that the system can have up to eight steady states, and their existence conditions were analytically determined. We focus here on the necessary and sufficient conditions of the local stability of the steady states, according to the four operating parameters of the process, which are the dilution rate and the chlorophenol, phenol, and hydrogen input concentrations. In previous studies, this stability analysis was performed only numerically. Using the Liénard--Chipart stability criterion, we show that the positive steady state can be unstable and we give numerical evidence for a supercritical Hopf bifurcation with the appearance of a stable periodic orbit. We give two bifurcation diagrams with respect to the dilution rate, first, and then to the chlorophenol input concentration as the bifurcating parameters, showing that the system can present rich behavior, including bistability, coexistence, and occurrence of limit cycle.},

  abstract     = {Aggregation phenomena occur across the biological sciences, from cell adhesion to insect swarms, animal home ranges to human cities. Understanding the mechanisms by which they may spontaneously emerge has therefore generated much interest from applied mathematicians. Partial differential equations (PDEs) with nonlocal advection offer a popular formalism for studying aggregations. However, the inherent nonlocality, often necessary for ensuring continuum models are well-posed, makes their study technically challenging. Here, we take a different approach by studying a discrete-space system that can be formally related to classical nonlocal PDE approaches via a limiting procedure. We show how to find expressions for the asymptotically stable steady-states of this discrete-space system via an energy functional approach. This allows us to predict the size of aggregations as a function of the underlying movement mechanisms of individual organisms. We apply this to a recent model of cell adhesion, revealing a hysteresis property whereby the existing aggregations may persist even as the adhesion tendency decreases past the bifurcation point. We compare this to numerical solutions of the associated nonlocal PDE system, showing that the hysteresis property predicted by the discrete-space expressions is also present in the continuum system.},

Bacteria form, in short periods of time, a habitat---the biofilm---where they develop multiresistance and tolerance to antibiotics and to the host immune system. To avoid its formation, researchers in the biomedical sciences showed evidence that coating medical devices with antibacterial agents---antibiotics---is a promising strategy. We present a mathematical model to simulate the action of an antibiotic, released from a medical surface, to fight bacterial infection. The model is composed by a system of partial differential equations that describe the distribution of drug and the evolution of a bacterial population. The preexistence of infection focus, the inoculation of bacteria during the surgery, the race for the medical surface, the resistance and tolerance of the population are taken into account. Analytical estimates of the bacterial density show the crucial importance of aseptic surgical procedures and of timely detection of preexisting infection focus.

Since the model contains a nonlinear differential operator, we cannot use a Lyapunov functional and an a priori estimate method directly. In this paper, we provide a new framework to obtain complete phase and frequency synchronization of the power grid model. We assume that the coupling strength and the moment of inertia are positive and the initial data are near the synchronization state. After applying an appropriate transform, we derive a system of differential equations whose coefficient matrix is negative definite. The initial data assumption and the negative definite coefficient matrix lead to the global existence and synchronization of the power grid model with a nonlinear differential operator. For both identical and nonidentical cases, the exponential decay for the frequency difference is determined and the square of frequencies converges to the average of the normalized energy feeding rates.},

The objective is to determine the shape of the packing that maximizes the reaction conversion rate subjected to some specified manufacturing constraints. The optimization approach developed is based on the adjoint system method and the results show that the optimal shape obtained allows one to significantly improve the reaction conversion rate.

We study a stochastic queueing control problem (QCP) with the control process governing the allocation of each arriving organ, and the objective of maximizing the expected total life years, which consists of both pre- and posttransplant years, of the entire population in the system during a finite time horizon. We first construct a deterministic control problem, referred to as the fluid control problem (FCP), and show that it serves as a performance upper bound for the QCP. We next develop an asymptotic framework, in which large scaled overloaded transplant systems are considered, and show that the fluid scaled QCP attains the FCP upper bound asymptotically. We then propose a simple priority type policy for the QCP based on the optimal solution of the FCP, and establish its asymptotic optimality through a scaling limit theorem. Last, we conduct sensitivity analysis of the FCP with respect to the input parameters and functions to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed policy.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a mathematical modeling framework for the conformational dynamics of charged molecules (i.e., solutes) in an aqueous solvent (i.e., water or salted water). The solvent is treated as an incompressible fluid, and its fluctuating motion is described by the Stokes equation with the Landau--Lifschitz stochastic stress. The motion of the solute-solvent interface (i.e., the dielectric boundary) is determined by the fluid velocity together with the balance of the viscous force, hydrostatic pressure, surface tension, solute-solvent van der Waals interaction force, and electrostatic force. The electrostatic interactions are described by the dielectric Poisson--Boltzmann theory. Within such a framework, we derive a generalized Rayleigh--Plesset equation, a nonlinear stochastic ordinary differential equation (SODE), for the radius of a spherical charged molecule, such as an ion. The spherical average of the stochastic stress leads to a multiplicative noise. We design and test numerical methods for solving the SODE and use the equation, together with explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations, to study the effective radius of a single ion. Potentially, our general modeling framework can be used to efficiently determine the solute-solvent interfacial structures and predict the free energies of more complex molecular systems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we address the question of determining optimal chemotherapy strategies to prevent the growth of brain tumor population. To do so, we consider a reaction-diffusion model which describes the diffusion and proliferation of tumor cells and a minimization problem corresponding to it. We shall establish that the optimization problem admits a solution and obtain a necessary condition for the minimizer. In a specific case, the optimizer is calculated explicitly, and we prove that it is unique. Then, a gradient-based efficient numerical algorithm is developed in order to determine the optimizer. Our results suggest a bang-bang chemotherapy strategy in a cycle which starts at the maximum dose and terminates with a rest period. Numerical simulations based upon our algorithm on a real brain image show that this is in line with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), a standard chemotherapy protocol.},

In this work, we aim to investigate the boundary propagation speeds in those models based on asymptotic analysis of the free boundary model and efficient numerical simulations of the cell density model. We derive, for the first time, some analytical solutions for the free boundary model with pressure jumps across the tumor boundary in multidimensions with finite tumor sizes. We further show that in the large radius limit, the analytical solutions to the free boundary model in one and multiple spatial dimensions converge to traveling wave solutions. The convergence rate in the propagation speeds are algebraic in multidimensions as opposed to the exponential convergence in one dimension. We also propose an accurate front capturing numerical scheme for the cell density model, and extensive numerical tests are provided to illustrate the analytical findings.},

We investigate quantitatively the surface localization of the plasmons in three dimensions. The results are threefold. We first prove that on smooth bounded domains of general shape, the sequence of plasmons converges to zero off the boundary surface almost surely at the rate faster than $j^{-1/2}$ as $j \to \infty$. We then prove that if the domain is strictly convex, then the convergence rate becomes $j^{-\infty}$; namely, it is faster than $j^{-N}$ for any integer $N$. As a consequence, we prove that cloaking by anomalous localized resonance does not occur on three-dimensional strictly convex smooth domains. We then look into the surface localization of the plasmons on the Clifford torus by numerical computations. The Clifford torus is taken as an example of nonconvex surfaces. The computational results show that the torus exhibits spectral properties completely different from strictly convex domains. In particular, they suggest that there is a subsequence of plasmons on the torus which has much slower decay than other entries of the sequence.},

We find that the scale-dependent dynamics and the self-similar mixing can be RT type and RM type depending on the exponent of the acceleration power-law.

Probab., 30 (2020), pp. 2573--2612] a probabilistic solution of the NTE is considered in order to demonstrate a Perron--Frobenius type growth of the solution via its projection onto an associated leading eigenfunction. In [S. C. Harris, E. Horton, and A. E. Kyprianou, Ann. Appl. Probab., 30 (2020), pp. 2815--2845; A. M. G. Cox et al., Monte Carlo Methods for the Neutron Transport Equation, https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02864 (2020)], further analysis is performed to understand the implications of this growth both in the stochastic sense as well as from the perspective of Monte Carlo simulation. Such Monte Carlo simulations are prevalent in industrial applications, in particular where regulatory checks are needed in the process of reactor core design. In that setting, however, it turns out that a different notion of growth takes center stage, which is otherwise characterized by another eigenvalue problem. In that setting, the eigenvalue, sometimes called $k$-effective (written $k_{\texttt{eff}}$), has the physical interpretation as being the ratio of neutrons produced (during fission events) to the number lost (due to absorption in the reactor or leakage at the boundary) per typical fission event. In this article, we aim to supplement [J. Stat. Phys., 176 (2019), pp. 425--455; Ann. Appl. Probab., 30 (2020), pp. 2573--2612; Ann. Appl.

To our knowledge, despite the fact that an extensive engineering literature and industrial Monte Carlo software are concentrated around the estimation of $k_{\texttt{eff}}$ and its associated eigenfunction, we believe that our work is the first rigorous treatment in the probabilistic sense (which underpins some of the aforesaid Monte Carlo simulations).},

However, some debate remains regarding how the various characteristics of mucus (charge of the polymers themselves, binding affinity of ions with mucus) impact the rate at which small ions may diffuse through a hydrated mucus gel. Indeed, it is not even clear if small ionic species diffuse through mucus gel at an appreciably different rate than they do in aqueous solution. Here, we present a mathematical description of the transport of two ionic species (hydrogen and chloride) through a mucus layer based on the Nernst--Planck equations of electrodiffusion. The model explicitly accounts for the binding affinity of hydrogen to the mucus material as well as the Donnan potential that occurs at the interface between regions with and without mucus. Steady-state fluxes of ionic species are quantified, as are their dependencies on the chemical properties of the mucus gel and the composition of the bath solution. We outline a mechanism for generating enhanced diffusive flux of hydrogen across the gel region and hypothesize how this mechanism may be relevant to the apparently contradictory experimental data in the literature.},

In particular, it reveals the expression of the distributed shape derivative in tensor form, built on a Lagrangian-type approach and regularity results for the wave equation with discontinuous coefficients.

We consider a single cytoneme nucleating from a source cell and searching for a set of $N$ target cells $\Omega_k\subset {\mathbb R}^d$, $k=1,\ldots,N$, with $d\geq 2$. We assume that each time the cytoneme nucleates, it grows in a random direction so that the probability of being oriented toward the $k$th target is $p_k$ with $\sum_{k=1}^Np_k&lt;1$. Hence, there is a nonzero probability of failure to find a target unless there is some mechanism for returning to the nucleation site and subsequently nucleating in a new direction. We model the latter as a 1D search process with stochastic resetting, finite return times, and refractory periods. We use a renewal method to calculate the splitting probabilities and conditional mean first passage times for the cytoneme to be captured by a given target cell. We then determine the steady-state accumulation of morphogen over the set of target cells following multiple rounds of search-and-capture events and morphogen degradation. This then yields the corresponding morphogen gradient across the set of target cells whose steepness depends on the resetting rate. We illustrate the theory by considering a single layer of target cells and discuss the extension to multiple cytonemes.},

We hypothesize that this spontaneous looping can be modeled as a mechanical instability due to accumulation of residual stresses induced by the geometrical frustration of tissue remodeling, which mimics the cellular rearrangement within the heart tube. Thus, we perform a linear stability analysis of the resulting nonlinear elastic boundary value problem to determine the onset of c-looping as a function of the geometry of the tube and of the internal remodeling rate.

Additionally, that these simulations be robust and highly accurate is necessitated by many applications of great interest. High-order spectral algorithms applied to interfacial formulations can rapidly deliver high fidelity approximations with a modest number of degrees of freedom. The class of high-order perturbation of surfaces methods has proven to be particularly appropriate for these simulations, and in this contribution we consider questions of both practical implementation and rigorous analysis. For the former we generalize our recent results to utilize the uniformly well-defined impedance-impedance operators rather than the Dirichlet--Neumann operators which occasionally encounter unphysical singularities. For the latter we utilize this new formulation to establish the existence, uniqueness, and analyticity of solutions in non-resonant configurations. We also include results of numerical simulations based on an implementation of our new formulation which demonstrates its noteworthy accuracy and robustness.},

Interestingly, many factors may perturb the stability of space homogeneous streaming, leading to the spontaneous formation of collective oscillations of the agents related to stop-and-go waves, jamiton, or phantom jam in the literature. In this article, we demonstrate that even a minimal additive stochastic noise in stable first-order dynamics can initiate stop-and-go phenomena. The noise is not a classic white one but a colored noise described by a Gaussian Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process. It turns out that the joint dynamics of particles and noises forms again a (Gaussian) Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process whose characteristics can be explicitly expressed in terms of parameters of the model. We analyze its stability and characterize the presence of waves through oscillation patterns in the correlation and autocorrelation of the distance spacing between the particles. We determine exact solutions for the correlation functions for the finite system with periodic boundaries and in the continuum limit when the system size is infinite. Finally, we compare experimental trajectories of single-file pedestrian motions to simulation results.},

The theory is based on a conservation of energy technique to correct the transmission/reflection predicted by linear potential flow theory by taking into account the energy flux into the overwash and the mechanical energy dissipated by the formation of overwash. Wave energy dissipation is calculated by assuming that the transition from deep water to shallow water flow occurs over a sufficiently narrow domain such that it can be modeled as a discontinuity in the flow (akin to a hydraulic jump). Theoretical predictions are compared to CFD model data for the step problem and laboratory experimental measurements for the plate problem. Generally, excellent agreement is found for all cases tested, and the theory gives significant improvements compared to linear models that do not capture overwash effects and a theory that does not account for energy loss in the transition domain.},

We discuss a generalized Helmholtz--Kirchhoff identity that is valid in dispersive media and characterize the statistical properties of the empirical cross spectral density of the wave field. We can then introduce and analyze an original communication scheme between two passive arrays that uses only ambient noise illumination. The passive transmitter array does not transmit anything, but it is a tunable metamaterial surface that can modulate its dispersive properties and encode a message in the modulation. The passive receiver array made of two receivers that are half a wavelength apart from each other can decode the message from the empirical cross spectral density of the wave field.},

  abstract     = {A population is said to have an ideal free distribution in a spatially heterogeneous but temporally constant environment if each of its members has chosen a fixed spatial location in a way that optimizes its individual fitness, allowing for the effects of crowding. In this paper, we extend the idea of individual fitness associated with a specific location in space to account for the full path that an individual organism takes in space and time over a periodic cycle, and we extend the mathematical formulation of an ideal free distribution to general time periodic environments. We find that, as in many other cases, populations using dispersal strategies that can produce a generalized ideal free distribution have a competitive advantage relative to populations using dispersal strategies that cannot do so. A sharp criterion on the environmental functions is found to be necessary and sufficient for such ideal free distribution to be feasible. In the case the criterion is met, we show the existence of dispersal strategies that can be identified as producing a time-periodic version of an ideal free distribution, and such strategies are evolutionarily steady and are neighborhood invaders from the viewpoint of adaptive dynamics. Our results extend previous works in which the environments are either temporally constant, or temporally periodic but the total carrying capacity is temporally constant.},

Asymptotic analysis of the model is carried out by exploiting the small aspect ratio typical of pouch cell designs. The analysis reveals the scaling that results in a distinguished limit and highlights the role played by the electrical conductivities of the current collectors. The resulting model comprises a collection of one-dimensional models for the through-cell electrochemical behavior which are coupled via two-dimensional problems for the Ohmic and thermal behavior in the planar current collectors. A further limit is identified which reduces the problem to a single volume-averaged through-cell model, greatly reducing the computational complexity.

Networked organisms ranging from filamentous fungi to slime molds demonstrate a remarkable ability to mix or disperse molecules and organelles in their transport media. Here we introduce mathematical tools to analyze the structure of energy efficient transport networks that maximize mixing and sending signals originating from and arriving at each node. We define two types of entropy on flows to quantify mixing and develop numerical algorithms to optimize the combination of entropy and energy on networks, given constraints on the amount of available material. We present an in-depth exploration of optimal single source-sink networks on finite triangular grids, a fundamental setting for optimal transport networks in the plane. Using numerical simulations and rigorous proofs, we show that if the constraint on conductances is strict, the optimal networks are paths of every possible length. If the constraint is relaxed, our algorithm produces loopy networks that fan out at the source and pour back into a single path that flows to the sink. Taken together, our results expand the class of optimal transportation networks that can be compared with real biological data and highlight how real network morphologies may be shaped by trade-offs between transport efficiency and the need to mix the transported matter.},

  abstract     = {The release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes in 2016 and 2017 enabled near-elimination of the sole dengue vector Aedes albopictus on Shazai and Dadaosha islands in Guangzhou. Mathematical analysis may offer guidance in designing effective mass release strategies for the area-wide application of this Wolbachia incompatible and sterile insect technique in the future. The two most crucial concerns in designing release strategies are how often and in what amount should Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes be released in order to guarantee population suppression. Motivated by the experimental data from the Guangzhou mosquito factory and the release strategy implemented on two islands, we formulate and analyze a mosquito population suppression model considering the situation for the release period $T$ less than the sexual lifespan of Wolbachia-infected males. We define release amount thresholds $g_1^*$ and $g_2^*$ with $g_1^*&lt;g_2^*$. When the release amount $c$ satisfies $c\ge g_2^*$, population suppression is always achievable, as is mathematically manifested by the global asymptotic stability of the origin. However, when $c\in (0, g_1^*]$, we find that suppression can be achieved only if the initial wild mosquito population is small enough. This is mathematically proved by the local asymptotic stability of the origin, together with the existence of exactly two $T$-periodic solutions, one of which is asymptotically stable and the other of which is unstable, with $T$ being the waiting period between two consecutive releases. For $c\in (g_1^*, g_2^*)$, we find sufficient conditions on the nonexistence of $T$-periodic solution, and the existence of at most two $T$-periodic solutions.},

  abstract     = {The electrostatic fields and potentials associated with neutral periodic crystals are defined by sums that are not absolutely convergent. The sums depend on the order of summation. The mean-zero periodic solution ${\underline \phi}$ of Poisson&#39;s equation provides a natural potential and electric field. This sum is inconsistent with the electric field in ferroelectric materials. We introduce summation methods based on the concept of neutral charge groups, a notion common in computational chemistry. If a charge group has moments of order $&lt;\kappa$ vanishing, then the sum for $\partial^\alpha \phi$ defined by summing first by charge groups is absolutely convergent for $|\alpha|\ge 3-\kappa$. In the borderline case $|\alpha| = 2-\kappa$, consider charge groups coming from primitive unit cells. For a macroscopic shape $\Omega$, the unit-cell $R\,\Omega$ algorithm sums over unit cells in $R\,\Omega$ and then takes the limit $R\to \infty$. This yields an answer for $\partial^\alpha\phi$ that depends on $\Omega$ and the unit cell. The limits differ from $\partial^\alpha{\underline \phi}$ by a constant given as an easily approximable integral. For quadrupolar primitive unit cells, $\kappa=2$. The unit-cell $R\,\Omega$ algorithm gives a potential $\phi$ that differs from ${\underline \phi}$ by a constant. This constant enters additively in the energy content per unit volume. If one could grow or cut crystals respecting these unit cells, this shape-dependent energy effect could be verified experimentally. For dipolar primitive unit cells, $\kappa=1$. Given a shape $\Omega$ and unit cell, the algorithm yields a well-defined electric field that differs from the mean-zero periodic field by a constant vector. If one could grow or cut crystals respecting these dipolar unit cells, this shape-dependent ferroelectric effect [C. Kittel, Introduction to Solid State Physics, 8th ed., Wiley, New York, 2004] could be verified experimentally.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes, for wave propagating in a globally perturbed half-plane with a perfectly conducting step-like surface, a sharp Sommerfeld radiation condition (SRC) for the first time, an analytic formula of the far field pattern, and a high-accuracy numerical solver. We adopt the Wiener--Hopf method to compute the Green function for a cracked half-plane, a special background for the perturbed half-plane. We rigorously show that the Green function asymptotically satisfies a universal-direction SRC (uSRC) and is purely outgoing at infinity. This helps to propose an implicit transparent boundary condition for the scattered wave, produced by either a cylindrical incident wave due to a line source or a plane incident wave. Then, a well-posedness theory is established via an associated variational formulation. The theory reveals that the scattered wave, after subtracting a known wave field, satisfies the same uSRC so that its far field pattern is accessible theoretically. For a plane-wave incidence, asymptotic analysis shows that merely subtracting reflected plane waves from the scattered wave in respective regions, due to nonuniform heights of the step-like surface, is sufficient to produce an outgoing wave satisfying the uSRC. Numerically, we adopt a previously developed perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary integral equation method to solve the problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the PML truncation error decays exponentially fast as thickness or absorbing power of the PML increases. Such an exponential convergence relies heavily on the fact that the background Green function exponentially decays in the PML.},

  abstract     = {A fractional-order model for myxomatosis transmission dynamics is developed and analyzed. The presented compartmentalized model is based on the Caputo--Fabrizio fractional-order type owing to its flexibility when handling initial value problems. The model properties such as positivity and boundedness are proved using a one-parameter Mittag--Leffler function approximation. The model reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, is determined using the next-generation method assuming the integer-order case of the model and is used to determine the conditions for disease progression as well as its containment. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness of nontrivial solutions of the model are shown using the fixed point theory. In addition, we performed sensitivity analysis of model parameters as inputs with $\mathcal{R}_{0}$ as the output using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) scheme and determined the key processes that must be targeted in order to contain the infection. The significance of parameter values was based on $p$-values obtained after performing Fisher-transformation on the obtained partial rank correlation coefficients. More still, pairwise comparison of significant parameters was carried out with and without false discovery rate adjustment to ensure that significantly different processes are not falsely disqualified. Our results show that the model has a locally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium when $\mathcal{R}_0$ is less than one and a unique endemic equilibrium whenever $\mathcal{R}_{0}$ is greater than one. The sensitivity analysis process revealed that on one hand, the processes described by parameters related to contact have the greatest potential of making the epidemic worse if not curtailed. On the other hand, the processes associated with recovery of rabbits are highly vital in containing the disease when enhanced. Although the obtained median of the reproduction number is around 1, we observe that while there are combinations of parameters that can make the infection worse, there are also combinations that can be enhanced to curtail the infection. We further observed that increased memory/dependence of future values of the model on previous states predicts lower peak values of infected cases in the short-term but higher equilibrium values in the long-term. Based on our results, we recommend that infected rabbits be isolated to reduce contact with uninfected ones. Furthermore, efforts must be put in place to minimize the contact between the vectors and rabbits as well as reduce the vector population if the disease is to be contained. In the worst-case scenario, culling of infected rabbits can be applied to reduce the likelihood of transmission through contact between susceptible and infected rabbits.},

This paper addresses the problem for a group of agents that are identical and indistinguishable, oblivious, and lack the capacity of direct communication. At the beginning of unit time-intervals, the agents select random headings in the plane and then detect the presence of other agents behind them. Then they move forward only if no agents are detected in their sensing “back half-plane.” Two types of motion are considered: when no peers are detected behind them, either the agents perform unit jumps forward, or they start to move with unit speed while continuously sensing their back half-plane, and stop whenever another agent appears there. For the first type of motion extensive empirical evidence suggests that with high probability clustering occurs in finite expected time to a small region with diameter of about the size of the unit jump, while for continuous sensing and motion we can prove gathering in finite expected time if a “blind-zone” is assumed in their sensing half-plane. Relationships between the number of agents or the size of the blind-zone and convergence time are empirically studied and compared to a theoretical upper-bound dependent on these factors.},

We explore two interesting limits of the homogenized model, in which the reaction rate at the pellet surface is small, and where the mass transfer across the gas--liquid interface is small, respectively. We then couple the macroscale equations to an equation governing the external gas flow through the filter. We solve the resulting model and consider asymptotic reductions based on the filter geometry. We consider two distinguished limits and, for one of them, obtain an explicit solution for the sulphur dioxide concentration and the void fraction in the filter.

The lift-off time is a useful metric in ensuring that the snacks are properly cooked. Here we propose a multiphase mathematical model for the frying of potato snacks, where water inside the dough is evaporated from both the top and bottom surfaces of the snack at two receding evaporation fronts. The vapor created at the top of the snack bubbles away to the surface, whereas the vapor released from the bottom surface forms a buoyant blanket layer. By asymptotic analysis, we show that the model simplifies to solving a one-dimensional Stefan problem in the snack coupled to a thin-film equation in the vapor blanket through a nonlinear boundary condition. Using our mathematical model, we predict the change in the snack density as a function of time and investigate how lift-off time depends on the different parameters of the problem.},

  abstract     = {Modeling and simulation of neuronal processes has evolved from the one-dimensional (1D), symmetry-exploiting cable equation to detailed 3D models that incorporate the ultrastructural architecture of neurons. While dimension-reduced models have the clear advantage of simplicity, which makes numerical simulation an easy task, they neglect structural details which may be relevant when studying the structure-function interplay in cells. The Poisson--Nernst--Planck equations represent the other end of the modeling spectrum, a continuum mechanics model that accounts for the 3D domain as well as the spatio-temporal ion concentrations involved in biochemical signaling. In the presented work, we show that three simpler models can be derived from the Poisson--Nernst--Planck equations: the broadly used 1D cable equation, a 3D version thereof, and a 1D electro-diffusion model. We identify the assumptions and approximations that are made for the simpler models and, using numerical simulation, assess the impact of violations of these assumptions on model accuracy in scenarios ranging from individual axon fibers and bundles to dendritic spine microdomains. It is shown that the coarsest model (1D cable equation) is able to accurately resolve the electric behavior in all scenarios, as long as the cellular geometry does not diverge significantly from symmetric local cylinders. In cases where the ionic spatio-temporal dynamics are relevant, more detailed models like the 3D Poisson--Nernst--Planck equations need to be employed. We conclude with guidelines as to which level of modeling detail is necessary to capture the underlying neurobiological features accurately.},

The source is assumed to be driven by a fractional Gaussian field whose covariance is represented by a classical pseudodifferential operator. The work contains three contributions. First, the connection is established between fractional Gaussian fields and rough sources characterized by their principal symbols. Second, the direct source scattering problem is shown to be well-posed in the distribution sense. Third, we demonstrate that the micro-correlation strength of the random source can be uniquely determined by the passive measurements of the wave field in a set which is disjoint with the support of the strength function. The analysis relies on careful studies on the Green function and Fourier integrals for the Helmholtz equation.},

The results obtained support a more in-depth theoretical understanding of the eco-evolutionary process which underpins the emergence of phenotypic heterogeneity in vascularized tumors.

Next, we study the evolution problem and show that if the directed movement effect is small, the solutions behave like those of the classical reaction-diffusion equation with bistable growth pattern. We present numerical simulations, which show that directed movement can help overcome a strong Allee effect and provide some partial analytical results in this direction.

  abstract     = {Localized spot patterns, where one or more solution components concentrate at certain points in the domain, are a common class of localized pattern for reaction-diffusion systems, and they arise in a wide range of modeling scenarios. Although there is a rather well-developed theoretical understanding for this class of localized pattern in one and two space dimensions, a theoretical study of such patterns in a three-dimensional setting is, largely, a new frontier. In an arbitrary bounded three-dimensional domain, the existence, linear stability, and slow dynamics of localized multispot patterns are analyzed for the well-known singularly perturbed Gierer--Meinhardt activator-inhibitor system in the limit of a small activator diffusivity $\varepsilon^2\ll 1$. Our main focus is to classify the different types of multispot patterns and predict their linear stability properties for different asymptotic ranges of the inhibitor diffusivity $D$. For the range $D={\mathcal O}(\varepsilon^{-1})\gg 1$, although both symmetric and asymmetric quasi-equilibrium spot patterns can be constructed, the asymmetric patterns are shown to be always unstable. On this range of $D$, it is shown that symmetric spot patterns can undergo either competition instabilities or a Hopf bifurcation, leading to spot annihilation or temporal spot amplitude oscillations, respectively. For $D={\mathcal O}(1)$, only symmetric spot quasi-equilibria exist and they are linearly stable on ${\mathcal O}(1)$ time intervals. On this range, it is shown that the spot locations evolve slowly on an ${\mathcal O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ time scale toward their equilibrium locations according to an ODE gradient flow, which is determined by a discrete energy involving the reduced-wave Green&#39;s function. The central role of the far-field behavior of a certain core problem, which characterizes the profile of a localized spot, for the construction of quasi-equilibria in the $D={\mathcal O}(1)$ and $D={\mathcal O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ regimes, and in establishing some of their linear stability properties, is emphasized. Finally, for the range $D={\mathcal O}(\varepsilon^{2})$, it is shown that spot quasi-equilibria can undergo a peanut-splitting instability, which leads to a cascade of spot self-replication events. Predictions of the linear stability theory are all illustrated with full PDE numerical simulations of the Gierer--Meinhardt model.},

In particular, the similarity measure chosen to compare observations and simulation of tumor contour is presented. A specific joint state-parameter correction with a Luenberger observer correcting the state and a reduced-order Kalman filter correcting the parameters is introduced and studied. We then illustrate and assess our proposed observer method with synthetic problems. Our numerical trials show that state estimation is very effective with the proposed Luenberger observer, but specific strategies are needed to accurately perform parameter estimation in a clinical context. We then propose strategies to deal with the fact that data is very sparse in time and that the initial distribution of the proliferation rate is unknown. The results on synthetic data are very promising, and work is ongoing to apply our strategy on clinical cases.},

  abstract     = {Systems involving nematic liquid crystals subjected to magnetic fields or electric fields are modeled using the Oseen--Frank macroscopic continuum theory, and general criteria are developed to assess the local stability of equilibrium solutions. The criteria take into account the inhomogeneity of the electric field and the mutual influence of the electric field and the liquid-crystal director field on each other. The criteria show that formulas for the instability thresholds of electric-field Fréedericksz transitions cannot in all cases be obtained from those for the analogous magnetic-field transitions by simply replacing the magnetic parameters by the corresponding electric parameters, contrary to claims in standard references. A simple analytical test is provided to determine when an electric-field-induced instability can differ qualitatively from the analogous magnetic-field-induced instability. For the systems we study, it is found that taking into account the full coupling between the electric field and the director field can either elevate or leave unchanged an instability threshold (never lower it), compared to the threshold predicted by the magnetic-field analogy. The physical mechanism that underlies the effect of elevating an instability threshold is the increase in free energy associated with a first-order change in the ground-state electric field caused by a perturbation of the ground-state director field. Examples are given that involve classical Fréedericksz transitions and also periodic instabilities. The inclusion of flexoelectric terms in the theory is studied, and it is found that these terms are not capable of altering the instability thresholds of any of the classical Fréedericksz transitions.},

In particular, for special depth profiles reflected waves did not appear and ray theory became exact. Herein, geometrical optics is employed to obtain asymptotic series for waves of general shapes in nonuniform narrow channels, within the framework of linear shallow water theory. While being kept simple, the series incorporate higher order contributions that may describe the evolution of waves with high accuracy. The higher orders also contain a secondary wave system. For selected classes of geometries and wave shapes explicit solutions are calculated and compared to numerical solutions. Apart from the vicinity of shorelines, say, higher order expansions generally may provide very accurate approximations to the full solutions. The asymptotic series are analyzed for different wave shapes and are found to be convergent for cases where the basic wave profiles have compact support (finite length). A number of new, closed form, exact solutions are also found. The asymptotic expansion is put into a context by employing it for the transmission of waves from a uniform channel section into a nonuniform one.

As is well known, the unique solvability of these problems is not always guaranteed. To obtain a unique solution that is “physically meaningful,” the limiting absorption principle (LAP) is a commonly used method. LAP assumes that the limit of a family of solutions with absorbing media converges as the absorption parameter tends to 0 and that the limit is the “physically meaningful solution.” It is also called the LAP solution in this paper. It has been proved that the LAP holds for periodic waveguides in [V. Hoang, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 71 (2011), pp. 791--810]. In this paper, we consider the spectrum decomposition of periodic translation operators. With the curve integral formulation and a generalized residue theorem, the operator is explicitly described by its eigenvalues and generalized eigenfunctions, which are closely related to Bloch wave solutions. Then the LAP solution is decomposed into generalized eigenfunctions. This gives a better understanding of the structure of scattered fields.},

However, in trying to determine the second term, so as to extend the range of validity of the solution, it is found that a phenomenon akin to switchbacking occurs, with the asymptotic details being strongly dependent on the reaction order; this appears to be a consequence of the spatial algebraic decay of the leading-order solution far from the electrode. Comparison of asymptotic results with numerical solutions obtained using finite element methods indicates a relation involving the homogeoneous reaction order for which the two-term asymptotic approximation would work best for all time. Links to problems that involve algebraically decaying boundary layers are briefly discussed.},

The control variable, the spatial velocity, is first introduced for the classical disease models, such as the SIR model. For this proposed model, we provide fast numerical algorithms based on proximal primal-dual methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model illustrates how to separate infected patients in a spatial domain effectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper details a new macroscopic traffic flow model accounting for the boundedness of traffic acceleration, which is required for physical realism. Our approach relies on the coupling between a scalar conservation law, which refers to the seminal Lighthill--Whitham--Richards model, and a system of ordinary differential equations describing the trajectories of accelerating vehicles, which we treat as moving constraints. We propose a wave-front tracking algorithm to construct approximate solutions. We use this algorithm to prove the existence of entropy weak solutions to the associated Cauchy problem and provide some numerical simulations illustrating the solution behaviour.},

  abstract     = {Following several recent works devoted to the analysis of spatial heterogeneity in reaction-diffusion equations, we investigate the problem of optimizing the total population size for logistic diffusive models with respect to resources distributions. Using the spatially heterogeneous Fisher-KPP equation, we obtain a surprising fragmentation phenomenon: depending on the scale of diffusivity (i.e., the dispersal rate), it is better to either concentrate or fragment resources. Our main result is that, the smaller the dispersal rate of the species in the domain, the more optimal resources distributions tend to oscillate. This is in sharp contrast with other criteria in population dynamics, such as the classical problem of optimizing the survival ability of a species, where concentrating resources is always favorable, regardless of the diffusivity. Our study is completed by numerous numerical simulations that confirm our results.},

  abstract     = {In many industrial applications oil drops suspended in water are broken down by turbulent fluid motion, assisted by the addition of surfactants. In this paper, we develop a model for the interaction between droplet breakup and surfactant behavior in a homogeneous turbulent flow. We derive equations for the evolution of droplet size distribution, surfactant concentration, and surface tension. Our resulting model is analyzed using both asymptotic and numerical methods. We find that the large-time behavior is highly dependent on the history of the drop-surfactant interaction, and we identify distinct phases in the breakup dynamics. The model is then used to investigate how increasing the concentration of surfactant promotes enhanced droplet breakup and thus increases the proportion of smaller droplets. We also explore varying the method of surfactant addition and find that there may be advantages to adding the surfactant gradually rather than all at once. These results can be used to optimize surfactant application in industrial processes.},

It is specified as a virus density distribution with respect to genotype and time governed by a reaction-diffusion integro-differential equation taking virus mutations, replication, and elimination by immune cells and medical treatment into account. Conditions for the existence of virus strains that correspond to localized density distributions in the space of genotypes are determined. It is shown that common viral evolutionary traits like diversification and extinction are driven by nonlocal interactions via immune responses, target-cell competition, and therapy. This provides us with a mechanistic explanation for clinically relevant properties like immune escape and drug resistance selection, and allows us to link virus genotypes to phenotypes.},

  abstract     = {The first time a searcher finds a target is called a first passage time (FPT). In many physical, chemical, and biological processes, the searcher is “mortal,” which means that the searcher might become inactivated (degrade, die, etc.) before finding the target. In the context of intracellular signaling, an important recent work discovered that fast inactivation can drastically alter the conditional FPT distribution of a mortal diffusive searcher, if the searcher is conditioned to find the target before inactivation. In this paper, we prove a general theorem that yields an explicit formula for all the moments of such conditional FPTs in the fast inactivation limit. This formula is quite universal, as it holds under very general conditions on the diffusive searcher dynamics, the target, and the spatial domain. These results prove in significant generality that if inactivation is fast, then the conditional FPT compared to the FPT without inactivation is (i) much faster, (ii) much less affected by spatial heterogeneity, and (iii) much less variable. Our results agree with recent computational and theoretical analysis of a certain discrete intracellular diffusion model and confirm a conjecture related to the effect of spatial heterogeneity on intracellular signaling.},
