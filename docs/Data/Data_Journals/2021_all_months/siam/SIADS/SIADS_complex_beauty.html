These higher order degeneracies occur in applications, with spatial Coulomb friction being the prominent example. In this work, we consider PWS systems with isolated codimension-2 discontinuity sets using regularization and blowup to study the dynamics. We present a general framework and give specific results for the local dynamics in a class of problems, and generalizing Filippov sliding, crossing, and sliding vector fields.},

  abstract     = {Neuronal networks vary dramatically in size, connectivity structure, and functionality across downstream layers of the brain. This raises the question of whether information is lost as it is re-encoded along compressive and expansive pathways. In this work, we develop a potential data-driven mechanism for the preservation of information in the activity of neuronal networks across downstream layers, which uses the widespread linearity of individual neuronal responses to sufficiently strong ramped artificial inputs to fit a linear input-output mapping across the network. We analyze the dynamics of several families of two-layer neuronal network models, where the input components far outnumber the downstream neurons, as in compressive pathways, and apply the fitted mapping in conjunction with compressive sensing theory to reconstruct stimuli with sparse structure. The input-output mapping facilitates stimulus reconstructions that only use measurements of downstream neuronal firing rates in response to inputs over a short time duration, furnishing stimulus recovery even when theoretical analysis is intractable or the governing equations of the dynamical system are unknown as in experiment. Similarly accurate stimulus reconstructions are obtained across different single-neuron models, network coupling functions, and image classes. Improved reconstructions are yielded when uniformly random feedforward connectivity is replaced by spatially localized feedforward connectivity akin to receptive fields. We expect that similar principles could be leveraged experimentally in prosthetics as well as in the reconstruction of large-scale network connectivity.},

In this framework, the Mori--Zwanzig formalism, developed in statistical mechanics to tackle the hard problem of construction of reduced-order dynamics for high-dimensional dynamical systems, can be considered as a natural generalization of the Koopman description of the dynamical system. We next show that, similar to the approximate Koopman learning methods, data-driven methods can be developed for the Mori--Zwanzig formalism with Mori&#39;s linear projection operator. We have developed two algorithms to extract the key operators, the Markov and the memory kernel, using time series of a reduced set of observables in a dynamical system. We have adopted the Lorenz `96 system as a test problem and solved for the above operators. These operators exhibit complex behaviors, which are unlikely to be captured by traditional modeling approaches in Mori--Zwanzig analysis. The nontrivial generalized fluctuation-dissipation relationship, which relates the memory kernel with the two-time correlation statistics of the orthogonal dynamics, was numerically verified as a validation of the solved operators. We present numerical evidence that the generalized Langevin equation, a key construct in the Mori--Zwanzig formalism, is more advantageous in predicting the evolution of the reduced set of observables than the conventional approximate Koopman operators.},

Empirical studies of networks have identified feedback loops, feedforward loops, and several other small structures as “motifs” that occur frequently in real-world networks and may contribute by various mechanisms to important functions in these systems. However, these mechanisms are unknown for many of these motifs. We propose to distinguish between “structure motifs” (i.e., weakly connected graphlets) in networks and “process motifs” (which we define as structured sets of walks) on networks and consider process motifs as building blocks of processes on networks. Using steady-state covariance and steady-state correlation in a multivariate Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process on a network as examples, we demonstrate that distinguishing between structure motifs and process motifs makes it possible to gain quantitative insights into mechanisms that contribute to important functions of dynamical systems on networks.},

This work extends the classic Budyko- and Sellers-type conceptual energy balance models of temperature-albedo feedback by removing the standard assumption of planetary symmetry about the equator. The dynamics of distinct Northern and Southern Hemisphere ice caps are coupled through an equation representing the annual global mean surface temperature. The system has a discontinuous switching mechanism based on mass balance principles for the Northern Hemisphere ice sheet. We show that the associated Filippov system admits a unique nonsmooth and attracting limit cycle that represents the cycling between glacial and interglacial states. Due to the vastly different timescales involved, the model presents a nonsmooth geometric perturbation problem, for which we use ad hoc mathematical techniques to produce the periodic orbit. We find that climatic changes in the Northern Hemisphere drive synchronous in-phase changes in the Southern Hemisphere due to the coupling provided by the annual global mean surface temperature. This behavior is observed for the Earth on orbital timescales.},

  abstract     = {The estimation of the kinetic parameters that regulate the speed of enzyme catalyzed reactions requires the careful design of experiments under a constrained set of conditions. Many estimates reported in the literature incorporate protocols that leverage simplified mathematical models of the reaction&#39;s time course known as quasi-steady-state (QSS) reductions. Such reductions often---but not always---emerge as the result of a singular perturbation scenario. However, the utilization of the singular perturbation reduction method requires knowledge of a dimensionless parameter, “$\varepsilon$,” that is proportional to the ratio of the reaction&#39;s fast and slow timescales. To date, no such ratio has been determined for the intermolecular autocatalytic zymogen activation reaction, which means it remains open as to when the experimental protocols described in the literature are even capable of generating accurate estimates of pertinent kinetic parameters. Using techniques from differential equations, Fenichel theory, and center manifold theory, we derive the appropriate “$\varepsilon$” whose magnitude regulates the validity of the QSS reduction employed in the reported experimental procedures. Although the model equations are two-dimensional, the fast/slow dynamics are rich. The phase plane exhibits a dynamic transcritical bifurcation point in a particular singular limit. The existence of such a bifurcation is relevant because the critical manifold loses normal hyperbolicity and classical Fenichel theory is inapplicable. We show that while there exists a faux Canard that passes directly through this bifurcation point, trajectories emanating from experimental initial conditions are actually bounded away from the bifurcation point by an asymptotic distance that is proportional to the square root of the linearized system&#39;s eigenvalue ratio. Furthermore, we show that in some cases chemical reversibility can be interpreted dynamically as an imperfection since the presence of reversibility can destroy the bifurcation structure present in the singular limit. By extension, some of these features are also present in the phase-plane dynamics of the famous Michaelis--Menten reaction mechanism. Finally, we show that the reduction method by which QSS reductions are justified can depend on the path taken in parameter space. Specifically, we show that the standard QSS reduction for this reaction is justifiable by center manifold theory in one limit, and via Fenichel theory in a different limit.},

These two systems are woodpile chains (which we model as systems of Hertzian particles and springs) and diatomic Hertzian chains with alternating masses. We demonstrate that nanoptera arise from the Stokes phenomenon and appear as special curves (called Stokes curves) are crossed in the complex plane. We use techniques from exponential asymptotics to obtain approximations of the oscillation amplitudes. Our analysis demonstrates that traveling-wave solutions in a singularly perturbed woodpile chain have a single Stokes curve, which generates oscillations behind the wave front. Comparing these asymptotic predictions with numerical simulations reveals that our asymptotic approximation accurately describes the nondecaying oscillatory behavior in a woodpile chain. We perform a similar analysis of a diatomic Hertzian chain, and we show that each nanopteron solution has two distinct exponentially small oscillatory contributions. We demonstrate that there exists a set of mass ratios for which these two contributions cancel to produce localized solitary waves. This result builds on prior experimental and numerical observations that there exist mass ratios that support localized solitary waves in diatomic Hertzian chains without precompression. Comparing our asymptotic and numerical results for a diatomic Hertzian chain with precompression reveals that our exponential asymptotic approach accurately predicts the oscillation amplitude for a wide range of system parameters, but it fails to identify several values of the mass ratio that correspond to localized solitary-wave solutions.},

In more detail, contributions show how rational function interpolation is a pivotal tool (i) to construct (frequency-limited) reduced-order dynamical models appropriate for model-based control design and (ii) to accurately discretize controllers in view of onboard computer-limited implementation. These contributions are illustrated along the paper through the design of an active feedback gust load alleviation function, applied on an industrial generic business jet aircraft use case. The closed-loop validation and performance evaluation are assessed through the use of a dedicated industrial simulator and considering certification objectives. Although application is centered on aircraft applications, the method is not restrictive and can be applied to any linear dynamical system.},

We do so in the limit where the ratio of the natural spring frequency and the forcing frequency is on the same order of magnitude as the scale associated with the regularized stiction model. The motivation for studying this special parameter regime (which can be interpreted as a rigid body limit) comes from [E. Bossolini, M. Brøns, and K. U. Kristiansen, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 16, (2017), pp. 2233--2258] which demonstrated new friction phenomena in this regime. The results of this paper led to some open problems; see also [E. Bossolini, M. Brøns, and K. U. Kristiansen, SIAM Rev., 62 (2020), pp. 869--897], that we resolve in this paper. In particular, using GSPT and blowup [C. K. R. T.

In a first step, we reduce the system&#39;s behavior to the dynamics on its center manifold. We thereby still capture the major qualitative behavior of the RODEs. In a second step, we analyze the reduced RODEs and quantify the probability of the occurrence of different types of bifurcations based on the (nonlinear) functional appearance of uncertain parameters. To realize this major step, we present three approaches: an analytical one, where the probability can be calculated explicitly based on Mellin transformation and inversion, a semianalytical one consisting of a combination of the analytical approach with a moment-based numerical estimation procedure, and a particular sampling-based approach using unscented transformation. We complement our new methodology with various numerical examples. (A corrected version is attached.)},

  abstract     = {For signals driven by multiple separate and decoupled dynamical systems, traditional methods in signal analysis often fail to decompose the signal into the parts driven by the different dynamics. Two signals from different dynamical systems may have similar energy at every frequency, so techniques such as the Fourier transform will be unable to separate a time series if it contains multiple such signals. This is especially true when the dynamical system is chaotic, as the produced signals are inherently broadband. We present how an algorithm called shadow manifold interpolation (SMI), inspired by recent advances in applied dynamical systems theory, can succeed in this task. SMI takes two causally related signals and reconstructs one from the other, producing a reconstruction that only captures the shared dynamics between the two signals, i.e., the portion of the signals driven by some underlying dynamical systems that contribute to both signals. From this we produce a decomposition of the signal into different signals representing separate dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SMI at decomposing signals in a variety of test cases. We consider three ways in which two signals may be causally related. Through testing the algorithm on simulated composite dynamical systems, we demonstrate that SMI succeeds in separating out the constituent systems in two schemes, failing only when the two signals share multiple decoupled dynamics. The main limitation of this algorithm is that a second causally related reference signal is needed in order to decompose a given signal. This reference signal must share at least one dynamic of interest with the given signal.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with the dynamics of magnetic domain walls (DWs) in nanowires as solutions to the classical Landau--Lifschitz--Gilbert equation augmented by a typically nonvariational Slonczewski term for spin-torque effects. Taking applied field and spin-polarization as the primary parameters, we study dynamic stability as well as selection mechanisms analytically and numerically in an axially symmetric setting. Concerning the stability of the DWs&#39; asymptotic states, we distinguish the bistable (both stable) and the monostable (one unstable, one stable) parameter regime. In the bistable regime, we extend known stability results of an explicit family of precessing solutions and identify a relation of applied field and spin-polarization for standing DWs. We verify that this family is convectively unstable into the monostable regime, thus forming so-called pushed fronts, before turning absolutely unstable. In the monostable regime, we present explicit formulas for the so-called absolute spectrum of more general matrix operators. This allows us to relate translation and rotation symmetries to the position of the singularities of the pointwise Green&#39;s function. Thereby, we determine the linear selection mechanism for the asymptotic velocity and frequency of DWs and corroborate these by long-time numerical simulations. All these results include the axially symmetric Landau--Lifschitz--Gilbert equation.},

The observer only has access to information sent through a digital communication channel with a finite capacity. The recently introduced notion of restoration entropy provides a way to determine the smallest channel capacity above which an observer can be designed that observes the system without a degradation of the initial observation quality. In this paper, we propose a subgradient algorithm to estimate the restoration entropy via the computation of an appropriate Riemannian metric on the state space, which allows us to determine the approximate value of the entropy from the time-one map (in the discrete-time case) or the generating vector field (for ODE systems), respectively.},

At fixed (unit) time intervals agents repeatedly reconsider and change their opinions if and only if they find themselves at the extremes of the range of ideological positions held by members of the society. Extremist agents are erratic: they either become more radical, and move away from the positions of other agents, with probability $\varepsilon$, or more moderate, and move towards the positions held by their peers, with probability $(1 - \varepsilon)$. The change in the opinion of the extremists is one unit on the real line. We prove that the agent positions cluster in time, with all nonextremist agents located within a unit interval. However, the consensus opinion is dynamic. Due to the extremists&#39; erratic behavior the clustered opinion set performs a sluggish random walk on the entire range of possible ideological positions (the real line). The inertia of the group, the reluctance of the society&#39;s agents to change their consensus opinion, increases with the size of the group. The extremists perform biased random walk excursions to the right and left, and, in time, their actions succeed to move the society of agents in random directions. The far left agent effectively pushes the group consensus toward the right, while the far right agent counterbalances the push and causes the consensus to move toward the left.},

  abstract     = {In this work we characterize the set of persistent species in dynamical systems related to chemical reaction networks. Chemical reaction networks consist of a set of species and a set of reaction rules describing the interactions between the species. From a reaction network, by differentiation with respect to time and space, a reaction-diffusion system (RDS) can be derived describing the dynamics of the concentrations of the species. We show how double integration with respect to time and space of the solutions of the RDS conversely leads back to the reaction network and reveals all the possibly persistent subsets of species. We show that organizations as defined in chemical organization theory (COT) are strongly related to the persistent subsets of species. Organizations are subsets of species that have two properties. First, they are closed, that is, there is no reaction running on them that produces new species which are not contained in the organizations. Second, organizations are self-maintaining. By additionally allowing for the distribution of species, we generalize organizations towards distributed organizations (DOs). After introducing our concept of persistence as the first main result of this study, we prove that for a given reaction network the set of DOs is always a lattice. The second main result is that the set of persistent species of a solution of an RDS is always a DO. By linking these two results we achieve a connection between persistence concerning a single solution of an RDS and persistence with regard to all solutions of all RDSs having one and the same underlying reaction network. We show how this strongly benefits reaction network analysis. By presenting simulation results performed with MATLAB, we illustrate the discussed phenomena.},

A semigroup of composition operators defined for nonlinear autonomous dynamical systems---the Koopman semigroup and its associated Koopman generator---plays a central role in this study. We introduce the resolvent of the Koopman generator, which we call the Koopman resolvent, and provide its spectral characterization for three types of nonlinear dynamics: ergodic evolution on an attractor, convergence to a stable equilibrium point, and convergence to a (quasi-)stable limit cycle. This shows that the Koopman resolvent provides the Laplace-domain representation of such nonlinear autonomous dynamics. A computational aspect of the Laplace-domain representation is also discussed with emphasis on nonstationary Koopman modes.},

  abstract     = {Oscillators have two main limitations: their synchronization properties are limited (i.e., they have a finite synchronization region) and they have no memory of past interactions (i.e., they return to their intrinsic frequency whenever the entraining signal disappears). We previously proposed a general mechanism to transform an oscillator into an adaptive frequency oscillator which adapts its parameters to learn the frequency of any input signal. The synchronization region then becomes infinite and the oscillator retains the entrainment frequency when the driving signal disappears. While this mechanism has been successfully used in various applications, such as robot control or observer design for active prosthesis, a formal understanding of its properties is still missing. In this paper, we study the adaptation mechanism in the case of strongly coupled phase oscillators and show that nontrivial slow-fast dynamics is at the origin of the adaptation. We show the existence of a layered structure of stable and unstable invariant slow manifolds and demonstrate how the input signal forces the dynamics to jump between these manifolds at regular intervals, leading to exponential convergence of the frequency adaptation. We extend the idea to a network of oscillators with amplitude adaptation and show that the slow invariant manifolds structure persists. Numerical simulations validate our analysis and extend the discussion to more complex cases.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a system of partial differential equations that govern the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban crime with law enforcement. The deployment of law enforcement is called on-hotspot policing if the dispatched police approach the crime hotspot gradient with the same intensity as the criminal agents, and it is called off-hotspot policing otherwise. We reveal several parameter regimes governed by the policing intensity that promote the emergence of crime hotspots. The existence and stability of these regular patterns, which can be either time-stationary or time-periodic, are proved using bifurcation theories. The results give a wavemode selection mechanism for these spatially heterogeneous solutions and suggest that hotspot policing can stabilize crime aggregates or drive them from one location to another. We also prove that this PDE system admits a unique and global-in-time solution, and the solution is uniformly bounded. However, this system can be ill-posed for both on- and off-hotspot policing as the solution dynamics do not always change continuously with respect to the initial data. Moreover, phase transitions between closed loops of solution trajectories occur for a wide range of system parameters, and this reveals another dimension of complexity of the system. Concerning the antihotspot policing strategy (i.e., law enforcement actively deployed away from hotspots in space), we show that this likely counterintuitive strategy tends to stabilize static hotspots and annihilate time-periodic aggregates. These results point to a difficulty of using this system for something like predicting crime and determining the effectiveness of hotspot policing, due to the parameter sensitivity, and they call for further advancement in the mathematical modeling and analysis of urban criminal activities with hotspot policing.},

Moreover, the model supports oscillating-in-time spatial patterns, thus giving a theoretical explanation of the periodic appearance of inflammatory eruptions typical of recurrent erythema multiforme. A detailed numerical bifurcation analysis indicates that the inclusion of the logistic growth term is crucial for the occurrence of a sequence of bifurcations leading to spatio-temporal chaos.

Unfortunately, most phase reduction frameworks place restrictive constraints on the magnitude of allowable inputs, limiting the practical utility of the resulting phase reduced models in many situations. In this work, motivated by the search for control strategies to hasten recovery from jet-lag caused by rapid travel through multiple time zones, the efficacy of the recently developed adaptive phase-amplitude reduction is considered for manipulating oscillation timing in the presence of a large magnitude entraining stimulus. The adaptive phase-amplitude reduced equations allow for a numerically tractable optimal control formulation, and the associated optimal stimuli significantly outperform those resulting from previously proposed optimal control formulations. Additionally, a data-driven technique to identify the necessary terms of the adaptive phase-amplitude reduction is proposed and validated using a model describing the aggregate oscillations of a large population of coupled limit cycle oscillators. Such data-driven model reduction algorithms are essential in situations where the underlying model equations are either unreliable or unavailable.},

  abstract     = {We use the theory of Koopman (or composition) operators to study the dynamical system on $\mathbb{N}^*$ emerging from the well-known $3x+1$ (or Collatz) problem. The advantage of this approach is that the conjecture can be described via bounded linear operators. We study the properties of these operators and their connection with the problem and the trajectories of the dynamical system. Furthermore, in order to investigate the trajectories, we utilize Fourier transform techniques to reveal the frequency content of the sequences of signs emerging from these trajectories. This method also enables us to define an isometry on a Hilbert space. Finally, the $C^*$-algebra generated by this isometry is used in order to study how the sequences of signs correlate with each other.},

  abstract     = {Multiplex networks are networks composed of multiple layers such that the number of nodes in all layers is the same and the adjacency matrices between the layers are diagonal. We consider the special class of multiplex networks where the adjacency matrices for each layer are simultaneously triagonalizable. For such networks, we derive the relation between the spectrum of the multiplex network and the eigenvalues of the individual layers. As an application, we propose a generalized master stability approach that allows for a simplified, low-dimensional description of the stability of synchronized solutions in multiplex networks. We illustrate our result with a duplex network of FitzHugh--Nagumo oscillators. In particular, we show how interlayer interaction can lead to stabilization or destabilization of the synchronous state. Finally, we give explicit conditions for the stability of synchronous solutions in duplex networks of linear diffusive systems.},

  abstract     = {Path integration is a navigational strategy through which an animal remains oriented even in the absence of stable landmarks. Bump attractor networks have played a key role in modeling and analyzing the neural processes involved in path integration. In such networks, self-motion inputs and asymmetries in the network translate an activity bump over the attractor manifold, updating the animal&#39;s perceived position in space. The self-motion inputs can be incorporated through a multiplicative model, in which neuronal inputs are combined multiplicatively, or an additive model, in which neuronal inputs are combined through summation. Multiplicative models have a simple traveling wave solution and are often used to analyze properties of these networks. Relatively little mathematical analysis has been done on additive models, which are generally considered to be more biologically realistic. We analyze a general additive bump attractor model of path integration, deriving explicit mathematical expressions describing the temporal and spatial dynamics of the activity bump. We find that intrinsic spatial deformations of the activity bump lead to small, positive path integration errors that are approximately proportional to the animal&#39;s velocity. This error is minimized through a balance of acceleration and velocity input. We also derive simple expressions for the path integration gain, showing explicitly how it depends on the model parameters. Our analytical results are supported by numerical simulations of four specific, representative models. Our results have biological implications and provide a mathematical foundation for understanding a large class of path integration models.},

USA, 104 (2007), pp. 8490--8495], show that annular rings with a background flicker can induce visual hallucinations in humans that take the form of radial fan shapes. The well-known retino-cortical map tells us that the corresponding patterns of neural activity in the primary visual cortex for rings and arms in the retina are orthogonal stripe patterns. The implication is that cortical forcing by spatially periodic input can excite orthogonal modes of neural activity. Here we show that a simple scalar neural field model of primary visual cortex with state-dependent spatial forcing is capable of modeling this phenomenon. Moreover, we show that this occurs most robustly when the spatial forcing has a 2:1 resonance with modes that would otherwise be excited by a Turing instability. By utilizing a weakly nonlinear multiple-scales analysis we determine the relevant amplitude equations for uncovering the parameter regimes which favor the excitation of patterns orthogonal to sensory drive. In combination with direct numerical simulations we use this approach to shed further light on the original psychophysical observations of Billock and Tsou.},

This framework provides a method for determining the influence of channel surface microstructure on the value of diffusivity that is particularly effective when the microstructure exhibits relatively low roughness. This method is based on the observation that the Markov transition (scattering) operator determined by the microstructure, under the condition of weak surface scattering, has a universal form given, up to a multiplicative constant, by the classical Legendre differential operator. We also show how characteristic numbers of the system---namely, geometric parameters of the microstructure, the spectral gap of a Markov operator, and the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient of a commonly used model of surface scattering---are all related. Examples of microstructures are investigated to illustrate the relation of these quantities numerically and analytically.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and exploiting the syntrophic relationship between microbial species is a major challenge in the mathematical theory of the anaerobic digestion process. In this work, we focus on the acetogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis phases and include distinct removal rates for the species. Our study gives a quite comprehensive analysis of a syntrophic model by analyzing the joined effects of syntrophy relationship, mortality, substrate inhibition, and input concentrations that were neglected in previous studies. The mathematical analysis of the model involving mortality is a difficult problem since the model is not reduced to a planar system as in the case where the dilution rates of the substrates and the removal rates of microbial species are equal. Using general nonmonotonic growth rates, the necessary and sufficient conditions of existence and local stability of all steady states of the four-dimensional system are determined, according to the operating parameters. This general model exhibits a rich behavior with the coexistence of two microbial species, the bistability, the multiplicity of coexistence steady states, and the existence of two steady states of extinction of the first species. The operating diagram shows how the model behaves by varying the control parameters and illustrates the effect of the substrate inhibition and the new input substrate concentration (hydrogen) on the appearance or the disappearance of coexistence and bistability regions. Similarly to the classical chemostat model, including the substrate inhibition can destabilize a two-tiered microbial “food chain,” where the asymptotic behavior of the system depends on the initial condition.},

  abstract     = {The understanding of how spatio-temporal patterns of neural activity may arise in the cortex of the brain has advanced with the development and analysis of neural field models. Replicating this success for subcortical tissues, such as the thalamus, requires an extension to include relevant ionic currents that can further shape firing response. Here we advocate for one such approach that can accommodate slow currents. By way of illustration we focus on incorporating a T-type calcium current into the standard neural field framework. Direct numerical simulations are used to show that the resulting tissue model has many of the properties seen in more biophysically detailed model studies and, most important, the generation of oscillations, waves, and patterns that arise from rebound firing. To explore the emergence of such solutions we focus on one- and two-dimensional spatial models and show that exact solutions describing homogeneous oscillations can be constructed in the limit that the firing rate nonlinearity is a Heaviside function. A linear stability analysis, using techniques from nonsmooth dynamical systems, is used to determine the points at which bifurcations from synchrony can occur. Furthermore, we construct periodic traveling waves and investigate their stability with the use of an appropriate Evans function. The stable branches of the dispersion curve for periodic traveling waves are found to be in excellent agreement with simulations initiated from an unstable branch of the synchronous solution.},

  abstract     = {We present algorithms and their implementation to compute limit cycles and their isochrons for state-dependent delay differential equations (SDDEs) which are perturbed from a planar ordinary differential equation (ODE) with a limit cycle. Note that the space of solutions of an SDDE is infinite dimensional. We compute a two parameter family of solutions of the SDDE which converges to the solutions of the ODE as the perturbation goes to zero in a neighborhood of the limit cycle. The method we use formulates functional equations among periodic functions (or functions converging exponentially to periodic). The functional equations express that the functions solve the SDDE. Therefore, rather than evolving initial data and finding solutions of a certain shape, we consider spaces of functions with the desired shape and require that they are solutions. The mathematical theory of these invariance equations is developed in a companion paper [J. Yang, J. Gimeno, and R. de la Llave, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 53 (2021), pp. 4031--4067], which provides proofs of a posteriori theorems. They show that if there is a sufficiently approximate solution (with respect to some explicit condition numbers), then there is a true solution close to the approximate one. Since the numerical methods produce an approximate solution, and provide estimates of the condition numbers, we can make sure that the numerical solutions we consider approximate true solutions. In this paper, we choose a systematic way to approximate functions by a finite set of numbers (Taylor--Fourier series) and develop a toolkit of algorithms that implement the operators---notably composition---that enter into the theory. We also present several results obtained by running the implementations in some representative cases.},

These coupling functions can be used to understand the behavior of potentially high-dimensional, nonlinear oscillators in terms of their phase differences. The proposed formulation accurately replicates nonlinear bifurcations that emerge as the coupling strength increases and is valid in regimes well beyond those that can be considered using classic weak coupling assumptions. We demonstrate the performance of our approach through two examples. First, we use the diffusively coupled complex Ginzburg--Landau (CGL) model and demonstrate that our theory accurately predicts bifurcations far beyond the range of existing coupling theory. Second, we use a realistic conductance-based model of a thalamic neuron and show that our theory correctly predicts asymptotic phase differences for nonweak synaptic coupling. In both examples, our theory accurately captures model behaviors that weak coupling theories can not.},

Weighted networks are ubiquitous in real-world applications. We consider a dynamical systems perspective by associating with each network a set of continuous dynamical systems, the ones that respect the graph structure of the network. For weighted networks it is natural for the admissible coupled cell systems to have an additive input structure. We present a characterization of the synchrony subspaces and the antisynchrony subspaces for a weighted network depending on the restrictions that are imposed in their admissible input-additive coupled cell systems. These subspaces are flow invariant by those systems and are generalized polydiagonal subspaces, that is, are characterized by conditions on the cell coordinates of the types $x_i = x_j$ and/or $x_k = -x_l$ and/or $x_m=0$. The existence and identification of the synchrony and antisynchrony subspaces for a weighted network are deeply relevant from the applications and dynamics points of view. Our characterization of the synchrony and antisynchrony subspaces of a weighted network follows from our results where we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a generalized polydiagonal to be invariant by the adjacency matrix and/or the Laplacian matrix of the network.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates fundamental properties of a new class of dynamical systems, which are everywhere smooth except for a codimension-$n$ discontinuity manifold with an arbitrary positive integer $n$. Such systems emerge naturally in modeling the motion of bodies with spatial point contacts as well as with finite contact surfaces under dry friction. As a special case, the investigated class includes Filippov systems ($n=1$) as well as the recently introduced extended Filippov systems ($n=2$). Trajectories reaching the discontinuity manifold are studied in detail, and new types of pathological behavior are uncovered, in systems where the local dynamics around the discontinuity manifold involves polycycles or strange attractors. The concept of crossing and sliding dynamics is extended for this type of system. The results are illustrated by several examples.},

Next, we present a finite-dimensional model that approximates the inertial form. Finally, we propose a temporally discretized model, which is more suitable for computer computation.

The parameter is the linearization at the trivial 1-cluster equilibrium of total synchrony. All equilibria are cluster solutions involving up to three clusters. The resulting global dynamics is of gradient type: all bounded solutions are cluster equilibria and heteroclinic orbits between them. In the limit of large $N$, we present a detailed analysis of the web of heteroclinic orbits among the plethora of 2-cluster equilibria. Our focus is on the global dynamics of 3-cluster solutions with one rebel cluster of small size. These solutions describe slow relative growth and decay of 2-cluster states. For $N\rightarrow\infty$, the limiting heteroclinic web defines an integrable rebel flow in the space of 2-cluster equilibrium configurations. We identify and study the seven qualitatively distinct global rebel flows which arise in this setting. Applications include oscillators with all-to-all coupling, and electrochemistry. For illustration we consider synchronization clusters among $N$ complex Stuart--Landau oscillators with complex linear global coupling.},

Synchronization in stochastic limit cycle oscillators due to common noise is usually demonstrated by applying Ito&#39;s lemma to the logarithm of the phase difference. However, this argument cannot be straightforwardly extended to our case because of its discrete state space. Assuming the intrinsic and extrinsic noises operate at different time scales, we prove that the average level of synchronization is of the order of the rate of the intrinsic noise (inversely proportional to the system volume) times the square of the switching rate of the external noise. Moreover, we show in numerical experiments the approximate asymptotic value of the synchronization level by applying this result to classical oscillators found in the literature.},

In that work, we studied a Lotka--Volterra competition-diffusion model in a one-dimensional advective homogeneous environment, where the downstream end has a net loss of individuals measured by $b$. The global dynamics is completely characterized by $b$. In this paper, we consider the case where the environment is heterogeneous and $b\ge 1$. We first provide necessary and sufficient conditions on persistence of the corresponding single species model. Then for the two-species model, after analyzing the linear stability of the semitrivial steady states (if they exist) and excluding the existence of coexistence steady states (with highly nontrivial arguments), we apply the theory of monotone dynamical systems to find that the species with slower diffusion rate (if it persists) is always selected. This is different from the situation that $b=1$ is a bifurcation value when the environment is homogeneous. We leave the challenging case where $b&lt;1$ for future work.},

In the well-known basic model, the population is made up of “spreaders,&quot; “ignorants,&quot; and “stiflers,&quot; and any spreader attempts to transmit the rumor to the other individuals via directed contacts. In case the contacted individual is an ignorant, it becomes a spreader, while in the other two cases the initiating spreader turns into a stifler. The process in a finite population will eventually reach an equilibrium situation, where individuals are either stiflers or ignorants. We generalize the model by assuming that each ignorant becomes a spreader only after hearing the rumor a predetermined number of times. We identify and analyze a suitable limiting dynamical system of the model, and we prove limit theorems that characterize the ultimate proportion of individuals in the different classes of the population.},

We investigate the dynamics of a subclass of TLNs referred to as competitive TLNs where all the connections between different nodes are inhibitory. We prove the existence of periodic solutions in competitive TLNs with three nodes using a combination of mathematical analysis and numerical simulations. We calculate the analytical expressions of the periodic solutions, then we consider a reduced system of transcendental equations and apply a Kantorovich&#39;s convergence result to demonstrate the existence of these solutions. We then analyze the attributes (frequency and amplitude) of these periodic solutions as the model parameters vary. Finally, we study the entrainment properties of competitive TLNs in the oscillatory regime, by examining their response to external periodic inputs to one of the nodes in the network. We numerically determine the ranges of input amplitudes and frequencies for which competitive TLNs are able to follow the periodic input for three-node networks and larger networks with cyclic symmetry.},

  abstract     = {The synchronization of different brain regions is widely observed under both normal and pathological conditions, such as epilepsy. However, the relationship between the dynamics of these brain regions, the connectivity between them, and the ability to synchronize remains an open question. We investigate the problem of inter-region synchronization in networks of Wilson--Cowan/neural field equations with homeostatic plasticity, each of which acts as a model for an isolated brain region. We consider arbitrary connection profiles with only one constraint: the rows of the connection matrices are all identically normalized. We found that these systems often synchronize to the solution obtained from a single, self-coupled neural region. We analyze the stability of this solution through a straightforward modification of the master stability function (MSF) approach and found that synchronized solutions lose stability for connectivity matrices when the second largest positive eigenvalue is sufficiently large for values of the global coupling parameter that are not too large. This result was numerically confirmed for ring systems and lattices and was also robust to small amounts of heterogeneity in the homeostatic set points in each node. Finally, we tested this result on connectomes obtained from 196 subjects over a broad age range (4--85 years) from the Human Connectome Project. We found that the second largest eigenvalue tended to decrease with age, indicating an increase in synchronizability that may be related to the increased prevalence of epilepsy with advancing age.},

In this paper, we provide some insight on this topic using optimization-based control on an age-differentiated compartmental model. For real-life decision-making, we investigate the impact of the planning horizon on the optimal vaccination/social distancing strategy. We find that in order to reduce social distancing in the long run, without overburdening the health care system, it is essential to vaccinate the people with the highest contact rates first. That is also the case if the objective is to minimize fatalities provided that the social distancing measures are sufficiently strict. However, for short-term planning it is optimal to focus on the high-risk group.},

Roughly speaking, the continuum Winfree model (CWM) is an integro-differential equation for the temporal evolution of a Winfree phase field over an infinite cylinder. For bounded measurable initial phase field and natural frequency functions, we can establish a unique global existence of classical solutions to the CWM in a large coupling regime. At the same time, we can also see that a classical solution to the CWM can be obtained as an $L^1$-limit of a sequence of lattice solutions to the LWM under a suitable framework. This provides a good approximation of solution to the CWM as a sequence of solutions to the LWM. Moreover, we verify that the continuum limit of a sequence of equilibria to the LWM tends to a unique stationary profile of the CWM.},

  abstract     = {To assess which ecosystems are most vulnerable it is necessary to compare the resilience of complex interaction networks in a meaningful way. A fundamental problem for the comparative analysis of ecological stability is that the organisms in ecological networks operate on different time scales. A conventional solution to this problem has been to assume the intraspecific interaction strengths in the dynamical system (and diagonal elements in the community matrix) have the same value, ignoring the time scale differences, and therefore disregarding vital ecological information. In this paper, we consider two methods that have previously been developed to deal with community matrices arising from populations with widely different time scales and which contain differing self-regulation terms (diagonal entries). One approach considers the critical self-regulation in a system by proportionally adjusting the diagonal entries until the tipping point is found. The other is a scaling procedure that translates the intraspecific information on the diagonal on to the off-diagonal entries. We show the relation between the leading eigenvalue of the latter, and the numerical diagonal parameter of the former, which in many ecologically relevant networks is exact. In addition, we show for $3 \times 3$ scaled competitive systems how the feedback determines whether the leading eigenvalue is real- or complex-valued, which is important for knowing when the scaling procedure remains ecologically sensible. While arising from an ecological setting, this work has wider implications in network theory and linear algebra.},

Owing to the analytic representation, one can investigate the existence of equilibria with a single spot, two spots, and the ring configuration where $N$ localized spots are equally spaced along a latitudinal line with mathematical rigor. We show that localized spots at the innermost/outermost locations of the torus are equilibria for any aspect ratio $\alpha=\frac{R}{r}$. In addition, we find that there exists a range of the aspect ratio in which localized spots stay at a special location of the torus. The theoretical results and the linear stability of these spot equilibria are confirmed by solving the nonlinear evolution of the Brusselator reaction-diffusion model by numerical means.

  abstract     = {Understanding principles of neurolocomotion requires the synthesis of neural activity, sensory feedback, and biomechanics. The nematode C. elegans is an ideal model organism for studying locomotion in an integrated neuromechanical setting because its neural circuit has a well-characterized modular structure and its undulatory forward swimming gait adapts to the surrounding fluid with a shorter wavelength in higher viscosity environments. This adaptive behavior emerges from the neural modules interacting through a combination of mechanical forces, neuronal coupling, and sensory feedback mechanisms. However, the relative contributions of these coupling modes to gait adaptation are not understood. Here, an integrated neuromechanical model of C. elegans forward locomotion is developed and analyzed. The model consists of repeated neuromechanical modules that are coupled through the mechanics of the body, short-range proprioception, and gap-junctions. The model captures the experimentally observed gait adaptation over a wide range of mechanical parameters, provided that the muscle response to input from the nervous system is faster than the body response to changes in internal and external forces. The modularity of the model allows the use of the theory of weakly coupled oscillators to identify the relative roles of body mechanics, gap-junctional coupling, and proprioceptive coupling in coordinating the undulatory gait. The analysis shows that the wavelength of body undulations is set by the relative strengths of these three coupling forms. In a low-viscosity fluid environment, the competition between gap-junctions and proprioception produces a long wavelength undulation, which is only achieved in the model with sufficiently strong gap-junctional coupling. The experimentally observed decrease in wavelength in response to increasing fluid viscosity is the result of an increase in the relative strength of mechanical coupling, which promotes a short wavelength.},

Under the usual regularity assumption on $f$, namely, $f\in C^3_b (\mathbb{R}^d, \mathbb{R}^{d\times m})$, the rough differential equation has a unique solution that defines a random dynamical system $\phi_0$. On the other hand, we also consider an ordinary random differential equation $dY_\delta=f(Y_\delta)d\omega_\delta$, where $\omega_\delta$ is a random process with stationary increments and continuously differentiable paths that approximates $\omega$. The latter differential equation generates a random dynamical system $\phi_\delta$ as well. We show the convergence of the random dynamical system $\phi_\delta$ to $\phi_0$ for $\delta\to 0$ in Hölder norm.},

  abstract     = {We propose a computational approach to estimate the stability domain of quadratic-bilinear reduced-order models (ROMs), which are low-dimensional approximations of large-scale dynamical systems. For nonlinear ROMs, it is important not only to show that the origin is locally asymptotically stable, but also to quantify if the operative range of the ROM is included in the region of convergence. While accuracy and structure preservation remain the main focus of development for nonlinear ROMs, computational methods that go beyond the existing highly conservative analytical results have been lacking thus far. In this work, for a given quadratic Lyapunov function, we first derive an analytical estimate of the stability domain, which is rather conservative but can be evaluated efficiently. With the goal to enlarge this estimate, we provide an optimal ellipsoidal estimate of the stability domain by solving a convex optimization problem. This provides us with valuable information about stability properties of the ROM, an important aspect of predictive simulation. We do not assume a specific ROM method, so a particular appeal is that the approach is applicable to quadratic-bilinear models obtained via data-driven approaches, where ROM stability properties cannot---per definition---be derived from the full-order model. Numerical results for a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG)-balanced ROM of Burgers&#39; equation, a proper orthogonal decomposition ROM of FitzHugh--Nagumo, and a nonintrusive ROM of Burgers&#39; equation demonstrate the scalability and quantitative advantages of the proposed approach. The optimization-based estimates of the stability domain are found to be up to four orders of magnitude less conservative than analytical estimates.},

  abstract     = {Experimental characterization of neuronal dynamics involves recording both of spontaneous activity patterns and of responses to transient and sustained inputs. While much theoretical attention has been devoted to the spontaneous activity of neurons, less is known about the dynamic mechanisms shaping their responses to transient inputs, although these bear significant physiological relevance. Here, we study responses to transient inputs in a widely used class of neuron models (nonlinear adaptive hybrid models) well-known to reproduce a number of biologically realistic behaviors. We focus on responses to transient inputs that have been previously associated with Type III neurons, arguably the least studied category in Hodgkin&#39;s classification, which are those neurons that never exhibit continuous firing in response to sustained excitatory currents. The two phenomena that we study are postinhibitory facilitation, in which an otherwise subthreshold excitatory input can induce a spike if it is applied with proper timing after an inhibitory pulse, and slope detection, in which a neuron spikes to a transient input only when the input&#39;s rate of change is in a specific, bounded range. Using dynamical systems theory, we analyze the origin of these phenomena in nonlinear hybrid models. We provide a geometric characterization of dynamical structures associated with postinhibitory facilitation in the system and an analytical study of slope detection for tent inputs. While the necessary and sufficient conditions for these behaviors are easily satisfied in neurons with Type III excitability, our proofs are quite general and valid for neurons that do not exhibit Type III excitability as well. This study therefore provides a framework for the mathematical analysis of these responses to transient inputs associated with Type III neurons in other systems and for advancing our understanding of these systems&#39; computational properties.},

In the case of a Cauchy distribution of excitability, we prove that with pure sinusoidal coupling, there can be no oscillations. However, if the excitability distribution has faster decay or the noise is Gaussian, then we show that there are oscillations and that they occur in a very specific manner organized around a Takens--Bogdanov bifurcation and a degenerate homoclinic bifurcation. We show that if the coupling is slightly more general, then even a Cauchy distribution is able to generate oscillations. Finally, we rescale the reduced equations in the small heterogeneity limit and show the common dynamics in these different models.},

Viewed formally, these results generalize those of Conley and Franks for continuous-time and discrete-time dynamical systems, respectively, on metric spaces.

The switching mechanism naturally forces the existence of periodic orbits. In order to make unbiased comparisons between periodic orbits in this model and a traditional one where the contact rate switches based on more simplistic pointwise evaluations of active cases, we use a rigorous homotopy continuation method. We develop computer-assisted proofs that can validate the continuation and prove that the branch of periodic orbits has no folds and is isolated in the space of periodic solutions. This allows a direct, rigorous comparison between the geometric and quantitative properties of the cycles with a moving average threshold and a pointwise threshold. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a sample problem modeled off of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Montreal.},

  abstract     = {When dynamical systems that produce rhythmic behaviors operate within hard limits, they may exhibit limit cycles with sliding components, that is, closed isolated periodic orbits that make and break contact with a constraint surface. Examples include heel-ground interaction in locomotion, firing rate rectification in neural networks, and stick-slip oscillators. In many rhythmic systems, robustness against external perturbations involves response of both the shape and the timing of the limit cycle trajectory. The existing methods of infinitesimal phase response curve (iPRC) and variational analysis are well established for quantifying changes in timing and shape, respectively, for smooth systems. These tools have recently been extended to nonsmooth dynamics with transversal crossing boundaries. In this work, we further extend the iPRC method to nonsmooth systems with sliding components, which enables us to make predictions about the synchronization properties of weakly coupled stick-slip oscillators. We observe a new feature of the isochrons in a planar limit cycle with hard sliding boundaries: a nonsmooth kink in the asymptotic phase function, originating from the point at which the limit cycle smoothly departs the constraint surface and propagating away from the hard boundary into the interior of the domain. Moreover, the classical variational analysis neglects timing information and is restricted to instantaneous perturbations. By defining the “infinitesimal shape response curve&quot; (iSRC), we incorporate timing sensitivity of an oscillator to describe the shape response of this oscillator to parametric perturbations. In order to extract timing information, we also develop a “local timing response curve&quot; (lTRC) that measures the timing sensitivity of a limit cycle within any given region. We demonstrate in a specific example that taking into account local timing sensitivity in a nonsmooth system greatly improves the accuracy of the iSRC over the global timing analysis given by the iPRC.},

Outside the homoclinic snaking region, the hexagon fronts can invade the trivial state in a bursting fashion. In this paper, we use a far-field core decomposition to set up a numerical path-following routine to trace out the bifurcation diagrams of hexagon fronts for the two main orientations of cellular hexagon patterns with respect to the interface in the bistable region. We find for one orientation that the hexagon fronts can destabilize as the distorted hexagons are stretched in the transverse direction leading to defects occurring in the deposited cellular pattern. We then plot diagrams showing when the selected fronts for the two main orientations, aligned perpendicularly to each other, are compatible leading to a hexagon wavenumber selection prediction for hexagon patches on the plane. Finally, we verify the compatibility criterion for hexagon patches in the Swift--Hohenberg equation with a quadratic-cubic nonlinearity and a large nonvariational perturbation.

  abstract     = {We study the dynamics of the periodically forced May--Leonard system. We extend previous results on the field, and we identify different dynamical regimes depending on the strength of attraction $\delta$ of the network and the frequency $\omega$ of the periodic forcing. We focus our attention in the case $\delta\gg1$ and $\omega \approx 0$, where we show that, for a positive Lebesgue measure set of parameters (amplitude of the periodic forcing), the dynamics are dominated by strange attractors with fully stochastic properties, supporting Sinai--Ruelle--Bowen (SRB) measures. The proof is performed by using the Wang and Young&#39;s theory of rank-one strange attractors. This work ends the discussion about the existence of observable and sustainable chaos in this scenario. We also identify some bifurcations occurring in the transition from an attracting two-torus to rank-one strange attractors, whose existence has been suggested by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {We analyze a class of cell-bulk coupled PDE-ODE models, motivated by quorum-sensing and diffusion-mediated behavior in microbial systems, that characterize communication between localized spatially segregated dynamically active signaling compartments or “cells” that have a permeable boundary. In this model, the cells are disks of a common radius $\varepsilon \ll 1$ and they are spatially coupled through a passive extracellular bulk diffusion field with diffusivity $D$ in a bounded 2-D domain. Each cell secretes a signaling chemical into the bulk region at a constant rate and receives a feedback of the bulk chemical from the entire collection of cells. This global feedback, which activates signaling pathways within the cells, modifies the intracellular dynamics according to the external environment. The cell secretion and global feedback are regulated by permeability parameters across the cell membrane. For arbitrary reaction-kinetics within each cell, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used in the limit $\varepsilon\ll 1$ of small cell radius to construct steady-state solutions of the PDE-ODE model and to derive a nonlinear globally coupled eigenvalue problem (GCEP) that characterizes the linear stability properties of the steady-states. The analysis and computation of the nullspace of the GCEP as parameters are varied is central to the linear stability analysis. In the limit of large bulk diffusivity $D={D_0/\nu}\gg 1$, where $\nu\equiv {-1/\log\varepsilon}$, an asymptotic analysis of the PDE-ODE model leads to a limiting ODE system for the spatial average of the concentration in the bulk region that is coupled to the intracellular dynamics within the cells. Results from the linear stability theory and ODE dynamics are illustrated for Sel&#39;kov reaction-kinetics, where the kinetic parameters are chosen so that each cell is quiescent when uncoupled from the bulk medium. For various specific spatial configurations of cells, the linear stability theory is used to construct phase diagrams in parameter space characterizing where a switch-like emergence of intracellular oscillations can occur through a Hopf bifurcation. The effect of the membrane permeability parameters, the reaction-kinetic parameters, the bulk diffusivity, and the spatial configuration of cells on both the emergence and synchronization of the oscillatory intracellular dynamics, as mediated by the bulk diffusion field, is analyzed in detail. The linear stability theory is validated from full numerical simulations of the PDE-ODE system, and from the reduced ODE model when $D$ is large.},

This approach works fine for a wide class of systems that are perturbations of non-Hamiltonian integrable planar vector fields. Specifically, our method can provide an approximation up to any desired order, both for the locus where the heteroclinic bifurcation occurs in the parameter space and for the orbit in the phase space. We also give proofs that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the solution. As illustrations, we apply it to the generic Hopf-zero and nonresonant double Hopf singularities which give rise to an intricate bifurcation scenario in the cases where a heteroclinic cycle appears in the corresponding unfolding of normal forms. The obtained high-order approximations are expressed in terms of symbolic nonzero normal form coefficients which improve the existing first-order approximations in the literature. They are also in excellent agreement with numerical continuations. Note that the derived formulas can be practically important in many control engineering applications in which certain constants of the problem may not be known in advance.},

We obtain the same conditions by using a different analytical approach that exploits the singular limit of the problem. We also apply this methodology of the action functional to the problem for traveling 2-pulse solutions and derive the explicit conditions for existence and a saddle-node bifurcation. From these we deduce a necessary condition for the existence of traveling 2-pulse solutions. We end this article with a discussion related to Hopf bifurcations near the saddle-node bifurcation.

To substantiate the method, we next show that the structure of the approximating ODE is reminiscent of the structure of the generator of translation along solutions of the DDE.

  abstract     = {In this study, we develop model bias estimators based on an asymptotic expansion of the model dynamics for small time scales and small perturbations in a model parameter, and then use the estimators to improve the performance of a data assimilation system. We employ the well-known Lorenz (1963) model so that we can study all aspects of the dynamical system and model bias estimators in a detailed way that would not be possible with a full physics numerical weather prediction model. In particular, we first work out the asymptotics of the Lorenz model for small changes in one of its parameters and then use statistics from cycled data assimilation experiments to demonstrate that the asymptotics accurately represent the behavior of the model and that the coefficients of the nonlinear asymptotical expansion can be reasonably estimated by solving a least squares minimization problem. In data assimilation, the background error covariance matrix usually estimates the uncertainty of the model background, which is then used along with the observation error covariance matrix to produce an updated analysis. If the uncertainty of the model background is strongly influenced by time-dependent model biases, then the development of nonlinear bias estimators that also vary with time could improve the performance of the assimilation system and the accuracy of the updated analysis. We demonstrate this improvement through the combination of a constant background error covariance matrix with a dynamically varying matrix computed using the model bias estimators. Numerical tests using the Lorenz (1963) model illustrate the feasibility of the approach and show that it leads to clear improvements in the analysis and forecast accuracy.},

This condition effectively translates to the requirement that the spatial refinements must occur at a faster pace than the temporal refinements.

The study of the transition to periodic solutions from the steady conduction state of a rotating and self-gravitating fluid sphere, heated uniformly from the inside, is discussed here. The continuation of double Hopf points is used to determine the region of the parameter space in which the first bifurcation is to solutions independent of the longitude (axisymmetric solutions). It is limited by three segments of curves separated by two triple Hopf points. This type of so-called torsional solutions was recently found, and it is shown here that they are the preferred solutions at the onset of convection for a wide range of fluids of Prandtl numbers, ${Pr}$, extending from ${Pr}=0$ to ${Pr}\approx 0.9$, which includes, for instance, liquid metals and gases. Although the corresponding interval of Ekman numbers, ${E}$, narrows when ${Pr}\rightarrow 0$, it is shown that there is always a small gap of parameters, relevant to geophysics and astrophysics, where the torsional solutions are preferred. The limits of the double Hopf curves when ${Pr\rightarrow 0}$ follow linear laws of the form ${E}=c(m_1,m_2){Pr}$, $c(m_1,m_2)$ being constant depending on the two azimuthal wavenumbers, $m_1$ and $m_2$, of the eigenfunctions that define the double Hopf problem.},

  abstract     = {Replica-mean-field models have been proposed to decipher the activity of otherwise analytically intractable neural networks via a multiply-and-conquer approach. In this approach, one considers limit networks made of infinitely many replicas with the same basic neural structure as that of the network of interest, but exchanging spikes in a randomized manner. The key point is that these replica-mean-field networks are tractable versions that retain important features of the finite structure of interest. To date, the replica framework has been discussed for first-order models, whereby elementary replica constituents are single neurons with independent Poisson inputs. Here, we extend this replica framework to allow elementary replica constituents to be composite objects, namely, pairs of neurons. As they include pairwise interactions, these pair-replica models exhibit nontrivial dependencies in their stationary dynamics, which cannot be captured by first-order replica models. Our contributions are two-fold: (i) We analytically characterize the stationary dynamics of a pair of intensity-based neurons with independent Poisson input. This analysis involves the reduction of a boundary-value problem related to a two-dimensional transport equation to a system of Fredholm integral equations---a result of independent interest. (ii) We analyze the set of consistency equations determining the full network dynamics of certain replica limits. These limits are those for which replica constituents, be they single neurons or pairs of neurons, form a partition of the network of interest. Both analyses are numerically validated by computing input/output transfer functions for neuronal pairs and by computing the correlation structure of certain pair-dominated network dynamics.},

This proof utilizes the convexity of the normalized communication weights and a Gronwall--Halanay-type inequality. The main advantage of our method, compared to previous approaches to the delay Hegselmann--Krause model, is that it does not require any restriction on the maximal time delay, or the initial data, or decay rate of the influence function. From this point of view the result is optimal. For the Cucker--Smale model it provides an analogous result in the regime of unconditonal flocking with sufficiently slowly decaying communication rate, but still without any restriction on the length of the maximal time delay. Moreover, we demonstrate that the method can be easily extended to the mean-field limits of both the Hegselmann--Krause and Cucker--Smale systems, using appropriate stability results on the measure-valued solutions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we analyze nonlinear dynamics of the fullerene molecule. We prove, under isotypic nonresonant assumptions, the existence of global branches of periodic solutions emerging from an icosahedral equilibrium (nonlinear normal modes). We use equivariant degree theory to prove the existence of several branches of symmetric solutions for maximal orbit types which are standing and rotating waves that propagate along the molecule with icosahedral, tetrahedral, pentagonal, and triangular symmetries. Using a model that reflects the nonlinear characteristics of the fullerene, we confirm numerically the isotypic nonresonant assumptions and apply numerical Newton&#39;s continuation method to approximate some of the predicted modes.},

  abstract     = {The totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) is a basic model of statistical mechanics that has found numerous applications. We consider the case of TASEP with a finite chain where particles may enter from the left and leave to the right at prescribed rates. This model can be formulated as a Markov process with a finite number of states. Due to the irreducibility of the process, it is well-known that the probability distribution on the states is globally attracted to a unique equilibrium distribution. We extend this result to the more detailed level of individual trajectories. To do so we formulate TASEP as a random dynamical system. Our main result is that the trajectories from all possible initial conditions contract to each other yielding the existence of a random attractor that consists of a single trajectory almost surely. This implies that in the long run TASEP “filters out” any perturbation that changes the state of the particles along the chain.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we aim to classify the dynamic transitions and bifurcations for a family of axisymmetric geophysical fluid problems of a generic fourth-second order structure. A transition theorem is established by reducing the governing partial differential equations to a complex-valued ordinary differential equation, derived by employing approximate invariant manifolds. We develop an algorithm for the numerical determination of the transition/bifurcation types. Finally we apply the transition theorem and algorithm to examine the baroclinic instability in a two-layer quasi-geostrophic system in an annular channel and with different bathymetry profiles. Our numerical results show that with concave bathymetry the transition (bifurcation) is always continuous (supercritical Hopf bifurcation), whereas for convex bathymetry a jump transition (subcritical Hopf bifurcation) may occur in the basic azimuthal currents that rotate in the same direction.},

  abstract     = {Deciding whether and where a system of parametrized ordinary differential equations displays bistability, that is, has at least two asymptotically stable steady states for some choice of parameters, is a hard problem. For systems modeling biochemical reaction networks, we introduce a procedure to determine, exclusively via symbolic computations, the stability of the steady states for unspecified parameter values. In particular, our approach fully determines the stability type of all steady states of a broad class of networks. To this end, we combine the Hurwitz criterion, reduction of the steady state equations to one univariate equation, and structural reductions of the reaction network. Using our method, we prove that bistability occurs in open regions in parameter space for many relevant motifs in cell signaling.},
