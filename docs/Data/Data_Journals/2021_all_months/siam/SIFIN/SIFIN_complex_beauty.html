This limit theorem resolves the open question from [E. Bayraktar, L. Dolinskyi, and Y. Dolinsky, Finance Stoch., 24 (2020), pp. 1013--1034]. The main idea of our proof is to establish a uniqueness result for the optimal strategy. The proof of the uniqueness is heavily based on the dual approach which was developed recently in [Ch. Czichowsky and W. Schachermayer, Ann. Appl. Probab., 26 (2016), pp. 1888--1941; Ch. Czichowsky, W. Schachermayer, and J. Yang, Math. Finance, 27 (2017), pp. 623--658; Ch.

To accomplish this we make two key contributions. First, we propose a dynamic default contagion model with endogenous early defaults for a finite set of banks, generalizing the Gai--Kapadia framework. Second, we reformulate this system as a stochastic particle system leading to a limiting mean-field problem. We study the existence of these clearing systems and, for the mean-field problem, the continuity of the system response.},

Empirical results suggest that if a significant market fluctuation occurs, invested wealth tends to have a notable change from its current value. We consider an incomplete stochastic volatility market model that is driven by both a Brownian motion and a jump process. First, we obtain a closed-form formula for an approximation to the optimal portfolio in a small-time horizon. This is obtained by finding the associated Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman integro-differential equation and then approximating the value function by constructing appropriate supersolution and subsolution. It is shown that the true value function can be obtained by sandwiching the constructed super-solution and subsolution. We also prove the accuracy of the approximation formulas. Finally, we provide a procedure for generating a close-to-optimal portfolio for a finite time horizon.},

The equilibrium strategy is then characterized by an extended path-dependent Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation system under a game-theoretic framework. A verification theorem is provided. We derive explicit solutions to three problems, including MVP with constant risk aversion, MVP for log returns, and a mean-variance objective with a linear controlled Volterra process. We also thoroughly examine the effect of volatility roughness on equilibrium strategies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that trading rules with rough volatility outperform the classic counterparts.},

  abstract     = {We consider a real options problem, which is posed as a stochastic optimal control problem. The investment strategy, which plays the role of control, involves a one-time option to expand (invest) and a one-time option to abandon (terminate) the project. The timing and amount of the investment and the termination time are parameters to be optimized in order to maximize the expected value of the profit. This stochastic optimization problem amounts to solving a deterministic variational inequality in dimension one, with the associated obstacle problem. Because we consider both cessation and expansion options and fixed and variable costs of expansion, the obstacle is nonsmooth. Due to the lack of smoothness, we use the concept of a weak solution. However, such solutions may not lead to a straightforward investment strategy. Therefore, we further consider strong ($C^1$) solutions based on thresholds. We propose sufficient conditions for the existence of such solutions to the variational inequality with a non-smooth obstacle in dimension one. When applied to the real options problem, these sufficient conditions yield a simple optimal investment strategy with the stopping times defined in terms of the thresholds.},

To fill the gap, this paper studies how the firm value processes interact with each other in the presence of correlated defaults as well as a large number of firms. To this end, a new renewal theory is developed. The results show that even under a simple one-factor model, the idiosyncratic moments of the defaulted firm transfer to other firms at the time of default, causing a propagation in credit risk. Furthermore, we can quantify this propagation via asymptotic theory, which provides a multiname distance-to-default type risk measure for a system of firms. The results potentially constitute a new method in studying contagion and other correlated default effects and therefore provide new measurements in credit risk management. Numerical and empirical studies are presented to illustrate our claim.},

We propose a novel machine learning approach that solves for the local saddle-point at a chosen set of inputs and then uses a nonparametric (Gaussian process) regression to obtain a functional representation of the value function. Our algorithm resembles control randomization and regression Monte Carlo techniques but also brings multiple innovations, including adaptive experimental design, separate surrogates for optimal control and the local worst-case measure, and computational speed-ups for the sup-inf optimization. Thanks to the new scheme we are able to consider settings that have been previously computationally intractable and provide several new financial insights about learning and optimal trading under unknown market parameters. In particular, we demonstrate the financial advantages of adaptive robust framework compared to adaptive and static robust alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Randomization is an increasingly popular tool for solving optimal stopping problems numerically, for instance, in order to price Bermudan options. This means that stopping decisions are relaxed by randomizing them with respect to an independent noise, thereby mollifying the optimal control problem. We study two specific algorithms based on randomization. We consider a forward approach consisting of global optimization of properly parameterized randomized stopping times. As an alternative, we also consider a backward approach based on dynamic programming, i.e., optimizing a sequence of stopping decisions locally in time. We provide theoretical justification for the resulting simulation-based algorithms by a rigorous convergence analysis in the number of training trajectories. Therefore, this work contains partial convergence analysis of the recent machine learning approaches to optimal stopping problems.},

In doing this, we provide a complete study of absence of arbitrage in a multicurrency market where, in each single monetary area, multiple interest rates coexist. We first characterize absence of arbitrage in the case without collateral. After that we study collateralization schemes in a very general situation: the cash flows of the contingent claim and those associated to the collateral agreement can be specified in any currency. We study both segregation and rehypothecation and allow for cash and risky collateral in arbitrary currency specifications. Absence of arbitrage and pricing in the presence of collateral are discussed under all possible combinations of conventions. Our work provides not only a reference for the analysis of wealth dynamics but also valuation formulas that are a useful foundation for cross currency curve construction techniques. Our framework provides also a solid foundation for the construction of multicurrency simulation models for the generation of exposure profiles in the context of xVA calculations.},

In this model, credit rating migrations are assumed to depend on the ratio of debt and asset value of the underlying company, where debt is assumed to be a zero coupon corporate bond and asset value follows a geometric Brownian motion with volatility and dividend depending on credit rating. There is a buffer zone (called deadband in engineering) in credit rating migration, so upgrade and downgrade thresholds are different. Mathematically, this model is a system of partial differential equations with two free boundaries that correspond to the hitting boundaries in state space to upgrade and downgrade credit rating, respectively. The existence, uniqueness, regularity, and asymptotic behavior of the solution and free boundaries with zero dividend are obtained. Some nonzero dividend cases are discussed with numerical results.},

Traders often rely on discrete-time hedging strategies based on fixed trading times or fixed trading prices (i.e., trades occur only if the underlying asset&#39;s price reaches some predetermined values). Motivated by this insight and with the aim of obtaining explicit solutions, we consider the seller of a perpetual American put option who can hedge her portfolio once until the underlying stock price leaves a certain range of values $(a,b)$. We determine optimal trading boundaries as functions of the initial stock holding, and an optimal hedging strategy for a bond/stock portfolio. Optimality here refers to the variance of the hedging error at the (random) time when the stock leaves the interval $(a,b)$. Our study leads to analytical expressions for both the optimal boundaries and the optimal stock holding, which can be evaluated numerically with no effort.},

We study two examples of parsimonious models in this class: a two-factor model and a model in which the order book depth is mean reverting. For each model we perform a detailed analysis of the role of different parameters, study the dynamics of the price, order book depth, volume, and order imbalance, provide an intuitive financial interpretation of the variables involved, and show how the model reproduces statistical properties of price changes, market depth, and order flow in limit order markets.},

For benchmarking purposes, a constant proportion (CP) investment strategy is also considered. To ensure that terminal wealth distributions are compared on a fair and practical basis, we assume that an investor, otherwise agnostic about the philosophical differences of the underlying approaches to dynamic MV optimization, requires that the same expected value of terminal wealth should be obtained regardless of the approach. We present first-order stochastic dominance results proving that for wealth outcomes below the chosen expected value target, the cTCMV strategy always outperforms the DOMV strategy, and an appropriately chosen CP strategy always outperforms the dTCMV strategy. We also show that the PCMV strategy results in a terminal wealth distribution with fundamentally different characteristics than any of the other strategies. Finally, our analytical results are very effective in explaining the numerical results currently available in the literature regarding the relative performance of the various investment strategies.},

This short paper is dedicated to a complementary model-free result: An arbitrage-free implied volatility in fact is the harmonic mean of a positive function for any fixed maturity. We investigate the latter function, which is tightly linked to Fukasawa&#39;s invertible map $f_{1/2}$ [M. Fukasawa, Math. Finance, 22 (2012), pp. 753--762], and its relation with the local volatility surface.

We construct a new series expansion for this integral in terms of double infinite weighted sums of particular independent random variables through a change of measure and the decomposition of squared Bessel bridges. When approximated by series truncations, this representation has exponentially decaying truncation errors. We propose feasible strategies to largely reduce the implementation of the new series to simulations of simple random variables that are independent of any model parameters. We further develop direct inversion algorithms to generate samples for such random variables based on Chebyshev polynomial approximations for their inverse distribution functions. These approximations can be used under any market conditions. Thus, we establish a strong, efficient, and almost exact sampling scheme for the Heston model.},

To do so, we use a principal-agent approach, where the agents (the market makers) optimize their quotes in a Nash equilibrium fashion, providing best response to the contract proposed by the principal (the exchange). This contract aims at attracting liquidity on the platform. This is because the wealth of the exchange depends on the arrival of market orders, which is driven by the spread of market makers. We compute the optimal contract in quasi-explicit form and also derive the optimal spread policies for the market makers. Several new phenomena appears in this multi market-maker setting. In particular we show that it is not necessarily optimal to have a large number of market makers in the presence of a contracting scheme.},

The proposed iterative algorithm, called DECODE, jointly estimates a performance measure of the market and the effective parameter vector in the optimal portfolio solution, where the relative-volatility timing is introduced into the risk exposure of an efficient portfolio via the control of its sparsity. The portfolio&#39;s risk exposure level, which is linked to its sparsity in the proposed framework, is automatically tuned with the latest market condition without using cross validation. The algorithm is efficient as it costs only a few computations of quadratic programming. We prove that the iterative algorithm converges and show the oracle inequalities of the DECODE, which provide sufficient conditions for a consistent estimate of an optimal portfolio. The algorithm can also handle the curse of dimensionality in that the number of training samples is less than the number of assets. Our empirical studies of over-12-year backtest illustrate the relative-volatility timing feature of the DECODE and the superior out-of-sample performance of the DECODE portfolio, which beats the equally weighted portfolio and improves over the shrinkage portfolio.},

We investigate the continuous-time Markowitz mean-variance problem for a multivariate class of affine and quadratic Volterra models. In this incomplete non-Markovian and nonsemimartingale market framework with unbounded random coefficients, the optimal portfolio strategy is expressed by means of a Riccati backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). In the case of affine Volterra models, we derive explicit solutions to this BSDE in terms of multidimensional Riccati--Volterra equations. This framework includes multivariate rough Heston models and extends the results of Han and Wong [Appl. Math. Optim. (2020)]. In the quadratic case, we obtain new analytic formulae for the the Riccati BSDE and we establish their link with infinite-dimensional Riccati equations. This covers rough Stein--Stein and Wishart type covariance models. Numerical results on a two-dimensional rough Stein--Stein model illustrate the impact of rough volatilities and stochastic correlations on the optimal Markowitz strategy. In particular for positively correlated assets, we find that the optimal strategy in our model is a “buy rough sell smooth” one.},

Our approach builds on two fundamental structural results for law-invariant functionals: the equivalence of law invariance and Schur convexity, i.e., monotonicity with respect to the convex stochastic order, and the fact that a law-invariant functional is fully determined by its behavior on bounded random variables. We show how to apply these results to provide a unifying perspective on the literature on law-invariant functionals, with special emphasis on quantile-based representations, including Kusuoka representations, dilatation monotonicity, and infimal convolutions.},

  abstract     = {Latency is the time delay between an exchange streaming market data to a trader, the trader processing information and deciding to trade, and the exchange receiving the order from the trader. Liquidity takers face a moving target problem as a consequence of their latency in the marketplace. They send market orders with a limit price that aim at a price and quantity they observed in the limit order book (LOB), and by the time their order is processed by the exchange, prices could have worsened, so the order may not be filled, or prices could have improved, so the order is filled at a better price. In this paper we provide a model to compute the price that liquidity takers would be willing to pay to reduce their latency in the marketplace. To this end, we derive a latency-optimal strategy that specifies the limit price of liquidity taking orders to increase the chances of filling orders if, due to latency, prices or quantities in the LOB have worsened. The latency-optimal strategy balances the trade-off between the costs of walking the LOB and targeting a desired percentage of filled orders over a period of time. We employ the cost of improving fills with the latency-optimal strategy to compute the shadow price of latency. Finally, we use a proprietary data set of foreign exchange (FX) to compute the maximum price that an FX trader would be willing to pay for colocation and hardware to reduce their latency in the marketplace.},

In order to verify that the solution of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation coincides with the value function, we establish a verification theorem.

  abstract     = {Decision making under uncertainty is generally considered as the selection of an optimal sequence of actions in an uncertain environment. Its calibration raises the “inverse” problem to recover the criterion from the data. A classical example in economy is the theory of “revealed preference” introduced by Samuelson [Economica, 5 (1938), pp. 61--71]. The observable at a given date $t$, $\mathscr X_t(x)$, is an increasing function of a real parameter $x$ (the wealth in economy). The process ${\mathscr X_t(x)}$ is called the characteristic process. The objective is to recover a dynamic stochastic utility ${U(t,z)}$, “revealed” in the sense where its performance is without bias, more formally when “${U(t,\mathscr X_t(x))}$ is a martingale.” The increasing of $\mathscr X_t(x)$ in $x$ and the concavity of the utility lead to privilege the so-called adjoint process $Y_t(u_z(x)):=U_z(t,\mathscr X_t(x))$ in the linearization of the problem; the one to one correspondence between $U_z(t,z)$ and $Y_t(u_z(x))$ for a given characteristic process is used intensively. We focus on the $(u,\mathscr X,Y)$ triplets, bringing great attention to their initial conditions. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of at least one solution to the “revealed&quot; utility problem. An operational version is as follows: “${\mathscr X_{t}(x)Y_t(y)}$ is a supermartingale for any $(x,y)$ and ${\mathscr X_{t}(x)Y_t(u_{z}(x))}$ is a martingale for $y=u_z(x)$.&quot; Moreover, there is an equivalent intrinsic framework, where in addition the processes “${\mathscr X_{t}(x)}$,${Y_t(y)}$,${U(t,z)}$&quot; are supermartingales. Itô&#39;s semimartingale framework is used to illustrate this characterization. The operational version ensures that the revealed utility is a solution of a nonlinear stochastic PDE. Less obvious is its interpretation as a stochastic value function of some optimization problem. The financial markets framework appears as a special case, under stronger assumptions. Then, we revisit the dynamic equilibrium problem as in He and Leland [Rev. Financial Stud., 6 (1993), pp. 593--617], by considering it as a revealed utility problem. We solve the problem in a random environment, by characterizing all the equilibria, in showing that the only possible conjugate dynamic utilities are the mixture of stochastic dual power utilities.},

The resulting problem is called the multimarginal martingale optimal transport problem. We propose two numerical methods to solve such problems: using discretization and linear programming applied to the primal side and using penalization and deep neural networks optimization applied to the dual side. We prove convergence for our methods and compare their numerical performance. We show how adding further information about call option prices at additional maturities can be incorporated and narrows down the no-arbitrage pricing bounds. Finally, we obtain structural results for the case of the payoff given by a weighted sum of covariances between the assets.},

We study an equivalent stochastic target problem with the conditional probability of success as a new state variable, in addition to the asset value process. We propose numerical approximations based on piecewise constant policy time stepping coupled with novel finite difference schemes. We prove convergence in the monotone case combining backward stochastic differential equation arguments with the Barles and Jakobsen and Barles and Souganidis approaches for nonlinear PDEs. The difficulties compared to the classical setting consist in the construction of monotone schemes under degeneracy due to the perfectly correlated joint process, the unboundedness of the control variable, and the effect of the boundaries in the probability variable on the analysis. We extend the method to a class of nonmonotone schemes using higher order interpolation and prove convergence for linear drivers. In a numerical section, we illustrate the performance of our schemes by considering an example in a financial market with imperfections, and show that a standard nonmonotone scheme produces financially counterintuitive solutions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, to cope with the shortage of sufficient theoretical support resulting from the fast-growing quantitative financial modeling, we investigate two classes of generalized stochastic volatility models, establish their well-posedness of strong solutions, and conduct the stability analysis with respect to small perturbations. In the first class, a multidimensional path-dependent process is driven by another multidimensional path-dependent process. The second class is a generalized one-dimensional stochastic volatility model with Hölder continuous coefficients. What greatly differentiates these two classes of models is that both the process and its correlated driving process have their own subdifferential operators, whose one special case is the general reflection operators for multisided barriers. Hence, the models investigated fully cover various newly explored variants of stochastic volatility models whose well-posedness is unknown, and naturally serve as the rigorous mathematical foundation for new stochastic volatility model development in terms of multidimensions, path dependence, and multisided barrier reflection.},

  abstract     = {An investor initially shorts a divisible American option $f$ and dynamically trades stock $S$ to maximize her expected utility. The investor faces the uncertainty of the exercise time of $f$, yet by observing the exercise time she would adjust her dynamic trading strategy accordingly. We thus investigate the robust utility maximization problem $V(x)=\sup_{(H,c)}\inf_{\eta}\mathbb{E}[U(x+H\cdot S-c(\eta(f)-p))]$, where $H$ is the dynamic trading strategy for $S$, $c$ represents the amount of $f$ the investor initially shorts, $\eta$ is the liquidation strategy for $f$, and $p$ is the initial price of $f$. We mainly consider two cases: In the first case, the investor shorts a fixed amount of $f$; i.e., without loss of generality, $c=1$ and $p=0$; in the second case, she statically trades $f$; i.e., $c$ can be any nonnegative number. We first show that in both cases $V(x)=\sup_{(H,c)}\inf_{\tau}\mathbb{E}[U(x+H\cdot S-c(f_\tau-p))]=\inf_{\rho}\sup_{(H,c)}$ $\mathbb{E}[U(x+H\cdot S-c(f_\rho-p))]$, where $\tau$ is a pure stopping time, $\rho$ is a randomized stopping time, and $H$ satisfies a certain nonanticipation condition. Then in the first case (i.e., $c=1$), we show that when $U$ is exponential, $V(x)=\inf_{\tau}\sup_{H}\mathbb{E}[U(x+H\cdot S-f_\tau)]$; for general utility, this equality may fail, yet it can be recovered if we in addition let $\tau$ be adapted to $H$ in a certain sense. Finally, in the second case ($c\in[0,\infty)$) we obtain a duality result for the robust utility maximization on an enlarged space.},

We apply model order reduction (MOR) to obtain a reduced system. MOR has been previously studied for asymptotically stable controlled stochastic systems with zero initial conditions. However, stochastic differential equations modeling price processes are uncontrolled, have nonzero initial states and are often unstable. Therefore, we extend MOR schemes and combine ideas of techniques known for deterministic systems. This leads to a method providing a good pathwise approximation. After explaining the reduction procedure, the error of the approximation is analyzed and the performance of the algorithm is shown conducting several numerical experiments. Within the numerics section, the benefit of the algorithm in the context of option pricing is pointed out.},
