The Shepp--Olkin theorem states that in the binary case (${r=1}$), the Shannon entropy of $S_n$ is maximized when all the $X_i$&#39;s are uniformly distributed, i.e., Bernoulli(1/2). In an attempt to generalize this theorem to arbitrary finite alphabets, we obtain a lower bound on the maximum entropy of $S_n$ and prove that it is tight in several special cases. In addition to these special cases, an argument is presented supporting the conjecture that the bound represents the optimal value for all $n$, $r$, i.e., that $H(S_n)$ is maximized when $X_1, \dots, X_{n-1}$ are uniformly distributed over ${0, r}$, while the probability mass function of $X_n$ is a mixture (with explicitly defined nonzero weights) of the uniform distributions over ${0, r}$ and ${1, \dots, r-1}$.},

Applications of characterizing statistics to the theory of hypothesis testing are given.

Under a global independence hypothesis, we define, by mean of moment generating functions, an easily implementable condition for the sustainability of the collective vault. That is, if, for all the participants and at any time, on average, the sum of the loans is strictly less than the sum of the payments to the collective vault, then the probability of the collective vault failing can be made arbitrarily small, provided the loans only start to be accepted after a sufficiently large delay. We present numerical illustrations of collective vaults for exponential and chi-squared distributed random terms. For the practical management of such a collective vault it may be advisable to have loan granting rules that destroy the independence of the random terms. We present a first simulation study that shows the effect of such a loan granting rule, that removes the independence hypothesis on maintaining the stability of the collective vault.},

The strong Feller property in the total variation distance is derived as a by-product. The key of the approach is a set of estimates for the variations of the transition probabilities. The estimates in Wasserstein distance are derived from an upper bound of the kernels induced by the first moment of the superprocess. Those in total variation distance are based on a comparison of the cumulant semigroup of the superprocess with that of a continuous-state branching process. The results improve and extend considerably those of Friesen [Long-Time Behavior for Subcritical Measure-Valued Branching Processes with Immigration, arXiv:1903.05546, 2019] and Stannat [J. Funct.

The standard formulation of these principles involves two asymptotic (upper and lower) estimates for the logarithms of the probabilities that the normalized trajectory of the process lies in a given set $B$. We obtain conditions on a set $B$ such that these estimates coincide and the large deviation principles take the form of exact asymptotic equalities. Such LDPs are called exact. We show that the estimating interval of an ordinary LDP is contained in the estimating interval of the extended LDP. Hence the fulfillment of the exact extended LDP implies that of the exact ordinary LDP. The results obtained in the present paper are also fully valid and relevant for random walks (a special case of compound recovery processes).},

The resource allocation is performed on the basis of the aggregate utility maximization in accordance with the popular approach proposed by F. Kelly and coauthors in 1998. The problem is to construct a pricing mechanism for transmission rates in order to stimulate an optimal allocation of the available resources. In contrast to the usual approach, the proposed algorithm does not use the information on the aggregate traffic over each link. This algorithm&#39;s inputs are the total number $N$ of users, the link capacities, and optimal myopic reactions of randomly selected users to the current prices. The dynamic pricing scheme is based on the dual stochastic gradient projection method. For a special class of utility functions $u_i$, we obtain upper bounds for the constraint residuals and for the deviation of the objective function from the optimal value. These estimates are uniform in $N$ and of order $O(T^{-1/4})$ in the number $T$ of measured user reactions. We present the results of computer experiments for quadratic functions $u_i$, which are the differences between the linear utilities, which are individual for each user, and the quadratic penalty assigned by the network.},

Interruptions in service can mean either a complete shutdown of the server for a random period of time or a transition to a different (nonstandard) regime---they can occur either at the end of busy periods when the system is operating in the standard regime, or at the end of vacations at which the system contains no customers. We assume that there is a random timeout before a possible vacation and that the vacation occurs at the end of this timeout if no customers were received by the system during the timeout. Otherwise, the vacation is canceled and the system resumes standard operations. We consider three regimes with different conditions regarding the presence of timeouts and the rules for resuming the standard regime. Under fairly general assumptions concerning distributions of timeout times, we obtain durations of vacations, and processes describing the performance of the system during interruptions, formulas for the distribution, and expectation of the number of customers in the system in the stationary regime. Corresponding examples are given. For a number of special cases our results coincide with those available in the literature.},

The weak convergence of various transformations of trajectories of random flights with Poisson switching times was studied by Davydov and Konakov in [Random walks in nonhomogeneous Poisson environment, in Modern Problems of Stochastic Analysis and Statistics, Springer, 2017, pp. 3--24], who also built a diffusion approximation of the process of random flights. The goal of the present paper is to prove a stronger convergence with respect to the Kantorovich distance. Three types of transformations are considered. The cases of exponential and superexponential growth of the switching time transformation function are quite simple---in these cases the required result follows from the fact that the limit processes lie within the unit ball. In the case of a power-like growth of the transformation function, the convergence follows from combinatorial arguments and properties of the Kantorovich metric.},

This modification was concerned with the sums of absolute (respectively, difference) moments of order $2+\alpha$ for the distributions of the summands truncated at the unit level. It was shown that, when checking the normal convergence, it is sufficient, instead of checking the convergence to zero of the Lindeberg or Rotar&#39; characteristics for any $\varepsilon &gt;0$, to check that there exists an $\alpha &gt;0$ such that a characteristic (introduced in these papers) corresponding to this $\alpha$ converges to zero. Moreover, from the existence of such $\alpha$ it follows that the characteristic corresponding to any $\alpha &gt;0$ also tends to zero.

  abstract     = {We consider the family of converging max-continuous local submartingales starting from zero. An equivalence relation for processes of this family is introduced so that two processes are called equivalent if their joint laws of the terminal value and the maximum are the same. We single out a subfamily of processes of simple structure that have a unique (in the sense of the distribution) representative in each equivalence class. Next, using an extension of Monroe&#39;s theorem, we embed a process of this subfamily in a Brownian motion using a minimal time-change, and from this embedding construct a continuous local martingale from the same equivalence class. Moreover, it is found that whether a process from this family belongs to the class of uniformly integrable martingales depends only on its equivalence class. So, these results provide an alternative approach to the problems of characterization of the distribution of a continuous local martingale and its maximum, which were considered by L.C.G. Rogers and P. Vallois in the early 1990s.},

  abstract     = {We consider a subcritical branching process in an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random environment, where one immigrant arrives at each generation. We consider the event $\mathcal{A}_{i}(n)$ in which all individuals alive at time $n$ are descendants of the immigrant, who joined the population at time $i$, and investigate the asymptotic probability of this extreme event for $n\to \infty$ when $i$ is fixed, the difference $n-i$ is fixed, or $\min (i,n-i)\to \infty$. To deduce the desired asymptotics we establish some limit theorems for random walks conditioned to be nonnegative or negative on $[0,n]$.},

  abstract     = {The invariance principle for compound renewal processes is extended (in the sense of asymptotic equivalence) to the zone of moderately large and small deviations. It is assumed that the vector $(\tau,\zeta)$, which “governs” the process, satisfies certain moment conditions (for example, the Cramér condition), and its components $\tau$ and $\zeta$ are either independent or linearly dependent. This extension holds, in particular, for random walks.},
