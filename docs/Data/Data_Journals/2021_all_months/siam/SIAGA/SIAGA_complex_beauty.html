  abstract     = {We provide a complete taxonomic characterization of robust hierarchical clustering methods for directed networks following an axiomatic approach. We begin by introducing three practical properties associated with the notion of robustness in hierarchical clustering: linear scale preservation, stability, and excisiveness. Linear scale preservation enforces imperviousness to change in units of measure, whereas stability ensures that a bounded perturbation in the input network entails a bounded perturbation in the clustering output. Excisiveness refers to the local consistency of the clustering outcome. Algorithmically, excisiveness implies that we can reduce computational complexity by only clustering a subset of our data while theoretically guaranteeing that the same hierarchical outcome would be observed when clustering the whole dataset. In parallel to these three properties, we introduce the concept of representability, a generative model for describing clustering methods through the specification of their action on a collection of networks. Our main result is to leverage this generative model to give a precise characterization of all robust---i.e., excisive, linear scale preserving, and stable---hierarchical clustering methods for directed networks. We also address the implementation of our methods and describe an application to real data.},

Commonly, we compute the resultant as a quotient of determinants of matrices and we say that there exists a determinantal formula when we can express it as a determinant of a matrix whose elements are the coefficients of the input polynomials. We study the resultant in the context of mixed multilinear polynomial systems, that is, multilinear systems with polynomials having different supports, on which determinantal formulas were not known. We construct determinantal formulas for two kinds of multilinear systems related to the multiparameter eigenvalue problem (MEP): first, when the polynomials agree in all but one block of variables; second, when the polynomials are bilinear with different supports, related to a bipartite graph. We use the Weyman complex to construct Koszul-type determinantal formulas that generalize Sylvester-type formulas. We can use the matrices associated to these formulas to solve square systems without computing the resultant. The combination of the resultant matrices with the eigenvalue and eigenvector criterion for polynomial systems leads to a new approach for solving MEP.},

In this work, we focus on the trade-off among file size, device capacity, and the cost of repairing failing devices. We construct ERRCs with the same set of parameters as cascade codes.

As a consequence, we prove that the set of maximal minors of a matrix of indeterminates form an amoeba basis for the ideal they define, and we attain a new upper bound on the complex semidefinite extension complexity of polytopes, dependent only on their number of vertices and facets. We also highlight the connections between the notion of phaseless rank and the problem of finding large sets of complex equiangular lines or mutually unbiased bases.},

We show that if $m(n) = n$, then this statement holds for $n \leq 3$ and fails for all $n \geq 4$. In particular, the set of gross substitutes valuations on $n \geq 4$ items is strictly larger than the set of MBVs defined on the ground set $[n]$. Our proof uses matroid theory and discrete convex analysis to explicitly construct a large family of counter-examples. It indicates that merging and endowment by themselves are poor operations to generate gross substitutes valuations. We also connect the general MBV conjecture and related questions to longstanding open problems in matroid theory and conclude with open questions at the intersection of this field and economics.},

  abstract     = {Partitions of a set play an important role in automatic knowledge discovery algorithms that learn human-like concepts from human-like innate priors. One such type of prior is isometries, the recognition of which is considered a part of innate human cognitive ability. In this paper, we consider isometries of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and compute isometry-subgroup-induced partitions as orbit computations under various isometry-subgroup actions on $\mathbb{Z}^n$. For both computational (to avoid infinity) and practical (to consider an application domain) reasons, we restrict the set of orbits, i.e., a partition of $\mathbb{Z}^n$, to a finite subset, i.e., a partition of $Z \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^n$. However, not only is the orbit relation still defined on the entire $\mathbb{Z}^n$, but the algorithm has no control over $Z$ which is specified a priori by an application or a data set. Our main contribution is an efficient algorithm solving this restricted orbit-computation problem exactly, in the special case of atomically generated subgroups---a new notion motivated from building human-like artificial intelligence. Technically, the atomic property is key to preserving the semidirect-product structure---the core structure we leverage to make our algorithm outperform generic approaches. Besides algorithmic merit, our approach enables parallel-computing implementations in many subroutines, which can further benefit from hardware boosts. Moreover, our algorithm works efficiently for any finite subset $Z$ regardless of its shape or its location in $\mathbb{Z}^n$. Therefore, this algorithmic efficiency is application-independent.},

  abstract     = {An augmented metric space is a metric space $(X, d_X)$ equipped with a function $f_X: X \to \mathbb{R}$. This type of data arises commonly in practice, e.g., a point cloud $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^D$ where each point $x\in X$ has a density function value $f_X(x)$ associated to it. An augmented metric space $(X, d_X, f_X)$ naturally gives rise to a 2-parameter filtration $\mathcal{K}$. However, the resulting 2-parameter persistent homology ${H}_{\bullet}(\mathcal{K})$ could still be of wild representation type and may not have simple indecomposables. In this paper, motivated by the elder-rule for the zeroth homology of 1-parameter filtration, we propose a barcode-like summary, called the elder-rule-staircode, as a way to encode ${H}_0(\mathcal{K})$. Specifically, if $n = |X|$, the elder-rule-staircode consists of $n$ number of staircase-like blocks in the plane. We show that if ${H}_0(\mathcal{K})$ is interval decomposable, then the barcode of ${H}_0(\mathcal{K})$ is equal to the elder-rule-staircode. Furthermore, regardless of the interval decomposability, the fibered barcode, the dimension function (a.k.a. the Hilbert function), and the graded Betti numbers of ${H}_0(\mathcal{K})$ can all be efficiently computed once the elder-rule-staircode is given. Finally, we develop and implement an efficient algorithm to compute the elder-rule-staircode in $O(n^2\log n)$ time, which can be improved to $O(n^2\alpha(n))$ if $X$ is from a fixed dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^D$, where $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function.},

This seemingly novel problem arises in the study of global dynamics of gene regulatory networks in which case the poset is a Boolean lattice. We provide an algorithm for solving this problem using linear programming for arbitrary partial orders of linear polynomials. This algorithm exploits this additional algebraic structure inherited from the polynomials to efficiently compute the admissible linear extensions.

Its primary advantage is that there is no need for back-substitution, and the solving/hypothesis-testing phase can be parallelized.

As a consequence, we observe that almost sure boundedness of the log-likelihood function guarantees almost sure existence of an MLE, thereby proving a conjecture of Drton, Kuriki, and Hoff [Existence and Uniqueness of the Kronecker Covariance MLE, preprint, arXiv:2003.06024, 2020]. The main tools we use are from the theory of quiver representations, in particular, results of Kac, King, and Schofield on canonical decomposition and stability.},

We focus on Gaussian transformation families, which include matrix normal models and Gaussian graphical models given by transitive directed acyclic graphs.

We give a correspondence between structure in the higher-order cumulants and combinatorial structure in the causal graph. It has previously been shown that low rank of the covariance matrix corresponds to trek separation in the graph. Generalizing this criterion to multiple sets of vertices, we characterize when determinants of subtensors of the higher-order cumulant tensors vanish. This criterion applies when hidden variables are present as well. For instance, it allows us to identify the presence of a hidden common cause of $k$ of the observed variables.},

  abstract     = {A tetrahedral complex all of whose tetrahedra meet at a common vertex is called a vertex star. Vertex stars are a natural generalization of planar triangulations, and understanding splines on vertex stars is a crucial step to analyzing trivariate splines. It is particularly difficult to compute the dimension of splines on vertex stars in which the vertex is completely surrounded by tetrahedra---we call these closed vertex stars. A formula due to Alfeld, Neamtu, and Schumaker gives the dimension of $C^r$ splines on closed vertex stars of degree at least $3r+2$. We show that this formula is a lower bound on the dimension of $C^r$ splines of degree at least $(3r+2)/2$. Our proof uses apolarity and the so-called Waldschmidt constant of the set of points dual to the interior faces of the vertex star. We furthermore observe that arguments of Alfeld, Schumaker, and Whiteley imply that the only splines of degree at most $(3r+1)/2$ on a generic closed vertex star are global polynomials.},

We propose a framework for studying these codes as subspaces of the skew group algebra over the Galois group, and we relate this point of view with usual notions of vector rank-metric codes and matrix codes. We then adapt the notion of error-correcting pairs to this context, in order to provide a nontrivial decoding algorithm for these codes. We then focus on the case where the Galois group is abelian, which leads us to see codewords as elements of a multivariate skew polynomial ring. We prove that we can bound the dimension of the vector space of zeros of these polynomials, depending of their degree. This result can be seen as an analogue of the Alon--Füredi theorem---and by means of the Schwartz--Zippel lemma---in the rank metric. Finally, we construct the counterparts of Reed--Muller codes in the rank metric, and we give their parameters. We also show the connection between these codes and classical Reed--Muller codes in the case of a Kummer extension.},

  abstract     = {Semidefinite programming (SDP) is the task of optimizing a linear function over the common solution set of finitely many linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). For the running time of SDP solvers, the maximal matrix size of these LMIs is usually more critical than their number. The semidefinite extension degree ${sxdeg}(K)$ of a convex set $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is the smallest number $d$ such that $K$ is a linear image of a finite intersection $S_1\cap\dots\cap S_N$, where each $S_i$ is a spectrahedron defined by a linear matrix inequality of size $\le d$. Thus ${sxdeg}(K)$ can be seen as a measure for the complexity of performing semidefinite programs over the set $K$. We give several equivalent characterizations of ${sxdeg}(K)$ and use them to prove our main result: ${sxdeg}(K)\le2$ holds for any closed convex semialgebraic set $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$. In other words, such $K$ can be represented using the second-order cone.},
