  abstract     = {We develop a Metropolized Multiscale Forest Recombination Markov Chain on redistricting plans. The chain is designed to be usable as the proposal in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Sampling the space of plans amounts to dividing a graph into a partition with a specified number of elements each of which corresponds to a different district according to a specified probability measure. The districts satisfy a collection of hard constraints, and the probability measure may be weighted with regard to a number of other criteria. The multiscale algorithm is similar to our previously developed Metropolized Forest Recombination proposal; however, this algorithm provides improved scaling properties and may also be used to preserve nested communities of interest such as counties and precincts. Both works use a proposal which extends the ReCom algorithm [D. DeFord, M. Duchin, and J. Solomon, Harvard Data Sci. Rev., (2021)] which leveraged spanning trees to merge and split districts. In this work, we extend the state space so that each district is defined by a hierarchy of trees. In this sense, the proposal step in both algorithms can be seen as a “Forest ReCom.” The collection of plans sampled by the MCMC algorithm can serve as a baseline against which a particular plan of interest is compared. If a given plan has different racial or partisan qualities than what is typical of the collection of plans, the given plan may have been gerrymandered and is labeled as an outlier. Metropolizing relative to a policy driven probability measure removes the possibility of algorithmically inserted biases.},

  abstract     = {We study scattering by a high aspect ratio particle using boundary integral equation methods. This problem has important applications in nanophotonics problems, including sensing and plasmonic imaging. To illustrate the effect of parity and the need for adapted methods in the presence of high aspect ratio particles, we consider the scattering in two dimensions by a sound-hard, high aspect ratio ellipse. This fundamental problem highlights the main challenge and provides valuable insights to tackle plasmonic problems and general high aspect ratio particles. For this problem, we find that the boundary integral operator is nearly singular due to the collapsing geometry from an ellipse to a line segment. We show that this nearly singular behavior leads to qualitatively different asymptotic behaviors for solutions with different parities. Without explicitly taking this nearly singular behavior and this parity into account, computed solutions incur a large error. To address these challenges, we introduce a new method called quadrature by parity asymptotic expansions (QPAX) that effectively and efficiently addresses these issues. We first develop QPAX to solve the Dirichlet problem for Laplace&#39;s equation in a high aspect ratio ellipse. Then, we extend QPAX for scattering by a sound-hard, high aspect ratio ellipse. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QPAX through several numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {We study the band structure of self-adjoint elliptic operators $\mathbb{A}_g= -\nabla \cdot \sigma_{g} \nabla$, where $\sigma_g$ has the symmetries of a honeycomb tiling of $\mathbb{R}^2$. We focus on the case where $\sigma_{g}$ is a real-valued scalar: $\sigma_{g}=1$ within identical, disjoint “inclusions,” centered at vertices of a honeycomb lattice, and $\sigma_{g}=g\gg1 $ (high contrast) in the complement of the inclusion set (bulk). Such operators govern, e.g., transverse electric modes in photonic crystal media consisting of high dielectric constant inclusions (semiconductor pillars) within a homogeneous lower contrast bulk (air), a configuration used in many physical studies. Our approach, which is based on monotonicity properties of the associated energy form, extends to a class of high contrast elliptic operators that model heterogeneous and anisotropic honeycomb media. Our results concern the global behavior of dispersion surfaces and the existence of conical crossings (Dirac points) occurring in the lowest two energy bands as well as in bands arbitrarily high in the spectrum. Dirac points are the source of important phenomena in fundamental and applied physics, e.g., graphene and its artificial analogues, and topological insulators. The key hypotheses are the nonvanishing of the Dirac (Fermi) velocity $v_D(g)$, verified numerically, and a spectral isolation condition, verified analytically in many configurations. Asymptotic expansions, to any order in $g^{-1}$, of Dirac point eigenpairs and $v_D(g)$ are derived with error bounds. Our study illuminates differences between the high contrast behavior of $\mathbb{A}_g$ and the corresponding strong binding regime for Schrödinger operators.},

The second result is concerned with the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the evolution problem. In several cases, we prove that stable solutions attract the other solutions with an optimal exponential rate of convergence determined by the spectral gap of the linearized problem around the stable solutions.

A fine mesh is used to capture the heterogeneities of the coefficient field, and the equation is solved globally on a coarse mesh in the discontinuous Galerkin discretization setting. The main idea of the model reduction approach is to extract dominant modes in local spectral problems for representation of important features, construct multiscale basis functions in coarse oversampled regions by constraint energy minimization problems, and perform a Petrov--Galerkin projection and a symmetrization onto the coarse grid. The method is explicit in the sense that the time marching does not require inverting any matrix. Moreover, the method is energy conserving and exhibits both coarse-mesh and spectral convergence, provided that the oversampling size is appropriately chosen. We study the stability and convergence of our method. We also present numerical results on the Marmousi model in order to test the performance of the method and verify the theoretical results.},

However, established computational methodologies, like molecular dynamics, are still mostly constrained to closed systems and timescales too small to be relevant for life processes. Alternatively, particle-based reaction-diffusion models are currently the most accurate and computationally feasible approach at these scales. Their efficiency lies in modeling entire molecules as particles that can diffuse and interact with each other. In this work, we develop modeling and numerical schemes for particle-based reaction-diffusion in an open setting, where the reservoirs are mediated by reaction-diffusion PDEs. We derive two important theoretical results. The first one is the mean-field for open systems of diffusing particles; the second one is the mean-field for a particle-based reaction-diffusion system with second-order reactions. We employ these two results to develop a numerical scheme that consistently couples particle-based reaction-diffusion processes with reaction-diffusion PDEs. This allows modeling open biochemical systems in contact with reservoirs that are time-dependent and spatially inhomogeneous, as in many relevant real-world applications.},

When chemical species and reaction rates in a reaction system have different orders of magnitude, the associated stochastic system is often modeled in a multiscale regime. It is known that multiscale models can be approximated with a reduced system such as mean field dynamics or hybrid systems, but the accuracy of the approximation remains unknown. In this paper, we estimate the probability distribution of low copy species in multiscale stochastic reaction systems under a short timescale. We also establish an error bound for this approximation. Throughout the paper, typical mass-action systems are mainly handled, but we also show that the main theorem can be extended to general kinetics, which generalizes existing results in the literature. Our approach is based on a direct analysis of the Kolmogorov equation, in contrast to classical approaches in the existing literature.},

Unfortunately, no numerical tests are performed to show the efficiency of this multiscale approach. The LDDMM image registration framework is essentially a variational problem with differential equation constraints and the structure of the cost functional is very complex. Therefore, it&#39;s necessary and meaningful to introduce some other analogous multiscale approaches with a much simpler cost functional. Motivated by the work of Modin, Nachman, and Rondi, we construct a multiscale image registration approach for the two-dimensional diffeomorphic image registration model in [H. Han and Z. Wang, SIAM J. Imaging Sci., 13 (2020), pp. 1240--1271]. This approach achieves a smooth minimizer for the cost functional without regularization. This result is completely different from most published models which only achieve minimizers of the cost functional with some regularization. The existence of solutions for the multiscale approach and the convergence of the multiscale approach are proved. In addition, a multigrid based multiscale diffeomorphic image registration algorithm is presented. Moreover, numerical tests are also performed to show that the proposed multiscale approach achieves a satisfactory image registration result without mesh folding.},

  abstract     = {The “flexible boundary condition” method, introduced by Sinclair and coworkers in the 1970s, remains among the most popular methods for simulating isolated two-dimensional crystalline defects, embedded in an effectively infinite atomistic domain. In essence, the method can be characterized as a domain decomposition method which iterates between a local anharmonic and a global harmonic problem, where the latter is solved by means of the lattice Green function of the ideal crystal. This local/global splitting gives rise to tremendously improved convergence rates over related alternating Schwarz methods. In a previous publication [M. Hodapp, G. Anciaux, and W. Curtin, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg., 348 (2019), pp. 1039--1075], we have shown that this method also applies to large-scale three-dimensional problems, possibly involving hundreds of thousands of atoms, using fast summation techniques exploiting the low-rank nature of the asymptotic lattice Green function. Here, we generalize the Sinclair method to bounded domains and develop an implementation using a discrete boundary element method to correct the infinite solution with respect to a prescribed far-field condition, thus preserving the advantage of the original method of not requiring a global spatial discretization. Moreover, we present a detailed convergence analysis and show for a one-dimensional problem that the method is unconditionally stable under physically motivated assumptions. To further improve the convergence behavior, we develop an acceleration technique based on a relaxation of the transmission conditions between the two subproblems. Numerical examples for linear and nonlinear problems are presented to validate the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel weak formulation and discretization for discovering governing equations from noisy measurement data. This method of learning differential equations from data fits into a new class of algorithms that replace pointwise derivative approximations with linear transformations and variance reduction techniques. Compared to the standard SINDy algorithm presented in [S. L. Brunton, J. L. Proctor, and J. N. Kutz, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 113 (2016), pp. 3932--3937], our so-called weak SINDy (WSINDy) algorithm allows for reliable model identification from data with large noise (often with ratios greater than 0.1) and reduces the error in the recovered coefficients to enable accurate prediction. Moreover, the coefficient error scales linearly with the noise level, leading to high-accuracy recovery in the low-noise regime. Altogether, WSINDy combines the simplicity and efficiency of the SINDy algorithm with the natural noise reduction of integration, as demonstrated in [H. Schaeffer and S. G. McCalla, Phys. Rev. E, 96 (2017), 023302], to arrive at a robust and accurate method of sparse recovery.},

  abstract     = {We study the propagation of sound waves in a three-dimensional, infinite ambient flow with weak random fluctuations of the mean particle velocity and speed of sound. We more particularly address the regime where the acoustic wavelengths are comparable to the correlation lengths of the weak inhomogeneities---the so-called weak coupling limit. The analysis is carried on starting from the linearized Euler equations and the convected wave equation with variable density and speed of sound, which can be derived from the nonlinear Euler equations. We use a multiscale expansion of the Wigner distribution of a velocity potential associated to the waves to derive a radiative transfer equation describing the evolution of the angularly resolved wave action in space/time phase space. The latter experiences convection, refraction, and scattering when it propagates through the heterogeneous ambient flow, although the overall wave action is conserved. The convection and refraction phenomena are accounted for by the convective part of the transport equation and depend on the smooth variations of the ambient quantities. The scattering phenomenon is accounted for by the collisional part of the transport equation and depends on the cross-power spectral densities of the fluctuations of the ambient quantities at the wavelength scales. The refraction, phase shift, spectral broadening, and multiple scattering effects of the high-frequency regimes described in various previous publications are thus encompassed by the proposed model. The overall derivation is based on the interpretation of spatial-temporal Wigner transforms in terms of semiclassical operators in their standard quantization.},

Of particular interest is to identify optimal arrangements of small absorbing traps that minimize the average MFPT. Although the MFPT, and the associated optimal trap arrangement problem, has been well-studied for disk-shaped domains, there are very few analytical or numerical results available for general star-shaped domains or for thin domains with large aspect ratio. Analytical progress is challenging owing to the need to determine the Neumann Green&#39;s function for the Laplacian, while the numerical challenge results from a lack of easy-to-use and fast numerical tools for first computing the MFPT and then optimizing over a class of trap configurations. In this direction, and for the stationary trap problem, we develop a simple embedded numerical method, based on the closest point method (CPM), to perform MFPT simulations on elliptical and star-shaped domains. For periodic mobile trap problems, we develop a robust CPM to compute the average MFPT. Optimal trap arrangements are identified numerically through either a refined discrete sampling approach or from a particle-swarm optimization procedure. To confirm some of the numerical findings, novel perturbation approaches are developed to approximate the average MFPT and identify optimal trap configurations for a class of near-disk confining domains or for an arbitrary thin domain of large aspect ratio.},

  abstract     = {The computation of free energies is a common issue in statistical physics. A natural technique to compute such high-dimensional integrals is to resort to Monte Carlo simulations. However, these techniques generally suffer from a high variance in the low temperature regime, because the expectation is often dominated by high values corresponding to rare system trajectories. A standard way to reduce the variance of the estimator is to modify the drift of the dynamics with a control enhancing the probability of rare events, leading to so-called importance sampling estimators. In theory, the optimal control leads to a zero-variance estimator; it is, however, defined implicitly and computing it is of the same difficulty as the original problem. We propose here a general strategy to build approximate optimal controls in the small temperature limit for diffusion processes, with the first goal to reduce the variance of free energy Monte Carlo estimators. Our construction builds upon low noise asymptotics by expanding the optimal control around the instanton, which is the path describing most likely fluctuations at low temperature. This technique not only helps reducing variance, but it is also interesting as a theoretical tool since it differs from usual small temperature expansions (WKB ansatz). As a complementary consequence of our expansion, we provide a perturbative formula for computing the free energy in the small temperature regime, which refines the now standard Freidlin--Wentzell asymptotics. We compute this expansion explicitly for lower orders, and explain how our strategy can be extended to an arbitrary order of accuracy. We support our findings with illustrative numerical examples.},

While homogenization models for electromagnetic heating have been around for decades, these approaches break down when the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is comparable to the characteristic microscale length. Here we derive from Maxwell&#39;s equations and the energy equation effective equations for a binary composite in the case where the characteristic microscale length and wavelength are comparable. Under the assumption of small loss factors in the materials, high-frequency homogenization results in a locally temperature dependent elliptic problem for the field amplitude via Floquet--Bloch theory. The length scale for thermal transport is the macroscale, and classical homogenization applies. We characterize the results in terms of a complex wavenumber for propagation, and validate our results for a lamellar structure for which an exact solution exists under isothermal conditions, and characterize field strength needed to achieve thermal runaway in the composite as a function of the resonant frequency and volume fraction of the lossless material.},

When $0 &lt; \varepsilon \ll 1$, the problem is equivalent to the long-time dynamics of the NKGE with small initial data (and $O(1)$ cubic nonlinearity), while the amplitude of the initial data (and the solution) is at $O(\varepsilon)$. For the long-time dynamics of the NKGE up to the time at $O(1/\varepsilon^{2})$, the resolution and error bounds of classical numerical methods depend significantly on the small parameter $\varepsilon$, which causes severe numerical burdens as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$. The EWI-FP method is fully explicit, symmetric in time, and has many superior properties in solving wave equations. By adapting the energy method combined with the method of mathematical induction, we rigorously carry out uniform error bounds of the EWI-FP discretization at $O(h^{m_0} + \varepsilon^{2-\beta}\tau^2)$ up to the time at $O(1/\varepsilon^{\beta})$ with $0 \leq \beta \leq 2$, mesh size $h$, time step $\tau$ and $m_0$ an integer depending on the regularity of the solution. By a rescaling in time, our results are straightforwardly extended to those error bounds and $\varepsilon$-scalability (or meshing strategy requirement) of the EWI-FP method for an oscillatory NKGE, whose solution propagates waves with wavelength at $O(1)$ and $O(\varepsilon^{\beta})$ in space and time, respectively, and wave speed at $O(\varepsilon^{-\beta})$.

Instead of solving a convection-diffusion type cell problem in the Eulerian formulation (arising from homogenization theory for parabolic equations), we compute the motion of particles in the Lagrangian formulation, which is modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A robust numerical integrator based on a splitting method was proposed to solve the SDEs and rigorous error analysis for the numerical integrator was provided using the backward error analysis technique in our previous work. However, the upper bound on the error estimate is not sharp. To improve our result, we propose a new and uniform in time error analysis for the numerical integrator that allows us to get rid of the exponential growth factor in our previous error estimate. Our new error analysis is based on a probabilistic approach, which interprets the solution process generated by our numerical integrator as a Markov process. By exploring the ergodicity of the solution process, we prove the convergence analysis of our method in computing effective diffusivity over infinite time. We present numerical results to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method in computing effective diffusivity for several chaotic flows, especially the Arnold--Beltrami--Childress flow and Kolmogorov flow in three-dimensional space.},

  abstract     = {We study the multiscale description of large-time collective behavior of agents driven by alignment. The resulting multiflock dynamics arises naturally with realistic initial configurations consisting of multiple spatial scaling, which in turn peak at different time scales. We derive a “master-equation” which describes a complex multiflock congregations governed by two ingredients: (i) a fast inner-flock communication; and (ii) a slow(-er) interflock communication. The latter is driven by macroscopic observables which feature the up-scaling of the problem. We extend the current monoflock theory, proving a series of results which describe rates of multiflocking with natural dependencies on communication strengths. Both agent-based, kinetic, and hydrodynamic descriptions are considered, with particular emphasis placed on the discrete and macroscopic descriptions.},

  abstract     = {We study the time-domain acoustic scattering problem by a cluster of small holes (i.e., sound-soft obstacles). Based on the retarded boundary integral equation method, we derive the asymptotic expansion of the scattered field as the size of the holes goes to zero. Under certain geometrical constraints on the size and the minimum distance between the holes, we show that the scattered field is approximated by a linear combination of point-sources where the weights are given by the capacitance of each hole and the causal signals (of these point-sources) can be computed by solving a retarded in time linear algebraic system. A rigorous justification of the asymptotic expansion and the unique solvability of the linear algebraic system is shown under natural conditions on the cluster of holes. As an application of the asymptotic expansion, we derive, in the limit case when the holes are densely distributed and occupy a bounded domain, the equivalent effective acoustic medium (an equivalent mass density characterized by the capacitance of the holes) that generates, approximately, the same scattered field as the cluster of holes. Conversely, given a locally variable, smooth, and positive mass density, satisfying a certain subharmonicity condition, we can design a perforated material with holes, having appropriate capacitances, that generates approximately the same acoustic field as the acoustic medium modeled by the given mass density (and constant speed of propagation). Finally, we numerically verify the asymptotic expansions by comparing the asymptotic approximations with the numerical solutions of the scattered fields via the finite element method.},

In this work kernel analog forecasting methods are studied from the perspective of data generated by multiscale dynamical systems. The problems chosen exhibit a variety of different Markovian closures, using both averaging and homogenization; furthermore, settings where scale separation is not present and the predicted variables are non-Markovian are also considered.

One of the main results is that we prove that the proposed multiscale method achieves nearly exponential convergence in the approximation error with respect to the computational degrees of freedom. Our strategy is to perform an energy orthogonal decomposition of the solution space into a coarse scale component comprising $a$-harmonic functions in each element of the mesh, and a fine scale component named the bubble part that can be computed locally and efficiently. The coarse scale component depends entirely on function values on edges. Our approximation on each edge is made in the Lions--Magenes space $H_{00}^{1/2}(e)$, which we will demonstrate to be a natural and powerful choice. We construct edge basis functions using local oversampling and singular value decomposition. When local information of the right-hand side is adaptively incorporated into the edge basis functions, we prove a nearly exponential convergence rate of the approximation error. Numerical experiments validate and extend our theoretical analysis; in particular, we observe no obvious degradation in accuracy for high-contrast media problems.},

Especially, we prove the existence of conically degenerate points, i.e., Dirac points, at which two dispersion band functions intersect. We then investigate the dynamics of wave packets spectrally localized at a Dirac point and derive the leading effective envelope equation. It turns out the envelope can be described by a nonlinear Dirac equation with a varying mass. With rigorous error estimates, we demonstrate that the asymptotic solution based on the effective envelope equation approximates the true solution well in the weighted-$H^s$ space.},

A key feature of this system is that the new PDE describing the evolution of the polarization current is only defined in the domain of metallic nanostructures. We first extend the equation satisfied by the polarization current into the domain of the dielectric medium in a novel way. The well-posedness of the original system and the extended system are proved and the extension error between these two systems is analyzed rigorously with an exact transparent boundary condition. Next we apply the asymptotic homogenization method to derive the homogenized system and define the multiscale approximate solution for the extended system. Under realistic assumptions, we prove that the homogenized polarization current is negligible and that the homogenized coupled system can be replaced by the homogenized Maxwell&#39;s equations with guaranteed accuracy to reduce the computational cost. Finally, to recover the spatial nonlocal effects, the original system is solved in each isolated metallic nanostructure with boundary conditions given by the multiscale approximate solution. Numerical examples demonstrate that our multiscale approach is capable of yielding accurate results with significant computational savings compared to solving the original system directly.},

The direct computation of the infinitesimal generator is not easy because of the discretization of the state space, in particular because of the trade-off inherent in the choice of the best lag time to study the process. Short lag times implies a strong discretization of the state space and a consequent loss of Markovianity. Large lag times bypass events on fast timescales. We propose a method to approximate the generator with the computation of the Newton polynomial extrapolation. This technique is a multistep approach which uses as its input Koopman transfer operators evaluated for a series of lag times. Thus, the estimated infinitesimal generator combines information from different time resolutions and does not bias only fast- or slow-decaying dynamics. We show that the multi-scale Newton method can improve the estimation of the generator in comparison to the computation using finite difference or matrix logarithm methods.},

Interface conditions available in the literature have several weak points: most of them are suitable only for flows parallel to the fluid-porous interface, some are restricted to specific boundary value problems, and others contain unknown model parameters which still need to be determined. These facts severely restrict the variety of applications that can be successfully modeled. We propose new interface conditions which are valid for arbitrary flow directions. These coupling conditions are rigorously derived using the theory of homogenization and boundary layers. All effective parameters appearing in these conditions are computed numerically based on the geometrical configuration of the coupled system. The developed conditions are validated by the comparison of numerical simulation results for the coupled Stokes--Darcy model and the pore-scale resolved model.

For covariance functions that are Green&#39;s functions of elliptic boundary value problems and homogeneously distributed sampling points, we show how to identify a subset $S \subset { 1 , \dots , N }^2$, with $\# S = \mathcal{O} ( N \log (N) \log^{d} ( N /\epsilon ) )$, such that the zero fill-in incomplete Cholesky factorization of the sparse matrix $\Theta_{ij} \mathbf{1}_{( i, j ) \in S}$ is an $\epsilon$-approximation of $\Theta$. This factorization can provably be obtained in complexity $\mathcal{O} ( N \log( N ) \log^{d}( N /\epsilon) )$ in space and $\mathcal{O} ( N \log^{2}( N ) \log^{2d}( N /\epsilon) )$ in time, improving upon the state of the art for general elliptic operators; we further present numerical evidence that $d$ can be taken to be the intrinsic dimension of the data set rather than that of the ambient space. The algorithm only needs to know the spatial configuration of the $x_{i}$ and does not require an analytic representation of $G$. Furthermore, this factorization straightforwardly provides an approximate sparse PCA with optimal rate of convergence in the operator norm. Hence, by using only subsampling and the incomplete Cholesky factorization, we obtain, at nearly linear complexity, the compression, inversion, and approximate PCA of a large class of covariance matrices. By inverting the order of the Cholesky factorization we also obtain a solver for elliptic PDE with complexity $\mathcal{O} ( N \log^{d}( N /\epsilon) )$ in space and $\mathcal{O} ( N \log^{2d}( N /\epsilon) )$ in time, improving upon the state of the art for general elliptic operators.},

  abstract     = {We develop an asymptotic analysis of target fluxes in the three-dimensional (3D) narrow capture problem. The latter concerns a diffusive search process in which the targets are much smaller than the size of the search domain. The small target assumption allows us to use matched asymptotic expansions and Green&#39;s functions to solve the diffusion equation in Laplace space. In particular, we derive an asymptotic expansion of the Laplace transformed flux into each target in powers of the nondimensionalized target size $\epsilon$. One major advantage of working directly with fluxes is that one can generate statistical quantities, such as splitting probabilities and conditional first passage time moments, without having to solve a separate boundary value problem in each case. However, in order to derive asymptotic expansions of these quantities, it is necessary to eliminate Green&#39;s function singularities that arise in the limit $s\rightarrow 0$, where $s$ is the Laplace variable. We achieve this by considering a triple expansion in $\epsilon$, $s$, and $\Lambda\sim \epsilon /s$. This allows us to perform partial summations over infinite power series in $\Lambda$, which leads to multiplicative factors of the form $\Lambda^n/(1+\Lambda)^n $. Since $\Lambda^n/(1+\Lambda)^n \rightarrow 1$ as $s\rightarrow 0$, the singularities in $s$ are eliminated. We then show how corresponding asymptotic expansions of the splitting probabilities and conditional mean first passage times (MFPTs) can be derived in the small-$s$ limit. The resulting expressions agree with previous asymptotic expansions derived by solving a separate boundary value problem for each statistical quantity, although each expansion was only carried out to second order in the expansions. Here we also determine the third order contributions, which are $O(\epsilon^2)$ and $O(\epsilon)$ in the cases of the splitting probabilities and conditional (MFPTs), respectively. Finally, we illustrate the theory by considering a pair of targets in a spherical search domain, for which the Green&#39;s functions can be calculated explicitly.},

The resulting macroscopic model is now a generic second order model (GSOM), which contains in turn a control term inherited from the microscopic interactions. We show that such a control may be chosen so as to optimize global traffic trends, such as the vehicle flux or the road congestion, constrained by the GSOM dynamics. By means of numerical simulations, we investigate the effect of this control hierarchy in some specific case studies, which exemplify the multiscale path from the vehiclewise implementation of a driver-assist control to its optimal hydrodynamic design.},

It is the purpose of this paper to provide a rigorous mathematical setting for Mandel&#39;s problem and for the corresponding Mandel--Cryer effect. We first formulate nonstandard linear parabolic problems for the volume strain and the fluid pressure. These problems admit “explicit” solutions in terms of Fourier series. Introducing the abstract variational parabolic formulation with appropriate spaces, the Fourier series are shown to converge strongly. The main result is the mathematical proof of the Mandel--Cryer effect. Here we use the Laplace transform applied to the pressure equation. We write the transformed pressure in such a way, that a Tauberian type of result applies to its time derivative. From this the Mandel--Cryer effect is immediate.},

To treat the implicit part, we propose a variational approach by viewing it as a Wasserstein gradient flow of the relative entropy, and solve it via a proximal quasi-Newton method. In so doing we get positivity and asymptotic preservation for free. The method is also massively parallelizable and thus suitable for high dimensional problems. We further show that the convergence of our implicit solver is uniform across different scales.

The macro states are represented by the membership functions and may be overlapping. The magnitude of this overlap is a measure for the strength of the rebinding effect, caused by the projection and stabilizing the system. A minimal bound for the rebinding effect included in a given system is computed as the solution of an optimization problem.

We prove that with a simple stochastic model, interfacial and relaxation terms are equivalent to the evaluation of an integral, which cannot be explicitly computed in general. However, in different particular cases matching with a large range of applications (topology of the bubbles/droplets, or special flow regime conditions), the interfacial and relaxation parameters can be explicitly computed, leading to different models that are either nonlinear versions or slight modifications of previously proposed models. The validity domains of previously proposed models are clarified, and some modeling parameters of the averaged system are linked with the local topology of the flow.

  abstract     = {In scientific machine learning, regression networks have been recently applied to approximate solution maps (e.g., the potential-ground state map of the Schrödinger equation). In this paper, we aim to reduce the generalization error without spending more time on generating training samples. However, to reduce the generalization error, the regression network needs to be fit on a large number of training samples (e.g., a collection of potential-ground state pairs). The training samples can be produced by running numerical solvers, which takes significant time in many applications. In this paper, we aim to reduce the generalization error without spending more time on generating training samples. Inspired by few-shot learning techniques, we develop the multilevel fine-tuning algorithm by introducing levels of training: we first train the regression network on samples generated at the coarsest grid and then successively fine-tune the network on samples generated at finer grids. Within the same amount of time, numerical solvers generate more samples on coarse grids than on fine grids. We demonstrate a significant reduction of generalization error in numerical experiments on challenging problems with oscillations, discontinuities, or rough coefficients. Further analysis can be conducted in the neural tangent kernel regime, and we provide practical estimators to the generalization error. The number of training samples at different levels can be optimized for the smallest estimated generalization error under the constraint of budget for training data. The optimized distribution of budget over levels provides practical guidance with theoretical insight as in the celebrated multilevel Monte Carlo algorithm.},

In this work, we derive a numerically tractable micro-macro model including coupled generalized Darcy&#39;s laws that still includes the microscale dynamics which are responsible, e.g., for hysteresis effects. For this purpose, we extend the two-scale expansion approach of periodic homogenization to include different time scales which allows us to start from a fully instationary Navier--Stokes--Cahn--Hilliard model at the pore scale as microscale. Identifying and separating the time scales allows us to derive local fast scale equations describing the microscale dynamics and global slow-scale equations giving rise to the macroscopic Darcy law.},

  abstract     = {Discrete-state continuous-time Markov processes are an important class of models employed broadly across the sciences. When the system size becomes large, standard approaches can become intractable to exact solution and numerical simulation. Approximations posed on a continuous state space are often more tractable and are presumed to converge in the limit as the system size tends to infinity. For example, an expansion of the master equation truncated at second order yields the Fokker--Planck equation, a widely used continuum approximation equipped with an underlying process of continuous state. Surprisingly, in [C. R. Doering, K. V. Sargsyan, and L. M. Sander, Multiscale Model. Simul., 3 (2005), pp. 283--299] it is shown that the Fokker--Planck approximation may exhibit exponentially large errors, even in the infinite system-size limit. Crucially, the source of this inaccuracy has not been addressed. In this paper, we focus on the family of continuous-state approximations obtained by arbitrary-order truncations. We uncover how the exponentially large error stems from the truncation by quantifying the rapid error decay with increasing truncation order. Furthermore, we explain why this discrepancy only comes to light in a subset of problems. The approximations produced by finite truncation beyond second order lack underlying stochastic processes. Nevertheless, they retain valuable information that explains the previously observed discrepancy by bridging the gap between the continuous and discrete processes. The insight conferred by this broader notion of “continuum approximation,” where we do not require an underlying stochastic process, prompts us to revisit previously expressed doubts regarding continuum approximations. In establishing the utility of higher-order truncations, this approach also contributes to the extensive discussion in the literature regarding the second-order truncation: while recognizing the appealing features of an associated stochastic process, in certain cases it may be advantageous to dispense of the process in exchange for the increased approximation accuracy guaranteed by higher-order truncations.},

Most methods for applying TPT involve the construction of a Markov state model on a discretization of state space that approximates the underlying diffusion process. However, the assumption of Markovianity is difficult to verify in practice, and there are to date no known error bounds or convergence results for these methods. We propose a Monte Carlo method for approximating the forward committor, probability current, and streamlines from TPT for diffusion processes. Our method uses only sample trajectory data and partitions of state space based on Voronoi tessellations. It does not require the construction of a Markovian approximating process. We rigorously prove error bounds for the approximate TPT objects and use these bounds to show convergence to their exact counterparts in the limit of arbitrarily fine discretization. We illustrate some features of our method by application to a process that solves the Smoluchowski equation on a triple-well potential.},

  abstract     = {In this work, cascading transmission line failures are studied through a dynamical model of the power system operating under fixed conditions. The power grid is modeled as a stochastic dynamical system where first-principles electromechanical dynamics are excited by small Gaussian disturbances in demand and generation around a specified operating point. In this context, a single line failure is interpreted in a large deviation context as a first escape event across a surface in phase space defined by line security constraints. The resulting system of stochastic differential equations admits a transverse decomposition of the drift, which leads to considerable simplification in evaluating the quasipotential (rate function) and, consequently, computation of exit rates. Tractable expressions for the rate of transmission line failure in a restricted network are derived from large deviation theory arguments and validated against numerical simulations. Extensions to realistic settings are considered, and individual line failure models are aggregated into a Markov model of cascading failure inspired by chemical kinetics. Cascades are generated by traversing a graph composed of weighted edges representing transitions to degraded network topologies. Numerical results indicate that the Markov model can produce cascades with qualitative power law properties similar to those observed in empirical cascades.},

Then we propose numerical schemes that are uniformly accurate with respect to the scaling parameter. We show that these schemes converge to some limiting schemes which are consistent with the limiting macroscopic or kinetic system.

The model considers two spherical molecules, each with an arbitrary number of small binding sites on their surface, and the two molecules bind if and only if their binding sites come into contact (such molecules are often called “patchy particles” in the biochemistry literature). The molecules undergo translational and rotational diffusion, and the binding sites are allowed to diffuse on their surfaces. Mathematically, the model takes the form of a high-dimensional, anisotropic diffusion equation with mixed boundary conditions. We apply matched asymptotic analysis to derive the bimolecular binding rate in the limit of small, well-separated binding sites. The resulting binding rate formula involves a factor that depends on the electrostatic capacitance of a certain four-dimensional region embedded in five dimensions. We compute this factor numerically by modifying a recent kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm. We then apply a quasi chemical formalism to obtain a simple analytical approximation for this factor and find a binding rate formula that includes the effects of binding site competition/saturation.

  abstract     = {Characterizing the importances (i.e., centralities) of nodes in social, biological, and technological networks is a core topic in both network analysis and data science. We present a linear-algebraic framework that generalizes eigenvector-based centralities, including PageRank and hub/authority scores, to provide a common framework for two popular classes of multilayer networks: multiplex networks (which have layers that encode different types of relationships) and temporal networks (in which relationships change over time). Our approach involves the study of joint, marginal, and conditional “supracentralities” that one can calculate from the dominant eigenvector of a supracentrality matrix [Taylor et al., Multiscale Model. Simul., 15 (2017), pp. 537--574; [110] in this paper], which couples centrality matrices that are associated with individual network layers. We extend this prior work (which was restricted to temporal networks with layers that are coupled by adjacent-in-time coupling) by allowing the layers to be coupled through a (possibly asymmetric) interlayer-adjacency matrix $\tilde{\bm{A}}$, where the entry $\tilde{A}_{tt&#39;} \geq 0$ encodes the coupling between layers $t$ and $t&#39;$. Our framework provides a unifying foundation for centrality analysis of multiplex and temporal networks, and it also illustrates a complicated dependency of the supracentralities on the topology and weights of interlayer coupling. By scaling $\tilde{\bm{A}}$ by an interlayer-coupling strength $\omega\ge0$ and developing a singular perturbation theory for the limits of weak ($\omega\to0^+$) and strong ($\omega\to\infty$) coupling, we also reveal an interesting dependence of supracentralities on the right and left dominant eigenvectors of $\tilde{\bm{A}}$. We provide additional theoretical and practical insights by applying our framework to two empirical data sets: a multiplex network of airline transportation in Europe and a temporal network that encodes the graduation and hiring of mathematical scientists at United States universities.},

In the case of molecules moving over the 3D surface, such as proteins on walls of bacteria cell, a large portion of the 3D surface is not observed in two-dimensional (2D)-time microscopy. It follows that biomolecules may disappear for a period of time in a region of interest, and then reappear later. Assuming Brownian motion with drift, we address the mathematical problem of the reconstruction of biomolecules trajectories on a cylindrical surface. A subregion of the cylinder is typically recorded during the observation period, and biomolecules may appear or disappear in any place of the 3D surface.

Using the properties of generalized functions, we derive governing equations for the unknown asymptotics of the ansatz including the travel time functions and dyadic coefficients. In order to derive the initial data of the unknowns at the point source, we further propose a condition for matching Hadamard&#39;s ansatz with the homogeneous-medium fundamental solution at the point source. To treat singularity of dyadic coefficients at the source, we then introduce smoother dyadic coefficients. Directly taking the Fourier transform of Hadamard&#39;s ansatz in time, we obtain a new ansatz, dubbed Hadamard--Babich ansatz, for the frequency-domain point-source elastic wave equations. To verify the feasibility of the new ansatz, we truncate the ansatz to keep only the first two terms, and we further develop partial-differential-equation--based Eulerian approaches to compute the resulting asymptotic solutions.

The well-posedness of the direct source scattering problem is established, and the regularity of the electromagnetic field is given. For the inverse source scattering problem, the microcorrelation strength matrix of the covariance operator is shown to be uniquely determined by the high frequency limit of the expectation of the electric field measured in an open bounded domain disjoint with the support of the source. In particular, we show that the diagonal entries of the strength matrix can be uniquely determined by only using the amplitude of the electric field. Moreover, this result is extended to the almost surely sense by deducing an ergodic relation for the electric field over the frequencies.},

However, it requires less memory and yields a faster computational time than a uniform DG discretization. In addition, the underlying splitting allows naturally for hybridization in both space and angle.
