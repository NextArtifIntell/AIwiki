  abstract     = {The FitzHugh--Nagumo system has been studied extensively for several decades. It has been shown numerically that pulses are generated to propagate and then some of the pulses are annihilated after collision. For the mathematical understanding of these complicated dynamics, we investigate the global dynamics of a one-dimensional free boundary problem in the singular limit of a FitzHugh--Nagumo type reaction-diffusion system. By introducing the notion of symbolic dynamics, we show that the asymptotic behaviors of solutions are classified into three categories: (i) the solution converges uniformly to the resting state; (ii) the solution converges to a series of traveling pulses propagating in either the same direction or both directions; and (iii) the solution converges to a propagating wave consisting of multiple traveling pulses and two traveling fronts propagating in both directions.},

However, its stability analysis is more difficult than the case of the Bloch domain wall, which still remains open when the spatial dimension is greater than one. In this paper, we are interested in the Walker domain-wall configuration in ferromagnetic thin-film material, where the magnetization of the thin film is described by the two-dimensional Landau--Lifshitz equation with an external magnetic field and a simplified demagnetizing field. We prove the stability of the Walker domain wall for the two-dimensional Landau--Lifshitz equation. To achieve this, we introduce a one-dimensional uniaxial traveling wave solution of the Landau--Lifshitz equation, which generates a moving frame. Taking a high-dimensional perturbation under this frame, we get an equivalent quasilinear differential system. However, the linear operator of its linearized equations admits zero as a simple eigenvalue. Furthermore, we introduce another coordinate frame to obtain a new equivalent system. Then the variational estimation technique can be used effectively for the new system.},

Then we obtain the asymptotic behavior of the basic reproduction ratio as the diffusion coefficients go to zero and infinity, respectively. We also investigate the limiting behavior of a positive periodic solution for periodic and cooperative reaction-diffusion systems with the Neumann boundary condition when the diffusion coefficients are large enough.

The key feature of this work is the surprising discovery that quasi-positive systems that satisfy an intermediate sum condition automatically give rise to a new class of $L^p$-energy type functionals that allow us to obtain requisite uniform a priori bounds. Our methods are sufficiently robust to extend to different boundary conditions, or to certain quasi-linear systems. We also show that in the case of mass dissipation, the solution is bounded in sup-norm uniformly in time. We illustrate the applicability of results by showing global existence and large time behavior of models arising from a spatio-temporal spread of infectious disease.},

Our motivation for proving this result is that (a) the finite-element method for computing approximations to solutions of the Helmholtz equation is based on the standard variational formulation, and (b) the location of eigenvalues, and especially near-zero ones, plays a key role in understanding how iterative solvers such as the generalized minimum residual method (GMRES) behave when used to solve linear systems, in particular those arising from the finite-element method. The result proved in this paper is thus the first step towards rigorously understanding how GMRES behaves when applied to discretizations of high-frequency Helmholtz problems under strong trapping (the subject of the companion paper [P.

A rigorous analysis of this algorithm for dissipative partial differential equations was first provided by Azouani, Olson, and Titi [J. Nonlinear Sci., 24 (2014), pp. 277--304] in the context of the two-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations. In that analysis, as also in each of the subsequent ones of other dissipative systems including the 3D Boussinesq system with a large Prandtl number, the primitive equations of the ocean and atmosphere, and several $\alpha$-models of turbulence, a crucial role is played by the known uniform ${\mathbb H}^1$-norm bound of the absorbing ball (i.e., an eventual ${\mathbb H}^1$-norm bound on a solution of each of these systems). However, in the 3D case, even for a globally regular solution, no such (eventual) uniform ${\mathbb H}^1$-norm bound is known. The starting point of our analysis is a Leray--Hopf weak solution, satisfying a certain condition based on observations, which subsequent work has shown to imply eventual regularity (and regularity in case the solution is on the weak attractor). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such rigorous analysis of the Azouani--Olson--Titi data assimilation algorithm for the 3D NSE for which an a priori eventual uniform ${\mathbb H}^1$-norm bound is unknown, even if the solution is regular.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we prove global existence of classical solutions to the incompressible isotropic Hookean elastodynamics in three-dimensional thin domain $\Omega_\delta=\mathbb{R}^2\times [0,\delta]$ with periodic boundary condition. This system essentially consists of two-dimensional quasilinear wave-type equations. Following the classical vector field theory and the generalized energy method of Klainerman, we introduce the anisotropic weighted Sobolev-type inequalities, the anisotropic generalized energy, and the anisotropic weighted $L^2$ norm adapted to the thin domain. The main issue in the anisotropic generalized energy estimate is that the pressure gradient brings an extra singular $\delta^{-1}$ factor arising from the $\partial^2_3$ derivative. Based on the inherent cancellation structure, we introduce an auxiliary anisotropic generalized energy to overcome this difficulty. The ghost weight technique introduced by Alinhac [Invent. Math., 145 (2001), pp. 597--618] and the strong null condition introduced by Lei [Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 69 (2016), pp. 2072--2106] play important roles for temporal decay estimates.},

For one spatial dimension with certain assumptions on the interaction potential, the diffusion index $m$, and the initial data, we prove the convergence to the unique steady state as time goes to infinity (equilibration), with an explicit algebraic rate. The proof is based on a uniform-in-time bound on the first moment of the density distribution, combined with an energy dissipation rate estimate. This is the first result on the equilibration of aggregation-diffusion equations for a general class of weakly confining potentials $W(r)$: those satisfying $\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty}W(r)&lt;\infty$.},

Adjacent layers meet at free interface regions, and the top layer is bounded above by a free boundary as well. A uniform gravitational field, normal to the rigid bottom, acts on the fluid. We assume that the fluid mass densities are strictly decreasing from bottom to top and consider the cases with and without surface tension acting on the free surfaces. In addition to these gravity-capillary effects, we allow a force to act on the bulk and external stress tensors to act on the free interface regions. Both of these additional forces are posited to be in traveling wave form: time-independent when viewed in a coordinate system moving at a constant, nontrivial velocity parallel to the lower rigid boundary. Without surface tension in the case of two dimensional fluids and with all positive surface tensions in the higher dimensional cases, we prove that for each sufficiently small force and stress tuple there exists a traveling wave solution. The existence of traveling wave solutions to the one layer configuration ($m=1$) was recently established and, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first construction of traveling wave solutions to the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in the $m$-layer arrangement.},

Then, we prove a Lipschitz stability result for simultaneous recovery of $\sigma$ and $q$. In both cases the parameters have a priori known bounds and belong to a known finite-dimensional subspace. The proofs rely on a monotonicity result combined with the techniques of localized potentials. To numerically solve the inverse problem, we propose two cost functions. The reformulation of the minimization problem via the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator allows us to obtain the optimality conditions by using the Fréchet differentiability of this operator and its inverse. The reconstruction is then performed by means of iterative algorithms based on the Newton and quasi-Newton methods. Finally, we illustrate some numerical results.},

For the nonisentropic Euler equations, we identify a sufficient condition for the formation of singularities of solutions with large initial data that allow a far-field vacuum---there exists a strong compression in the initial data. Furthermore, we identify two new phenomena---decompression and de-rarefaction---for the nonisentropic Euler flows, different from the isentropic flows, via constructing two respective solutions. For the decompression phenomenon, we construct a first global continuous nonisentropic solution, even though the initial data contain a weak compression, by solving a backward Goursat problem, so that the solution is smooth, except on several characteristic curves across which the solution has a weak discontinuity (i.e., only Lipschitz continuity). For the de-rarefaction phenomenon, we construct a continuous nonisentropic solution whose initial data contain isentropic rarefactions (i.e., without compression) and a locally stationary varying entropy profile, for which the solution still forms a shock wave in a finite time.},

The fluid flow and the elastodynamics of the multilayered poroelastic structure are fully coupled across a fixed interface through physical coupling conditions (including the Beavers--Joseph--Saffman condition), which present mathematical challenges related to the regularity of associated velocity traces. We prove the existence of weak solutions to this fluid-structure interaction problem with either (i) a linear, dynamic Biot model or (ii) a nonlinear quasi-static Biot component, where the permeability is a nonlinear function of the fluid content (as motivated by biological applications). The proof is based on constructing approximate solutions through Rothe&#39;s method and using energy methods and a version of the Aubin--Lions compactness lemma (in the nonlinear case) to recover the weak solution as the limit of approximate subsequences. We also provide uniqueness criteria and show that constructed weak solutions are indeed strong solutions to the coupled problem if one assumes additional regularity.},

We consider initial data in Sobolev spaces defined on euclidean (${\mathbb R}^d$) and periodic (${\mathbb T}^d$) domains and we prove global in time existence results for small data (in all dimensions) with regularity above the algebra structure under some extra hypotheses. By using Strichartz estimates, we obtain global well-posedness in $L^2({\mathbb R})\times L^2({\mathbb R})$ (with exponential decay in some physical cases), what cannot be applied to higher dimensions. Furthermore, under some physical assumptions, we show the existence of initial data, in both cases ${\mathbb R}^d$ or ${\mathbb T}^d$, such that the corresponding solutions blow up in finite or infinite time, with exponential rate. Also, using a self-contained approach we also present an interesting result about the existence of initial data with higher regularity, in periodic domains, such that the corresponding solutions either blow up in finite time or have unbounded Sobolev norms with a vanishing dissipation parameter. Finally, we present some numerical simulations in the cases ${\mathbb R}^d$, $d=1,2$, illustrating our results and motivating new research for the system.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the initial-boundary value problem on the full Euler--Poisson system for ions over a half line. We establish the existence of stationary solutions under the Bohm criterion similar to the isentropic case and further obtain the large time asymptotic stability of small-amplitude stationary solutions provided that the initial perturbation is sufficiently small in some weighted Sobolev spaces. Moreover, the convergence rate of the solution toward the stationary solution is obtained. The proof is based on the energy method. A key point is to capture the positivity of the temporal energy dissipation functional and boundary terms with suitable space weight functions either algebraic or exponential depending on whether or not the incoming far-field velocity is critical.},

  abstract     = {This paper intends to study an experimentally observed stabilizing phenomenon and to prove a mathematically rigorous stability result on the perturbations near a background magnetic field. Physical experiments and numerical simulations have observed a remarkable phenomenon that a background magnetic field can smooth and stabilize the electrically conducting turbulent fluids. To understand the mechanism of this phenomenon, we focus on a special 2D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system with anisotropic dissipation and partial damping and examine the stability near a background magnetic field. Due to the lack of full dissipation and damping, this stability problem is not trivial. Without the presence of a magnetic field, the fluid velocity is governed by the 2D Navier--Stokes equations in the whole space $\mathbb R^2$ with only vertical dissipation, and its stability (near the trivial solution) is still an open problem. However, when coupled to the magnetic field in such an MHD system, we are able to show that any perturbation near a background magnetic field is globally stable in Sobolev space $H^2$. This result reflects the observed stabilizing effect of the magnetic field. Mathematically, the MHD system obeyed by the perturbations can be converted to a system of wave equations which exhibits extra smoothing and stabilizing properties. These properties allow us to control the nonlinearity in the anisotropic Navier--Stokes equations and thus establish the desired stability result.},

By introducing an elaborate iterative method and using intensive entropy analysis, it is proved that the $L^\infty$ entropy solution of compressible Euler equations with finite initial mass converges strongly in the natural $L^1$ topology to a fundamental solution of the porous medium equation (PME) with time-dependent diffusion, called a generalized Barenblatt solution. It is interesting that the $L^1$ decay rate is getting faster and faster as $\lambda$ increases in $(0, \frac{\gamma}{\gamma+2}]$, while is getting slower and slower in $[ \frac{\gamma}{\gamma+2}, 1)$.},

For a bounded function $\kappa $ on ${\mathcal X}$ and $f$ in a suitable functional space over ${\mathcal X}$, we establish regularity of $u(t, x)=\mathbb{E}^x \big[ \exp \big( -\int_0^t \kappa (Y_s)ds \big) f(Y_t) \big]$ and show that it is the unique mild solution to a time fractional equation with initial value $f$. When $X$ is a symmetric Markov process on ${\mathcal X}$, we further show that $u$ is the unique weak solution to that time fractional equation. The main results are applied to compute the probability distribution of several random quantities of anomalous subdiffusion $Y$ where $X$ is a one-dimensional Brownian motion, including the first passage time, occupation time, and stochastic areas of $Y$.},

  abstract     = {In this work we study a Lipschitz stability result in the reconstruction of a compactly supported initial temperature for the heat equation in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$, from measurements along a positive time interval and over an open set containing its support. We employ a nonconstructive method which ensures the existence of the stability constant, but it is not explicit in terms of the parameters of the problem. The main ingredients in our method are the compactness of support of the initial condition and the explicit dependency of solutions to the heat equation with respect to it. By means of Carleman estimates we obtain an analogous result for the case when the observation is made along an exterior region $\omega\times(\tau,T)$, such that the unobserved part ${\mathbb{R}}^n\backslash\omega$ is bounded. In the latter setting, the method of Carleman estimates gives a general conditional logarithmic stability result when initial temperatures belong to a certain admissible set, without the assumption of compactness of support and allowing an explicit stability constant. Furthermore, we apply these results to deduce similar stability inequalities for the heat equation in ${\mathbb{R}}$ and with measurements available on a curve contained in ${\mathbb{R}}\times [0,\infty)$, leading to the derivation of stability estimates for an inverse problem arising in 2D fluorescence microscopy. In order to further understand this Lipschitz stability, in particular, the magnitude of its stability constant with respect to the parameters of the problem, a numerical reconstruction is presented based on the construction of a linear system for the inverse problem in fluorescence microscopy. We investigate the stability constant by analyzing the condition number of the corresponding matrix.},

It is supposed that they are subjected to anti-plane shear deformation and occupy an infinite cylinder in the reference configuration. Curves of solutions to the corresponding elastostatic problem are constructed using analytic global bifurcation theory. The curve associated with the first class is shown to exhibit broadening behavior, while for the second we find that the governing equation undergoes a loss of ellipticity in the limit. A sequence of solutions undergoes broadening when their effective supports grow without bound. This phenomenon has received considerable attention in the context of solitary water waves; it has been predicted numerically, yet it remains to be proven rigorously. The breakdown of ellipticity is related to cracks and instability making it an important aspect of the theory of failure mechanics.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the ergodicity of an invariant sublinear expectation of sublinear Markovian semigroups. For this, we first develop an ergodic theory of an expectation preserving map on a sublinear expectation space. Ergodicity is defined as any invariant set in which either itself or its complement has 0 capacity. We prove, under a general sublinear expectation space setting, the equivalent relation between ergodicity and the corresponding transformation operator having simple eigenvalue 1, and also with Birkhoff-type strong law of large numbers if the sublinear expectation is regular. For a sublinear Markov process, we prove that its ergodicity is equivalent to the Markovian semigroup having eigenvalue $1$, and the eigenvalue is simple in the space of bounded measurable functions. As an example we show that $G$-Brownian motion ${B_t}_{t\geq 0}$ on the unit circle has an invariant expectation and is ergodic if and only if ${\mathbb E}(-(B_1)^2)&lt;0$. Moreover, it is also proved in this case that the invariant expectation is regular and the canonical stationary process has no mean-uncertainty under the invariant expectation.},

  abstract     = {We establish the existence of global large smooth solutions to one-dimensional, compressible Navier--Stokes system for a viscous and heat-conducting ionized gas when the viscosity depends on the density and the heat conductivity depends on both the density and the absolute temperature. Unlike the case either for the ideal polytropic gases and the real gases or for nonlinear thermoviscoelasticity, in addition to the basic five thermodynamic variables, i.e., the specific volume, the absolute temperature, the pressure, the specific internal energy, and the specific entropy, the state of an ionized gas depends further on the degree of ionization, which can be expressed as a function of the specific volume and the absolute temperature by Saha&#39;s ionization equation. Such a dependence leads to the loss of genuine nonlinearity for both forward and backward characteristic fields and hence the loss of concavity of the physical entropy in some small bounded region. As a consequence, one cannot even deduce the desired dissipative estimates on both the bulk velocity and the absolute temperature as for the case of the ideal polytropic gases, the real gases, or nonlinear thermoviscoelasticity, thus making the analysis more difficult. For a class of heat conductivity which depends both on the density and the absolute temperature and a class of density-dependent viscosity which can include the case when the viscosity is a positive constant, we show that the corresponding initial boundary value problem admits a unique global smooth nonvacuum solution provided that the initial data are assumed to be without vacuum, mass concentrations, or vanishing temperatures. The key point in the analysis is to deduce the positive lower and upper bounds on both the specific volume and the absolute temperature.},

For a smooth, strictly convex, bounded domain, we show that there are at most finitely many positive wave numbers at which a plane wave with a fixed incident direction is nonscattering. For a disk there exist densities such that the corresponding incident Herglotz waves are nonscattering for infinitely many positive wave numbers.

The global well-posedness of strong solutions in the Sobolev space $H^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for the associated Cauchy problem is established when initial data are a small perturbation of a stable radiative equilibrium. The term related to the corrective term of radiation $\vec I_1$ in the momentum equation leads to new technical difficulties. Based on the energy method combined with the low-medium-high frequency decomposition, we develop a novel way to obtain the estimates of the solution and hence global existence. Furthermore, the optimal time decay rates of all-order spatial derivatives of the solutions are shown when the initial perturbation is additionally bounded in $L^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$.},

  abstract     = {In a recent paper we studied an equation (called the “simple equation&#39;&#39;) introduced by one of us in 1963 for an approximate correlation function associated with the ground state of an interacting Bose gas. Solving the equation yields a relation between the density $\rho$ of the gas and the energy per particle. Our construction of solutions gave a well-defined function $\rho(e)$ for the density as a function of the energy $e$. We had conjectured that $\rho(e)$ is a strictly monotone increasing function, so that it can be inverted to yield the strictly monotone increasing function $e(\rho)$. We had also conjectured that $\rho e(\rho)$ is convex as a function of $\rho$. We prove both conjectures here for small densities, the context in which they have the most physical relevance, and the monotonicity also for large densities. Both conjectures are grounded in the underlying physics, and their proof provides further mathematical evidence for the validity of the assumptions underlying the derivation of the simple equation, at least for low or high densities, if not intermediate densities, although the equation gives surprisingly good predictions for all densities $\rho$. Another problem left open in our previous paper was whether the simple equation could be used to compute accurate predictions of observables other than the energy. Here, we provide a recipe for computing predictions for any one- or two-particle observables for the ground state of the Bose gas. We focus on the condensate fraction and the momentum distribution, and show that they have the same low density asymptotic behavior as that predicted for the Bose gas. Along with the computation of the low density energy of the simple equation in our previous paper, this shows that the simple equation reproduces the known and conjectured properties of the Bose gas at low densities.},

We show the existence of a spectral gap under conditions that generalize those in the literature by using a method based on Harris&#39;s theorem, a result coming from the study of equilibration of Markov processes. The difficulty posed by the nonconservativeness of the equation is overcome by performing an $h$-transform, after solving the dual Perron eigenvalue problem. The existence of the direct Perron eigenvector is then a consequence of our methods, which prove exponential contraction of the evolution equation. Moreover the rate of convergence is explicitly quantifiable in terms of the dual eigenfunction and the coefficients of the equation.},

We allow the initial density to be close to a constant and the potential part of the initial velocity to be small independently of the rescaled viscosity parameter $\varepsilon$ while the rotational part of the initial velocity is assumed to be small compared to $\varepsilon$. We then show that the lifespan of the system $T^{\varepsilon}$ satisfies $T^{\varepsilon}&gt;\varepsilon^{-(1-\vartheta)}$, where the small constant $\vartheta$ is the size of the initial perturbation in some suitable space. The normal form transformation and the classical parabolic energy estimates are the main ingredients of the proof.},

As a direct consequence, even though there exist strong boundary layers, the inviscid type limit is still established for the solutions of 2D steady viscous incompressible MHD equations in Sobolev spaces provided that the following three assumptions hold: the hydrodynamics and magnetic Reynolds numbers take the same order in term of the reciprocal of a small parameter $\epsilon$; the tangential component of the magnetic field does not degenerate near the boundary; and the ratio of the strength of the tangential component of the magnetic field and the tangential component of velocity is suitably small.

In fact, the choices of such diffusion rates are open in the Hausdorff topology. Our result provides some evidence in the affirmative direction regarding the conjecture by Dockery et al. in 1998. The main tools include Morse decomposition of the semiflow and the theory of normalized Floquet principal bundle for linear parabolic equations.

Different from the previous studies with the various setting boundaries, we observe that the crucial mechanism to affect the structure of the stationary Euler--Poisson equations is the doping profile. When the doping profile is supersonic, regardless of the boundary settings, we prove that the Euler--Poisson system possesses two $C^{\infty}$-smooth transonic solutions. One is from the supersonic region to the subsonic region, and the other is of the inverse direction. However, when the doping profile is subsonic, the case is more complicated. We prove that there is no continuous transonic solution if the semiconductor effect is small enough, but there will arise two kinds of smooth transonic solutions when the semiconductor effect is large enough. Both of them are from the supersonic region the to subsonic region, where one is a unique $C^{\infty}$-smooth transonic solution with a relatively large number as its derivative at the sonic point, and the other consists of a class of smooth transonic solutions with another relatively small number as the derivative at the sonic point. This class of solutions are proved mostly to be $C^{\infty}$ smooth, except for a special case in which we only prove the $C^{m}$ smoothness. The method adopted is mainly the manifold analysis and the singularity analysis near the sonic line and the singular point.},

The pivoting point is to establish a novel variational structure, based on abstract modular spaces associated to a given convex function. First, we show that the new variational triple is suited for framing the evolution, in the sense that a novel duality pairing can be introduced and a generalized computational chain rule holds. Second, we prove well-posedness in an extended variational sense for evolution equations, without relying on any reflexivity assumption and any polynomial requirement on the nonlinearity. Finally, we discuss several important applications that can be addressed in this framework: these cover, but are not limited to, equations in Musielak--Orlicz--Sobolev spaces, such as variable exponent, Orlicz, weighted Lebesgue, and double-phase spaces.},

In this case, the fields are very intense and the corresponding degrees of freedom can be treated semiclassically. We prove that in such a regime the effective dynamics for the quantum particles is approximated by the one generated by a time-dependent point interaction, i.e., a singular time-dependent perturbation of the Laplacian supported in a point. As a by-product, we also show that the unitary dynamics of a time-dependent point interaction can be approximated in strong operator topology by the one generated by time-dependent Schrödinger operators with suitably rescaled regular potentials.},

When $\alpha + \beta \in [1,2]$, it is shown that there exists at least one weak mass-conserving solution for all times.

The question of uniqueness is also considered. Finally, for $\alpha &lt;0$ and a specific daughter distribution function, the nonexistence of mass-conserving solutions is also established.},

Given a continuous function on a bounded region that represents a continuum charge density, we construct a sequence of point charges and prove that the corresponding discrete electrostatic energies converge to the continuum counterpart. In a more general setting, we consider a given, compactly supported, signed Radon measure in the three-dimensional space representing the distribution of charges. We construct a sequence of point charges that converge to the given signed Radon measure and show that the corresponding discrete energies converge to the continuum one defined by the signed Radon measure. Conversely, for any sequence of point charges that satisfy certain reasonable assumptions on local geometry and excluded volumes, we prove that there exists a subsequence converging to a signed Radon measure and that the corresponding discrete energies converge to the continuum one defined by the limiting signed Radon measure. Tools used in our analysis include the explicit constructions of point charges from a given signed Radon measure as well as approximation properties of signed Radon measures. Finally, we apply our discrete-to-continuum analysis to the minimization of electrostatic energy related to the classical balayage problem in the potential theory. Such minimization can be potentially applied to the modeling of charged molecular systems with heterogeneously distributed charges embedded in a continuum solvent.},

As an application, we give a $B^{2/3}_{1,\infty}$-estimate for the characteristic functions of twins generated by finite energy sequences in the spirit of compactness for $\Gamma$-convergence. Heuristically, this suggests that the larger-scale interfaces, such as habit planes, can cluster on a set of Hausdorff-dimension $3-\frac{2}{3}$. We provide evidence indicating that this fractional dimension is optimal.

Finally, we investigate the limiting behavior of the spatial average of the particle distribution as $t \to \infty$. In particular, we show that it converges uniformly to a smooth, compactly supported function that preserves the mass, angular momentum, and energy of the system and depends only upon limiting particle momenta.},

This is motivated by the lack of optimal solutions in the $L^1$-setting for transitions from a smaller to a larger equilibrium with zero backlog. Key innovations involve dealing with discontinuous velocities in the presence of point masses, and a finite domain with in- and outfluxes. Taking a Lagrangian point of view, we establish existence and uniqueness of solutions and formulate a notion of weak solution. We prove that the Lagrangian solutions are weak solutions and vice versa. We prove continuity of the flow with respect to time (and almost also with respect to the initial state). Due to generally discontinuous velocities, these delicate regularity results hold only with respect to carefully crafted seminorms that are modifications of the flat norm. Generally, the solution cannot be continuous with respect to any norm on the space of measures.},

At the mathematical level, these time mirrors are modeled by singularities in the time variable in the coefficients of a wave equation, and a prototype of such singularity is a Dirac delta. Our main goal in this work is to obtain refocusing estimates for the wavefield that quantify the quality of time reversal. This amounts to analyzing the wave equation with Dirac-type singularities and developing a proper regularity theory as well as deriving uniform estimates.},

Moreover, the domain can have an irregular boundary with cusp-like features and codimension not necessarily equal to one, or even an integer. Given $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\Gamma\subseteq\partial\Omega$, we introduce a function space $\mathscr{N}^{s(\cdot),p}(\Omega)\subseteq L^p_{\text{loc}}(\Omega)$ for which a well-defined trace operator can be identified. Membership in $\mathscr{N}^{s(\cdot),p}(\Omega)$ constrains the oscillations in the function values as $\Gamma$ is approached, but does not imply any regularity away from $\Gamma$. Under connectivity assumptions between $\Omega$ and $\Gamma$, we produce a linear trace operator from $\mathscr{N}^{s(\cdot),p}(\Omega)$ to the space of measurable functions on $\Gamma$. The connectivity assumptions are satisfied, for example, by all one-sided nontangentially accessible domains. If $\Gamma$ is upper Ahlfors-regular, then the trace is a continuous operator into a Sobolev--Slobodeckij space. If $\Gamma=\partial\Omega$ and is further assumed to be lower Ahlfors-regular, then the trace exhibits the standard Lebesgue point property. To demonstrate the generality of the results, we construct $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ with an $m&gt;$ one-dimensional Ahlfors-regular $\Gamma\subseteq\partial\Omega$ satisfying the main domain hypotheses, yet $\Gamma$ is nowhere rectifiable and for every neighborhood of every point in $\Gamma$, there exist boundary points within that neighborhood that are only tangentially accessible.},

  abstract     = {A Gårding-type inequality is proved for a quadratic form associated to $\mathcal{A}$-quasiconvex functions. This quadratic form appears as the relative entropy in the theory of conservation laws and it is related to the Weierstrass excess function in the calculus of variations. The former provides weak-strong uniqueness results, whereas the latter has been used to provide sufficiency theorems for local minimizers. Using this new Gårding inequality we provide an extension of these results to PDE constrained problems in dynamics and statics under $\mathcal{A}$-quasiconvexity assumptions. The application in statics improves existing results by proving uniqueness of $L^p$-local minimizers in the classical $\mathcal{A}={curl}$ case.},

  abstract     = {We consider state-dependent delay equations (SDDEs) obtained by adding delays to a planar ODE with a limit cycle. Situations of this type appear in models of several physical processes, where small delay effects are added. Even if the delays are small, they are very singular perturbations since the natural phase space of an SDDE is an infinite-dimensional space. We show that for the SDDE, there are initial values which lead to solutions similar to those of the ODE. That is, there exist a periodic solution and a two parameter family of solutions whose evolution converges to the periodic solution (in the ODE case, these are called the isochrons). The method of proof bypasses the theory of existence, uniqueness, dependence on parameters of SDDE. We consider the class of functions of time that have a well defined behavior (e.g., periodic, or asymptotic to periodic) and derive functional equations which impose that they are solutions of the SDDE. These functional equations are studied using functional analysis methods. We provide a result in “a posteriori” format: given an approximate solution of the functional equation, which has some good condition numbers, we prove that there is a true solution close to the approximate one. Thus, our result can be used to validate the results of numerical computations or formal expansions. The method of proof also leads to practical algorithms. In a companion paper, we present the implementation details and representative results. One feature of the method presented here is that it allows us to obtain smooth dependence on parameters for the periodic solutions and their slow stable manifolds without studying the smoothness of the flow (which seems to be problematic for SDDEs, for now the optimal result on smoothness of the flow is $C^1$).},

In the introductory section we develop the thermodynamic foundations of the proposed model, and we document the role of thermodynamics in obtaining critical structural relations between the quantities of interest. These structural relations are then exploited in the mathematical analysis of the governing equations. In particular, the definition of weak solution is motivated by the thermodynamic basis of the model. The extra stress tensor describing the elastic response of the fluid is in our case purely spherical, which is a simplification from the physical point of view. The model nevertheless exhibits features that require novel mathematical ideas in order to deal with the technically complex structure of the associated internal energy and the more complicated forms of the corresponding entropy and energy fluxes. The paper provides the first rigorous proof of the existence of large-data global-in-time weak solutions to the governing equations for coupled thermo-mechanical processes in viscoelastic rate-type fluids.},

To achieve this, we apply the vanishing viscosity method and compensated compactness theory. We construct globally defined approximate solutions by adding our novel viscosity terms to the Euler equations, which together with our key observation on relative velocity plays a fundamental role in the hardest part of our proof: the uniform $L^\infty$ estimate.

Rough path techniques can stay closer to deterministic analytical methods and have the potential to transfer many pathwise ordinary differential equation (ODE) techniques more directly to a stochastic setting. However, there are few works that analyze dynamical properties of RDEs and connect the rough path/regularity structures, ODE, and random dynamical systems approaches. Here we contribute to this aspect and analyze invariant manifolds for RDEs. By means of a suitably discretized Lyapunov--Perron-type method we prove the existence and regularity of local center manifolds for such systems. Our method directly works with the RDE and we exploit rough paths estimates to obtain the relevant contraction properties of the Lyapunov--Perron map.},

The solution and force are smooth on $(0,T)$ and the total dissipation and work of the force are both finite. We show that a possible failure of the energy balance stems from two effects. The first is the anomalous dissipation of the solution, which has been studied in many contexts. The second is what we call the anomalous work done by the force, a phenomenon that has not been analyzed before. There are numerous examples of solutions exhibiting anomalous work, for which even a continuous energy profile does not rule out the anomalous dissipation, but only implies the balance of the strengths of these two effects, which we confirm in explicit constructions. More importantly, we show that there exist solutions exhibiting anomalous dissipation with zero anomalous work. Hence the violation of the energy balance results from the nonlinearity of the solution instead of artifacts of the force. Such examples exist in the class $u \in L_t^{3} B^{\frac{1}{3} -}_{3,\infty}$ and $f \in L_t^{2-} H^{-1}$, which implies the sharpness of many existing conditions on the energy balance.},

Our major novel discovery is a localization and geometrization property. We first show that a scatterer, which might be an active source or an inhomogeneous index of refraction, cannot be completely invisible if its support is small compared to the wavelength and scattering intensity. Next, we localize and geometrize the “smallness” results to the case where there is a high-curvature point on the boundary of the scatterer&#39;s support. We derive explicit bounds between the intensity of an invisible scatterer and its diameter or its curvature at the aforementioned point. These results can be used to characterize radiationless sources or nonradiating waves near high-curvature points. As significant applications we derive new intrinsic geometric properties of interior transmission eigenfunctions near high-curvature points. This is of independent interest in spectral theory. We further establish unique determination results for the single-wave Schiffer&#39;s problem in certain scenarios of practical interest, such as collections of well-separated small scatterers.

  abstract     = {In order to improve the frequency dispersion effects of irrotational shallow water models in coastal oceanography, several full dispersion versions of classical models have been formally derived in the literature. The idea, coming from G. Whitham in [Proc. A, 299 (1967), pp.6--25] was to modify them so that their dispersion relation is the same as the water waves equations. In this paper we construct new shallow water approximations of the velocity potential, then deduce ones on the vertically averaged horizontal component of the velocity. We make use of them to derive rigorously from the water waves equations two new Hamiltonian full dispersion models. This provides for the first time nontrivial precision results characterizing the order of approximation of the full dispersion models. They are nontrivial in the sense that they are better than the ones for the corresponding classical models.},

Assuming that the stability of $M_i$ changes along the slow trajectories at certain turning points, we derive criteria for the existence and stability of relaxation oscillations for the slow-fast system. Our approach is based on a generalization of the entry-exit relation to systems with multi-dimensional fast variables. We then apply our criteria to several predator-prey systems with rapid ecological evolutionary dynamics to show the existence of relaxation oscillations in these models.},

This free energy density functional is composed of three quadratic terms as the elastic energy density part, and a singular potential in the bulk part that is considered as a natural enforcement of a physical constraint on the eigenvalues of $Q$. The system is a nondiagonal parabolic system with a singular potential which trends to infinity logarithmically when the eigenvalues of $Q$ approach the physical boundary. We give a rigorous proof that for rather general initial data with possibly infinite free energy, the system has a unique strong solution after any positive time $t_0$. Furthermore, this unique strong solution detaches from the physical boundary after a sufficiently large time $T_0$. We also give an estimate of the Hausdorff measure of the set where the solution touches the physical boundary and thus prove a partial regularity result of the solution in the intermediate stage $(0,T_0)$.},

No smallness of initial data for the existence of all-time solutions is supposed. The uniform estimates of solutions with respect to the Mach number and the Froude number are established for all time, in particular for high-order derivatives of the pressure, which is a novelty in contrast to previous results. The cases of “ill-prepared” initial data and “well-prepared” initial data are both discussed. It is interesting to see that either both the Mach number and the Froude number vanish or the time goes to infinity; the limiting functions are the same, that is, the steady state. The main difficulty is that the system is degenerate near the free boundary and contains singular terms. This result can be viewed as the first on the low Mach and Froude numbers limit for free boundary problems. At the same time, we also establish the all-time existence of the classical solution with sharp convergent rates to the steady state, while previous results were only concerned with the weak or strong solutions.},

In this paper, we take a perturbative framework around the Maxwellian type equilibrium and use the classical energy method together with careful analysis based on the decomposition of the perturbation. We establish the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of strong solutions with large initial data when the noise strength is large enough. For the large-time behavior, we show the exponential decay of solutions toward the equilibrium under the same assumptions as those for the global solutions.},

  abstract     = {We derive high order homogenized models for the incompressible Stokes system in a cubic domain filled with periodic obstacles. These models have the potential to unify the three classical limit problems (namely the “unchanged” Stokes system, the Brinkman model, and Darcy&#39;s law) corresponding to various asymptotic regimes of the ratio $\eta\equiv a_{\epsilon}/\epsilon$ between the radius $a_{\epsilon}$ of the holes and the size $\epsilon$ of the periodic cell. What is more, a novel, rather surprising feature of our higher order effective equations is the occurrence of odd order differential operators when the obstacles are not symmetric. Our derivation relies on the method of two-scale power series expansions and on the existence of a “criminal” ansatz, which allows to reconstruct the oscillating velocity and pressure $(\bm u_{\epsilon},p_{\epsilon})$. as a linear combination of the derivatives of their formal average $(\bm u_{\epsilon}^{*},p_{\epsilon}^{*})$ weighted by suitable corrector tensors. The formal average $(\bm u_{\epsilon}^{*},p_{\epsilon}^{*})$ is itself the solution to a formal, infinite order homogenized equation, whose truncation at any finite order is in general ill-posed. Inspired by the variational truncation method of [V. P. Smyshlyaev and K. Cherednichenko, J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 48 (2000), pp. 1325--1357; K. D. Cherednichenko and J. A. Evans, Multiscale Model. Simul., 14 (2016), pp. 1513--1539] we derive, for any $K\in\mathbb{N}$, a well-posed model of order $2K+2$ which yields approximations of the original solutions with an error of order $O(\epsilon^{K+3})$ in the $L^{2}$ norm. Furthermore, the error improves up to the order $O(\epsilon^{2K+4})$ if a slight modification of this model remains well-posed. Finally, we find asymptotics of all homogenized tensors in the low volume fraction limit $\eta\rightarrow 0$ and in dimension $d\&gt;3$. This allows us to obtain that our effective equations converge coefficientwise to either of the Brinkman or Darcy regimes which arise when $\eta$ is, respectively, equivalent, or greater than the critical scaling $\eta_{{crit}}\sim\epsilon^{2/(d-2)}$.},

  abstract     = {We are concerned with the structural stability of conical shocks in the three-dimensional steady supersonic flows past Lipschitz perturbed cones whose vertex angles are less than the critical angle. The flows under consideration are governed by the steady isothermal Euler equations for potential flow with axisymmetry so that the equations contain a singular geometric source term. We first formulate the shock stability problem as an initial boundary value problem with the leading conical shock-front as a free boundary, and then establish the existence and structural/asymptotic stability of global entropy solutions of bounded variation (BV) of the problem. To achieve this, we first develop a modified Glimm scheme to construct approximate solutions via self-similar solutions as building blocks in order to incorporate with the geometric source term. Then we introduce the Glimm-type functional, based on the local interaction estimates between weak waves, the strong leading conical shock, and self-similar solutions, as well as the estimates of the center changes of the self-similar solutions. To make sure of the decrease of the Glimm-type functional, we choose appropriate weights by careful asymptotic analysis of the reflection coefficients in the interaction estimates, when the Mach number of the incoming flow is sufficiently large. Finally, we establish the existence of global entropy solutions involving a strong leading conical shock-front, besides weak waves, under the conditions that the Mach number of the incoming flow is sufficiently large and the weighted total variation of the slopes of the generating curve of the Lipschitz perturbed cone is sufficiently small. Furthermore, the entropy solution is shown to approach asymptotically the self-similar solution that is determined by the incoming flow and the asymptotic tangent of the cone boundary at infinity.},

We first establish the L∞-bounds of the solutions of a class of systems that improve some previous results in [M. Pierre, Milan J. Math., 78 (2010), pp. 417--455].

These results are due to the mixing effect of diffusion and transport. Although the equation is parabolic only in the velocity variable, it has a hypoelliptic structure provided that the transport part $\partial_t+b(v)\cdot\nabla_x$ is nondegenerate in some sense. We achieve the results by revisiting the method, proposed by Golse, Imbert, Mouhot, and Vasseur in the case $b(v)= v$, that combines the elliptic De Giorgi--Nash--Moser theory with velocity averaging lemmas.},

We consider a highly heterogeneous diffusion-convection equation in space, coupled with a stochastic differential equation with highly heterogeneous temporal scales that accounts for media change. Our main result consists of deriving the macroscale equation. We show that the resulting macroscale equation is deterministic with a nonlinear convective term. The convergence analysis involves the cell problem and the invariant measure of the stochastic differential equation. Although homogenization with changing media properties has been previously studied in other settings, this is the first result of this type, that includes a convective term. The latter makes the coupling between the homogenization and the time averaging much stronger. We show that the convergence to the limiting equation is in probability and we also find a corrector for it that gives stronger convergence.},

Both tensor fields verify a general ellipticity condition. In this work, the well-posedness of formulations for the Dirichlet and Neumann problems (i.e., with a boundary condition on the electric field or its curl, respectively) is proven using well-suited function spaces and Helmholtz decompositions. For both problems, the a priori regularity of the solution and the solution&#39;s curl is analyzed. The regularity results are obtained by splitting the fields and using shift theorems for second-order divergence elliptic operators. Finally, the discretization of the formulations with a $H$(curl)-conforming approximation based on edge finite elements is considered. An a priori error estimate is derived and verified thanks to numerical results with an elementary benchmark.},

We first prove the global-in-time existence of weak solutions. The proof is via energy, $L^p$, and compact support estimates together with a velocity averaging lemma. The combined effect of the alignment nature of $Q_r$, which keeps the characteristic from spreading, and the dissipative nature of $Q_i$, which gives the uniform control on the size of the distribution function, is crucially used in the estimates. We also rigorously establish a hydrodynamic limit to the pressureless Euler equation by employing the relative entropy combined with the Monge--Kantorovich--Rubinstein distance.},

In this paper, we establish the local existence and uniqueness theory for the initial-value problem in Sobolev spaces for interfacial electrohydrodynamics. As we show, this system is locally well-posed in both two and three dimensions when surface tension is taken into account. More importantly, the tangential electric field provides a significant stabilizing effect for the two-dimensional problem (with a one-dimensional interface) such that we can prove the local-in-time well-posedness for small data even if one neglects the surface tension.},

  abstract     = {In a classical survey [Mathematics in Industrial Problems, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1989, Chapter 16.2], Friedman proposed an open problem on the collision of two incompressible jets emerging from two axially symmetric nozzles. In this paper, we are concerned with the mathematical theory on this collision problem, and establish the well-posedness theory on hydrodynamic impinging outgoing jets issuing from two coaxial axially symmetric nozzles. More precisely, we show that for any given mass fluxes $M_1&gt;0$ and $M_2&lt;0$ in two nozzles, respectively, there exists an incompressible, inviscid impinging outgoing jet with contact discontinuity, which issues from two given semi-infinitely long axially symmetric nozzles and extends to infinity. Moreover, the constant pressure free stream surfaces of the impinging jet initiate smoothly from the mouths of the two nozzles and shrink to some asymptotic conical surface. There exists a smooth surface separating the two incompressible fluids and the contact discontinuity occurs on the surface. Furthermore, we show that there is no stagnation point in the flow field and its closure, except one point on the symmetric axis. Some asymptotic behavior of the impinging jet in upstream and downstream, geometric properties of the free stream surfaces are also obtained. The main results in this paper solve the open problem on the collision of two incompressible axially symmetric jets in [Friedman&#39;s book].},

Rigorous error bounds in Hölder spaces are provided. As an application, convergence of dislocations moving by the gradient flow of the elastic energy to dislocations moving by the gradient flow of the arclength functional, when the motion law is given by an $H^1$-type dissipation, and convergence to curve shortening flow in co-dimension 2 for the usual $L^2$-dissipation is established.

  abstract     = {We propose and analyze a finite-difference discretization of the Ambrosio--Tortorelli functional. It is known that if the discretization is made with respect to an underlying periodic lattice of spacing $\delta$, the discretized functionals $\Gamma$-converge to the Mumford--Shah functional only if $\delta\ll\varepsilon$, $\varepsilon$ being the elliptic approximation parameter of the Ambrosio--Tortorelli functional. Discretizing with respect to stationary, ergodic, and isotropic random lattices we prove this $\Gamma$-convergence result also for $\delta\sim\varepsilon$, a regime at which the discretization with respect to a periodic lattice converges instead to an anisotropic version of the Mumford--Shah functional. Moreover, we show that this scaling is optimal in the sense that it is the largest possible discretization scale for which the $\Gamma$-limit is of Mumford--Shah type. Finally, we present some numerical results highlighting the isotropic behavior of our random discrete functionals.},

In this general setting, we establish sharp algebraic decay rates and temporal asymptotics of perturbations to the front. Some of these results are known for the specific example of the Fisher-KPP equation, and our results can thus be viewed as establishing universality of some aspects of this simple model. We also give a precise description of how the spatial localization of perturbations to the front affects the temporal decay rate, across the full range of localizations for which asymptotic stability holds. Technically, our approach is based on a detailed study of the resolvent operator for the linearized problem, through which we obtain sharp linear time decay estimates that allow for a direct nonlinear analysis.},

  abstract     = {The paper considers three-dimensional (3D) traveling surface waves on water of finite depth under the forces of gravity and surface tension using the exact governing equations, also called Euler equations. It was known that when two nondimensional constants $b$ and $\lambda$, which are related to the surface tension coefficient and the traveling wave speed, respectively, near a critical curve in the $(b, \lambda )$-plane, the Euler equations have a 3D solution that has one hump at the center, approaches nonzero oscillations at infinity in the propagation direction, and is periodic in the transverse direction. This paper proves that in this parameter region, the Euler equations also have a 3D two-hump solution with similar properties. These two humps in the propagation direction are far apart and connected by small oscillations in the middle. The result obtained here is the first rigorous proof on the existence of 3D multi-hump water waves. The main idea of the proof is to find appropriate free constants and derive the necessary estimates of the solutions for the Euler equations in terms of those free constants so that two 3D one-hump solutions that are far apart can be successfully matched in the middle to form a 3D two-hump solution if some values of those constants are specified from matching conditions. The idea may also be applied to study the existence of 3D $2^n$-hump water waves.},

We consider the free boundary value problem for the Patlak--Keller--Segel model with homogeneous nonlinear degenerate diffusion in the present paper, which can be used to simulate the congested phenomena and the dynamical behaviors of cell motion with finite total mass and compactly supported density distribution. For the subcritical case, we prove that the cell density function exists globally in time and tends to the corresponding steady-state at an exponential time rate due to the balance between the nonlinear diffusion effect and nonlocal aggregation. For the supercritical case, we show that the global solution for the cell density exists and converges algebraically in time to the Barenblatt solution of the corresponding porous media equation due to the diffusion dominating mechanism. This provides a different viewpoint on the dynamical behaviors of the congested phenomena subject to the combined influences of nonlinear diffusion and nonlocal aggregation.},

In the case of degenerate noises, we show the convergence of solutions in mean to the set of periodic probability solutions. New results on the uniqueness of periodic probability solutions and global probability solutions of the FPE are also obtained. As applications, we study the long-time behaviors of the FPEs associated to stochastic damping Hamiltonian systems and stochastic slow-fast systems, and of weak solutions of periodic stochastic differential equations with less regular coefficients.},

  abstract     = {In a three-dimensional bounded possibly multiply connected domain, we prove the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of some vector potentials, associated with a divergence-free function and satisfying mixed boundary conditions. For such a construction, the fundamental tool is the characterization of the kernel which is related to the topology of the domain. We also give several estimates of vector fields via the operators div and curl when mixing tangential and normal components on the boundary. Furthermore, we establish some Inf-Sup conditions that are crucial in the $L^{p}$-theory proofs. Finally, we apply the obtained results to solve the Stokes problem with a pressure condition on some part of the boundary and Navier-type boundary condition on the remaining part, where weak and strong solutions are considered.},

The deformable interface is under the effect of an ambient field generated by the underlying and unbounded material derivative term which further contributes to the nondissipativity of the FSI system with respect to the standard energy inner product. In this work we show that, on an appropriate subspace, only one dimension less than the entire finite energy space, the FSI system is wellposed and is moreover associated with a continuous semigroup which is uniformly bounded in time. Our approach involves establishing maximal dissipativity with respect to a special inner product which is equivalent to the standard inner product for the given finite energy space. Among other technical features, the necessary PDE estimates require the invocation of a multiplier which is intrinsic to the given compressible FSI system.},

We also give some qualitative results for the Blaschke--Santaló diagram for the class of planar convex domains: we prove that in this case the diagram can be described as the set of points contained between the graphs of two continuous and increasing functions. This shows in particular that the diagram is simply connected, and even horizontally and vertically convex. We also prove that the shapes that fill the upper part of the boundary of the diagram are smooth ($C^{1,1}$), while those on the lower one are polygons (except for the ball).

  abstract     = {We consider the conductivity transmission problem in two dimensions with a simply connected inclusion of arbitrary shape. It is well known that the solvability of the transmission problem can be established via the boundary integral formulation in which the Neumann--Poincaré (NP) operator is involved. In this paper, we derive series expansions of the layer potential operators based on geometric function theory and exhibit a novel approach to the transmission problem. We first construct a collection of harmonic basis functions by using the Faber polynomials associated with the simply connected inclusion. We then derive explicit series expansions of the layer potential operators with respect to the constructed basis functions. In particular, the NP operator becomes a doubly infinite, self-adjoint matrix operator, whose entry is explicitly given by the Grunsky coefficients corresponding to the inclusion. By applying the finite section method to this matrix formulation, we obtain an approximation scheme for the spectrum of the NP operator and the solution to the transmission problem. This scheme allows us to numerically compute, in a simple way, the spectrum of the NP operator for a smooth domain when the exterior conformal mapping is known. We additionally derive an explicit integral expression for the coefficients of the exterior conformal mapping so that for an inclusion of arbitrary shape, one can numerically compute the exterior conformal mapping by solving only one boundary integral equation and apply the proposed approach. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

As of today, why the algorithm works and how it converges is mostly unknown. The continuous version of the algorithm is a set of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In this paper, we prove the well posedness of the SDE system and justify its mean-field limit is a Fokker--Planck equation, whose long time equilibrium is the target distribution. We further demonstrate that the convergence rate is near optimal ($J^{-1/2}$ with $J$ being the number of particles). These results, combined with the in-time convergence of the Fokker--Planck equation to its equilibrium [J. A. Carrillo and U. Vaes, preprint, arXiv:1910.07555, 2019] justify the validity of the EKS, and provide the convergence rate as a sampling method.},

Consequently, no additional regularity of the level sets of the ideal data is assumed, and in particular the subgradient of the total variation at it could be empty. In exchange, other restrictions on the data or on the noise are required.

The case when the pressure $p(v)=v^{-\gamma}$, the viscosity $\mu(v)=\tilde{\mu} v^{-\alpha}$, and the capillarity $\kappa(v)=\tilde{\kappa} v^{-\beta}$ for the specific volume $v(t,x)&gt;0$ is considered, where $\alpha,\beta, \gamma\in\mathbb{R}$ are parameters, and $\tilde{\mu},\tilde{\kappa}$ are given positive constants. We focus on the impermeable wall problem where the velocity $u(t,x)$ on the boundary $x=0$ is zero. If $\alpha,\beta$, and $\gamma$ satisfy some conditions and the initial data have the constant states $(v_+, u_+)$ at infinity with $v_+, u_+&gt;0$, and have no vacuum and mass concentrations, we prove that the one-dimensional compressible Navier--Stokes--Korteweg system admits a unique global strong solution without vacuum, which tends to the 2-rarefaction wave as time goes to infinity. Here both the initial perturbation and the strength of the rarefaction wave can be arbitrarily large. As a special case of the parameters $\alpha,\beta$ and the constants $\tilde{\mu},\tilde{\kappa}$, the large-time behavior of large solutions to the compressible quantum Navier--Stokes system is also obtained for the first time. Our analysis is based on a new approach to deduce the uniform-in-time positive lower and upper bounds on the specific volume and a subtle large-time stability analysis.},

In accordance with recent developments in the modeling literature, a particular focus is on possible effects of taxis-type movement of uninfected toward infected cells, where in contrast to setting addressed by standard Keller--Segel type systems, the evolution of the considered attractant is influenced by an inherently nonlinear production mechanism. Despite the accordingly increased mathematical challenges going along with an apparent lack of favorable structural properties that have facilitated accessibility of such classical Keller--Segel models to various techniques from parabolic blow-up analysis, the present study attempts to develop an approach capable of detecting taxis-driven aggregation phenomena in complex models of this form. In the framework of radially symmetric solutions to associated Neumann-type initial boundary value problems, through an analysis of a corresponding mass accumulation function a result on the occurrence of finite-time blow-up in two- or three-dimensional balls is derived. This rigorously confirms the potential of the considered model to describe the spontaneous emergence of locally high densities, as known from experimental observations in contexts of virus hotspot formation phenomena.},

It was an open question to prove such a result for an operator which does not share this form. We prove a closed entropy-entropy production inequality à la Villani which implies exponentially fast convergence to equilibrium for the linear Boltzmann equation with a quantitative rate. The key new idea appearing in our proof is the use of a total derivative of the entropy of a projection of our solution to compensate for an error term which appears when using nonlinear entropies.

We prove uniform continuity estimates for viscosity solutions of the approximating problems which may be of independent interest. We pay special attention to the case when the Hamiltonian is convex in the gradient variable and equations are of first order and provide a representation formula for the solution of the limiting first order HJB equation. We also propose an intrinsic definition of viscosity solution on the Wasserstein space.},

Pures Appl., 143 (2020), pp. 116--161] on the geometric structures of Laplacian eigenfunctions and their applications to inverse scattering problems. In that work, we studied the analytic behavior of the Laplacian eigenfunctions at a point where two nodal or generalized singular lines intersect. The results reveal an important and intriguing property that the vanishing order of the eigenfunction at the intersecting point is closely related to the rationality of the intersecting angle. In this paper, we continue this development in three dimensions and study the analytic behaviors of the Laplacian eigenfunctions at places where nodal or generalized singular planes intersect. Compared with the two-dimensional case, the geometric situation is much more complicated, and so is the corresponding analysis: the intersection of two planes generates an edge corner, whereas the intersection of more than three planes generates a vertex corner. We provide a systematic and comprehensive characterization of the relations between the analytic behaviors of an eigenfunction at a corner point and the geometric quantities of that corner for all these geometric cases. Moreover, we apply the spectral results to establish some novel unique identifiability results for the geometric inverse problems of recovering the shape as well as the (possible) surface impedance coefficient by the associated scattering far-field measurements.},

Despite its frequent use, mathematical understanding is still limited. In [T. Franz and H. Wendland, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 50 (2018), pp. 4752--4784] we proved convergence for a specific flow problem under appropriate conditions on the underlying kernel. The kernel has to satisfy so-called moment and approximation conditions. We also showed that the generalized Wendland kernels satisfy these conditions in odd space dimensions. In this paper, we will significantly improve the above results in the following ways. We will show that the results also hold in even space dimensions. We will show that the generalized Wendland kernels satisfy the approximation condition of any order, which means that for these kernels we can eliminate the dependence of the convergence rate on the approximation condition. We will show that the standard Wendland kernels, though they perform numerically similarly, do not satisfy the approximation condition.},

In the model, the short waves propagate along the streamlines of the fluid flow. This is translated in the system by the fact that the nonlinear Schrödinger equation is set up on the Lagrangian coordinates of the fluid. This prompts the crucial problem of establishing the regularity of the Lagrangian transformation, which is an important achievement of this paper. The latter is also a decisive point for the local well-posedness. The system provides a simplified mathematical model for studying aurora type phenomena.

Also, for solutions with a mild $L^1$-norm growth in time it is established that its lim inf converges to zero, as time goes to infinity. This confirms the nonexistence of breathers and other solutions for the ILW model moving with a speed łqłq slower&quot; than a soliton. We also prove that in the far field linearly dominated region, the $L^2$-norm of the solution also converges to zero as time approaches infinity. In addition, we deduced several scenarios for which the initial value problem associated to the generalized Benjamin--Ono and the generalized ILW equations cannot possess time periodic solutions (breathers). Finally, as previously demonstrated in solutions of the KdV and Benjamin--Ono equations, we establish the following propagation of regularity result: if the datum $u_0\in H^{3/2+}({\mathbb{R}})\cap H^m((x_0,\infty))$, for some $x_0\in{\mathbb{R}},\,m\in Z^+,\,m\geq 2$, then the corresponding solution $u(\cdot,t)$ of the ILW equation belongs to $H^m(\beta,\infty)$ for any $t&gt;0$ and $\beta\in{\mathbb{R}}$.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, a lot of attention has been drawn to the question of whether logistic kinetics is sufficient to enforce the global existence of classical solutions or to prevent finite-time blow-up in various chemotaxis models. However, for several important chemotaxis models, only in the space two dimensional setting has it been shown that logistic kinetics is sufficient to enforce the global existence of classical solutions (see [K. Fujie, M. Winkler, and T. Yokota, Nonlinear Anal., 109 (2014), pp. 56--71], [J. I. Tello and W. Winkler, Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 32 (2007), pp. 849--877]). The current paper gives a confirmed answer to the above question for the following parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with singular sensitivity and logistic source in any space dimensional setting: $u_t=\Delta u-\chi\nabla\cdot (\frac{u}{v} \nabla v)+u(a(x,t)-b(x,t) u)$ and $0=\Delta v-\mu v+\nu u$ under the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, where $\chi$ is the singular chemotaxis sensitivity coefficient, $a(x,t)$ and $b(x,t)$ are positive smooth functions, and $\mu,\nu$ are positive constants. We prove that, for every given nonnegative initial data $0\not\equiv u_0\in C^0(\bar \Omega)$, the system has a unique globally defined classical solution $(u(t,x;u_0),v(t,x;u_0))$ with $u(0,x;u_0)=u_0(x)$, which shows that, in any space dimensional setting, logistic kinetics is sufficient to enforce the global existence of classical solutions and hence prevents the occurrence of finite-time blow-up even for arbitrarily large $\chi$. In addition, the solutions are shown to be uniformly bounded under the conditions $a_{\inf}&gt;\frac{\mu \chi^2}{4}$ when $\chi \leq 2$ and $a_{\inf}&gt;\mu (\chi-1)$ when $\chi&gt;2$.},

In contrast with the mean-field regime, in which each particle interacts with every other particle, i.e., with $O(N)$ particles, we consider the a priori more difficult case of a sparse network; that is, each particle interacts, on average, with $O(1)$ particles. We also assume that the network&#39;s dynamics is much faster than the particles&#39; dynamics, with the time-scale of the network described by a parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We combine the averaging ($\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$) and the many-particles ($N \rightarrow \infty$) limits and prove that the evolution of the particles&#39; empirical density is described (after taking both limits) by a nonlinear Fokker--Planck equation; moreover, we give conditions under which such limits can be taken uniformly in time, hence providing a criterion under which the limiting nonlinear Fokker--Planck equation is a good approximation of the original system uniformly in time.

  abstract     = {We prove a high-dimensional version of the Strichartz estimates for the unitary group associated to the free Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation. As a by-product, we deduce maximal estimates which allow us to prove local well-posedness for the generalized Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation in the whole subcritical case whenever $d \ge 4, k \ge 4,$ complementing the recent results of Kinoshita [Global Well-Posedness for the Cauchy Problem of the Zakharov-Kuznetsov Equation in 2D, 2019; Well-Posedness for the Cauchy Problem of the Modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov Equation, 2019] and Herr and Kinoshita [Subcritical Well-Posedness Results for the Zakharvo-Kuznestov Equation in Dimension Three and Higher, 2020]. Finally, we use some of those maximal estimates in order to prove pointwise convergence results for the flow of the generalized Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation in any dimension, in the same spirit of Compaan, Lucà, and Staffilani [Pointwise convergence of the Schrödinger flow, Int. Math. Res. Not., 1 (2021), pp. 596--647]. With the use of recently proven estimates, we are able to establish pointwise results also for the original Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation in every dimension.},

More precisely, we show that the spectrum of the transmission eigenvalue problem is discrete if the electromagnetic parameters $\varepsilon, \, \mu, \, \hat \varepsilon, \, \hat \mu$ in the equations characterizing the inhomogeneity and background are smooth in some neighborhood of the boundary and isotropic on the boundary, and satisfy the conditions $\varepsilon \neq \hat \varepsilon$, $\mu \neq \hat \mu$, and $\varepsilon/ \mu \neq \hat \varepsilon/ \hat \mu$ on the boundary. These are quite general assumptions on the coefficients, which are easy to check. To our knowledge, our paper is the first to establish discreteness of transmission eigenvalues for Maxwell&#39;s equations without assuming any restrictions on the sign combination of the contrasts $\varepsilon-\hat \varepsilon$ and $\mu - \hat \mu$ near the boundary and allowing for all the electromagnetic parameters to be inhomogeneous and anisotropic, except for on the boundary where they are isotropic but not necessarily constant as is often assumed in the literature.},

Each of our families converges to a foliation of $T \times \mathbb{R}$ by $T$. These surfaces then lift to minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that are periodic in horizontal directions but not periodic in the vertical direction. In the language of crystallography, our construction can be interpreted as disordered stacking of layers of periodically arranged catenoid necks. Limit positions of the necks are governed by equations that appear, surprisingly, in recent studies on the mean field equation and the Painlevé VI equation. This helps us to obtain a rich variety of disordered minimal surfaces. Our work is motivated by experimental observations of twinning defects in periodic minimal surfaces, which we reproduce as special cases of stacking disorder.},

While it is well established that the minimizers of such interaction energies converge to a certain particle density profile as the number of particles tends to infinity, any bound on the rate of this convergence is only known in special cases by means of quantitative estimates. The main result of this paper extends these quantitative estimates to a large class of interaction energies by a different proof. The proof relies on one-dimensional features such as the convexity of the interaction potential and the ordering of the particles. The main novelty of the proof is the treatment of the singularity of the interaction potential by means of a carefully chosen renormalization.},

The upper boundary is a free boundary with the effect of surface tension taken into account, and the lower boundary is a fixed boundary on which the Navier slip condition is imposed. It is proved that there is a uniform time interval on which the estimates independent of both viscosity and surface tension coefficients of the solution can be established. This then allows one to justify the vanishing viscosity and surface tension limits by the strong compactness argument. In the presence of surface tension, the main difficulty lies in the less regularity of the highest temporal derivative of the mean curvature of the free surface and the pressure. It seems hard to overcome this difficulty by using the vorticity in viscous boundary layers. One of the key observations here is to find that there is a crucial cancelation between the mean curvature and the pressure by using the dynamic boundary condition.},

The mappings under consideration are Sobolev homeomorphisms and their weak limits. They are monotone in the sense of C. B. Morrey. One major advantage of adopting monotone Sobolev mappings lies in the existence of the energy-minimal deformations. However, injectivity is inevitably lost, so an obvious question to ask is, what are the largest subsets of the reference configuration on which minimal deformations remain injective? The fact that such subsets have full measure should be compared with the notion of global invertibility, which deals with subsets of the deformed configuration instead. In this connection we present a Cantor-type construction to show that both the branch set and its image may have positive area. Another novelty of our approach lies in allowing the elastic deformations to be free along the boundary, known as frictionless problems.},

The discrete model introduced here is characterized by an energy with two contributions, the surface and the elastic-bulk energy, and it is formally justified starting from atomistic interactions. The surface energy counts missing bonds at the film and substrate boundaries, while the elastic energy models the fact that for film atoms there is a preferred interatomic distance different from the preferred interatomic distance for substrate atoms. In the regime of small mismatches between the film and the substrate optimal lattices, a discrete rigidity estimate is established by regrouping the elastic energy in triangular-cell energies and by locally applying rigidity estimates from the literature. This is crucial to establish precompactness for sequences with equibounded energy and to prove that the limiting deformation is one single rigid motion. By properly matching the convergence scaling of the different terms in the discrete energy, both surface and elastic contributions appear also in the resulting continuum limit in agreement (and in a form consistent) with literature models. Thus, the analysis performed here is a microscopical justification of such models.},

The arguments are facilitated by a new characterization of the asymptotic behavior of approximate nonlocal inclusions, which reveals, in particular, an invariance under diagonalization of the constraining set. For a complementary viewpoint, we also discuss a class of double-integral functionals for which relaxation is in fact structure preserving and the relaxed integrands arise from separate convexification.},

Compared with the known results on the stability of transonic shocks, one of the major difficulties for the axisymmetric flows with swirls is that corner singularities near the intersection point of the shock surface and nozzle boundary and the artificial singularity near the axis appear simultaneously. One of the key points in the analysis for this paper is the introduction of an invertible modified Lagrangian transformation which can straighten the streamlines in the whole nozzle and help to represent the solutions of transport equations explicitly. Furthermore, the simple but useful modified Lagrangian transformation makes the treatment for the singularities near the axis easy and clean. Such a technique may be helpful in studies of other problems for axisymmetric flows.},

We study the behavior when the gas is conditioned on a rare event. We first show that the special case of quadratic confinement and linear constraint is exactly solvable due to a remarkable factorization, and that the conditioning has then the simple effect of shifting the cloud of particles without deformation. To address more general cases, we perform a theoretical asymptotic analysis relying on a large deviations technique known as the Gibbs conditioning principle. The technical part amounts to establishing that the conditioning ensemble is an $I$-continuity set of the energy. This leads to characterizing the conditioned equilibrium measure as the solution of a modified variational problem. For simplicity, we focus on linear statistics and on quadratic statistics constraints. Finally, we numerically illustrate our predictions and explore cases in which no explicit solution is known. For this, we use a generalized hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling from the conditioned distribution for a finite but large system.},

The flow is described by 3-D compressible steady Euler equations, which are quasilinear multidimensional hyperbolic with respect to the supersonic direction. By the mass conservation of gases and the geometric property of the divergent nozzle, the moving gases in the nozzle will gradually become rarefactive and tend to the vacuum state at infinity, which means that the compressible Euler equations are degenerate at infinity. For such an expansive supersonic Euler flow and for small initial perturbations, we show that the 3-D Euler flow is globally stable and there are no vacuum domains in the nozzle.},

We analyze the HK barycenter between Dirac measures in detail, and find that it differs substantially from the Wasserstein barycenter by exhibiting a local “clustering” behavior, depending on the length scale of the input measures. In applications it makes sense to simultaneously consider all choices of this scale, leading to a 1-parameter family of barycenters. We demonstrate the usefulness of this family by analyzing point clouds sampled from a mixture of Gaussians and inferring the number and location of the underlying Gaussians.},
