  abstract     = {This paper develops a general theory on optimal allocation of multiarmed bandit (MAB) processes subject to arm switching constraints formulated as a general random time set. A Gittins index is constructed for each single arm, and the optimality of the corresponding Gittins index policy is proved. The constrained MAB model and the Gittins index policy established in this paper subsume those for MAB processes in continuous time, integer time, semi-Markovian, as well as general discrete time settings. Consequently, the new theory covers the classical MAB models as special cases and also applies to many other situations that have not yet been studied in the literature. While the proof of the optimality of the Gittins index policy benefits from ideas in the existing theory of MAB processes in continuous time, new techniques are introduced which drastically simplify the proof.},

[H. Albrecher and J. Hartinger, Hermis J. Comp. Math. Appl., 7 (2006), pp. 109--122]). Building on our previous work [L. Bai, J. Ma, and X. Xing, Ann. Appl. Probab., 27 (2017), pp. 3588--3632], where we established the dynamic programming principle via a backward Markovization procedure and proved that the value function is the unique constrained viscosity solution of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation, which is a nonlocal, nonlinear, and degenerate parabolic partial integro-differential equation on an unbounded domain, in this paper we show that the optimal strategy is still of a band type but in a more complicated dynamic fashion. The main technical obstacles in constructing and validating the optimal strategy include the regularity of the value function, due to the fundamental degeneracy of the HJB equation caused by the Markovization procedure, and the well-posedness of the closed-loop stochastic system, given the “band&quot; nature of the optimal strategy. Some of the technical results in this paper are purely analytical and therefore interesting in their own right.},

With the help of nonnegative matrix theory together with some key results related to the compositions of directed edge sets, we establish a systematic algebraic-graphical method of dealing with the product convergence of infinite sub-stochastic matrices and infinite super-stochastic matrices. By using this method, the stability of MASs over signed networks under different actual scenarios is analyzed, including asynchronous interactions, lossy links, random networks, matrix disturbance, external noise disturbance, and a leader of unmeasurable velocity and acceleration. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is verified by computer simulations.},

In particular, we concentrate on the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems, i.e., we are looking for an optimal control $u_{{opt}}$ in the linear state feedback form $u_{{opt}}(t,\cdot ) = P x(t,\cdot )$, where $x(t,\cdot)$ is the solution of the controlled partial differential equation (PDE) for a time point $t$. Under sufficient regularity assumptions, the Riccati operator $P$ fulfills the algebraic Riccati equation (ARE) $ AP + P A - P B B^{\star} P + Q = 0$, where $A$, $B$, and $Q$ are linear operators associated to the LQR problem. By expressing $P$ in terms of an integral kernel $p$, the weak form of the ARE leads to a nonlinear partial integro-differential equation (IDE) for the kernel $p$---the Riccati-IDE. We represent the kernel function as an element of a sparse grid space, which considerably reduces the cost to solve the Riccati IDE. Numerical results are given to validate the approach.},

This algorithm is based on an offline/online decomposition of the reconstruction process and on an ansatz for the unknown operator obtained by an a priori chosen set of linearly independent matrices. The presented convergence analysis focuses on linear-quadratic (optimization) problems governed by linear differential systems and reveals the strong dependence of the performance of the greedy algorithm on the observability properties of the system and on the ansatz of the basis elements. Moreover, the analysis allows us to use a precise (and in some sense optimal) choice of basis elements for the linear case and led to the introduction of a new and more robust optimized greedy reconstruction algorithm. This optimized approach also applies to nonlinear Hamiltonian reconstruction problems, and its efficiency is demonstrated by numerical experiments.},

The peculiar feature of such problems is the presence of a positivity state constraint, which often arises in economic applications. To deal with such constraints, we set up the problem in a Banach lattice, not necessarily reflexive: a typical example is the space of continuous functions on a compact set. In this setting, which seems to be new in this context, we are able to find explicit solutions to the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation associated to a suitable auxiliary problem and to write the corresponding optimal feedback control. Thanks to a type of infinite-dimensional Perron--Frobenius theorem, we use these results to gain information about the optimal paths of the original problem. This was not possible in the infinite-dimensional setting used in earlier works on this subject, where the state space was an ${L}^2$ space.},

First, under the minimum rank condition of a Kalman matrix, we show the necessity of the conditions of compatibility for the coupling matrices involved in the system on a general bounded domain. Thus the results in [T. Li, X. Lu, and B. Rao, Control Optim. Calc. Var., 27 (2021)] on the necessity of the conditions of compatibility for the coupling matrices can be established from a special parallelepiped domain to a general smooth bounded domain. Next, we establish the equivalence between the minimality of Kalman&#39;s rank condition and the independence of the presynchronized system with respect to applied boundary controls. This method has a general character and can be applied to other problems.},

Looking then for time-harmonic fields and writing the bathymetry, i.e., the bottom topography, as a perturbation of a flat bottom, we end up with a heterogeneous Helmholtz equation with an impedance boundary condition. In this way, we study a PDE-constrained optimization problem for a Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media whose coefficients are only bounded with bounded variation. We provide necessary condition for a general cost function to have at least one optimal solution. We also prove the convergence of a finite element approximation of the solution to the considered Helmholtz equation as well as the convergence of the discrete optimum toward the continuous ones. We end this paper with some numerical experiments to illustrate the theoretical results and show that some of their assumptions are necessary.},

We provide the design of the iterative method applied to the global first-order optimality system, prove its convergence, and derive an a posteriori error estimate. The analysis is done entirely on the continuous level. A distinguishing feature of the method is that the decomposed optimality system can be interpreted as an optimality system of a local “virtual&quot; optimal control problem. Thus, the iterative time-domain decomposition of the optimality system can be interpreted as an iterative parallel scheme for virtual optimal control problems on the subintervals. A typical example and further comments are given to show the range of potential applications. Moreover, we provide some numerical experiments to give a first interpretation of the role of the parameters involved in the iterative process.},

All systems have heterogeneous multi-input multi-output (MIMO) linear dynamics, and the relative measurement output of the systems, rather than relative internal state, is available through the time-varying network topology. The current setting makes the problem more practical but technically more challenging. The existing approaches cannot be applied to this problem directly. To overcome the technical challenges, a class of reference generators is proposed based on the low gain approach. By means of constructing multiple Lyapunov functions and designing the low gain parameter delicately, it is shown that output consensus of heterogeneous MIMO multi-agent systems without communication of internal state can be achieved.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the control problem of Markov jump linear systems with multiplicative noise and partial observations of the Markov chain (operating mode). We devise a new approach for $H_2$ analysis and control in a scenario of fast switching mode detectors, which considers the limiting case in which the switching frequency of the detector tends to infinity. Besides the interest in its own right, the approach devised here is particularly interesting in situations in which the mode estimates are updated continuously in time and subject to ambiguity, and therefore will typically change much faster than the actual operating mode. This strategy allows for a considerable reduction of the cardinality of the Markov chain&#39;s state space, and homogenizes the large transition parameters that correspond to the fast transitions. Therefore, it leads us to better-conditioned computational problems of reduced dimensionality, in comparison to the existing detector-based designs. A great deal of the existing literature on singularly perturbed switching diffusions relies on weak convergence methods. Our approach starts from a novel point of view, which hinges on pointwise convergence of a certain semigroup operator as the very underpinning technique of this paper. This strategy enables us to, in the fast-switching limit case, analyze mean square stability and homogenized $H_2$ performance through operator theory. We also introduce a new method for the $H_2$ design of homogenized controllers via linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and show, in a numerical example, that it can yield better results than an existing approach from the recent literature.},

  abstract     = {Various particle filters have been proposed over the last couple of decades with the common feature that the update step is governed by a type of control law. This feature makes them an attractive alternative to traditional sequential Monte Carlo which scales poorly with the state dimension due to weight degeneracy. This article proposes a unifying framework that allows us to systematically derive the McKean--Vlasov representations of these filters for the discrete time and continuous time observation case, taking inspiration from the smooth approximation of the data considered in [D. Crisan and J. Xiong, Stochastics, 82 (2010), pp. 53--68; J. M. Clark and D. Crisan, Probab. Theory Related Fields, 133 (2005), pp. 43--56]. We consider three filters that have been proposed in the literature and use this framework to derive Itô representations of their limiting forms as the approximation parameter $\delta \rightarrow 0$. All filters require the solution of a Poisson equation defined on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, for which existence and uniqueness of solutions can be a nontrivial issue. We additionally establish conditions on the signal-observation system that ensures well-posedness of the weighted Poisson equation arising in one of the filters.},

We show that the smooth pasting (SP) principle, the main approach that is used to construct explicit solutions for classical time-consistent optimal stopping problems, may fail under time-inconsistency. Specifically, a mere change of the discount function from exponential to nonexponential (everything else being the same) will cause the SP approach to fail. In general, we prove that SP solves a time-inconsistent problem, within the intrapersonal game theoretic framework with a general nonlinear cost functional and a geometric Brownian motion, if and only if certain inequalities on the model primitives are satisfied. In the special case of a real options problem, we show that while these inequalities hold trivially for the exponential discount function, they may not hold even for very simple nonexponential discount functions. Moreover, we show that the real options problem actually does not admit any equilibrium whenever the SP approach fails. The negative results in this paper caution one from blindly extending the classical approach for time-consistent stopping problems to their time-inconsistent counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Policy optimization (PO) is a key ingredient for modern reinforcement learning. For control design, certain constraints are usually enforced on the policies to optimize, accounting for stability, robustness, or safety concerns on the system. Hence, PO is by nature a constrained (nonconvex) optimization in most cases, whose global convergence is challenging to analyze in general. More importantly, some constraints that are safety-critical, e.g., the closed-loop stability, or the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-norm constraint that guarantees the system robustness, can be difficult to enforce on the controller being learned as the PO methods proceed. In this paper, we study the convergence theory of PO for $\mathcal{H}_2$ linear control with $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ robustness guarantee. This general framework includes risk-sensitive linear control as a special case. One significant new feature of this problem, in contrast to the standard $\mathcal{H}_2$ linear control, namely, linear quadratic regulator problems, is the lack of coercivity of the cost function. This makes it challenging to guarantee the feasibility, namely, the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ robustness, of the iterates. Interestingly, we propose two PO algorithms that enjoy the implicit regularization property, i.e., the iterates preserve the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ robustness automatically, as if they are regularized. Furthermore, despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we show that these algorithms converge to a certain globally optimal policy with globally sublinear rates, without getting stuck at any other possibly suboptimal stationary points, and with locally (super)linear rates under additional conditions. To the best of our knowledge, our work offers the first results on the implicit regularization property and global convergence of PO methods for robust/risk-sensitive control.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time Epstein--Zin utilities have been formulated on a controllable random horizon via an infinite-horizon backward stochastic differential equation with superlinear growth. A new comparison result is established for the uniqueness of the associated utility value processes. In a Black--Scholes market, the stochastic control problem is solved through the related Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. The verification argument features a delicate containment of the growth of the controlled mortality process, a process unique to our framework, on the strength of a combination of probabilistic arguments and the analysis of the HJB equation. In contrast to prior work under time-separable utilities, Epstein--Zin preferences facilitate calibration. The model-implied mortality closely approximates actual mortality data in the United States and United Kingdom; moreover, the efficacy of healthcare can be calibrated and compared between the two countries.},

The GBCS has a hierarchical decision-making structure: one regulator and multiple rational agents. The regulator is regarded as the global controller and makes the decision first, and then the agents try to optimize their respective objective functions to reach a possible Nash equilibrium as a result of noncooperative dynamic games. The stabilizability problem is whether the regulator can stabilize the system by regulating the Nash equilibrium formed by the agents at the lower level. In this paper, we will first formulate the stabilizability problem of the linear-quadratic GBCS. Some explicit necessary and (or) sufficient algebraic conditions on the stabilizability of GBCS are given by investigating the solvability relationship between the associated algebraic Riccati equations (AREs), the algebraic Riccati inequalities (ARIs), and the linear-quadratic differential games, which is a key technical difficulty of this paper.},

This implies that the folk result doesn&#39;t hold for those pricing rules and that they are not consistent with equilibrium. We derive the necessary conditions for a pricing rule to be consistent with equilibrium and prove that, when a pricing rule satisfies these necessary conditions, the insiders&#39; optimal strategy is absolutely continuous, thus obtaining the classical result in a more general setting. This, furthermore, allows us to justify the standard assumption of absolute continuity of insiders&#39; strategies since one can construct a pricing rule satisfying the necessary conditions derived in the paper that yield the same price process as the pricing rules employed in the modern literature when insiders&#39; strategies are absolutely continuous.},

  abstract     = {We propose a continuous-time version of the adaptive robust methodology introduced in T. R. Bielecki et al. [SIAM J. Control Optim., 57 (2019), pp. 925--946]. An agent solves a stochastic control problem where the underlying uncertainty follows a jump-diffusion process and the agent does not know the drift parameters of the process. The agent considers a set of alternative measures to make the control problem robust to model misspecification and employs a continuous-time estimator to learn the value of the unknown parameters to make the control problem adaptive to the arrival of new information. We use measurable selection theorems to prove the dynamic programming principle of the adaptive robust problem and show that the value function of the agent is characterized by a nonlinear partial differential equation. As an example, we derive the optimal adaptive robust strategy for an agent who acquires a large amount of shares in an order driven market and illustrate the financial performance of the execution strategy.},

  abstract     = {The linear quadratic regulator is the fundamental problem of optimal control. Its state feedback version was set and solved in the early 1960s. However, the static output feedback problem has no explicit-form solution. It is suggested to look at both of them from another point of view as matrix optimization problems, where the variable is a feedback matrix gain. The properties of such a function are investigated; it turns out to be smooth, but not convex, with possible non-connected domain. Nevertheless, the gradient method for it with the special step-size choice converges to the optimal solution in the state feedback case and to a stationary point in the output feedback case. The results can be extended for the general framework of unconstrained optimization and for a reduced gradient method for minimization with equality-type constraints.},

To address this issue, [Y.-J. Huang and Z. Zhou, Math. Oper. Res., 46 (2021), pp. 428--451] propose the notion of strong equilibrium for an infinite-time stochastic control problem in which an agent can control the generator of a time-homogeneous, continuous-time, finite-state Markov chain at each time. We study weak and strong equilibria in a general diffusion framework, provide necessary conditions for a strategy to be a strong equilibrium, and prove that strong equilibrium strategies do not exist for three investment and consumption problems. Finally, we propose a new notion of equilibrium strategies, referred to as regular equilibrium, show that it implies weak equilibrium, provide a sufficient condition under which a weak equilibrium strategy becomes a regular equilibrium, and show that this condition holds for many time-inconsistent problems.},

  abstract     = {Problems involving control of large ensembles of structurally identical dynamical systems, called ensemble control, arise in numerous scientific areas from quantum control and robotics to brain medicine. In many of such applications, control can only be implemented at the population level, i.e., through broadcasting an input signal to all the systems in the population, and this new control paradigm challenges the classical systems theory. In recent years, considerable efforts have been made to investigate controllability properties of ensemble systems, and most works emphasized on linear and some forms of bilinear and nonlinear ensemble systems. In this paper, we study controllability of a broad class of bilinear ensemble systems defined on semisimple Lie groups, for which we define the notion of ensemble controllability through a Riemannian structure of the state space Lie group. Leveraging the Cartan decomposition of semisimple Lie algebras in representation theory, we develop a covering method that decomposes the state space Lie group into a collection of Lie subgroups generating the Lie group, which enables the determination of ensemble controllability by controllability of the subsystems evolving on these Lie subgroups. Using the covering method, we show the equivalence between ensemble and classical controllability, i.e., controllability of each individual system in the ensemble implies ensemble controllability, for bilinear ensemble systems evolving on semisimple Lie groups. This equivalence makes the examination of controllability for infinite-dimensional ensemble systems as tractable as for a finite-dimensional single system.},

By performing scattering transformation of the input and output variables at each end of the communication link between two DAI controllers, and transmitting the scattered variables instead of the controller output, stability of the nominal frequency is guaranteed.

Using the knowledge of $\Lambda$ we construct a sequence of Neumann boundary values so that at a time $T$ the corresponding waves converge to zero while the time derivative of the waves converge to a delta distribution. The limit of such waves can be considered as a wave produced by an artificial point source. The convergence of the wave takes place in the function spaces naturally related to the energy of the wave.

The inertial dynamics are governed by a Hessian-driven damping term associated with the convex function to be minimized and potential effects induced by the linear constraints. We provide conditions on both the damping and the potential for which the solutions converge towards some feasible point of the convex minimization problem; this convergence is towards some minimizer provided that the solutions&#39; initial data is specifically preselected. In addition, we present asymptotic estimates on the convergence rate of the solutions depending on the interaction between damping and potential effects. Our analysis is mainly based on energy-like arguments that capture the dissipative nature of the inertial dynamics by means of a Bregman distance. We complement our study with the fact that the second-order dynamics admit a first-order representation in terms of the Arrow--Hurwicz differential system. Numerical experiments further illustrate our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {We consider optimal control problems for a wide class of bilateral obstacle problems where the control appears in a possibly nonlinear source term. The nondifferentiability of the solution operator poses the main challenge for the application of efficient optimization methods, and the characterization of Bouligand generalized derivatives of the solution operator is essential for their theoretical foundation and numerical realization. In this paper, we derive specific elements of the Bouligand generalized differential if the control operator satisfies natural monotonicity properties. We construct monotone sequences of controls where the solution operator is Gâteaux differentiable and characterize the corresponding limit element of the Bouligand generalized differential as being the solution operator of a Dirichlet problem on a quasi-open domain. In contrast to a similar recent result for the unilateral obstacle problem [A.-T. Rauls and S. Ulbrich, SIAM J. Control Optim., 57 (2019), pp. 3223--3248], we have to deal with an opposite monotonic behavior of the active and strictly active sets corresponding to the upper and lower obstacle. Moreover, the residual is no longer a nonnegative functional on $H^{-1}$, and its representation as the difference of two nonnegative Radon measures requires special care. This necessitates new proof techniques that yield two elements of the Bouligand generalized differential. Also for the unilateral case we obtain an additional element to that derived in [A.-T. Rauls and S. Ulbrich, SIAM J. Control Optim., 57 (2019), pp. 3223--3248].},

Such a new control design is first developed for nominal (uncertainty-free) control-separation LQ solutions using reduced Hamiltonian under different relative degree conditions and for finite-time and infinite-time cases and is demonstrated to have the capability to improve system performance as compared with traditional LQ solutions. Based on the developed new controller structure, the adaptive disturbance rejection problem is solved by developing a stable adaptive parameter estimation algorithm for the two-component control law, to ensure desired system stabilization and output regulation in the presence of system and disturbance uncertainties.

Although much work has been conducted on analyzing controllability properties, the most used tool remains the Lie algebra rank condition. In this paper, we develop alternative approaches based on theory and techniques in combinatorics to study controllability of bilinear systems. The core idea of our methodology is to represent vector fields of a bilinear system by permutations or graphs, so that Lie brackets are represented by permutation multiplications or graph operations, respectively. Following these representations, we derive combinatorial characterization of controllability for bilinear systems, which consequently provides novel applications of symmetric group and graph theory to control theory. Moreover, the developed combinatorial approaches are compatible with Lie algebra decompositions, including the Cartan and nonintertwining decomposition. This compatibility enables the exploitation of representation theory for analyzing controllability, which allows us to characterize controllability properties of bilinear systems governed by semisimple and reductive Lie algebras.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines the finite horizon optimal control problem and infinite horizon stabilization problem for Markov jump linear system (MJLS) with input delay. The essential obstacle encountered in this paper is that the optimal controller cannot be represented as a product of a deterministic gain and a state predictor. This paper presents a complete solution to the problems: (1) For the finite horizon, the necessary and sufficient solvability condition of the optimal control and the analytical controller are given based on the modified coupled difference Riccati equation defined herein. (2) For the infinite horizon, the necessary and sufficient stabilization conditions are explored under explicit expressions, and the optimal controller is designed with a modified coupled algebraic Riccati equation (CARE). We show that under the exact observability assumption, the MJLS with input delay is stabilizable in the mean-square sense with the optimal controller if and only if the CARE has a particular positive definite solution. The introduction of a delayed forward and backward Markov difference equation and the definition of a new type of Lyapunov function form the basic tools to solving this problem.},

  abstract     = {Suppose that a continuous-time linear infinite-dimensional system with a static state-feedback controller is strongly stable. We address the following question: If we convert the continuous-time controller to a sampled-data controller by applying an idealized sampler and a zero-order hold, will the resulting sampled-data system be strongly stable for all sufficiently small sampling periods? In this paper, we restrict our attention to the situation where the generator of the open-loop system is a Riesz-spectral operator and its point spectrum has a limit point at the origin. We present conditions under which the answer to the above question is affirmative. In the robustness analysis, we show that the sufficient condition for strong stability obtained in the Arendt--Batty--Lyubich--Vu͂ theorem is preserved between the original continuous-time system and the sampled-data system under fast sampling.},

  abstract     = {Although there have been many recent papers on the robust stability of full information estimation (FIE) and moving horizon estimation (MHE), all existing results are limited in some way, whether because convergence is not guaranteed in the presence of convergent disturbances [L. Ji, J. B. Rawlings, W. Hu, A. Wynn, and M. M. Diehl, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 61 (2016), pp. 3509--3514; W. Hu, Robust Stability of Optimization-based State Estimation Under Bounded Disturbances, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01903.pdf, 2017], boundedness of estimate error is not guaranteed in the presence of bounded disturbances [J. B. Rawlings and L. Ji, J. Process Control, 22 (2012), pp. 1439--1444], the class of stage costs is not sufficiently general to permit least squares objectives [S. Knüfer and M. A. Müller, in Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 2018, pp. 3477--3482], or the robustness bounds become worse with increasing horizon length [M. A. Müller, Automatica, 79 (2017), pp. 306--314; D. A. Allan and J. B. Rawlings, in Handbook of Model Predictive Control, Springer, New York, 2019, pp. 99--124]. Even when all these properties are found together in MHE [W. Hu, Robust Stability of Optimization-based State Estimation Under Bounded Disturbances, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01903.pdf, 2017; M. A. Müller, Automatica, 79 (2017), pp. 306--314], they are possible only due to a modified cost function containing a “max-term” penalizing the largest single stage cost, and convergence for MHE does not imply a proof of convergence for FIE. Here, we introduce a new definition of robust stability that implies both boundedness (for bounded disturbances) and convergence (for convergent disturbances). By constructing a Lyapunov-like function, termed a Q function, we show that “traditional” FIE satisfies this new definition given exponential detectability, exponential stabilizability, and a suitable stage cost that admits power law upper and lower bounds. This result for FIE is then used to show that, given a sufficiently large estimation horizon, MHE inherits these properties of robust stability and convergence. Of particular note is that, unlike most existing results, the robustness bounds for MHE get better with increasing horizon length.},

Using concepts from input-to-state stability and network small-gain theory, we first establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of linear positive systems described by Metzler matrices. Specifically, we derive two sets of stability conditions based on two forms of input-to-state stability gains for Metzler systems, namely max-interconnection gains and sum-interconnection gains. Based on the max-interconnection gains, we show that the cyclic small-gain theorem becomes necessary and sufficient for the stability of Metzler systems; based on the sum-interconnection gains, we obtain novel graph-theoretic conditions for the stability of Metzler systems. All these conditions highlight the role of cycles in the interconnection graph and unveil how the structural properties of the graph affect stability. Finally, we extend our results to the nonlinear monotone system and obtain similar sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability.},

In particular we consider the convergence of policy gradient methods in the setting of known and unknown parameters. We are able to produce a global linear convergence guarantee for this approach in the setting of finite time horizon and stochastic state dynamics under weak assumptions. The convergence of a projected policy gradient method is also established in order to handle problems with constraints. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm with two examples. The first example is the optimal liquidation of a holding in an asset. We show results for the case where we assume a model for the underlying dynamics and where we apply the method to the data directly. The empirical evidence suggests that the policy gradient method can learn the global optimal solution for a larger class of stochastic systems containing the LQR framework, and that it is more robust with respect to model misspecification when compared to a model-based approach. The second example is an LQR system in a higher dimensional setting with synthetic data.},

The system is discretized by a constant discontinuous Galerkin method in time and usual conforming linear finite elements in space. For the uncontrolled equation, we prove linear convergence in time and an order of $\mathcal{O}(h^{\frac{3}{2}-\epsilon})$ for the discretization error in space. Our main result regarding the optimal control problem is the uniform convergence of $dG(0)cG(1)$-discrete controls to ${\overline{l}}\in{H^1_{{0}}(0,T;L^2(\Omega))}$.

Its sensitivity w.r.t. parameter variations can be described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Starting from an arbitrary initial Pareto-optimal solution, the Pareto front can then be traced by numerical integration. We provide an error analysis based on Lipschitz properties and suggest an explicit Runge--Kutta method for the numerical solution of the ODE. The method is validated and compared with a predictor-corrector method on biobjective convex quadratic programming problems and the biobjective test function ZDT3, for which the exact solution is explicitly known and numerically tested on complex biobjective shape optimization problems involving finite element discretizations of the state equation.},

Control Related Fields, 2 (2012), pp. 271--329] models, and reveal some interesting aspects that appear for the first time in the literature. We illustrate the usefulness of the model and the results by a number of examples in dynamic portfolio selection, including mean-variance with state-dependent risk aversion, investment/consumption with nonexponential discounting, and utility-deviation-risk with coupled terminal state and expected terminal state.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a relaxed control regularization with general exploration rewards to design robust feedback controls for multidimensional continuous-time stochastic exit time problems. We establish that the regularized control problem admits a Hölder continuous optimal feedback control and demonstrate that both the value function and the feedback control of the regularized control problem are Lipschitz stable with respect to parameter perturbations. Moreover, we show that a precomputed feedback relaxed control gives a robust performance in a perturbed system and derive a first-order sensitivity equation for both the value function and optimal feedback relaxed control. These stability results provide a theoretical justification for recent reinforcement learning heuristics, including that an exploration reward in the optimization objective leads to more robust decision-making. We finally prove first-order monotone convergence of the value functions for relaxed control problems with vanishing exploration parameters, which subsequently enables us to construct the pure exploitation strategy of the original control problem based on the feedback relaxed controls.},

The company can increase its level of installed power by irreversible installations of solar panels. The electricity price evolves as an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, whose drift is negatively impacted by the current level of the company&#39;s installed power. The company aims at maximizing the total expected profits from selling electricity in the market, net of the total expected proportional costs of installation. This problem is modeled as a two-dimensional degenerate singular stochastic control problem. We find that the optimal installation strategy is triggered by a curve which separates the waiting region, where it is not optimal to install additional panels, and the installation region, where it is. Such a curve is the unique strictly increasing solution of a first-order ordinary differential equation. Finally, we show numerically the dependence of the optimal installation strategy on the model&#39;s parameters.},

The strategy of proof consists in relating the worst decay rate to optimal control questions and studying in detail their solutions. As a by-product of our analysis, we also obtain estimates for the worst $L_2$-gain of the time-varying linear control systems $\dot x=-cc^\top x+u$, where the signal $c$ is persistently excited, thus solving an open problem posed by Rantzer in 1999.},

For instance, it is known that any system that admits a robustly stable full-order observer (i.e., a system evolving in the same state space as the original system stabilized by output injection) must be i-IOSS. Nevertheless, there are many types of state estimator (such as moving horizon estimation and extended Kalman filtering) that are not such observers. Additionally, while other input-to-state-like properties have been characterized by storage functions with associated converse theorems, no converse theorem exists for i-IOSS. Here, we demonstrate that any system that admits a robustly stable state estimator must be i-IOSS, and, building on techniques developed for incremental input-to-state stability, provide an i-IOSS converse theorem. We also provide a result about changing supply rates for a general storage function, and apply it to an i-IOSS Lyapunov function as a corollary.},

We consider a general class of Lebesgue measurable switching signals. We provide an equivalence property showing that uniform input-to-state stability can be equivalently studied through the class of piecewise-constant inputs and piecewise-constant switching signals. Thanks to this equivalence property, we rely on what it is developed in the literature to provide direct and converse theorems for uniform input-to-state, asymptotic, and exponential stability. Based on these results, we give a first-order approximation theorem for nonlinear switching retarded systems. A link between the exponential stability of an unforced switching retarded system and the input-to-state stability property, in the case of measurable switching signals, is obtained. Examples showing the applicability of our results are also given.},

The problem is posed as solving a finite number of trigonometric moment equations for a nonnegative matricial measure, which is well known as the covariance extension problem in the literature of systems and control. This inverse problem and its various generalizations have been extensively studied in the past three decades, and they find applications in diverse fields such as modeling and system identification, signal and image processing, robust control, circuit theory, etc. In this paper, we address the challenging M$^2$ version of the problem, and elaborate on a solution technique via convex optimization with the $\tau$-divergence family. As a major contribution of this work, we show that by properly choosing the parameter of the divergence index, the optimal spectrum is a rational function, that is, the solution is a spectral density which can be represented by a finite-dimensional system, as desired in many practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by its broad applications in machine learning and reinforcement learning, we study the linear two-time-scale stochastic approximation, an iterative method using two different step sizes for finding the solutions of a system of two equations. Our main focus is to characterize the finite-time complexity of this method under time-varying step sizes and Markov randomness. In particular, we show that the mean square errors of the variables generated by the method converge to zero at a sublinear rate ${\cal O}(k^{2/3})$, where $k$ is the number of iterations. We then improve the performance of this method by considering the restarting scheme, where we restart the algorithm after every predetermined number of iterations. We show that using this restarting method the complexity of the algorithm under time-varying step sizes is as good as the one using constant step sizes, but still achieving an exact convergence to the desired solution. Moreover, the restarting scheme also helps to prevent the step sizes from getting too small, which is useful for the practical implementation of the linear two-time-scale stochastic approximation.},

By constructing a class of proper Yosida strong solution approximating systems and using the infinite-dimensional version of Itô&#39;s formula, several novel Lyapunov-based sufficient criteria are given to ensure the SISS of mild solutions of the studied systems with destabilizing and stabilizing impulses, respectively. It should be pointed out that the SISS-Lyapunov function is nonexponential, which contains the exponential SISS-Lyapunov function as a special case. The average dwell time condition and the reverse average dwell time condition are respectively imposed to restrict the occurrence frequency of destabilizing and stabilizing impulses, which are more general than the fixed dwell time condition. As a subsequent result, the SISS of interconnected systems on networks is investigated by the Lyapunov method and the graph-theoretic technique. A new way of construction of the SISS-Lyapunov function for the entire interconnected systems on networks is provided by the SISS-vertex-Lyapunov functions and the interconnected topological structure. Finally, two examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the main results.},

A solution is proposed in this paper to regulate the class of discrete-time linear systems whose open loop poles are located inside or on the unit circle. With the delay below an established upper bound, a memoryless delay-adaptive feedback design achieves the convergence of the system state and input to zero as time approaches infinity. In the event that the system has all its open loop poles strictly inside the unit circle or at $z=1$, regulation is achieved for any, arbitrarily large, bounded delay without resorting to any knowledge of the delay. The proposed delay-adaptive control design utilizes only the state at the current time instant for feedback, resulting in a memoryless feedback law convenient for implementation.},

The aim of the paper is to investigate the uniform synchronization at the infinite horizon for one abstract linear second order evolution system in a Hilbert space. First, using the classical compact perturbation theory on the uniform stability of semigroups of contractions, we will establish a lower bound on the number of damping, necessary for the uniform synchronization of the considered system. Then, under the minimum number of damping, we clarify the algebraic structure of the system as well as the necessity of the conditions of compatibility on the coupling matrices. We then establish the uniform synchronization by the compact perturbation method and then give the dynamics of the asymptotic orbit. Various applications are given for the system of wave equations with boundary feedback or (and) locally distributed feedback, and for the system of Kirchhoff plate with distributed feedback. Some open questions are raised at the end of the paper for future development. The study is based on the synchronization theory and the compact perturbation of semigroups.},

  abstract     = {Internal positivity offers a computationally cheap certificate for external (input-output) positivity of a linear time-invariant system. However, the drawback with this certificate lies in its realization dependency. First, computing such a realization requires finding a polyhedral cone with a potentially high number of extremal generators that lifts the dimension of the state-space representation, significantly. Second, not all externally positive systems possess an internally positive realization. Third, in many typical applications such as controller design, system identification, and model order reduction, internal positivity is not preserved. To overcome these drawbacks, we present a tractable sufficient certificate of external positivity based on second-order cones. This certificate does not require any special state-space realization: if it succeeds with a possibly non-minimal realization, then it will do so with any minimal realization. While there exist systems where this certificate is also necessary, we also demonstrate how to construct systems, where both second-order and polyhedral cones as well as other certificates fail. Nonetheless, in contrast to other realization independent certificates, the second-order-cone one appears to be favorable in terms of applicability and conservatism. Three applications are representatively discussed to underline its potential. We show how the certificate can be used to find externally positive approximations of nearly externally positive systems and demonstrate that this may help to reduce system identification errors. The same algorithm is used then to design state-feedback controllers that provide closed-loop external positivity, a common approach to avoid over- and undershooting of the step response. Last, we present modifications to generalized balanced truncation such that external positivity is preserved for those systems, where our certificate applies.},

Nevertheless, when it includes affine state constraints, it remains very challenging from the classical “maximum principle” perspective. In this study we present how matrix-valued reproducing kernels allow for an alternative viewpoint. We show that the quadratic objective paired with the linear dynamics encode the relevant kernel, defining a Hilbert space of controlled trajectories. Drawing upon kernel formalism, we introduce a strengthened continuous-time convex optimization problem which can be tackled exactly with finite-dimensional solvers, and which solution is interior to the constraints. When refining a time-discretization grid, this solution can be made arbitrarily close to the solution of the state-constrained linear quadratic regulator. We illustrate the implementation of this method on a path-planning problem.},

All these derivatives can be computed simultaneously in just one integration of the state and costate dynamics.

The arising optimization problem is nonsmooth for several reasons, in particular, since the control-to-state mapping is not single-valued. We therefore apply a Yosida-regularization (resp., vanishing viscosity approach) to obtain a single-valued control-to-state operator. Beside the existence of optimal solutions, their approximation by means of this regularization approach is the main subject of this work. It turns out that a so-called reverse approximation guaranteeing the existence of a suitable recovery sequence can only be shown under an additional smoothness assumption on at least one optimal solution.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the steady-state Kalman filtering over the random delay and packet drop channel, motivated by the state estimation in wireless sensor networks and networked control systems. Such systems induce both packet drops and time-varying delays. Assuming the Bernoulli processes for random delays and packet drops and enforcing nonrepetitive observations, we show that the channel states associated with random delays and packet drops form a finite Markov chain, and can thus be modeled as a finite state discrete Markov process. Furthermore, the composite system consisting of the process model and output communication channels results in a special type of the Markov jump linear systems. Design results for the steady-state Kalman filter over the channel of random delays and packet drops are presented, including the stabilizability and detectability conditions in the mean-square sense. The steady-state Kalman filtering results over the random delay and packet drop channel are illustrated by a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {The optimal transport problem has recently developed into a powerful framework for various applications in estimation and control. Many of the recent advances in the theory and application of optimal transport are based on regularizing the problem with an entropy term, which connects it to the Schrödinger bridge problem and thus to stochastic optimal control. Moreover, the entropy regularization makes the otherwise computationally demanding optimal transport problem feasible even for large scale settings. This has led to an accelerated development of optimal transport based methods in a broad range of fields. Many of these applications have an underlying graph structure, for instance, information fusion and tracking problems can be described by trees. In this work we consider multimarginal optimal transport problems with a cost function that decouples according to a tree structure. The entropy regularized multimarginal optimal transport problem can be viewed as a generalization of the Schrödinger bridge problem with the same tree-structure, and by utilizing these connections we extend the computational methods for the classical optimal transport problem in order to solve structured multimarginal optimal transport problems in an efficient manner. In particular, the algorithm requires only matrix-vector multiplications of relatively small dimensions. We show that the multimarginal regularization introduces less diffusion, compared to the commonly used pairwise regularization, and is therefore more suitable for many applications. Numerical examples illustrate this, and we finally apply the proposed framework for the tracking of an ensemble of indistinguishable agents.},

We use microlocal defect measures and the unique continuation property of eigenfunctions to prove that an appropriate observability inequality holds for wave equations with space varying and different speeds coupled by a single control function. For the unique continuation property of eigenfunctions, we construct a counterexample to show that in some metrics, the unique continuation property does not hold. Moreover, we study different conditions to ensure the unique continuation property. We also extend our result to the case of constant coefficients and possibly multiple control functions.

It is assumed that the fund manager can dynamically inject capital into the portfolio account such that the total capital dominates a nondecreasing benchmark floor process at each intermediate time. The tracking problem is formulated to minimize the cost of accumulated capital injection. We first transform the original problem with floor constraints into an unconstrained control problem, but under a running maximum cost. By identifying a controlled state process with reflection, the problem is further shown to be equivalent to an auxiliary problem, which leads to a nonlinear Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation with a Neumann boundary condition. By employing the dual transform, the probabilistic representation, and some stochastic flow analysis, the existence of a unique classical solution to the HJB equation is established. The verification theorem is carefully proved, which gives a complete characterization of the feedback optimal portfolio. The application to market index tracking is also discussed when the index process is modeled by a geometric Brownian motion.},

We show that the manipulative agent can steer the network opinion to any arbitrary value in finite time (i.e., the system is controllable) almost surely when there is no restriction on her influence. However, when the control input is sparsity constrained, the network opinion is controllable with some probability. We lower bound this probability using the concentration properties of random vectors based on the Lévy concentration function and small ball probabilities. Our theoretical and numerical results shed light on how controllability of the network opinion depends on the parameters such as the size and the connectivity of the network and sity constraints faced by the manipulative agent.},

When interactions between players are of mean field kind, we relate Nash equilibria for such games to an asymptotic notion of dynamic Cournot--Nash equilibria. Inspired by the works of Blanchet and Carlier for the static situation, we interpret dynamic Cournot--Nash equilibria in the light of causal optimal transport theory. Further specializing to games of potential type, we establish existence, uniqueness, and characterization of equilibria. Moreover we develop, for the first time, a numerical scheme for causal optimal transport, which is then leveraged in order to compute dynamic Cournot--Nash equilibria.

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to the theoretical and numerical study of an optimal design problem in high-temperature superconductivity (HTS). The shape optimization problem is to find an optimal superconductor shape minimizes a certain cost functional under a given target on the electric field over a specific domain of interest. For the governing PDE-model, we consider an elliptic curl-curl variational inequality (VI) of the second kind with an L1-type nonlinearity. In particular, the nonsmooth VI character and the involved H(curl)-structure make the corresponding shape sensitivity analysis challenging. To tackle the nonsmoothness, a penalized dual VI formulation is proposed, leading to the Gateaux differentiability of the corresponding dual variable mapping. This property allows us to derive the distributed shape derivative of the cost functional through rigorous shape calculus on the basis of the averaged adjoint method. The developed shape derivative turns out to be uniformly stable with respect to the penalization parameter, and strong convergence of the penalized problem is guaranteed. Based on the achieved theoretical findings, we propose three-dimensional numerical solutions, realized using a level set algorithm and a Newton method with the Nédélec edge element discretization. Numerical results indicate a favorable and efficient performance of the proposed approach for a specific HTS application in superconducting shielding.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies stability of stochastic impulsive switched systems with deterministic state-dependent impulses and switches. Here, “deterministic state-dependent” means that both switching and impulsive rules are deterministic and related to system states. Since impulses and switches are not necessarily synchronous, we first investigate stochastic impulsive switched systems with asynchronous time-dependent impulses and switches. Both the existence and convergence of the system solution are studied, and stability conditions are derived via the tradeoff between two average dwell-times for switching and impulsive time sequences. For the state-dependent case, based on active regions for the switching and assigned regions for the impulses, we first develop impulsive and switching rules such that both impulsive and switching times are stopping times, then verify the existence and uniqueness of the system solution, and finally establish stability conditions. Furthermore, we discuss the combination of time-dependent and state-dependent cases, and investigate the quasi solution of the system to relax the assumption on active regions. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the derived results.},

While the link between gap metric uncertainty and the small-gain theorem is clearly drawn already in Georgiou and Smith&#39;s original seminal work, the contribution of this paper is to provide an extensive treatise on the relation between these robust stability type theorems and the nonlinear small-gain type theorems in multiple scenarios. Here a special case of the nonlinear small-gain theorem using gain functions is shown to be equivalent to a fundamental robust stability theorem of Georgiou and Smith for feedback systems. Since existence of solutions is a fundamental requirement of a feedback system and typically it is harder to establish than the uniqueness of solutions, we also show that both global and local forms of the nonlinear small-gain theorem which establish existence and boundedness properties simultaneously imply the corresponding types of Georgiou and Smith&#39;s robust stability theorem in gain function formulation. Moreover, if we only consider the boundedness for both theorems in the local setting, we show that the equivalence between them can be similarly established as in the global setting.},

We apply this result to a subclass of perturbed problems and further prove that the solution of this subclass is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the perturbation and constant of order $O(h)$.

We assume the Chow--Rashevski--Hörmander condition at rank $k$ (at most $k$ Lie brackets are needed to span the tangent space) together with analyticity of $\mathcal{M}$ and the coefficients of $\mathscr{L}$. We prove that the energy decays at rate $\log(t)^{-\frac{1}{k}}$ (resp., $\log(t)^{-\frac{2}{k}}$) for data in the domain of the generator of the associated group. We show that this decay is optimal on a family of Baouendi--Grushin-type operators. This result follows from a perturbative argument (of independent interest) showing, in a general abstract setting, that quantitative approximate observability/controllability results for wave-type equations imply a priori decay rates for associated damped wave, Schrödinger, and plate equations. The adapted quantitative approximate observability/controllability theorem for hypoelliptic waves is obtained by the authors in [J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS), 21 (2019), pp. 957--1069] and [Mem. Amer.

For finite spaces, a theorem due to Blackwell leads to a complete characterization on when one information structure is better than another. For stochastic games, in general, such an ordering is not possible since additional information can lead to equilibria perturbations with positive or negative values to a player. However, for zero-sum games in a finite probability space, Peͅski introduced a complete characterization of ordering of information structures. In this paper, we obtain an infinite-dimensional (standard Borel) generalization of Peͅski&#39;s result. A corollary is that more information cannot hurt a decision maker taking part in a zero-sum game. We establish two supporting results which are essential and explicit though modest improvements on prior literature: (i) a partial converse to Blackwell&#39;s ordering in the standard Borel setup and (ii) an existence result for equilibria in zero-sum games with incomplete information.},

The control process linearly affects an abstract evolution equation on a suitable partially ordered infinite-dimensional space $X$, it takes values in the positive cone of $X$, and it has right-continuous and nondecreasing paths. Our main contribution is to provide a rigorous formulation of the problem by properly defining the controlled dynamics and integrals with respect to the control process, and then to derive necessary and sufficient first-order conditions for optimality. The latter are finally exploited in a specification of the model where we determine an optimal control. The techniques used are those of semigroup theory, vector-valued integration, convex analysis, and general theory of stochastic processes.},

The paper is divided into two parts, the first one focusing on linear controls and the last one dealing with saturated laws. For the linear case, the global exponential $BV$ stability is proved. For the saturated case, it is discussed that we cannot expect to have a basin of attraction larger than the region of linearity in a $BV$ context. We rather prove an $L^\infty$ local stability result. An explicit estimate of the basin of attraction is given. The Lyapunov functional is inspired from Glimm&#39;s seminal work [J. Glimm, Comm.

Special attention is given to sparsity effects, where with the inclusion of convex nondifferentiable regularization terms to the cost functional, we can infer from the first-order optimality conditions that the optimal drug concentrations can vanish on certain time intervals.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we provide an essentially complete answer to the question of minimal initial data required to solve an overdetermined system of linear partial difference equations with real constant coefficients using the notion of characteristic sets. A characteristic set is a special subset of the domain with the defining property that for every solution trajectory of the system of equations, the knowledge of the solution trajectory restricted to this set uniquely determines the trajectory over the whole domain. We emphasize the fact that subsets which are sublattices and unions of finitely many parallel translates of such sublattices are best suited to answer the question of the minimality of initial data. We first provide an algebraic characterization of a sublattice to be a characteristic sublattice. The main result of this paper provides conditions under which a system admits a union of a sublattice and finitely many parallel translates of it as a characteristic set; an important condition is the rank of the sublattice being equal to the Krull dimension of the system. For the condition when the rank of the sublattice is strictly less than the Krull dimension of the system, we show that neither the sublattice nor a finite union of sublattices can be a characteristic set. For the case when the rank of the sublattice is strictly greater than the Krull dimension of the system, a union of the sublattice and finitely many parallel translates of it is a characteristic set. But, unlike the case when the rank of the sublattice is equal to the Krull dimension of the system, in this case a proper sublattice of the given sublattice exists which along with its finitely many parallel translates now qualify as a characteristic set. We also show that for a given overdetermined system of partial difference equations, a characteristic set of the form given by a union of a sublattice and finitely many parallel translates of it always exists.},

The diffusion problem is modeled by the $p$-Laplacian operator. It is well known that this type of problem has no solution in general and then that it is necessary to work with a relaxed formulation. In the present paper, we obtain such relaxed formulation using the homogenization theory; i.e., we replace both materials by microscopic mixtures of them. Then we get some uniqueness results and a system of optimality conditions. As a consequence, we prove some regularity properties for the optimal solutions of the relaxed problem. Namely, we show that the flux is in the Sobolev space $H^1(\Omega)^N$ and that the optimal proportion of the materials is derivable in the orthogonal direction to the flux. This will imply that the unrelaxed problem has no solution in general. Our results extend those obtained by the first author for the Laplace operator.},

The numerical estimation is based on the regularized output least-squares formulation, with an $H^1(\Omega)$ penalty. We prove the well-posedness of the continuous formulation, e.g., existence and stability. Next, we develop a fully discrete scheme based on the Galerkin finite element method in space and backward Euler convolution quadrature in time. We prove the subsequential convergence of the sequence of discrete solutions to a solution of the continuous problem as the discretization parameters (mesh size and time step size) tend to zero. Further, under an additional regularity condition on the exact coefficient, we derive convergence rates in a weighted $L^2(\Omega)$ norm for the discrete approximations to the exact coefficient in the one- and two-dimensional cases. The analysis relies heavily on suitable nonstandard nonsmooth data error estimates for the direct problem. We provide illustrative numerical results to support the theoretical study.},

Here, we suppose that the initial and the boundary data switch between different $C^1$-functions at certain switching points, where the $C^1$-functions and the switching points are considered as the control. For a class of cost functionals, we prove first order necessary optimality conditions for the corresponding optimal control problem with state constraints. Furthermore, we use a Moreau--Yosida type regularization to approximate the optimal control problem with state constraints. We derive optimality conditions for the regularized problems and finally prove convergence to the solution of the optimal control problem with state constraints.},

When the control is valued in some subsets of Lebesgue spaces, the usual extensions are either too coarse (allowing in fact only very restricted nonlinearities) or too fine (being nonmetrizable). To overcome these drawbacks, a compromising convex compactification is here devised, combining classical techniques for Young measures with Choquet theory.

We also study the case of composite materials, having in mind applications in the sensitivity analysis of mechanical devices manufactured by additive printing. The main idea, which rests on the computation of the derivative of a minimum with respect to a parameter, was successfully applied in the scalar case in the first part of this paper and is here extended to more interesting situations in the vectorial case (linear elasticity), with applications in additive manufacturing. These computations for eigenvalues in the elasticity problem for generalized boundary conditions and for composite elastic structures constitute the main novelty of this paper. The results obtained here also show the efficiency of this method for such calculations whereas the methods used previously even for classical clamped or transmission boundary conditions are more lengthy or are based on various simplifying assumptions, such as the simplicity of the eigenvalue or the existence of a shape derivative.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the stability problem for a class of switched dynamic systems with logic switching signals is investigated. Emphasis is placed on the stability of logically switched dynamic systems (LSDSs) derived by using logic and switching rules. First, the so-called LSDSs giving a further extension of switched dynamic systems is designed for the first time, which is formulated in a hybrid form of a switched dynamic system and a logical dynamic system. Second, the concept of global uniform exponential stability is extended to the one for the LSDSs. It is illustrated that some traditional concepts of stability can be seen as special cases of the extended stability. Third, through the mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT), average cycle dwell time (ACDT), stable cyclic sequence dependent average cycle dwell time (S-ACDT), and unstable cyclic sequence dependent average cycle dwell time (U-ACDT), the stability problem for LSDSs with all stable or partly stable subsystems is solved. In other words, based on multiple Lyapunov functions and a digital transformation approach, the stability criteria for LSDSs containing all stable subsystems or partially unstable subsystems are obtained in the nonlinear case. Correspondingly, the stability conditions for LSDSs are also derived in the linear case. Finally, two examples are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the established results.},

The notion provides a perspective that explains how a state trajectory of one BCN can be paired with a state trajectory of another BCN, and vice versa. The present paper further pursues the notion of bisimulation in BCNs. It first gives necessary and sufficient conditions for checking this notion. The conditions are more general and neater than those previously published; more importantly, they allow us to go further to consider reducing a BCN via bisimulation. A bisimulation-based methodology is then proposed to reduce the size of the state space of a BCN. Applying the reduction methodology allows one to infer control properties of a BCN from those of the corresponding reduced system. Possibilities of applications of the results are illustrated on several Boolean models of real biomolecular systems.},

In addition to this new calculus, we provide relations for the resulting system to the first-order optimality system derived on the particle level and the first-order optimality system based on $L^2$-calculus under additional regularity assumptions. We further justify the use of the $L^2$-adjoint in numerical simulations by establishing a link between the adjoint in the space of probability measures and the adjoint corresponding to $L^2$-calculus. Moreover, we prove a convergence rate for the convergence of the optimal controls corresponding to the particle formulation to the optimal controls of the mean-field problem as the number of particles tends to infinity.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers linear-quadratic (LQ) stochastic leader-follower Stackelberg differential games for jump-diffusion systems with random coefficients. We first solve the LQ problem of the follower using the stochastic maximum principle and obtain the state-feedback representation of the open-loop optimal solution in terms of the integro-stochastic Riccati differential equation (ISRDE), where the state-feedback-type control is shown to be optimal via the completion of squares method. Next, we establish the stochastic maximum principle for the indefinite LQ stochastic optimal control problem of the leader using the variational method. However, to obtain the state-feedback representation of the open-loop solution for the leader, there is a technical challenge due to the jump process. To overcome this limitation, we consider two different cases, in which the state-feedback-type optimal control for the leader in terms of the ISRDE can be characterized by generalizing the Four-Step Scheme. Finally, in these two cases, we show that the state-feedback representation of the open-loop optimal solutions for the leader and the follower constitutes the Stackelberg equilibrium. Note that the (indefinite) LQ control problem of the leader is new and nontrivial due to the coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equation constraint induced by the rational behavior of the follower.},

In both contexts, we show under a weak detectability assumption that a Luenberger-like observer may reconstruct the so-called observable subspace of the system. However, since no exact observability hypothesis is required, only a weak convergence of the observer holds in general. Additional conditions on the system are required to show the strong convergence.

First, we introduce two notions called exchangeable teams and symmetric information structures. We show that in convex exchangeable team problems an optimal policy exhibits a symmetry structure. We give a characterization for such symmetrically optimal teams for a general class of convex dynamic team problems under a mild conditional independence condition. In addition, through concentration of measure arguments, we establish the convergence of optimal policies for teams with $N$ decision makers to the corresponding optimal policies for symmetric mean-field teams with infinitely many decision makers. As a by-product, we present an existence result for convex mean-field teams, where the main contribution of our paper is with respect to the information structure in the system when compared with the related results in the literature that have assumed either a classical information structure or a static information structure. We also apply these results to the important special case of linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) team problems, where while for partially nested LQG team problems with finite time horizons it is known that the optimal policies are linear, for infinite horizon problems the linearity of optimal policies has not been established in full generality. We also study average cost finite and infinite horizon dynamic team problems with a symmetric partially nested information structure and obtain globally optimal solutions where we establish linearity of optimal policies.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we provide a system theoretic treatment of a new class of multilinear time-invariant (MLTI) systems in which the states, inputs, and outputs are tensors, and the system evolution is governed by multilinear operators. The MLTI system representation is based on the Einstein product and even-order paired tensors. There is a particular tensor unfolding which gives rise to an isomorphism from this tensor space to the general linear group, i.e., the group of invertible matrices. By leveraging this unfolding operation, one can extend classical linear time-invariant (LTI) system notions, including stability, reachability, and observability, to MLTI systems. While the unfolding-based formulation is a powerful theoretical construct, the computational advantages of MLTI systems can only be fully realized while working with the tensor form, where hidden patterns/structures can be exploited for efficient representations and computations. Along these lines, we establish new results which enable one to express tensor unfolding--based stability, reachability, and observability criteria in terms of more standard notions of tensor ranks/decompositions. In addition, we develop a generalized CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition-- and tensor train decomposition--based model reduction framework, which can significantly reduce the number of MLTI system parameters.

In the maximum likelihood approach, this can be achieved using stochastic gradient search, where the underlying gradient estimation is based on the optimal filter and the optimal filter derivative. However, the optimal filter and its derivative are not analytically tractable for a nonlinear state-space model and need to be approximated numerically. In [G. Poyiadjis, A. Doucet, and S. S. Singh, Biometrika, 98 (2011), pp. 65--80], a particle approximation to this derivative has been proposed, while the corresponding central limit theorem and $L_{p}$ error bounds have been established in [P.

They are essential when modeling physical saturation in control systems and constraints of motion as well as studying projection-based numerical optimization algorithms. Motivated by the emerging application of feedback-based continuous-time optimization schemes that rely on the physical system to enforce nonlinear hard constraints, we study the fundamental properties of these dynamics on general locally Euclidean sets. Among others, we propose the use of Krasovskii solutions, show their existence on nonconvex, irregular subsets of low-regularity Riemannian manifolds, and investigate how they relate to conventional Carathéodory solutions. Furthermore, we establish conditions for uniqueness, thereby introducing a generalized definition of prox-regularity which is suitable for nonflat domains. Finally, we use these results to study the stability and convergence of projected gradient flows as an illustrative application of our framework. We provide simple counterexamples for our main results to illustrate the necessity of our already weak assumptions.},

  abstract     = {An optimal ergodic control (EC) problem is investigated for a linear stochastic differential equation with quadratic cost functional. Constant nonhomogeneous terms, not all zero, appear in the state equation, which lead to the asymptotic limit of the state nonzero. Under the stabilizability condition, for any (admissible) closed-loop strategy, an invariant measure is proved to exist, which makes the ergodic cost functional well-defined and the EC problem well-formulated. Sufficient conditions, including those allowing the weighting matrices of cost functional to be indefinite, are introduced for finiteness and solvability for the EC problem. Some comparisons are made between the solvability of EC problem and the closed-loop solvability of stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control problem in the infinite horizon. The regularized EC problem is introduced to be used to obtain the optimal value of the EC problem.},

  abstract     = {In the aim to find the simplest and most efficient shape of a noise absorbing wall to dissipate the acoustical energy of a sound wave, we consider a frequency model described by the Helmholtz equation with a damping on the boundary. The well-posedness of the model is shown in a class of domains with $d$-set boundaries ($N-1\le d&lt;N$). We introduce a class of admissible Lipschitz boundaries, in which an optimal shape of the wall exists in the following sense: We prove the existence of a Radon measure on this shape, greater than or equal to the usual Lebesgue measure, for which the corresponding solution of the Helmholtz problem realizes the infimum of the acoustic energy defined with the Lebesgue measure on the boundary. If this Radon measure coincides with the Lebesgue measure, the corresponding solution realizes the minimum of the energy. For a fixed porous material, considered as an acoustic absorbent, we derive the damping parameters of its boundary from the corresponding time-dependent problem described by the damped wave equation (damping in volume).},

  abstract     = {Consider a stochastic nonlinear system controlled over a possibly noisy communication channel. An important problem is to characterize the largest class of channels which admit coding and control policies so that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable. In this paper we consider the stability notion of (asymptotic) ergodicity. We prove lower bounds on the channel capacity necessary to achieve the stability criterion. Under mild technical assumptions, we obtain that the necessary channel capacity is lower-bounded by the log-determinant of the linearization, double-averaged over the state and noise space. We prove this bound by introducing a modified version of invariance entropy and utilizing the almost sure convergence of sample paths guaranteed by the pointwise ergodic theorem. Our results generalize those for linear systems and are in some cases more refined than those obtained for nonlinear systems via information-theoretic methods.},

Our contributions include an adaptive optimization strategy which refines the approximation quality separately for each state variable using suitable error estimates. The benefits are twofold: we obtain additional means for solution verification and reduce the computational effort for finding an approximate solution with increased precision, as is highlighted in a numerical case study with two nonlinear real-world problems.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses, from both theoretical and numerical standpoints, the problem of optimal control of hyperelastic materials characterized by means of polyconvex stored energy functionals. Specifically, inspired by Günnel and Herzog [Front. Appl. Math. Stat., 2 (2016)], a bio-inspired type of external action or control, which resembles the electro-activation mechanism of the human heart, is considered in this paper. The main contribution resides in the consideration of tracking-type cost functionals alternative to those generally used in this field, where the $L^2$ norm of the distance to a given target displacement field is the preferred option. Alternatively, the Hausdorff metric is, for the first time, explored in the context of optimal control in hyperelasticity. The existence of a solution for a regularized version of the optimal control problem is proved. A gradient-based method, which makes use of the concept of shape derivative, is proposed as a numerical resolution method. A series of numerical examples are included illustrating the viability and applicability of the Hausdorff metric in this new context. Furthermore, although not pursued in this paper, it must be emphasized that in contrast to $L^2$ norm tracking-cost functional types, the Hausdorff metric permits the use of potentially very different computational domains for both the target and the actuated soft continuum.},

Then, based on the generalized exponential martingale inequality for Lévy type stochastic integral, we extend our less conservative MLFs and indefinite scalar functions based method to obtain a sufficient condition for globally almost sure exponential stability. Further, we investigate the mechanical verification of all the above stabilities for rational SHSs by proposing a semidefinite programming based computational approach. Especially, our mechanical verification approach can also be applied to deal with certain systems beyond rational SHSs. The applicabilities of both our theoretical results and mechanical approach are demonstrated by academic examples.},

In particular, the setup cost is characterized by a two-step function and a higher cost would be charged once the order quantity exceeds a threshold $Q$. Unlike the optimality of the $(s,S)$-type policy obtained by Helmes, Stockbridge, and Zhu for continuous setup cost with the discounted cost criterion, we find that, in our model, although some $(s,S)$-type policy is indeed optimal in some cases, the $(s,S)$-type policy cannot always be optimal. In particular, we show that there exist cases in which an $(s,S)$ policy is optimal for some initial levels but it is strictly worse than a generalized $(s,{S(x):x\leq s})$ policy for the other initial levels. Under $(s,{S(x):x\leq s})$ policy, it orders nothing for $x&gt;s$ and orders up to level $S(x)$ for $x\leq s$, where $S(x)$ is a nonconstant function of $x$. We further prove the optimality of such $(s,{S(x):x\leq s})$ policy in a large subset of admissible policies for those initial levels. Moreover, the optimality is obtained through establishing a more general lower bound theorem which will also be applicable in solving some other optimization problems by the lower bound approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents criteria for the convergence of trajectories of time-varying nonlinear systems in terms of Lyapunov densities. The results are provided without assuming local stability and forward completeness of trajectories. As well as general time-varying nonlinear systems, periodically time-varying systems are also considered in this paper, where a weaker criterion is proposed for periodically time-varying systems. Also the existence of Lyapunov densities is proved for general and periodic time-varying nonlinear systems under the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the impulse cash-flow withdrawal (dividend distribution or consumption) optimization problem for a broad class of growth restricted linear diffusions with drift and volatility dependent on both the level of surplus and the environment/economy regime (described by a Markov chain). There are proportional and fixed costs associated with each cash-flow withdrawal transaction, and the objective of the optimization problem is to determine the optimal policy that maximizes the expected total cumulative discounted cash-flow withdrawals (dividend payments/consumption) minus expenses. This work extends all the existing work on the same problem under the diffusion setting by extending the underlying dynamics to a much more general class of Markov modulated diffusions and unifies the existing work on optimal impulse dividend control. We show that when there are two regimes, the value function, as a function of the initial cash reservoir and the initial environmental state, can be determined by solving a set of second order ordinary differential equations. We further show that either the optimal strategy is a regime switching lump-sum dividend barrier strategy or there exists no optimal strategies.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we study the controllability problem for a symmetric-top molecule, for both its classical and quantum rotational dynamics. The molecule is controlled through three orthogonal electric fields interacting with its electric dipole. We characterize the controllability in terms of the dipole position: when it lies along the symmetry axis of the molecule neither the classical nor the quantum dynamics are controllable due to the presence of a conserved quantity, the third component of the total angular momentum; when it lies in the orthogonal plane to the symmetry axis, a quantum symmetry arises due to the superposition of symmetric states, which has no classical counterpart. If the dipole is neither along the symmetry axis nor orthogonal to it, controllability for the classical dynamics and approximate controllability for the quantum dynamics are proved to hold. The approximate controllability of the symmetric-top Schrödinger equation is established by using a Lie--Galerkin method based on blockwise approximations of the infinite-dimensional systems.},

We consider a distributed control supported in a moving domain $\omega (t)$ with a uniform motion at a constant velocity $c=(1,\zeta)$. The results we obtain depend strongly on the topological features of the geodesics of ${\mathbb T} ^2$ with constant velocity $c$. When $\zeta\in {\mathbb Q}$, writing $\zeta=p/q$ with $p,q$ relatively prime, we prove that the null controllability holds if roughly the diameter of $\omega (0)$ is larger than $1/p$ and if the control time is larger than $q$. We also prove that for almost every $\zeta \in {\mathbb R}_+\setminus {\mathbb Q}$, and also for some particular values including, e.g., $\zeta=e$, the null controllability holds for any choice of $\omega (0)$ and for a sufficiently large control time. The proofs rely on a delicate construction of the weight function in a Carleman estimate which gets rid of a topological assumption on the control region often encountered in the literature. Diophantine approximations are also needed when $\zeta$ is irrational.},

We also consider linear control systems and their Morse canonical form (MCF) [A. Morse, SIAM J. Control, 11 (1973), pp. 446--465; B. P. Molinari, Internat. J. Control, 28 (1978), pp. 493--510]. For a linear DAE, a procedure called explicitation is proposed, which attaches to any linear DAE a linear control system defined up to a coordinates change, a feedback transformation, and an output injection. Then we compare subspaces associated to a DAE in a geometric way with those associated (also in a geometric way) to a control system, namely, we compare the Wong sequences of DAEs and invariant subspaces of control systems. We prove that the KCF of linear DAEs and the MCF of control systems have a perfect correspondence and that their invariants are related. In this way, we connect the geometric analysis of linear DAEs with the classical geometric linear control theory. Finally, we propose a concept called internal equivalence for DAEs and discuss its relation with internal regularity, i.e., the existence and uniqueness of solutions.},

  abstract     = {This paper outlines possible extensions of a classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) scheme to abstract systems whose state-spaces are smooth manifolds (i.e., state-manifolds). In particular, we first present a “direct” extension of a PID controller for first-order systems where the control actions are direct translations to manifolds, via canonical identifications. We show that one such direct extension is, however, unfeasible. Next, we suggest a specific extension, which arises as a nonstraightforward and careful definition of error terms, which leads to a consistent definition of M-PID controller. On the basis of the successful, novel definition of PID controller, we proceed in extending its design from first-order to second-order systems in two different versions, namely, position and velocity control. To complete this endeavor, we prove analytically that both position and velocity control may be achieved through the proposed approach.},

Probab., 16 (2006), pp. 2235--2255] established the existence of optimal controls for a relaxed version of this class of problems by using the so-called time-stretching method and the J1-topology. We show that the weak-M1 topology is better suited for establishing existence, since it allows to bypass the time-transformations, without any additional effort. Furthermore, we reveal how the time-scaling feature in the definition of the weak-M1 distance embeds the time-stretching method&#39;s scheme. This case study suggests that one can benefit from working with the weak-M1 topology in other singular control frameworks, such as queueing control problems under heavy traffic.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problems of the input-to-state stochastic stability for neutral switched stochastic delay systems. Two switching signals in the input controller, including the external input disturbance, are considered: (1) the synchronous switching signal, which indicates that the switching signal of the input controller coincides with that of the controlled subsystems, and (2) the asynchronous switching signal, which signifies that two switching instants for the input controller and the subsystem are not identical. Irrespective of which switching signal exists in the input controller and the subsystem, multiple Lyapunov--Krasovskii functions, generalized delay integral inequality, and mode-dependent average dwell time are incorporated to analyze the underlying problem. Sufficient conditions based on two integral inequalities are obtained for these two cases, respectively. Also new and more relaxed Lyapunov monotonicity conditions are introduced. One simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the robust stability of a networked control system (NCS) under the framework of infinite-dimensional discrete-time linear time-varying (LTV) systems. The NCS consists of a pair of uncertain plant and controller, as well as an uncertain bilateral communication channel in between. The uncertainties in the plant and controller are measured by the gap metric. The communication channel between the plant and controller is described by a cascade of two-port networks whose transmission matrices are subject to norm-bounded additive uncertainties. Such an uncertain two-port network can model distortions and interferences occurring during control and measurement signal transmissions. The causality of the LTV subsystems is characterized by using nest algebras. A necessary and sufficient condition for the robust stability of the NCS, with the causality of all system components explicitly considered, is established in the form of an arcsine inequality which generalizes a similar result for linear time-invariant NCSs.},
