  abstract     = {We introduce a randomized algorithm, namely, rchol, to construct an approximate Cholesky factorization for a given Laplacian matrix (a.k.a., graph Laplacian). From a graph perspective, the exact Cholesky factorization introduces a clique in the underlying graph after eliminating a row/column. By randomization, rchol only retains a sparse subset of the edges in the clique using a random sampling developed by Spielman and Kyng [private communication, 2020]. We prove rchol is breakdown free and apply it to solving large sparse linear systems with symmetric diagonally dominant matrices. In addition, we parallelize rchol based on the nested-dissection ordering for shared-memory machines. We report numerical experiments that demonstrate the robustness and the scalability of rchol. For example, our parallel code scaled up to 64 threads on a single node for solving the three-dimensional Poisson equation, discretized with the 7-point stencil on a 1024 x 1024 x 1024 grid, a problem that has one billion unknowns.},

  abstract     = {The thick level set (TLS) method has been proposed as a nonlocal damage model for the modeling of failure in solids being able to deal with crack initiation, branching, and merging. The nonlocality of the TLS is achieved by introducing a characteristic length into the problem. This way, the TLS does not suffer from spurious localization in the strain field. This paper introduces a domain decomposition method to obtain a parallel implementation of the TLS method. It describes how to handle the numerical features specific to the TLS analysis steps involving level set update, equilibrium solution, and damage front advance. For each of these tasks an appropriate parallel strategy is proposed. The most demanding task in terms of computational cost, i.e., solving the linearized system of equations from the equilibrium problem, is performed with a parallel iterative method profiting from the domain decomposition method adopted. A communication strategy to deal with enriched nodes belonging to shared regions of subdomains is provided. Collective communication strategies are also proposed to deal with operations related to the level set update and damage front advance. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework to handle parallel computing with the TLS method.},

Its creation is a fundamental, necessary task in executing most parallel, element-based computer simulations. Common methods differ in that the ghost layer may either be inherently part of the mesh data structure that is maintained and modified, or kept separate and constructed/deleted as needed. In this work, we present a design following the latter approach, which we chose for its modularity of algorithms and data structures. We target arbitrary adaptive, nonconforming forest-of-trees meshes of mixed element shapes, such as cubes, prisms, and tetrahedra, and restrict ourselves to ghost elements across mesh faces. Our algorithm has low code complexity and redundancy since we reduce it to generic codimension-1 subalgorithms that can be flexibly combined. We recover older algorithms for cubic elements as special cases and optimize further using recursive, amortized tree searches and traversals.},

These systems of first order hyperbolic PDEs allow one to study the dynamics of the matter and the dynamics of the space-time according to the theory of general relativity. The new well balanced finite volume scheme presented here exploits the knowledge of an equilibrium solution of interest when integrating the conservative fluxes, the nonconservative products, and the algebraic source terms, and also when performing the piecewise linear data reconstruction. This results in a rather simple modification of the underlying second order FV scheme, which, however, being able to cancel numerical errors committed w.r.t. the equilibrium component of the numerical solution, substantially improves the accuracy and long-time stability of the numerical scheme when simulating small perturbations of stationary equilibria. In particular, the need for well balanced techniques appears to be more and more crucial as the applications increase their complexity. We close the paper with a series of numerical tests of increasing difficulty, where we study the evolution of small perturbations of accretion problems and of stable Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) neutron stars. Our results show that the well balancing significantly improves the long-time stability of the finite volume scheme compared to a standard scheme.},

  abstract     = {This paper first explores Tadmor&#39;s minimum entropy principle for the special relativistic hydrodynamics (RHD) equations and incorporates this principle into the design of robust high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and finite volume schemes for RHD on general meshes. The proposed schemes are rigorously proven to preserve numerical solutions in a global invariant region constituted by all the known intrinsic constraints: minimum entropy principle, the subluminal constraint on fluid velocity, the positivity of pressure, and the positivity of rest-mass density. Relativistic effects lead to some essential difficulties in the present study which are not encountered in the nonrelativistic case. Most notably, in the RHD case the specific entropy is a highly nonlinear implicit function of the conservative variables, and, moreover, there is also no explicit formula of the flux in terms of the conservative variables. In order to overcome the resulting challenges, we first propose a novel equivalent form of the invariant region by skillfully introducing two auxiliary variables. As a notable feature, all the constraints in the novel form are explicit and linear with respect to the conservative variables. This provides a highly effective approach to theoretically analyze the invariant-region-preserving (IRP) property of numerical schemes for RHD, without any assumption on the IRP property of the exact Riemann solver. Based on this, we prove the convexity of the invariant region and establish the generalized Lax--Friedrichs splitting properties via technical estimates, laying the foundation for our rigorous IRP analyses. It is rigorously shown that the first-order Lax--Friedrichs type scheme for the RHD equations satisfies a local minimum entropy principle and is IRP under a CFL condition. Provably IRP high-order accurate DG and finite volume methods are then developed for the RHD with the help of a simple scaling limiter, which is designed by following the bound-preserving type limiters in the literature. Several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed schemes.},

For this purpose, we apply the Hermite--Galerkin spectral method with scaling factor for the spatial approximation. The linearized IMEX schemes, including the IMEX Crank--Nicolson scheme with adaptive time stepping and the IMEX second-order backward differentiation formula scheme with adaptive time stepping, are employed for the temporal discretization. The existence and uniqueness of the numerical solutions are strictly proved for these two kinds of schemes. The main advantages of our algorithms are that (i) the errors and singularities introduced by the domain truncation can be avoided because the original problems are directly solved in the unbounded domains; (ii) we don&#39;t need to solve a nonlinear algebra system at each time step because of the employment of linearized IMEX schemes in time. Numerical examples are conducted to validate the stability and accuracy of the schemes, which show the resulting IMEX Hermite--Galerkin spectral schemes are highly accurate, efficient, and robust when used in conjunction with the adaptive time stepping strategies. The proposed schemes are showcased by solving several nonlinear coupled nonlocal Gordon-type models with fractional Laplacian, including the sine-Gordon, Klein--Gordon, and Klein--Gordon--Zakharov systems, together with the numerical simulations of the interactions of vector solitons.},

  abstract     = {Inverse design arises in a variety of areas in engineering such as acoustic, mechanics, thermal/electronic transport, electromagnetism, and optics. Topology optimization is an important form of inverse design, where one optimizes a designed geometry to achieve targeted properties parameterized by the materials at every point in a design region. This optimization is challenging, because it has a very high dimensionality and is usually constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs) and additional inequalities. Here, we propose a new deep learning method---physics-informed neural networks with hard constraints (hPINNs)---for solving topology optimization. hPINN leverages the recent development of PINNs for solving PDEs, and thus does not require a large dataset (generated by numerical PDE solvers) for training. However, all the constraints in PINNs are soft constraints, and hence we impose hard constraints by using the penalty method and the augmented Lagrangian method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of hPINN for a holography problem in optics and a fluid problem of Stokes flow. We achieve the same objective as conventional PDE-constrained optimization methods based on adjoint methods and numerical PDE solvers, but find that the design obtained from hPINN is often smoother for problems whose solution is not unique. Moreover, the implementation of inverse design with hPINN can be easier than that of conventional methods because it exploits the extensive deep-learning software infrastructure.},

Comprehensive results on the global convergence and local asymptotic superlinear convergence of the Ssnal and PpdSsn algorithms are characterized under very mild conditions. The computational costs of a semismooth Newton algorithm for solving the subproblems involved in the Ssnal and PpdSsn algorithms can be cheap by fully exploiting the second order sparsity and employing efficient techniques. Numerical experiments on the Dantzig selector problem with synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that the Ssnal and PpdSsn algorithms substantially outperform the state-of-the-art first order algorithms even for the required low accuracy, and the proposed algorithms are able to solve the large-scale problems robustly and efficiently to a relatively high accuracy.},

We additionally show how to march the second partials of the eikonal using cell-based interpolants. Second derivative information computed this way is frequently second-order accurate, suitable for locally solving the transport equation. This provides a means of marching the prefactor coming from the WKB approximation of the Helmholtz equation. These solvers are designed specifically for computing a high-frequency approximation of the Helmholtz equation in a complicated environment with a slowly varying speed of sound, and, to the best of our knowledge, are the first solvers with these properties.

  abstract     = {The active flux scheme is a finite volume scheme with additional point values distributed along the cell boundary. It is third order accurate and does not require a Riemann solver: the continuous reconstruction serves as initial data for the evolution of the points values. The intercell flux is then obtained from the evolved values along the cell boundary by quadrature. This paper focuses on the conceptual extension of active flux to include source terms, and thus for simplicity assumes the homogeneous part of the equations to be linear. To a large part, the treatment of the source terms is independent of the choice of the homogeneous part of the system. Additionally, only systems are considered which admit characteristics (instead of characteristic cones). This is the case for scalar equations in any number of spatial dimensions and systems in one spatial dimension. Here, we succeed in extending the active flux method to include (possibly nonlinear) source terms while maintaining third order accuracy of the method. This requires a novel (approximate) operator for the evolution of point values and a modified update procedure of the cell average. For linear acoustics with gravity, it is shown how to achieve a well-balanced/stationarity preserving numerical method.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a fully discrete soft thresholding polynomial approximation over a general region, named Lasso hyperinterpolation. This approximation is an $\ell_1$-regularized discrete least squares approximation under the same conditions of hyperinterpolation. Lasso hyperinterpolation also uses a high-order quadrature rule to approximate the Fourier coefficients of a given continuous function with respect to some orthonormal basis, and then it obtains its coefficients by acting a soft threshold operator on all approximated Fourier coefficients. Lasso hyperinterpolation is not a discrete orthogonal projection, but it is an efficient tool to deal with noisy data. We theoretically analyze Lasso hyperinterpolation for continuous and smooth functions. The principal results are twofold: The norm of the Lasso hyperinterpolation operator is bounded independently of the polynomial degree, which is inherited from hyperinterpolation, and the $L_2$ error bound of Lasso hyperinterpolation is less than that of hyperinterpolation when the level of noise becomes large, which improves the robustness of hyperinterpolation. Explicit constructions and corresponding numerical examples of Lasso hyperinterpolation over intervals, discs, spheres, and cubes are given.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a new Gaussian process regression (GPR) method: physics information aided Kriging (PhIK). In the standard data-driven Kriging, the unknown function of interest is usually treated as a Gaussian process with assumed stationary covariance with hyperparameters estimated from data. In PhIK, we compute the mean and covariance function from realizations of available stochastic models, e.g., from realizations of governing stochastic partial differential equations solutions. Such a constructed Gaussian process generally is nonstationary and does not assume a specific form of the covariance function. Our approach avoids the optimization step in data-driven GPR methods to identify the hyperparameters. More importantly, we prove that the physical constraints in the form of a deterministic linear operator are guaranteed in the resulting prediction. We also provide an error estimate in preserving the physical constraints when errors are included in the stochastic model realizations. To reduce the computational cost of obtaining stochastic model realizations, we propose a multilevel Monte Carlo estimate of the mean and covariance functions. Further, we present an active learning algorithm that guides the selection of additional observation locations. The efficiency and accuracy of PhIK are demonstrated for reconstructing a partially known modified Branin function, studying a three-dimensional heat transfer problem, and learning a conservative tracer distribution from sparse concentration measurements.},

Our interest lies in solving large-scale sparse symmetric positive definite linear systems of equations, where the system matrix is preordered to doubly bordered block diagonal form (for example, using a nested dissection ordering). We investigate the use of randomized methods to construct high-quality preconditioners. In particular, we propose a new and efficient approach that employs Nyström&#39;s method for computing low rank approximations to develop robust algebraic two-level preconditioners. Construction of the new preconditioners involves iteratively solving a smaller but denser symmetric positive definite Schur complement system with multiple right-hand sides. Numerical experiments on problems coming from a range of application areas demonstrate that this inner system can be solved cheaply using block conjugate gradients and that using a large convergence tolerance to limit the cost does not adversely affect the quality of the resulting Nyström--Schur two-level preconditioner.},

The starting point is a low order stabilized finite element method using piecewise linear continuous discrete velocities and piecewise constant pressures. This pair of spaces needs to be stabilized, and, as such, the continuity equation is modified by adding a stabilizing bilinear form based on the jumps of the pressure. This modified continuity equation can be rewritten in a standard way involving a modified different velocity field, which is as a consequence divergence-free. This modified velocity field is then fed back to the momentum equation making the convective term skew-symmetric. Thus, the discrete problem can be proven stable without the need to rewrite the convective field in its skew-symmetric way. Error estimates with constants independent of the viscosity are proven.

The resulting discretized solutions to PDEs often do not satisfy requisite physical properties, such as positivity or monotonicity. Such invalid solutions pose both modeling challenges, since the physical interpretation of simulation results is not possible, and computational challenges, since such properties may be required to advance the scheme. We, therefore, consider the problem of computing solutions that preserve these structural solution properties, which we enforce as additional constraints on the solution. We consider in particular the class of convex constraints, which includes positivity and monotonicity. By embedding such constraints as a postprocessing convex optimization procedure, we are able to compute solutions that satisfy general types of convex constraints. For certain types of constraints (including positivity and monotonicity), the optimization is a filter, i.e., a norm-decreasing operation. We provide a variety of tests on one-dimensional time-dependent PDEs that demonstrate the efficacy of the method, and we empirically show that rates of convergence are unaffected by the inclusion of the constraints.},

  abstract     = {A mixed finite element method is proposed for the Maxwell eigenproblem under the general setting. The method is based on a modification of the Kikuchi mixed formulation in terms of the electric field and the multiplier, with a mesh-dependent Gauss law of the electric field enforced in the formulation. The electric field is discretized by discontinuous elements, and the multiplier is always discretized by the lowest-order continuous nodal element (e.g., the linear element). The method renders four key features: the discrete de Rham complex exact sequence is not required and is replaced by a gradient inclusion condition of a low-order scalar element; i.e., the finite element space of the electric field includes the gradient of an auxiliary scalar $H^1$-conforming finite element space of low order; the discrete compactness property holds; the strong convergence of the Gauss law is ensured globally for the finite element solution; the method converges nearly optimally for both singular and smooth solutions. With these features, we develop a general analysis to prove that whether or not the discrete eigenmodes are spurious-free and spectral-correct attributes essentially to the first-order approximation property in the $H({\bf curl\,};\Omega)$ norm.

  abstract     = {Basis functions which are invariant under the operations of a rotational point group $G$ are able to describe any 3D object which exhibits the rotational point group symmetry. However, in order to characterize the spatial statistics of an ensemble of objects in which each object is different but the statistics exhibit the symmetry, a complete set of basis functions is required. In particular, for each irreducible representation (irrep) of $G$, it is necessary to include basis functions that transform according to that irrep. This complete set of basis functions is a basis for square-integrable functions on the surface of the sphere in 3D. Because the objects are real-valued, it is convenient to have real-valued basis functions. In this paper the existence of such real-valued bases is proven, and an algorithm for their computation is provided for the icosahedral $I$ and the octahedral $O$ symmetries. Furthermore, it is proven that such a real-valued basis does not exist for the tetrahedral $T$ symmetry because some irreps of $T$ are essentially complex. The importance of these basis functions to computations in single-particle cryo electron microscopy is described.},

Shadid of Sandia National Laboratories. Unfortunately, the meeting was canceled because of the Covid-19 outbreak, but it was decided to carry on with the special section dedicated to recent progress in iterative methods. Perhaps because the conference was not held in person, a record number of 71 manuscripts were submitted, and 38 of these were accepted for publication in this volume. The papers in this section all center on iterative methods, yet they cover a broad range of topics and include theoretical developments, algorithms, and applications. We are grateful to SIAM and SISC for hosting this special section and to the editorial board and the referees, who worked hard to ensure a rigorous peer-review process while meeting the deadlines.

  abstract     = {We introduce a new and generic approximation to Schur complements arising from inf-sup stable mixed finite element discretizations of self-adjoint multiphysics problems. The approximation exploits the discretization mesh by forming local, or element, Schur complements of an appropriate system and projecting them back to the global degrees of freedom. The resulting Schur complement approximation is sparse, has low construction cost (with the same order of operations as assembling a general finite element matrix), and can be solved using off-the-shelf techniques, such as multigrid. Using results from saddle point theory, we give conditions such that this approximation is spectrally equivalent to the global Schur complement. We present several numerical results to demonstrate the viability of this approach on a range of applications. Interestingly, numerical results show that the method gives an effective approximation to the nonsymmetric Schur complement from the steady state Navier--Stokes equations.},

  abstract     = {PDE-constrained optimization problems are often treated using the reduced formulation where the PDE constraints are eliminated. This approach is known to be more computationally feasible than other alternatives at large scales. However, the elimination of the constraints forces the optimization process to fulfill the constraints at all times. In some problems this may lead to a highly nonlinear objective, which is hard to solve. An example of such a problem, which we focus on in this work, is full waveform inversion (FWI), which appears in seismic exploration of oil and gas reservoirs and in medical imaging. In an attempt to relieve the nonlinearity of FWI, several approaches suggested expanding the optimization search space and relaxing the PDE constraints. This comes, however, with severe memory and computational costs, which we aim to reduce. In this work we adopt the expanded search space approach and suggest a new formulation of FWI using extended source functions. To make the source-extended problem more feasible in memory and computations, we couple the source extensions in the form of a low-rank matrix. This way, we have a large-but-manageable additional parameter space, which has a rather low memory footprint and is much more suitable for solving large scale instances of the problem than the full-rank additional space. In addition, we show how our source-extended approach is applied together with the popular simultaneous sources technique---a stochastic optimization technique that significantly reduces the computations needed for FWI inversions. We demonstrate our approaches for solving FWI problems using 2D and 3D models with high-frequency data only.},

To efficiently solve the resulting linear system, we propose a geometric multigrid algorithm that keeps the degrees of freedom on the faces at every grid level. The core of the algorithm lies in the design of the prolongation operator that passes information from coarse to fine faces through the reconstruction of an intermediary polynomial of higher degree on the cells. High orders are natively handled by the use of the same polynomial degree at every grid level. The proposed algorithm requires a hierarchy of nested meshes, such that the faces (and not only the elements) are successively coarsened. Numerical tests on homogeneous and heterogeneous diffusion problems show fast convergence, scalability in the mesh size and polynomial order, and robustness with respect to heterogeneity of the diffusion coefficient.},

  abstract     = {The hybrid ML-FETI-DP algorithm combines the advantages of adaptive coarse spaces in domain decomposition methods and certain supervised machine learning techniques. Adaptive coarse spaces ensure robustness of highly scalable domain decomposition solvers, even for highly heterogeneous coefficient distributions with arbitrary coefficient jumps. However, their construction requires the setup and solution of local generalized eigenvalue problems, which is typically computationally expensive. The idea of ML-FETI-DP is to interpret the coefficient distribution as image data and predict whether an eigenvalue problem has to be solved or can be neglected while still maintaining robustness of the adaptive FETI-DP method. For this purpose, neural networks are used as image classifiers. In the present work, the ML-FETI-DP algorithm is extended to three dimensions, which requires both a complex data preprocessing procedure to construct consistent input data for the neural network as well as a representative training and validation data set to ensure generalization properties of the machine learning model. Numerical experiments for stationary diffusion and linear elasticity problems with realistic coefficient distributions show that a large number of eigenvalue problems can be saved; in the best case of the numerical results presented here, 97\% of the eigenvalue problems can be avoided being set up and solved.},

These rational matrix functions are designed so that directions associated with nonsought eigenvalues are dampened to (approximately) zero. Variants based on matrix partitionings are introduced to further reduce the overall complexity of the proposed framework. Compared with existing eigenvalue solvers based on rational matrix functions, the proposed technique requires no estimation of the number of eigenvalues located inside the disk. Several theoretical and practical issues are discussed, and the competitiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated via numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {We propose an unconditionally robust and highly effective preconditioner for general dense symmetric positive definite matrices based on structured incomplete factorization (SIF), called the enhanced SIF (eSIF) preconditioner. The original SIF strategy proposed recently derives a structured preconditioner by applying block diagonal preprocessing to the matrix and then compressing appropriate scaled off-diagonal blocks. Here, we use an enhanced scaling-and-compression strategy to design the new eSIF preconditioner. Some subtle modifications are made, such as the use of two-sided block triangular preprocessing. A practical multilevel eSIF scheme is then designed. We give rigorous analysis for both the enhanced scaling-and-compression strategy and the multilevel eSIF preconditioner. The new eSIF framework has some significant advantages and overcomes some major limitations of the SIF strategy. (i) With the same tolerance for compressing the off-diagonal blocks, the eSIF preconditioner can approximate the original matrix to a much higher accuracy. (ii) The new preconditioner leads to much more significant reductions of condition numbers due to an accelerated magnification effect for the decay in the singular values of the scaled off-diagonal blocks. (iii) With the new preconditioner, the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are much better clustered around 1. (iv) The multilevel eSIF preconditioner is further unconditionally robust or is guaranteed to be positive definite without the need of extra stabilization, while the multilevel SIF preconditioner has a strict requirement in order to preserve positive definiteness. Comprehensive numerical tests are used to show the advantages of the eSIF preconditioner in accelerating the convergence of iterative solutions.},

In this paper, we propose and analyze a Levenberg--Marquardt algorithm for nonlinear least squares subject to nonlinear equality constraints. Our algorithm is based on inexact solves of linear least-squares problems that only require Jacobian-vector products. Global convergence is guaranteed by the combination of a composite step approach and a nonmonotone step acceptance rule. We illustrate the performance of our method on several test cases from data assimilation and inverse problems; our algorithm is able to reach the vicinity of a solution from an arbitrary starting point and can outperform the most natural alternatives for these classes of problems.},

  abstract     = {We present PNKH-B, a projected Newton--Krylov method for iteratively solving large-scale optimization problems with bound constraints. PNKH-B is geared toward situations in which function and gradient evaluations are expensive, and the (approximate) Hessian is only available through matrix-vector products. This is commonly the case in large-scale parameter estimation, machine learning, and image processing. In each iteration, PNKH-B uses a low-rank approximation of the (approximate) Hessian to determine the search direction and construct the metric used in a projected line search. The key feature of the metric is its consistency with the low-rank approximation of the Hessian on the Krylov subspace. This renders PNKH-B similar to a projected variable metric method. We present an interior point method to solve the quadratic projection problem efficiently. Since the interior point method effectively exploits the low-rank structure, its computational cost only scales linearly with respect to the number of variables, and it only adds negligible computational time. We also experiment with variants of PNKH-B that incorporate estimates of the active set into the Hessian approximation. We prove the global convergence to a stationary point under standard assumptions. Using three numerical experiments motivated by parameter estimation, machine learning, and image reconstruction, we show that the consistent use of the Hessian metric in PNKH-B leads to fast convergence, particularly in the first few iterations.

Algebraic MultiGrid (AMG) preconditioners are a popular ingredient of such linear solvers; this is the motivation for the present work, where we examine some recent developments in a package of AMG preconditioners to improve efficiency, scalability, and robustness on extreme scale problems. The main novelty is the design and implementation of a parallel coarsening algorithm based on aggregation of unknowns employing weighted graph matching techniques; this is a completely automated procedure, requiring no information from the user, and applicable to general symmetric positive definite (s.p.d.) matrices. The new coarsening algorithm improves in terms of numerical scalability at low operator complexity upon decoupled aggregation algorithms available in previous releases of the package. The preconditioners package is built on the parallel software framework \tt PSBLAS, which has also been updated to progress towards exascale.

  abstract     = {The paper considers supervised learning problems of labeled data with grouped input features. The groups are nonoverlapped such that the model coefficients corresponding to the input features form disjoint groups. The coefficients have group sparsity structure in the sense that coefficients corresponding to each group shall be simultaneously either zero or nonzero. To make effective use of such group sparsity structure given a priori, we introduce a novel log-composite regularizer, which can be minimized by an iterative algorithm. In particular, our algorithm iteratively solves for a traditional group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) problem that involves summing up the $l_2$ norm of each group until convergent. By updating group weights, our approach enforces a group of smaller coefficients from the previous iterate to be more likely to set to zero compared to the group LASSO. Theoretical results include a minimizing property of the proposed model as well as the convergence of the iterative algorithm to a stationary solution under mild conditions. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets, indicating that our method yields a performance that is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods in linear regression and binary classification.},

  abstract     = {PDE-constrained optimization problems arise in a broad number of applications such as hyperthermia cancer treatment and blood flow simulation. Discretization of the optimization problem and using a Lagrangian approach result in a large-scale saddle-point system, which is challenging to solve, and acquiring a full space-time solution is often infeasible. We present a new framework to efficiently compute a low-rank approximation to the solution by reformulating the KKT system into a Sylvester-like matrix equation. This matrix equation is subsequently projected onto a small subspace via an iterative rational Krylov method, and we obtain a reduced problem by imposing a Galerkin condition on its residual. In our work we discuss implementation details and dependence on the various problem parameters. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the new strategy also when compared to other low-rank approaches.},

While there are a large number of effective techniques for pairwise problems with two networks that scale in terms of edges, these cannot be readily extended to align multiple networks as the computational complexity will tend to grow exponentially with the number of networks. In this manuscript we introduce a new multiple network alignment algorithm and framework that is effective at aligning thousands of networks with thousands of nodes. The key enabling technique of our algorithm is identifying an exact and easy to compute low-rank tensor structure inside of a principled heuristic procedure for pairwise network alignment called IsoRank. This can be combined with a new algorithm for $k$-dimensional matching problems on low-rank tensors to produce the alignment. We demonstrate results on synthetic and real-world problems that show our technique (i) is as good as or better than, in terms of quality, existing methods, when they work on small problems, while running considerably faster, and (ii) is able to scale to aligning a number of networks unreachable by current methods.},

  abstract     = {For the solution of large sparse unsymmetric systems, Duff et al. [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 37 (2015), pp. A1248--A1269] proposed an approach based on the block Cimmino iterations [Numer. Math., 35 (1980), pp. 1--12], in which the solution is computed in a single iteration, so we call it a pseudodirect solver. In this approach, matrices are augmented with additional variables and constraints so that a partitioning of the matrix in blocks of rows defines mutually orthogonal subspaces. The augmented system can then be solved efficiently with a sum of projections onto these orthogonal subspaces. The purpose of this manuscript is to extend this method to the minimum norm solution of underdetermined systems and to the solution of least-squares problems. In the latter case, a partitioning of the matrix in blocks of columns rather than rows is used, and the system must be suitably augmented to define mutually orthogonal subspaces again to recover the least-squares solution of the original problem. This article proves the equivalence between the solution of the original and the augmented system. In order to complete the extension to overdetermined systems, we also propose an iterative block conjugate gradient acceleration [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 16 (1995), pp. 1478--1511] for the solution of least-squares problems. The efficiency of both the iterative and the augmented pseudodirect approaches, as implemented in the ABCD-Solver, is illustrated on large rectangular matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection. -We have learnt with great sadness that our co-author, long-term collaborator, advisor, and good friend Constantin Popa passed away while we were revising this article.

Alg. Appl., 113 (1989), pp. 7--63] that under certain conditions involving local orthogonality and approximate satisfaction of a recurrence formula, that may be satisfied by a finite precision CG computation, the convergence of that computation is like that of exact CG for a matrix with many eigenvalues distributed throughout tiny intervals about the eigenvalues of the given matrix. We determine to what extent each of these variants satisfies the desired conditions, using a set of test problems, and show that there is significant correlation between how well these conditions are satisfied and how well the finite precision computation converges before reaching its ultimately attainable accuracy. We show that for problems where the width of the intervals containing the eigenvalues of the associated exact CG matrix makes a significant difference in the behavior of exact CG, the different CG variants behave differently in finite precision arithmetic. For problems where the interval width makes little difference or where the convergence of exact CG is essentially governed by the upper bound based on the square root of the condition number of the matrix, the different CG variants converge similarly in finite precision arithmetic until the ultimate level of accuracy is achieved, although this ultimate level of accuracy may be different for the different variants. This points to the need for testing new CG variants on problems that are especially sensitive to rounding errors.},

The approximation is recast in the form of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem and a nonlinear singular value problem for which two iterative methods are proposed, respectively. This study offers insight into and might serve as the building block for the more complicated multipartite systems and higher-rank approximation problems.

Comput., (2021), pp. S392--S419] to obtain discretization-error-accurate solutions for linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) by mixed-precision multigrid solvers. It is often assumed that the achievable accuracy is limited by discretization or algebraic errors. On the contrary, we show that the quantization error incurred by simply storing the matrix in any fixed precision quickly begins to dominate the total error as the discretization is refined. We extend the existing theory to account for these quantization errors and use the resulting bounds to guide the choice of four different precision levels in order to balance quantization, algebraic, and discretization errors in the progressive-precision scheme proposed in the companion paper. A remarkable result is that while iterative refinement is susceptible to quantization errors during the residual and update computations, the V-cycle used to compute the correction in each iteration is much more resilient and continues to work if the system matrices in the hierarchy become indefinite due to quantization. As a result, the V-cycle only requires relatively few bits of precision per level. Based on our findings, we outline a simple way to implement a progressive-precision full multigrid (FMG) solver with minimal overhead and demonstrate as an example that the one-dimensional biharmonic equation can be solved reliably to any desired accuracy using just a few V-cycles when the underlying smoother works well. Additionally, we show that the progressive-precision scheme leads to memory savings of up to 50\% compared to fixed precision.},

  abstract     = {This paper establishes the first theoretical framework for analyzing the rounding-error effects on multigrid methods using mixed-precision iterative-refinement solvers. While motivated by the sparse symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix equations that arise from discretizing linear elliptic PDEs, the framework is purely algebraic such that it applies to matrices that do not necessarily come from the continuum. Based on the so-called energy or $A$ norm, which is the natural norm for many problems involving SPD matrices, we provide a normwise forward error analysis and introduce the notion of progressive precision for multigrid solvers. Each level of the multigrid hierarchy uses three different precisions that each increase with the fineness of the level, but at different rates, thereby ensuring that the bulk of the computation uses the lowest possible precision. The theoretical results developed here in the energy norm differ notably from previous theory based on the Euclidean norm in important ways. In particular, we show that simply rounding an exact result to finite precision causes an error in the energy norm that is proportional to the square root of $\kappa$, the associated matrix condition number. (By contrast, this error is of order 1 when measured in the Euclidean norm.) Given this observation, we show that the limiting accuracy for both V-cycles and full multigrid is optimal in the sense that it is also proportional to $\kappa^{1/2}$ in energy. Additionally, we show that the loss of convergence rate due to rounding grows in proportion to $\kappa^{1/2}$, but argue that this loss is insignificant in practice. The theory presented here is the first forward error analysis in the energy norm of iterative refinement and the first rounding error analysis of multigrid in general.},

  abstract     = {We consider numerical simulation of two-phase flows in porous media using implicit methods. Because of the complex features involving heterogeneous permeability and nonlinear capillary effects, the nonlinear algebraic systems arising from the discretization are very difficult to solve. The traditional Newton method suffers from slow convergence in the form of a long stagnation or sometimes does not converge at all. In this paper, we develop nonlinear preconditioning strategies for the system of two-phase flows discretized by a fully implicit discontinuous Galerkin method. The preconditioners identify and approximately eliminate the local high nonlinearities that cause the Newton method to take small updates. Specifically, we propose two elimination strategies: one is based on exploring the unbalanced nonlinearities of the pressure and the saturation fields, and the other is based on identifying certain elements of the finite element space that have much higher nonlinearities than the rest of the elements. We compare the performance and robustness of the proposed algorithms with an existing single-field elimination approach and the classical inexact Newton method with respect to some physical and numerical parameters. Experiments on three-dimensional porous media applications show that the proposed algorithms are superior to other methods in terms of robustness and parallel efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In this work we develop a new hierarchical multilevel approach to generate Gaussian random field realizations in an algorithmically scalable manner that is well suited to incorporating into multilevel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. This approach builds off of other partial differential equation (PDE) approaches for generating Gaussian random field realizations; in particular, a single field realization may be formed by solving a reaction-diffusion PDE with a spatial white noise source function as the right-hand side. While these approaches have been explored to accelerate forward uncertainty quantification tasks, e.g., multilevel Monte Carlo, the previous constructions are not directly applicable to multilevel MCMC frameworks which build fine-scale random fields in a hierarchical fashion from coarse-scale random fields. Our new hierarchical multilevel method relies on a hierarchical decomposition of the white noise source function in $L^2$ which allows us to form Gaussian random field realizations across multiple levels of discretization in a way that fits into multilevel MCMC algorithmic frameworks. After presenting our main theoretical results and numerical scaling results to showcase the utility of this new hierarchical PDE method for generating Gaussian random field realizations, this method is tested on a four-level MCMC algorithm to explore its feasibility.},

[IEEE Access, 7 (2019), pp. 1404--1423], proposed an algorithm called Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression (SR3) that employs a splitting strategy by introducing an auxiliary variable $y$ and solves $\min_{x,y} \frac{1}{2}\Vert Ax - b\Vert_2^2 + \frac{\kappa}{2}\Vert Lx - y\Vert_2^2 + \mathcal{R}(x)$. By minimizing out the variable $x$, we obtain an equivalent optimization problem $\min_{y} \frac{1}{2} \Vert F_{\kappa}y - g_{\kappa}\Vert_2^2+\mathcal{R}(y)$. In our work, we view the SR3 method as a way to approximately solve the regularized problem. We analyze the conditioning of the relaxed problem in general and give an expression for the SVD of $F_{\kappa}$ as a function of $\kappa$. Furthermore, we relate the Pareto curve of the original problem to the relaxed problem, and we quantify the error incurred by relaxation in terms of $\kappa$. Finally, we propose an efficient iterative method for solving the relaxed problem with inexact inner iterations. Numerical examples illustrate the approach.},

Specifically, we explore an all-at-once approach. The main contribution centers on the analysis of two block preconditioners. Variations of these preconditioners have been proposed and analyzed in prior works for optimal control problems where the underlying partial differential equation is a Laplace-like operator. In this paper, we extend some of the prior convergence results to Helmholtz-based optimization applications. Our analysis examines situations where control variables and observations are restricted to subregions of the computational domain. We prove that solver convergence rates do not deteriorate as the mesh is refined or as the wavenumber increases. More specifically, for one of the preconditioners we prove accelerated convergence as the wavenumber increases. Additionally, in situations where the control and observation subregions are disjoint, we observe that solver convergence rates have a weak dependence on the regularization parameter. We give a partial analysis of this behavior. We illustrate the performance of the preconditioners on control problems motivated by acoustic testing.},

The reconstructions of the new methods differ from standard Kaczmarz iterates in that our final result is the average of the stopped up- and down-sweeps. Even when Kaczmarz&#39;s method is supplied with an oracle that provides the exact error---and is therefore able to stop at the best possible iterate---our methods have a lower two-norm error in the vast majority of our test cases.

  abstract     = {Iterative hybrid projection methods have proven to be very effective for solving large linear inverse problems due to their inherent regularizing properties as well as the added flexibility to select regularization parameters adaptively. In this work, we develop Golub--Kahan-based hybrid projection methods that can exploit compression and recycling techniques in order to solve a broad class of inverse problems where memory requirements or high computational cost may otherwise be prohibitive. For problems that have many unknown parameters and require many iterations, hybrid projection methods with recycling can be used to compress and recycle the solution basis vectors to reduce the number of solution basis vectors that must be stored, while obtaining a solution accuracy that is comparable to that of standard methods. If reorthogonalization is required, this may also reduce computational cost substantially. In other scenarios, such as streaming data problems or inverse problems with multiple datasets, hybrid projection methods with recycling can be used to efficiently integrate previously computed information for faster and better reconstruction. Additional benefits of the proposed methods are that various subspace selection and compression techniques can be incorporated, standard techniques for automatic regularization parameter selection can be used, and the methods can be applied multiple times in an iterative fashion. Theoretical results show that, under reasonable conditions, regularized solutions for our proposed recycling hybrid method remain close to regularized solutions for standard hybrid methods and reveal important connections among the resulting projection matrices. Numerical examples from image processing show the potential benefits of combining recycling with hybrid projection methods.},

  abstract     = {We develop a multigrid solver steered by an a posteriori estimator of the algebraic error. We adopt the context of a second-order elliptic diffusion problem discretized by conforming finite elements of arbitrary polynomial degree $p \ge 1$. Our solver employs zero pre- and one postsmoothing by the overlapping Schwarz (block-Jacobi) method and features an optimal choice of the step-sizes in the smoothing correction on each level by line search. This leads to a simple Pythagorean formula of the algebraic error in the next step in terms of the current error and levelwise and patchwise error reductions. We show the following two results and their equivalence: the solver contracts the algebraic error independently of the polynomial degree $p$; and the estimator represents a two-sided $p$-robust bound on the algebraic error. The $p$-robustness results are obtained by carefully applying the results of [J. Schöberl et al., IMA J. Numer. Anal., 28 (2008), pp. 1--24] for one mesh, combined with a multilevel stable decomposition for piecewise affine polynomials of [J. Xu, L. Chen, and R. H. Nochetto, Optimal multilevel methods for $H({grad})$, $H({curl})$, and $H({div})$ systems on graded and unstructured grids, in Multiscale, Nonlinear and Adaptive Approximation, Springer, Berlin, 2009, pp. 599--659]. We consider quasi-uniform or graded bisection simplicial meshes and prove at most linear dependence on the number of mesh levels for minimal $H^1$-regularity and complete independence for $H^2$-regularity. We also present a simple and effective way for the solver to adaptively choose the number of postsmoothing steps necessary at each individual level, yielding a yet improved error reduction. Numerical tests confirm $p$-robustness and show the benefits of the adaptive number of smoothing steps.},

However, computing stochastic Galerkin approximations for a given problem requires the solution of large coupled systems of linear equations. Therefore, an effective and bespoke iterative solver is a key ingredient of any SGFEM implementation. In this paper, we analyze a class of truncation preconditioners for SGFEM. Extending the idea of the mean-based preconditioner, these preconditioners capture additional significant components of the stochastic Galerkin matrix. Focusing on the parametric diffusion equation as a model problem and assuming affine-parametric representation of the diffusion coefficient, we perform spectral analysis of the preconditioned matrices and establish optimality of truncation preconditioners with respect to SGFEM discretization parameters. Furthermore, we report the results of numerical experiments for model diffusion problems with affine and nonaffine parametric representations of the coefficient. In particular, we look at the efficiency of the solver (in terms of iteration counts for solving the underlying linear systems) and compare truncation preconditioners with other existing preconditioners for stochastic Galerkin matrices, such as the mean-based and the Kronecker product ones.},

These algorithms are built upon a new solid theoretical justification that guarantees that the sequence of approximate solutions to each problem in the sequence converges to the solution of the considered modified version of the $\ell_2$-$\ell_1$ problem. Compared to other traditional methods, the new algorithms have the advantage of building a single (flexible) approximation (Krylov) subspace that encodes regularization through variable “preconditioning” and that is expanded as soon as a new problem in the sequence is defined. Links between the new solvers and other well-established solvers based on augmenting Krylov subspaces are also established. The performance of these algorithms is shown through a variety of numerical examples modeling image deblurring and computed tomography.},

  abstract     = {We consider nonlinear convergence acceleration methods for fixed-point iteration $x_{k+1}=q(x_k)$, including Anderson acceleration (AA), nonlinear GMRES (NGMRES), and Nesterov-type acceleration (corresponding to AA with window size one). We focus on fixed-point methods that converge asymptotically linearly with convergence factor $\rho&lt;1$ and that solve an underlying fully smooth and nonconvex optimization problem. It is often observed that AA and NGMRES substantially improve the asymptotic convergence behavior of the fixed-point iteration, but this improvement has not been quantified theoretically. We investigate this problem under simplified conditions. First, we consider stationary versions of AA and NGMRES, and determine coefficients that result in optimal asymptotic convergence factors, given knowledge of the spectrum of $q&#39;(x)$ at the fixed point $x^*$. This allows us to understand and quantify the asymptotic convergence improvement that can be provided by nonlinear convergence acceleration, viewing $x_{k+1}=q(x_k)$ as a nonlinear preconditioner for AA and NGMRES. Second, for the case of infinite window size, we consider linear asymptotic convergence bounds for GMRES applied to the fixed-point iteration linearized about $x^*$. Since AA and NGMRES are equivalent to GMRES in the linear case, one may expect the GMRES convergence factors to be relevant for AA and NGMRES as $x_k \rightarrow x^*$. Our results are illustrated numerically for a class of test problems from canonical tensor decomposition, comparing steepest descent and alternating least squares as the fixed-point iterations that are accelerated by AA and NGMRES. Our numerical tests show that both approaches allow us to estimate asymptotic convergence speed for nonstationary AA and NGMRES with finite window size.},

The objective of this work is to investigate the ability of an isogeometric discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to evaluate accurately sensitivities with respect to shape parameters originating from computer-aided design (CAD) in the context of compressible aerodynamics. The isogeometric DG method relies on nonuniform rational B-spline representations, which allows us to define a high-order numerical scheme for Euler/Navier--Stokes equations, fully consistent with CAD geometries. We detail how this formulation can be exploited to construct an efficient and accurate approach to evaluate shape sensitivities. A particular attention is paid to the treatment of boundary conditions for sensitivities, which are more tedious in the case of geometrical parameters. The proposed methodology is first verified on a test-case with an analytical solution and then applied to two more demanding problems that concern the inviscid flow around an airfoil with its camber as a shape parameter and the unsteady viscous flow around a three-element airfoil with the positions of slat and flap as parameters.},

  abstract     = {It has recently been demonstrated that dynamical low-rank algorithms can provide robust and efficient approximations to a range of kinetic equations. This is true especially if the solution is close to some asymptotic limit where it is known that the solution is low-rank. A particularly interesting case is the fluid dynamic limit that is commonly obtained in the limit of small Knudsen number. However, in this case the Maxwellian which describes the corresponding equilibrium distribution is not necessarily low-rank; because of this, the methods known in the literature are only applicable to the weakly compressible case. In this paper, we propose an efficient dynamical low-rank integrator that can capture the fluid limit---the Navier--Stokes equations---of the Boltzmann-Bhatnagar--Gross--Krook (Boltzmann-BGK) model even in the compressible regime. This is accomplished by writing the solution as $f=Mg$, where $M$ is the Maxwellian and the low-rank approximation is only applied to $g$. To efficiently implement this decomposition within a low-rank framework requires, in the isothermal case, that certain coefficients are evaluated using convolutions, for which fast algorithms are known. Using the proposed decomposition also has the advantage that the rank required to obtain accurate results is significantly reduced compared to the previous state of the art. We demonstrate this by performing a number of numerical experiments and also show that our method is able to capture sharp gradients/shock waves.},

For near-Gaussian distributions, we are able to derive the optimal algorithm parameters with respect to the KSE criterion analytically.

The proposed SL hybrid HWENO scheme adopts a weak formulation of the characteristic Galerkin method and introduces an adjoint problem for the test function in the same way as the SL discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme [W. Guo, R. D. Nair, and J. M. Qiu, Monthly Weather Rev., 142 (2014), pp. 457--475]. Comparing with the original SL DG scheme, we introduce a hybrid moment-based HWENO reconstruction operator in space, bringing at least two benefits. Firstly, with the same order of accuracy, such a reconstruction allows lower degrees of freedom per element in the evolution process. Secondly, it naturally possesses a nonoscillatory property when dealing with discontinuity. In addition, we derive a novel troubled cell indicator which can effectively detect the discontinuous regions for the reconstruction operator. To apply the scheme for 2-D transport equations and the nonlinear VP system, we adopt a fourth-order dimensional splitting method. Positivity-preserving limiters are applied to enforce the positivity of the solution for the system having positive solutions. Finally, we show extensive numerical tests to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SL hybrid HWENO scheme.},

  abstract     = {We study the numerical solution of scalar time-harmonic wave equations on unbounded domains which can be split into a bounded interior domain of primary interest and an exterior domain with separable geometry. To compute the solution in the interior domain, approximations to the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map of the exterior domain have to be imposed as transparent boundary conditions on the artificial coupling boundary. Although the DtN map can be computed by separation of variables, it is a nonlocal operator with dense matrix representations, and hence computationally inefficient. Therefore, approximations of DtN maps by sparse matrices, usually involving additional degrees of freedom, have been studied intensively in the literature using a variety of approaches including different types of infinite elements, local nonreflecting boundary conditions, and perfectly matched layers. The entries of these sparse matrices are derived analytically, e.g., from transformations or asymptotic expansions of solutions to the differential equation in the exterior domain. In contrast, in this paper we propose to “learn” the matrix entries from the DtN map in its separated form by solving an optimization problem as a preprocessing step. Theoretical considerations suggest that the approximation quality of learned infinite elements improves exponentially with increasing number of infinite element degrees of freedom, which is confirmed in numerical experiments. These numerical studies also show that learned infinite elements outperform state-of-the-art methods for the Helmholtz equation. At the same time, learned infinite elements are much more flexible than traditional methods as they, e.g., work similarly well for exterior domains involving strong reflections. As the main motivating example we study the atmosphere of the Sun, which is strongly inhomogeneous and exhibits reflections at the corona.},

  abstract     = {Runge--Kutta (RK) schemes, especially Gauss--Legendre and some other fully implicit RK (FIRK) schemes, are desirable for the time integration of parabolic partial differential equations due to their A-stability and high-order accuracy. However, it is significantly more challenging to construct optimal preconditioners for them compared to diagonally implicit RK (DIRK) schemes. To address this challenge, we first introduce mathematically optimal preconditioners called block complex Schur decomposition (BCSD), block real Schur decomposition (BRSD), and block Jordan form (BJF), motivated by block-circulant preconditioners and Jordan form solution techniques for IRK. We then derive an efficient, near-optimal singly diagonal approximate BRSD (SABRSD) by approximating the quasi-triangular matrix in real Schur decomposition using an optimized upper-triangular matrix with a single diagonal value. A desirable feature of SABRSD is that it has a similar memory requirement and factorization (or setup) cost as singly DIRK (SDIRK). We approximate the diagonal blocks in these preconditioning techniques using an incomplete factorization with (near) linear complexity, such as multilevel ILU, ILU(0), or a multigrid method with an ILU-based smoother. We apply the block preconditioners in right-preconditioned GMRES to solve the advection-diffusion equation in 3D using finite element and finite difference methods. We show that BCSD, BRSD, and BJF significantly outperform other preconditioners in terms of GMRES iterations, and SABRSD is competitive with them and the prior state of the art in terms of computational cost while requiring the least amount of memory.},

Interestingly, the discrete energy stability result obtained in this paper can recover the classical energy dissipation law when the fractional order $\alpha \rightarrow 1$. That is, our scheme can asymptotically preserve the energy dissipation law in the $\alpha \rightarrow 1$ limit. This seems to be the first work on a variable time-stepping scheme that can preserve both the energy stability and the maximum bound principle. Our Crank--Nicolson scheme is built upon a reformulated problem associated with the Riemann--Liouville derivative. As a byproduct, we build up a reversible transformation between the L1-type formula of the Riemann--Liouville derivative and a new L1-type formula of the Caputo derivative with the help of a class of discrete orthogonal convolution kernels. This is the first time such a discrete transformation is established between two discrete fractional derivatives. We finally present several numerical examples with an adaptive time-stepping strategy to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

In the frequency domain, one solves a discretized Helmholtz equation, while in the time domain, the periodic solutions to a discretized wave equation are sought, e.g., by simulating for a long time with a time-harmonic forcing term. Disadvantages of the time-domain method are that the solutions are affected by temporal discretization errors and that the spatial discretization cannot be freely chosen, since it is inherited from the time-domain scheme. In this work we address these issues. Given an indefinite linear system satisfying certain properties, a matrix recurrence relation is constructed such that in the limit the exact discrete solution is obtained. By iterating a large, finite number of times, an approximate solution is obtained, similarly as in a time-domain method for the Helmholtz equation. To improve the convergence, the process is used as a preconditioner for GMRES, and the time-harmonic forcing term is multiplied by a smooth window function. The construction is applied to a compact-stencil finite-difference discretization of the Helmholtz equation, for which previously no time-domain solver was available. Advantages of the resulting solver are the relative simplicity, small memory requirement, and reasonable computation times.},

  abstract     = {The ability of neural networks to provide “best in class” approximation across a wide range of applications is well documented. Nevertheless, the powerful expressivity of neural networks comes to naught if one is unable to effectively train (choose) the parameters defining the network. In general, neural networks are trained by gradient descent--type optimization methods or a stochastic variant thereof. In practice, such methods result in the loss function decreases rapidly at the beginning of training but then, after a relatively small number of steps, significantly slow down. The loss may even appear to stagnate over the period of a large number of epochs, only to then suddenly start to decrease fast again for no apparent reason. This so-called plateau phenomenon manifests itself in many learning tasks. The present work aims to identify and quantify the root causes of plateau phenomenon. The analysis is carried out in the setting of univariate rectified linear unit networks. No assumptions are made on the number of neurons relative to the number of training data, and our results hold for both the lazy and adaptive regimes. The main findings are plateaus correspond to periods during which activation patterns remain constant, where activation pattern refers to the number of data points that activate a given neuron; quantification of convergence of the gradient flow dynamics; and characterization of stationary points in terms solutions of local least squares regression lines over subsets of the training data. Based on these conclusions, we propose a new iterative training method, the active neuron least squares, characterized by the explicit adjustment of the activation pattern at each step, which is designed to enable a quick exit from a plateau. Illustrative numerical examples are included throughout.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) is a derivative-free optimization method that lies between the deterministic and probabilistic approaches for inverse problems. EKI iterates the Kalman update of ensemble-based Kalman filters, whose ensemble converges to a minimizer of an objective function. EKI regularizes ill-posed problems by restricting the ensemble to the linear span of the initial ensemble, or by iterating regularization with early stopping. Another regularization approach for EKI, Tikhonov EKI, penalizes the objective function using the $l_2$ penalty term, preventing overfitting in the standard EKI. This paper proposes a strategy to implement $l_p, 0&lt;p\leq 1,$ regularization for EKI to recover sparse structures in the solution. The strategy transforms an $l_p$ problem into an $l_2$ problem, which is then solved by Tikhonov EKI. The transformation is explicit, and thus the proposed approach has a computational cost comparable to Tikhonov EKI. We validate the proposed approach&#39;s effectiveness and robustness through a suite of numerical experiments, including compressive sensing and subsurface flow inverse problems.},

The motivation for this study is that the time-dependent advection-diffusion equation can be seen as a “steady” advection-diffusion problem in $(d+1)$-dimensions and AIR has been shown to be a robust solver for steady advection-dominated problems. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of AIR as a preconditioner for advection-diffusion problems on fixed and time-dependent domains, using both slab-by-slab and all-at-once space-time discretizations, and in the context of uniform and space-time adaptive mesh refinement. A closer look at the geometric coarsening structure that arises in AIR also explains why AIR can provide robust, scalable, space-time convergence on advective and hyperbolic problems, while most multilevel parallel-in-time schemes struggle with such problems.},

Accordingly, AAAtrig inherits all the favorable characteristics of AAA and is thus extremely flexible and robust, being able to consider quite general sets of sample points in the complex plane. We consider a range of applications with particular emphasis on solving Laplace&#39;s equation in periodic domains and compressing periodic conformal maps. These results reproduce the tapered exponential clustering effect observed in other recent studies. The algorithm is implemented in Chebfun.},

Bilinear algorithms are a general representation of fast algorithms for bilinear functions, which include computation of matrix multiplication, convolution, and symmetric tensor contractions. A bilinear algorithm is described by three matrices. Our communication lower bounds are based on quantifying the minimal matrix ranks of matching subsets of columns of these matrices. This infrastructure yields new lower bounds for symmetric tensor contraction algorithms, which provide new qualitative insights. Tensor symmetry (invariance under permutation of modes) is common to many applications of tensor computations (e.g., tensor representation of hypergraphs, analysis of high-order moments in data, as well as tensors modeling interactions of electrons in computational chemistry). Tensor symmetry enables reduction in representation size as well as contraction cost by factors that scale with the number of equivalent permutations. However, we derive lower bounds showing that these cost and memory reductions can necessitate increases in data movement by factors that scale with the size of the tensors.},

The key property of the proposed method is its unconditional stability for general meshes, including the graded mesh commonly used for this type of equation. The unconditional stability is proved through establishing a discrete nonlocal free energy dissipation law, which is also true for the continuous problem. The main idea used in the analysis is to split the time fractional derivative into two parts: a local part and a history part, which are discretized by the well known L1, L1-CN, and $L1^{+}$-CN schemes. Then an extended auxiliary variable approach is used to deal with the nonlinear and history term. The main contributions of the paper are first, it is found that the time fractional Allen--Cahn equation is a dissipative system related to a nonlocal free energy. Second, we construct efficient time stepping schemes satisfying the same dissipation law at the discrete level. In particular, we prove that the proposed schemes are unconditionally stable for quite general meshes. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is verified by a series of numerical experiments.},

Cross fields are finding wide-spread use in mesh generation, computer graphics, and materials science among many applications. It was recently shown in [A. Chemin et al., International Meshing Roundtable, 2019, pp. 89--108] that 3-cross fields can be embedded into the set of symmetric fourth-order tensors. The concurrent work [D. Palmer, D. Bommes, and J. Solomon, Algebraic Representations for Volumetric Frame Fields, preprint, arXiv:1908.05411 (2019)] further develops a relaxation of this tensor field via a certain set of varieties. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating an arbitrary $n$-cross field using a fourth-order $Q$-tensor theory that is constructed out of tensored projection matrices. We establish that by a Ginzburg--Landau relaxation towards a global projection, one can reliably generate an $n$-cross field on arbitrary Lipschitz domains. Our work provides a rigorous approach that offers several new results including porting the tensor framework to arbitrary dimensions, providing a new relaxation method that embeds the problem into a global steepest descent, and offering a relaxation scheme for aligning the cross field with the boundary. Our approach is designed to fit within the classical Ginzburg--Landau PDE theory, offering a concrete road map for the future careful study of singularities of energy minimizers.},

  abstract     = {When using Laguerre and Hermite spectral methods to numerically solve PDEs in unbounded domains, the number of collocation points assigned inside the region of interest is often insufficient, particularly when the region is expanded or translated in order to safely capture the unknown solution. Simply increasing the number of collocation points cannot ensure a fast convergence to spectral accuracy. In this paper, we propose a scaling technique and a moving technique to adaptively cluster enough collocation points in a region of interest in order to achieve fast spectral convergence. Our scaling algorithm employs an indicator in the frequency domain that both is used to determine when scaling is needed and informs the tuning of a scaling factor to redistribute collocation points in order to adapt to the diffusive behavior of the solution. Our moving technique adopts an exterior-error indicator and moves the collocation points to capture the translation. Both frequency and exterior-error indicators are defined using only the numerical solutions. We apply our methods to a number of different models, including diffusive and moving Fermi--Dirac distributions and nonlinear Dirac solitary waves, and demonstrate recovery of spectral convergence for time-dependent simulations. A performance comparison in solving a linear parabolic problem shows that our frequency scaling algorithm outperforms the existing scaling approaches. We also show our frequency scaling technique is able to track the blowup of average cell sizes in a model for cell proliferation. In addition to the Laguerre and Hermite basis functions with exponential decay at infinity, we also successfully apply the frequency-dependent scaling technique into rational basis functions with algebraic decay at infinity.},

  abstract     = {Well known to the machine learning community, the random feature model is a parametric approximation to kernel interpolation or regression methods. It is typically used to approximate functions mapping a finite-dimensional input space to the real line. In this paper, we instead propose a methodology for use of the random feature model as a data-driven surrogate for operators that map an input Banach space to an output Banach space. Although the methodology is quite general, we consider operators defined by partial differential equations (PDEs); here, the inputs and outputs are themselves functions, with the input parameters being functions required to specify the problem, such as initial data or coefficients, and the outputs being solutions of the problem. Upon discretization, the model inherits several desirable attributes from this infinite-dimensional viewpoint, including mesh-invariant approximation error with respect to the true PDE solution map and the capability to be trained at one mesh resolution and then deployed at different mesh resolutions. We view the random feature model as a nonintrusive data-driven emulator, provide a mathematical framework for its interpretation, and demonstrate its ability to efficiently and accurately approximate the nonlinear parameter-to-solution maps of two prototypical PDEs arising in physical science and engineering applications: the viscous Burgers&#39; equation and a variable coefficient elliptic equation.},

As the surface evolves, the area element becomes uneven and the sampling suboptimal. In this method we maintain the quality of the sampling by precomposition of the parametrization with a deformation map of the parametric space. This deformation is generated by the velocity field associated to the diffusion process on the space of probability distributions and induces a uniform redistribution of the marker points. We also exploit the semigroup property of the heat equation to generate a submap decomposition of the deformation map which provides an efficient way of maintaining evenly distributed marker points on curves and surfaces undergoing extensive deformations.},

  abstract     = {The widespread use of neural networks across different scientific domains often involves constraining them to satisfy certain symmetries, conservation laws, or other domain knowledge. Such constraints are often imposed as soft penalties during model training and effectively act as domain-specific regularizers of the empirical risk loss. Physics-informed neural networks is an example of this philosophy in which the outputs of deep neural networks are constrained to approximately satisfy a given set of partial differential equations. In this work we review recent advances in scientific machine learning with a specific focus on the effectiveness of physics-informed neural networks in predicting outcomes of physical systems and discovering hidden physics from noisy data. We also identify and analyze a fundamental mode of failure of such approaches that is related to numerical stiffness leading to unbalanced back-propagated gradients during model training. To address this limitation we present a learning rate annealing algorithm that utilizes gradient statistics during model training to balance the interplay between different terms in composite loss functions. We also propose a novel neural network architecture that is more resilient to such gradient pathologies. Taken together, our developments provide new insights into the training of constrained neural networks and consistently improve the predictive accuracy of physics-informed neural networks by a factor of 50--100$\times$ across a range of problems in computational physics.

  abstract     = {A selection of algorithms for the rational approximation of matrix-valued functions are discussed, including variants of the interpolatory adaptive Antoulas--Anderson (AAA) method, the rational Krylov fitting (RKFIT) method based on approximate least squares fitting, vector fitting, and a method based on low-rank approximation of a block Loewner matrix. A new method, called the block-AAA algorithm, based on a generalized barycentric formula with matrix-valued weights, is proposed. All algorithms are compared in terms of obtained approximation accuracy and runtime on a set of problems from model order reduction and nonlinear eigenvalue problems, including examples with noisy data. It is found that interpolation-based methods are typically cheaper to run, but they may suffer in the presence of noise for which approximation-based methods perform better.},

  abstract     = {Discontinuous Galerkin (dG) methods on meshes consisting of polygonal/polyhedral (henceforth, collectively termed as polytopic) elements have received considerable attention in recent years. Due to the physical frame basis functions used typically and the quadrature challenges involved, the matrix-assembly step for these methods is often computationally cumbersome. To address this important practical issue, this work proposes two parallel assembly implementation algorithms on Compute Unified Device Architecture--enabled graphics cards for the interior penalty dG method on polytopic meshes for various classes of linear PDE problems. We are concerned with both single graphics processing unit (GPU) parallelization, as well as with implementation on distributed GPU nodes. The results included showcase almost linear scalability of the quadrature step with respect to the number of GPU cores used since no communication is needed for the assembly step. In turn, this can justify the claim that polytopic dG methods can be implemented extremely efficiently, as any assembly computing time overhead compared to finite elements on “standard” simplicial or box-type meshes can be effectively circumvented by the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Alternating least squares is the most widely used algorithm for CANDECOMC/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition. However, alternating least squares may exhibit slow or no convergence, especially when high accuracy is required. An alternative approach is to regard CP decomposition as a nonlinear least squares problem and employ Newton-like methods. Direct solution of linear systems involving an approximated Hessian is generally expensive. However, recent advancements have shown that use of an implicit representation of the linear system makes these methods competitive with alternating least squares (ALS). We provide the first parallel implementation of a Gauss--Newton method for CP decomposition, which iteratively solves linear least squares problems at each Gauss--Newton step. In particular, we leverage a formulation that employs tensor contractions for implicit matrix-vector products within the conjugate gradient method. The use of tensor contractions enables us to employ the Cyclops library for distributed-memory tensor computations to parallelize the Gauss--Newton approach with a high-level Python implementation. In addition, we propose a regularization scheme for the Gauss--Newton method to improve convergence properties without any additional cost. We study the convergence of variants of the Gauss--Newton method relative to ALS for finding exact CP decompositions as well as approximate decompositions of real-world tensors. We evaluate the performance of sequential and parallel versions of both approaches, and study the parallel scalability on the Stampede2 supercomputer.},

  abstract     = {The positivity preservation or hyperbolicity preservation of numerical schemes is essential for robust computations of compressible two-fluid models. Due to the quasi-conservative (nonconservative) nature of the compressible two-fluid model and use of the stiffened-gas equation of state that allows liquid-gas modeling, the analysis of the positivity preservation is significantly more challenging than that of the single-fluid case based on Euler&#39;s equations of gas dynamics with ideal gases. We present a detailed, thorough analysis of positivity preservation of widely accepted first-order schemes for the quasi-conservative compressible two-fluid model. The analysis is based on whether material parameters appearing in the stiffened-gas equation of state satisfy a concavity condition. When the concavity condition is satisfied, a proof of positivity preservation of the numerical scheme is presented. When the concavity condition is not satisfied, it is discovered that the positivity preservation is not necessarily ensured, and examples that lead to loss of positivity (or loss of hyperbolicity) are derived. The analysis and numerical verifications are carried out in both one and higher space dimensions. The positivity-preservation proof provides rigorous justification that the first-order scheme when yielding hyperbolicity-preserving solutions can be used as a basis for the design of a high-order hyperbolicity-preserving scheme for the compressible two-fluid model. On the other hand, the demonstration of the lack of positivity in cases where the concavity property is not satisfied by the fluid parameters reveals the possible loss of stability and robustness of the widely accepted first-order scheme for the quasi-conservative compressible two-fluid model in some extreme problems.},

It results in a system for the electric scalar potential that can be used for electro-quasistatics, electrostatics, as well as DC conduction. Our main finding is that the electro-quasistatic fields can be corrected for magnetic/inductive phenomena at any frequency in a second step. The combined field from both steps is a solution of the full Maxwell equations that consistently takes into account all electromagnetic effects. Electro-quasistatics serves as a gauge condition in this semidecoupled procedure to calculate the electromagnetic potentials. We derive frequency-stable weak variational formulations for both steps that (i) immediately lend themselves to finite-element Galerkin discretization, and (ii) can be equipped with the so-called electric circuit element (ECE) boundary conditions, which facilitate coupling with external circuit models.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical behavior of a poroelastic medium permeated by multiple interacting fluid networks can be described by a system of time-dependent partial differential equations known as the multiple-network poroelasticity (MPET) equations or multiporosity/multipermeability systems. These equations generalize Biot&#39;s equations, which describe the mechanics of the one network case. The efficient numerical solution of the MPET equations is challenging, in part due to the complexity of the system and in part due to the presence of interacting parameter regimes. In this paper, we present a new strategy for efficiently and robustly solving the MPET equations numerically. In particular, we discuss an approach to formulating finite element methods and associated preconditioners for the MPET equations based on simultaneous diagonalization of the element matrices. We demonstrate the technique for the multicompartment Darcy equations, with large exchange variability, and the MPET equations for a nearly incompressible medium with large exchange variability. The approach is based on designing transformations of variables that simultaneously diagonalize (by congruence) the equations&#39; key operators and subsequently constructing parameter-robust block diagonal preconditioners for the transformed system. The proposed approach is supported by theoretical considerations as well as by numerical results.},

Importance sampling is employed to reduce the induced force variance by taking advantage of the fast decay property of the Fourier coefficients. The stochastic approximation is unbiased with controlled variance. Analysis for bounded force fields gives some theoretic support of the method. Simulations of two typical problems of charged systems are presented to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the RBE method in comparison to the results from the Debye--Hückel theory, the classical Ewald summation, and the particle-particle particle-mesh method, demonstrating that the proposed method has the attractiveness of being easy to implement with the linear scaling and is promising for many practical applications.},

Mathematically, it is described by Maxwell&#39;s equations with discontinuous coefficients coupled with a set of Helmholtz-type equations defined only on the domains of metallic nanostructures. To solve this challenging problem, we develop an efficient multiscale method consisting of three steps. First, we extend the system into the domain occupied by the dielectric medium in a novel way and result in a coupled system with rapidly oscillating coefficients. A rigorous analysis of the error between the solutions of the original system and the extended system is given. Second, we derive the homogenized system and define the multiscale approximate solution for the extended system by using the multiscale asymptotic method. Third, to fix the inaccuracy of the multiscale asymptotic method inside the metallic nanostructures, we solve the original system in each metallic nanostructure separately with boundary conditions given by the multiscale approximate solution. A fast algorithm based on the $LU$ decomposition is proposed for solving the resulting linear systems. By applying the multiscale method, we obtain results that are in good agreement with those obtained by solving the original system directly at a much lower computational cost. Numerical examples are provided to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.},

In particular, the well-known Biot consolidation model describes the coupled interaction between the linear response of a porous elastic medium saturated with fluid and a diffusive fluid flow within it, assuming small deformations. Although deterministic linear models and finite element methods for solving them numerically have been well studied, there is little work to date on robust algorithms for solving poroelasticity models with uncertain inputs and for performing uncertainty quantification (UQ). The Biot model has a number of important physical parameters and inputs whose precise values are often uncertain in real world scenarios. In this work, we introduce and analyze the well-posedness of a new five-field model with uncertain and spatially varying Young&#39;s modulus and hydraulic conductivity field. By working with a properly weighted norm, we establish that the weak solution is stable with respect to variations in key physical parameters, including the Poisson ratio. We then introduce a novel locking-free stochastic Galerkin mixed finite element method that is robust in the nearly incompressible case. Armed with an appropriate norm, we construct a parameter-robust preconditioner for the associated discrete systems. Our new method facilitates forward UQ, allowing efficient calculation of statistical quantities of interest, and is provably robust with respect to variations in the Poisson ratio, the Biot--Willis constant, and the storage coefficient, as well as the discretization parameters.},

The adjoint scheme is determined from a linearization of the forward system and is used to compute the gradient of a cost function. The bottom topography function is recovered through an iterative process given by a three-operator splitting method which allows the feasibility of including two regularization terms.

  abstract     = {It is well known that symplectic integrators lose their near energy preservation properties when variable time-steps are used. The most common approach to combining adaptive time-steps and symplectic integrators involves the Poincaré transformation of the original Hamiltonian. In this article, we provide a framework for the construction of variational integrators using the Poincaré transformation. Since the transformed Hamiltonian is typically degenerate, the use of Hamiltonian variational integrators based on Type II or Type III generating functions is required instead of the more traditional Lagrangian variational integrators based on Type I generating functions. Error analysis is provided, and numerical tests based on the Taylor variational integrator approach in [J. M. Schmitt, T. Shingel, and M. Leok, BIT, 58 (2018), pp. 457--488] to time-adaptive variational integration of Kepler&#39;s 2-body problem are presented. Finally, we use our adaptive framework together with the variational approach to accelerated optimization presented in [A. Wibisono, A. Wilson, and M. Jordan, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 113 (2016), pp. E7351--E7358] to design efficient variational and nonvariational explicit integrators for symplectic accelerated optimization.},

The fluid is described using the Navier--Stokes equations, and the porohyperelastic structure is described using the Biot equations. To solve this problem numerically, we propose two novel, partitioned, loosely coupled methods based on the generalized Robin boundary conditions. In the first partitioned method, the Navier--Stokes problem is solved separately from the Biot problem. In the second proposed method, the problem is further split by separating the Biot problem into a mechanics subproblem and a Darcy subproblem. We derive the energy estimates for the proposed methods on a simplified, linear problem and show that the first partitioned method is unconditionally stable. The second partitioned method is shown to be energy-stable if the structure is viscoelastic and if certain conditions on the problem parameters and the time step are satisfied. The performance of both methods is investigated in the numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Fueled by many applications in random processes, imaging science, geophysics, etc., fractional Laplacians have recently received significant attention. The key driving force behind the success of this operator is its ability to capture nonlocal effects while enforcing less smoothness on functions. In this article, we introduce a spectral method to approximate this operator employing a sinc basis. Using our scheme, the evaluation of the operator and its application onto a vector has complexity of $\mathcal O(N\log(N))$, where $N$ is the number of unknowns. Thus, using iterative methods such as conjugate gradient, we provide an efficient strategy to solve fractional PDEs with exterior Dirichlet conditions on arbitrary Lipschitz domains. Our implementation works in both two and three dimensions. We also recover the FEM rates of convergence on benchmark problems. For fractional exponent $s=1/4$, our current three-dimensional implementation can solve the Dirichlet problem with $5\cdot 10^6$ unknowns in under 2 hours on a standard office workstation. We further illustrate the efficiency of our approach by applying it to fractional Allen--Cahn and image denoising problems.},

  abstract     = {Computing a flow system a number of times with different samples of flow parameters is a common practice in many uncertainty quantification applications, which can be prohibitively expensive for complex nonlinear flow problems. This report presents two second order, stabilized, scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) ensemble algorithms for fast computation of the Navier--Stokes flow ensembles: Stab-SAV-CN and Stab-SAV-BDF2. The proposed ensemble algorithms are based on the ensemble timestepping idea which makes use of a quantity called the ensemble mean to construct a common coefficient matrix for all realizations at the same time step after spatial discretization, in which case efficient block solvers, e.g., block GMRES, can be used to significantly reduce both storage and computational time. The adoption of a recently developed SAV approach that treats the nonlinear term explicitly results in a constant shared coefficient matrix among all realizations at different time steps, which further cuts down the computational cost, yielding an extremely efficient ensemble algorithm for simulating nonlinear flow ensembles with provable long time stability without any time step conditions. The SAV approach for the Navier--Stokes equations for a single realization was proved to be unconditionally stable in [L. Lin, Z. Yang, and S. Dong, J. Comput. Phys., 388 (2019), pp 1--22; X. Li and J. Shen, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 58 (2020), pp. 2465--2491]. However we found the SAV approach has very low accuracy that compromises its stability in our initial numerical investigations for several commonly tested benchmark flow problems. In this report, we propose to use the stabilization $-\alpha h \Delta (u^{n+1}-u^n)$ in Stab-SAV-CN and $-\alpha h \Delta (3u^{n+1}-4 u^{n}+u^{n-1})$ in Stab-SAV-BDF2 to address this issue. We prove that both of our ensemble algorithms are long time stable under one parameter fluctuation condition, without any time step constraints. For a single realization, both algorithms are unconditionally stable and have better accuracy than the SAV methods studied in [L. Lin, Z. Yang, and S. Dong, J. Comput. Phys., 388 (2019), pp 1--22; X. Li and J. Shen, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 58 (2020), pp. 2465--2491] for our test problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to show the efficiency of the proposed ensemble algorithms and the effectiveness of the stabilization for increasing accuracy and stability.},

In this paper we focus on the fast sampling of Gaussian fields using quasi-random points in a finite element and multilevel quasi Monte Carlo (MLQMC) setting. Our method uses the stochastic PDE (SPDE) approach of Lindgren et al. combined with a new fast algorithm for white noise sampling which is tailored to (ML)QMC. We express white noise as a wavelet series expansion that we divide into two parts. The first part is sampled using quasi-random points and contains a finite number of terms in order of decaying importance to ensure good quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) convergence. The second part is a correction term which is sampled using standard pseudo-random numbers. We show how the sampling of both terms can be performed in linear time and memory complexity in the number of mesh cells via a supermesh construction, yielding an overall linear cost. Furthermore, our technique can be used to enforce the MLQMC coupling even in the case of nonnested mesh hierarchies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with numerical experiments.},

We employ a three-operator splitting proposed by Davis and Yin [Set-Valued Var. Anal., 25 (2017), pp. 829--858] (namely, DYS) to solve the resulting possibly nonconvex problems and develop the convergence theory for this three-operator splitting algorithm in the nonconvex case. We show that when the step size is chosen less than a computable threshold, the whole sequence converges to a stationary point. By defining a new decreasing energy function associated with the DYS method, we establish the global convergence of the whole sequence and a local convergence rate under an additional assumption that $F$, $G$, and $H$ are semialgebraic. We also provide sufficient conditions for the boundedness of the generated sequence. Finally, some numerical experiments are conducted to compare the DYS algorithm with some classical efficient algorithms for sparse signal recovery and low rank matrix completion. The numerical results indicate that DYS outperforms the existing methods for these applications.},

In this paper, we generalize the block circulant preconditioner by introducing a small parameter $\epsilon&gt;0$ into the top-right block of the block circulant preconditioner. The implementation of the generalized preconditioner requires the same computational complexity as that of the block circulant one. Theoretically, we prove that (i) the generalization preserves the diagonalizability and the identity-plus-low-rank decomposition; (ii) all eigenvalues of the new preconditioned matrix are clustered at 1 for sufficiently small $\epsilon$; (iii) GMRES method for the preconditioned system has a linear convergence rate independent of size of the linear system when $\epsilon$ is taken to be smaller than or comparable to square root of time-step size. Numerical results are reported to confirm the efficiency of the proposed preconditioner and to show that the generalization improves the performance of block circulant preconditioner.},

The multiview canonical correlation analysis is a statistical approach which fuses each subvariable $\mathtt{v}_i$ into a reduced one $s_i={x}_i^{T}\mathtt{v}_i$ through a linear combination ${x}_i$ so that the fused $m$ random variables achieve the maximum of a certain type of correlation. Among many criteria that measure the correlation, one of the earliest rules is to maximize the sum of all pairwise correlations subject to the ellipsoidal constraint of each ${x}_i$. The model is commonly referred to as the maximal correlation problem (MCP), and the associated KKT system is called the multivariate eigenvalue problem (MEP). Existing methods for MCP and/or MEP may encounter slow convergence or be inapplicable in applications with high-dimensional features. This paper proposes a Krylov subspace-type method by exploiting the special structure of the ellipsoidal constraint of ${x}_i$. Both the global convergence and the local convergence rate are studied, and numerical verification of the efficiency is carried out on both synthetic examples and applications of the unsupervised feature fusion with real data.},

Further, we provide an efficient way to deal with the box-constraints which play a central role for the use of iterative linear solvers in contour-based eigensolvers. Indeed, these parameter-free filters consistently minimize the number of iterations and the number of FLOPs to reach convergence in the eigensolver.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new stabilizer-free and pressure-robust weak Galerkin finite element method for the Stokes equations with superconvergence on polytopal mesh in the primary velocity-pressure formulation. Convergence rates with one order higher than the optimal order for velocity in both the energy norm and the $L^2$-norm and for pressure in the $L^2$-norm are proved in our proposed scheme. The $H$(div)-preserving operator has been constructed based on the polygonal mesh for arbitrary polynomial degrees and employed in the body source assembling to break the locking phenomenon induced by poor mass conservation in the classical discretization. Moreover, the velocity error in our proposed scheme is proved to be independent of pressure and thus we confirm the pressure-robustness. For Stokes simulation, our proposed scheme only modifies the body source assembling but keeps the same stiffness matrix. Four numerical experiments are conducted to validate the convergence results and robustness.},

However, these networks are restricted to data on structured meshes. Unstructured meshes are often required for performing analyses of real systems with complex geometry. Our custom graph convolution operators based on the available differential operators for a given spatial discretization effectively extend the application space of deep convolutional autoencoders to systems with arbitrarily complex geometry that are typically discretized using unstructured meshes. We propose sets of convolution operators based on the spatial derivative operators for the underlying spatial discretization, making the method particularly well suited to data arising from the solution of partial differential equations. We demonstrate the method using examples from heat transfer and fluid mechanics and show better than an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over linear methods.},

In particular, we explore the case of a partially observed diffusion, with data also arriving according to a diffusion process. Based upon a standard identity of the score function, we consider two particle filter based methodologies to estimate the score function. Both methods rely on an online estimation algorithm for the score function, as described, e.g., in [P. Del Moral, A. Doucet, and S. S. Singh, M$2$AN Math. Model. Numer. Anal., 44 (2010), pp. 947--975], of $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ cost, with $N\in\mathbb{N}$ the number of particles. The first approach employs a simple Euler discretization and standard particle smoothers and is of cost $\mathcal{O}(N^2 + N\Delta_l^{-1})$ per unit time, where $\Delta_l=2^{-l}$, $l\in\mathbb{N}_0$, is the time-discretization step. The second approach is new and based upon a novel diffusion bridge construction. It yields a new backward-type Feynman--Kac formula in continuous time for the score function and is presented along with a particle method for its approximation. Considering a time-discretization, the cost is $\mathcal{O}(N^2\Delta_l^{-1})$ per unit time. To improve computational costs, we then consider multilevel methodologies for the score function. We illustrate our parameter estimation method via stochastic gradient approaches in several numerical examples.},

Nonlinear preconditioning, such as the inexact Newton with backtracking and nonlinear elimination algorithm and the multiplicative Schwarz preconditioned inexact Newton algorithm, may be effective in improving global convergence for Newton&#39;s method. It may prevent stagnation of the nonlinear residual norm and reduce the number of solutions of large ill-conditioned linear systems involving a global Jacobian required at each nonlinear iteration.

We evaluate the performance of TriCG and TriMR on linear systems generated from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection and from discretized and stabilized Stokes equations. We compare TriCG and TriMR with Symmlq and Minres, the recommended Krylov methods for symmetric and indefinite systems. In all our experiments, TriCG and TriMR terminate earlier than Symmlq and Minres on a residual-based stopping condition with an improvement of up to 50\% in terms of number of iterations. They also terminate more reliably than Block-Cg and Block-Minres. Experiments in quadruple and octuple precision suggest that loss of orthogonality in the basis vectors is significantly less pronounced in TriCG and TriMR than in Block-Cg and Block-Minres.},

In this case, a direct discretization of the energy functional induces a discretization of the differential operator. Following this approach, the discrete equations are naturally symmetric if the energy functional is self-adjoint, a property that may be lost when using standard difference formulas on nonuniform meshes or when the differential operator has varying coefficients. Low order finite difference or finite element systems can be derived by this approach in a systematic way and on logically structured meshes they become compact difference formulas. Extrapolation formulas used on the discrete energy can then lead to higher oder approximations of the differential operator. A rigorous analysis is presented for extrapolation used in combination with nonstandard integration rules for finite elements. Extrapolation can likewise be applied on matrix-free finite difference stencils. In our applications, both schemes show up to quartic order of convergence.},

  abstract     = {Today, high-dimensional calculations can be found in almost all scientific disciplines. The application of machine learning and uncertainty quantification methods are common examples where high-dimensional problems appear. Typically, these problems are computationally expensive or even infeasible on current machines due to the curse of dimensionality. The sparse grid combination technique is one method to mitigate this effect, but it still does not generate optimal grids for many application scenarios. In such cases, adaptivity strategies are applied to further optimize the grid generation. Generally, adaptive grid generation strategies can be be classified as spatially or dimensionally adaptive. One of the most prominent examples is the dimension-adaptive combination technique, which is easy to implement and suitable for cases where dimensions contribute in different magnitudes to the accuracy of the solution. Unfortunately, spatial adaptivity is not possible in the standard combination technique due to the required regular structure of the grids. We therefore propose a new algorithmic variant of the combination technique that is based on the combination of rectilinear grids which can adapt themselves locally to the target function using 1-dimensional refinements. We further increase the efficiency by adjusting point levels with tree rebalancing. Results for numerical quadrature and interpolation show that we can significantly improve upon the standard combination technique and compete with or even surpass common spatially adaptive implementations with sparse grids. At the same time our method keeps the black-box property of the combination technique which makes it possible to apply it to black-box solvers.},

Three-dimensional domain decomposition is utilized for both the electrostatic field solver with IFE and the particle operations in PIC to distribute the computation among multiple processors.

We propose a two-step algorithm to construct the finite element space at hand by means of a discrete extension operator that carefully mixes aggregation constraints of problematic degrees of freedom, which get rid of the small cut cell problem, and standard hanging degree of freedom constraints, which ensure trace continuity on nonconforming meshes. Following this approach, we derive a finite element space that can be expressed as the original one plus well-defined linear constraints. Moreover, it requires minimum parallelization effort, using standard functionality available in existing large-scale finite element codes. Numerical experiments demonstrate its optimal mesh adaptation capability, robustness to cut location, and parallel efficiency, on classical Poisson hp-adaptivity benchmarks. Our work opens the path to functional and geometrical error-driven dynamic mesh adaptation with the aggregated finite element method in large-scale realistic scenarios. Likewise, it can offer guidance for bridging other scalable unfitted methods and parallel adaptive mesh refinement.},

Thus, complex and high-dimensional functions can end up extremely demanding (from the computational point of view) to be optimized with the standard algorithm. To address this issue, we propose to linearly map the input parameter space of the original function onto its AS before the evolution, performing the mutation and mate processes in a lower-dimensional space. In this contribution, we describe the novel method called ASGA, presenting differences and similarities with the standard GA method. We test the proposed method over $n$-dimensional benchmark functions---Rosenbrock, Ackley, Bohachevsky, Rastrigin, Schaffer N. 7, and Zakharov---and finally we apply it to an aeronautical shape optimization problem.},

When the data available is directly on the PDF, there exist methods for inverse problems that can be employed to infer the coefficients and thus determine the FP equation and subsequently obtain its solution. Herein, we address a more realistic scenario, where only sparse data are given on the particles&#39; positions at a few time instants, which are not sufficient to accurately construct directly the PDF even at those times from existing methods, e.g., kernel estimation algorithms. To this end, we develop a general framework based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that introduces a new loss function using the Kullback--Leibler divergence to connect the stochastic samples with the FP equation to simultaneously learn the equation and infer the multidimensional PDF at all times. In particular, we consider two types of inverse problems, type I, where the FP equation is known but the initial PDF is unknown, and type II, in which, in addition to the unknown initial PDF, the drift and diffusion terms are also unknown. In both cases, we investigate problems with either Brownian or Lévy noise or a combination of both. We demonstrate the new PINN framework in detail in the one-dimensional (1D) case, but we also provide results for up to five dimensions demonstrating that we can infer both the FP equation and dynamics simultaneously at all times with high accuracy using only very few discrete observations of the particles.},

The main contribution of this work consists of two aspescts: the proposal of a novel regularized boundary integral equation, and the presentation of new regularized formulations of the strongly singular and hyper-singular boundary integral operators. First, turning to the spectral properties of the double-layer operator and the corresponding Calderón relation of the poroelasticity, we propose the novel low-GMRES-iteration integral equation whose eigenvalues are bounded away from zero and infinity. Second, with the help of the classical idea of using Günter derivatives and integration-by-parts, we reformulate the strongly singular and hyper-singular integral operators into combinations of the weakly singular operators and the tangential derivatives. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology are demonstrated through several numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {We develop an asymptotic preserving scheme for the gray radiative transfer equation. Two asymptotic regimes are considered: one is a diffusive regime described by a nonlinear diffusion equation for the material temperature; the other is a free streaming regime with zero opacity. To alleviate the restriction on time step and capture the correct front propagation in the diffusion limit, an implicit treatment is crucial. However, this often involves a large-scale nonlinear iterative solver as the spatial and angular dimensions are coupled. Our idea is to introduce an auxiliary variable that leads to a “redundant&quot; system, which is then solved with a three-stage update: prediction, correction, and projection. The benefit of this approach is that the implicit system is local to each spatial element, independent of angular variable, and thus only requires a scalar Newton&#39;s solver. We also introduce a spatial discretization with a compact stencil based on even-odd decomposition. Our method preserves both the nonlinear diffusion limit with correct front propagation speed and the free streaming limit, with a hyperbolic CFL condition.},

The proposed DDSMs are easy to be implemented, capable of incorporating multiple Cauchy data pairs to achieve high-quality reconstruction and highly robust with respect to large noise. Additionally, the implementation of DDSMs adopts offline-online decomposition, which helps to reduce a lot of computational costs and makes DDSMs as efficient as the conventional DSM proposed by Chow, Ito, and Zou. The numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficacy and show the potential benefits of combining DNN with DSM.},

These functions play a major role in modern actuarial science, and there are still many open problems left behind such as the one here of looking for a universal effective numerical scheme for them. By extending the celebrated Ballot Theorem to the continuous setting, we first derive an explicit integral expression for these functions, with an arbitrary penalty, in terms of their infinite-time counterpart. As is common in actuarial or financial practice, an advanced knowledge of the characteristic function of the driving Lévy process facilitates the applicants of the Fourier-cosine method to this integral expression. Under some mild and practically feasible assumptions, a comprehensive and rigorous (yet demanding) error analysis is provided; indeed, up to an arbitrarily chosen error tolerance level, the numerical scheme is linear in computational complexity, which can even reach the theoretically fastest possible rate of 3; all of these are the most effective records of the contemporary state of the art in actuarial science. Finally, the effectiveness of our approximation method is illustrated through different representative numerical experiments, some of which, such as those driven by Gamma and Generalized Stable Processes, are even achieved for the first time in the literature, due to the limitations of most common existing approaches; we shall discuss this more in this article.},

The approach for solving the vector potential is based on the method of lines transpose and is A-stable, eliminating the need for diffusion limiters needed in our previous work in three dimensions. For problems with strong shocks, this approach offers considerable improvements when compared with our previous version of constrained transport.

  abstract     = {In ptychography experiments, redundant scanning is usually required to guarantee the stable recovery, such that a huge number of frames are generated, and thus it poses a great demand on parallel computing to solve this large-scale inverse problem. In this paper, we propose the overlapping domain decomposition methods to solve the nonconvex optimization problem in ptychographic imaging. They decouple the problem defined on the whole domain into subproblems only defined on the subdomains with synchronizing information in the overlapping regions of these subdomains, thus leading to highly parallel algorithms with good load balance. More specifically, for the nonblind recovery (with known probe in advance), by enforcing the continuity of the overlapping regions for the image (sample), the nonlinear optimization model is established based on a novel smooth-truncated amplitude-Gaussian metric (ST-AGM). Such a metric allows for fast calculation of the proximal mapping with closed form, and meanwhile provides the possibility for the convergence guarantee of the first-order nonconvex optimization algorithm due to its Lipschitz smoothness. Then the alternating direction method of multipliers is utilized to generate an efficient overlapping domain decomposition based ptychography algorithm (OD${}^2$P) for the two-subdomain domain decomposition (DD), where all subproblems can be computed with closed-form solutions. Due to the Lipschitz continuity for the gradient of the objective function with ST-AGM, the convergence of the proposed OD${}^2$P is derived under mild conditions. Moreover, it is extended to more general cases including multiple-subdomain DD and blind recovery. Numerical experiments are further conducted to show the performance of proposed algorithms, demonstrating good convergence speed and robustness to the noise. Especially, we report the virtual wall-clock time of proposed algorithm up to 10 processors, which shows potential for upcoming massively parallel computations.},

Our generalized skeletonization factorization retains the locality property afforded by the “proxy point method,” and allows for a parallelized implementation where different processors work on different parts of the boundary simultaneously. Further, when the boundary undergoes local geometric perturbations (such as movement of an interior hole), the factorization can be recomputed efficiently with respect to the number of modified discretization nodes.

We analyze the mean square error of the control variate estimator when the coefficients of the polynomial chaos approximation are obtained from Monte Carlo simulation. For a fixed computational cost, we determine the optimal allocation of cost between approximating the polynomial chaos coefficients and estimating the expectation of the function with the control variate estimator. Then, we examine the effects of setting the control to a polynomial chaos approximation of a reduced model, formed by freezing the insignificant inputs of the original model using global sensitivity analysis. We introduce two other polynomial chaos-based control variate methods for the calculation of Sobol&#39; sensitivity indices, and compare our methods numerically against crude Monte Carlo and an approach that only uses polynomial chaos. Finally, we present some applications to option pricing, and compute the sensitivities of IEEE 14 busbar power system.},

  abstract     = {Preconditioners are generally essential for fast convergence in the iterative solution of linear systems of equations. However, the computation of a good preconditioner can be expensive. So, while solving a sequence of many linear systems, it is advantageous to recycle preconditioners; that is, update a previous preconditioner and reuse the updated version. In this paper, we introduce a simple and effective method for doing this. We consider recycling preconditioners for both the general case of sequences of linear systems ${A}({p}_k) {x}_k = {b}_k$ as well as the important special case of the type $(s_k{E} + {A}){x}_k = {b}_k$. The right-hand sides may or may not change. We update preconditioners by defining a map from a new matrix to a previous matrix, for example, the first matrix in the sequence. We then combine the preconditioner for this previous matrix with the map to define the new preconditioner. This approach has several advantages. The update is independent from the original preconditioner, so it can be applied to any preconditioner. The possibly high cost of an initial preconditioner can be amortized over many linear solves. The cost of updating the preconditioner is more or less constant and there is flexibility in balancing the quality of the map with the computational cost. In the numerical experiments section, we demonstrate good results for several applications, in particular when using an algebraic multigrid preconditioner.},

Even though these intermediate solutions are far from the exact algebraic solutions, their a posteriori error estimation produces a refinement pattern that is substantially equivalent to the one that would be generated by classical AFEM, at a considerable fraction of the computational cost. We provide a qualitative analysis of how the error propagates throughout the algorithm, and we present a series of numerical experiments that highlight the efficiency and the computational speedup of S-AFEM.},

Combining tensorized Chebyshev interpolation with a Tucker decomposition of low multilinear rank yields function approximations that can be computed and stored very efficiently. The existing Chebfun3 algorithm [B. Hashemi and L. N. Trefethen, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 39 (2017), pp. C341--C363] uses a similar format, but the construction of the approximation proceeds indirectly, via a so-called slice-Tucker decomposition. As a consequence, Chebfun3 sometimes unnecessarily uses many function evaluations and does not fully benefit from the potential of the Tucker decomposition to reduce, sometimes dramatically, the computational cost. We propose a novel algorithm Chebfun3F that utilizes univariate fibers instead of bivariate slices to construct the Tucker decomposition. Chebfun3F reduces the cost for the approximation in terms of the number of function evaluations for nearly all functions considered, typically by 75\% and sometimes by over 98\%.},

We propose a new fast, stable, and highly parallelable direct sampling method (DSM) for the simultaneous reconstruction process. Two groups of probing and index functions are constructed, and their desired properties are analyzed. In order to identify and decouple the multiple inhomogeneous inclusions of different physical nature, we introduce a new concept of mutually almost orthogonality property that generalizes the important concept of almost orthogonality property in classical DSMs for inhomogeneous inclusions of same physical nature in [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 37 (2015), pp. A1658--A1684; Inverse Problems, 30 (2014), 095003; SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 40 (2018), pp. A2720--A2748; Inverse Problems, 28 (2012), 025003; Inverse Probl.

With the help of this new concept, we develop a reliable strategy to distinguish two different types of inhomogeneous inclusions with noisy data collected at one or two measurement events. We further improve the decoupling effect by choosing an appropriate boundary influx. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

When available, these ambiguity sets are constructed from both data (collected at the initial time and along the boundaries of the physical domain) and concentration-of-measure results on the Wasserstein metric. To propagate the ambiguity sets into the future, we use a physics-dependent equation governing the evolution of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) obtained through the method of distributions. We investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of data-driven ambiguity sets and their associated guarantees when the random QoIs they describe obey hyperbolic partial differential equations with random inputs. For general nonlinear hyperbolic equations with smooth solutions, the CDF equation is used to propagate the upper and lower envelopes of pointwise ambiguity bands. For linear dynamics, the CDF equation allows us to construct an evolution equation for tighter ambiguity balls. We demonstrate that, in both cases, the ambiguity sets are guaranteed to contain the true (unknown) distribution within a prescribed confidence.},

Transport dominated phenomena, ubiquitous in technical and scientific applications, often require a large number of linear modes to obtain a small representation error. This difficulty, even for the most simple transports, originates from the inappropriateness of the decomposition structure in time dependent amplitudes of purely spatial modes. In this article an approach is discussed that decomposes a flow field into several fields of co-moving frames, where each one can be approximated by a few modes. The central aspect of this report is a transparent formulation of this decomposition as an optimization problem. Different singular-value-based objective functions are discussed and connected to former formulations. A boundary treatment is provided. The decomposition is applied to generic cases and to a technically relevant flow configuration of combustion physics.},

The region to be covered may be disconnected, be nonconvex, have Lipschitz boundary, and in particular have corners. Nullifying the area of the complement of the union of balls with respect to the region to be covered is considered as the constraint, while minimizing the balls&#39; radius is the objective function. The first-order sensitivity analysis of the area to be nullified in the constraint is performed using shape optimization techniques. Bi-Lipschitz mappings are built to model small perturbations of the nonsmooth shape defined via unions and intersections; this allows us to compute the derivative of the constraint via the notion of shape derivative. The considered approach is fairly general and can be adapted to tackle other relevant nonsmooth shape optimization problems. By discretizing the integrals that appear in the formulation of the problem and its derivatives, a nonlinear programming problem is obtained. From the practical point of view, the region to be covered is modeled by an oracle that, for a given point, answers whether it belongs to the region or not. No additional information on the region is required. Numerical examples in which the nonlinear programming problem is solved with an augmented Lagrangian approach are presented. The experiments illustrate the wide variety of regions whose covering can be addressed with the proposed approach.},

Surprisingly, this problem has a closed-form solution that can be computed efficiently, recovering the popular Vecchia approximation in spatial statistics. Based on recent results on the approximate sparsity of inverse Cholesky factors of $\Theta$ obtained from pairwise evaluation of Green&#39;s functions of elliptic boundary-value problems at points ${x_{i}}_{1 \leq i \leq N} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$, we propose an elimination ordering and sparsity pattern that allows us to compute $\epsilon$-approximate inverse Cholesky factors of such $\Theta$ in computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(N \log(N/\epsilon)^d)$ in space and $\mathcal{O}(N \log(N/\epsilon)^{2d})$ in time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best asymptotic complexity for this class of problems. Furthermore, our method is embarrassingly parallel, automatically exploits low-dimensional structure in the data, and can perform Gaussian-process regression in linear (in $N$) space complexity. Motivated by its optimality properties, we propose applying our method to the joint covariance of training and prediction points in Gaussian-process regression, greatly improving stability and computational cost. Finally, we show how to apply our method to the important setting of Gaussian processes with additive noise, compromising neither accuracy nor computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Divergence-free (div-free) and curl-free vector fields are pervasive in many areas of science and engineering, from fluid dynamics to electromagnetism. A common problem that arises in applications is that of constructing smooth approximants to these vector fields and/or their potentials based only on discrete samples. Additionally, it is often necessary that the vector approximants preserve the div-free or curl-free properties of the field to maintain certain physical constraints. Div/curl-free radial basis functions (RBFs) are a particularly good choice for this application as they are meshfree and analytically satisfy the div-free or curl-free property. However, this method can be computationally expensive due to its global nature. In this paper, we develop a technique for bypassing this issue that combines div/curl-free RBFs in a partition of unity framework, where one solves for local approximants over subsets of the global samples and then blends them together to form a div-free or curl-free global approximant. The method is applicable to div/curl-free vector fields in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and tangential fields on two-dimensional surfaces, such as the sphere, and the curl-free method can be generalized to vector fields in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The method also produces an approximant for the scalar potential of the underlying sampled field. We present error estimates and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on several test problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we present a multilevel preconditioner based on overlapping Schwarz methods for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. Robust two-level Schwarz preconditioners exist in the literature to guarantee fast convergence of Krylov methods. As long as the dimension of the coarse space is reasonable, that is, exact solvers can be used efficiently, two-level methods scale well on parallel architectures. However, the factorization of the coarse space matrix may become costly at scale. An alternative is then to use an iterative method on the second level, combined with an algebraic preconditioner, such as a one-level additive Schwarz preconditioner. Nevertheless, the condition number of the resulting preconditioned coarse space matrix may still be large. One of the difficulties of using more advanced methods, like algebraic multigrid or even two-level overlapping Schwarz methods, to solve the coarse problem is that the matrix does not arise from a partial differential equation (PDE) anymore. We introduce in this paper a robust multilevel additive Schwarz preconditioner where at each level the condition number is bounded, ensuring a fast convergence for each nested solver. Furthermore, our construction does not require any additional information than for building a two-level method and may thus be seen as an algebraic extension.},

  abstract     = {The biharmonic problem is a fourth order partial differential equation and thus requires two boundary conditions, and not just one like in the Laplace case, where the notion of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions comes from. A variational formulation gives an indication of which two conditions one could consider as Neumann, and which two as Dirichlet, and this choice was made in the literature to define Dirichlet--Neumann (and other) domain decomposition algorithms for the biharmonic equation. We show here that if one chooses other sets of two boundary conditions as Dirichlet and Neumann, one can obtain other Dirichlet--Neumann algorithms, and we prove that the classical choice leads to an algorithm with much less favorable convergence characteristics than our new choice. Our proof is based on showing that even optimizing the relaxation matrices (not just scalars) arising in the Dirichlet--Neumann algorithm running on two boundary conditions, the classical choice of Dirichlet and Neumann cannot achieve contraction rates comparable to our new choice, even though mesh independent convergence is achieved. We illustrate our results with numerical experiments, also exploring situations not covered by our analysis, and a simulation of the Golden Gate Bridge.},

  abstract     = {We introduce the Lipschitz matrix: a generalization of the scalar Lipschitz constant for functions with many inputs. Among the Lipschitz matrices compatible with a particular function, we choose the smallest such matrix in the Frobenius norm to encode the structure of this function. The Lipschitz matrix then provides a function-dependent metric on the input space. Altering this metric to reflect a particular function improves the performance of many tasks in computational science. Compared to the Lipschitz constant, the Lipschitz matrix reduces the worst-case cost of approximation, integration, and optimization; if the Lipschitz matrix is low rank, this cost no longer depends on the dimension of the input, but instead on the rank of the Lipschitz matrix mitigating the curse of dimensionality. Both the Lipschitz constant and matrix define uncertainty away from point queries of the function, and by using the Lipschitz matrix we can reduce uncertainty. If we build a minimax space-filling design of experiments in the Lipschitz matrix metric, we can further reduce this uncertainty. When the Lipschitz matrix is approximately low rank, we can perform parameter reduction by constructing a ridge approximation whose active subspace is the span of the dominant eigenvectors of the Lipschitz matrix. In summary, the Lipschitz matrix provides a new tool for analyzing and performing parameter reduction in complex models arising in computational science.},

In this paper, we will exploit this low-rank approximation property by solving the optimization problem directly over the set of low-rank matrices. In particular, we introduce a new multilevel algorithm, where the optimization variable is constrained to the Riemannian manifold of fixed-rank matrices. In contrast to most other multilevel algorithms, where the rank is chosen adaptively on each level in order to control the perturbation due to the low-rank truncation, we can keep the ranks (and thus the computational complexity) fixed throughout the iterations. Furthermore, classical implementations of line searches based on Wolfe conditions enable computing a solution where the numerical accuracy is limited to about the square root of the machine epsilon. Here, we propose an extension to Riemannian manifolds of the line search of Hager and Zhang, which uses approximate Wolfe conditions that enable computing a solution on the order of the machine epsilon. Numerical experiments demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed framework.},

It has been a challenging problem to design unconditionally MBP-preserving high-order accurate time-stepping schemes for these equations. In this paper, we combine the integrating factor Runge--Kutta (IFRK) method with the linear stabilization technique to develop a stabilized IFRK (sIFRK) method, and we successfully derive sufficient conditions for the proposed method to preserve the MBP unconditionally in the discrete setting. We then elaborate some sIFRK schemes with up to the third-order accuracy, which are proven to be unconditionally MBP-preserving by verifying these conditions. In addition, it is shown that many classic strong stability-preserving sIFRK schemes do not satisfy these conditions except the first-order one. Extensive numerical experiments are also carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

Our approach is based on fitting feed-forward neural networks to synthetic data sets constructed from circular interfaces immersed in uniform grids of various resolutions. These multilayer perceptrons process the level-set values from mesh points next to the free boundary and output the dimensionless curvature at their closest locations on the interface. Accuracy analyses involving irregular interfaces, in both uniform and adaptive grids, show that our models are competitive with traditional numerical schemes in the $L^1$ and $L^2$ norms. In particular, our neural networks approximate curvature with comparable precision in coarse resolutions, when the interface features steep curvature regions, and when the number of iterations to reinitialize the level-set function is small. Although the conventional numerical approach is more robust than our framework, our results have unveiled the potential of machine learning for dealing with computational tasks where the level-set method is known to experience difficulties. We also establish that an application-dependent map of local resolutions to neural models can be devised to estimate mean curvature more effectively than a universal neural network.},

  abstract     = {Based on the parallel cyclic reduction technique, a promising new parallel algorithm is designed for pentadiagonal systems. Subject to fulfilling stability conditions, this highly parallelizable algorithm works very well for systems of any size. The solver is implemented on a graphics processing unit using the CUDA programming platform where it is empirically studied for its performance in comparison with some of the present-day prominent parallel solvers. The construction of the new algorithm is originally motivated by a real-world application in computational finance. Accordingly, it is employed successfully to numerically solve the convection-dominated Heston partial differential equation for pricing a financial option, and implementation of the full solver is discussed in detail.},

  abstract     = {We are interested in parallelizing the least angle regression (LARS) algorithm for fitting linear regression models to high-dimensional data. We consider two parallel and communication avoiding versions of the basic LARS algorithm. The two algorithms have different asymptotic costs and practical performance. One offers more speedup and the other produces more accurate output. The first is bLARS, a block version of the LARS algorithm, where we update $b$ columns at each iteration. Assuming that the data are row-partitioned, bLARS reduces the number of arithmetic operations, latency, and bandwidth by a factor of $b$. The second is tournament-bLARS (T-bLARS), a tournament version of LARS where processors compete by running several LARS computations in parallel to choose $b$ new columns to be added in the solution. Assuming that the data are column-partitioned, T-bLARS reduces latency by a factor of $b$. Similarly to LARS, our proposed methods generate a sequence of linear models. We present extensive numerical experiments that illustrate speedups up to 4x compared to LARS without any compromise in solution quality.},

This paper details our recent implementation of parallel mesh reading and topological interpolation (computation of edges and faces from a cell-vertex mesh) into DMPlex. We apply these developments to seismic wave propagation scenarios on Mars as an example application. The principal motivation is to overcome single-node memory limits and reach mesh sizes which were impossible before.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new, conservative fully discrete scheme for the numerical solution of the regularized shallow water Boussinesq system of equations in the cases of periodic and reflective boundary conditions. The particular system is one of a class of equations derived recently and can be used in practical simulations to describe the propagation of weakly nonlinear and weakly dispersive long water waves, such as tsunamis. Studies of small-amplitude long waves usually require long-time simulations in order to investigate scenarios such as the overtaking collision of two solitary waves or the propagation of transoceanic tsunamis. For long-time simulations of nondissipative waves such as solitary waves, the preservation of the total energy by the numerical method can be crucial in the quality of the approximation. The new conservative fully discrete method consists of a Galerkin finite element method for spatial semidiscretization and an explicit relaxation Runge--Kutta scheme for integration in time. The Galerkin method is expressed and implemented in the framework of mixed finite element methods. This paper provides an extended experimental study of the accuracy and convergence properties of the new numerical method. The experiments reveal a new convergence pattern compared to the standard, nonconservative Galerkin methods.},

  abstract     = {The binary fluid surfactant phase-field model, coupled with two Cahn--Hilliard equations and Navier--Stokes equations, is a very complex nonlinear system, which poses many challenges to the design of numerical schemes. As far as the author knows, due to the highly nonlinear coupling nature, there is no fully decoupled scheme with second-order accuracy in time for numerical approximation. This paper proposes a novel decoupling approach by introducing a nonlocal auxiliary variable and its associated ODE to deal with the nonlinear coupling terms that satisfy the so-called zero-energy-contribution property. By combining it with other proven effective methods (the projection method of the Navier--Stokes equations and the SAV method of linearizing nonlinear potential), we arrive at a fully decoupled, linear, unconditionally energy stable scheme with second-order time accuracy. At each time step, only a few fully decoupled linear elliptic equations with constant coefficients are needed to be solved, which shows the advantages of ease of implementation and efficiency. We also prove the unconditional energy stability rigorously and provide various numerical simulations in two and three dimensions to demonstrate its stability and accuracy, numerically.},

It is of great interest in developing efficient methods with better algorithmic structures and proved convergence, which is, however, still lost and open for the classical augmented Lagrangian method (ALM)-based approaches. In this work, we propose two novel preconditioned and overrelaxed alternating direction methods of multipliers (ADMMs) with guaranteed convergence, which are based on the classical Eckstein--Bertsekas and Fortin--Glowinski splitting techniques. Particularly, the two new algorithms are essentially accelerated with the proposed preconditioners and overrelaxation schemes. We explore the proposed preconditioned overrelaxed ADMM methods for image segmentation; experiment results demonstrate the proposed methods significantly outperform the classical ALM-based algorithms in terms of superior numerical efficiency along with proved convergence.},

In realistic scenarios, there are often structures important to these flows that have a large extent but small width, including sea walls, berms, and harbor barriers. Explicit time stepping schemes, most often used for the shallow water equations, can then suffer from time step restrictions due to the CFL condition. In this article, we introduce an approach that side-steps these issues by allowing a barrier to have zero-width and to cut a cell arbitrarily without suffering from CFL restrictions. This is done by supplementing existing Riemann solvers and leveraging $h$-box and large time stepping methods. These methods preserve the properties of the Riemann solver and add negligible cost to the original solvers.},

Standard continuous piecewise linear finite elements are employed, and the algorithm does not have restrictions on the mesh structure or on the computational domain. In the inviscid case, we show that the resulting scheme satisfies a discrete maximum principle property under a standard CFL condition and observe, in practice, its second order accuracy in space. The algorithm successfully approximates several benchmarks with sharp transitions and fine structures typical of SQG flows.

Our method, which overcomes this difficulty, is to compute the Green&#39;s function of the semi-infinite Hamiltonian by imposing an appropriate boundary condition in the bulk direction; then, the spectral data is recovered via Riesz projection. We demonstrate our method&#39;s effectiveness by studies of edge states at a graphene zig-zag edge in the presence of defects modeled both by a discrete tight-binding model and a continuum PDE model under finite difference discretization. Our method may also be used to study states localized at domain wall-type edges in one- and two-dimensional materials where the edge Hamiltonian is infinite in both directions; we demonstrate this for the case of a tight-binding model of distinct honeycomb structures joined along a zig-zag edge. We expect our method to be useful for designing novel devices based on precise wave-guiding by edge states.},

Combining the laws of geometrical optics and energy conservation gives rise to a generalized Monge--Ampère equation. The underlying mathematical structure of some optical systems allows for an optimal-transport formulation of the problem with an associated cost function. This motivates the design of optimal-transport-based numerical algorithms. However, not all optical systems can be cast in the framework of optimal transport. In this paper, we derive a formulation in terms of generating functions where the generalized Monge--Ampère equation becomes a generated Jacobian equation. We present an iterative least-squares algorithm that can be used to solve generated Jacobian equations. We consider two example systems: System 1 is a single freeform lens with a point source and far-field target, and System 2 is a single freeform reflector with a parallel source beam and near-field target. We introduce a novel derivation of the generating functions via Hamilton&#39;s characteristics. We can associate a cost function to System 1, and we compare the performance of the numerical algorithm to a previous optimal-transport-based version. System 2 cannot be formulated as an optimal-transport problem, which demonstrates the wider applicability of the new version of the algorithm to any optical system that can be described by a smooth generating function.},

The indicator function is built using a similar concept as for differential sampling methods: compare the solution of the interior transmission problem for healthy inclusion with the one with embedded cracks.

One must navigate an energy landscape whose desirable critical points have sufficiently small basins of attractions that are inaccessible with Monte Carlo initialized gradient descent methods. We present a simple deterministic method for efficiently navigating the energy landscape in order to access these low energy CVTs. The method has two parameters and is based upon each generator moving away from the closest neighbor by a certain distance. We give a statistical analysis of the performance of this hybrid method comparing with the results of a large number of runs for both Lloyd&#39;s method and state-of-the-art quasi-Newton methods.

The method is energy stable and high order accurate. The highlight is that mesh sizes can be chosen according to the velocity structure of the material so that computational efficiency is improved. At the mesh refinement interfaces with hanging nodes, physical interface conditions are imposed by using ghost points and interpolation.

A key ingredient in multilevel methods is the relationship between the spatial accuracy at each level and the number of stochastic samples required to achieve that accuracy. Our sampling is based on flexible quadrature points that are designed for a prescribed accuracy, which can yield less overall computational cost compared to alternative multilevel methods. We propose a constrained optimization problem that determines the number of samples to balance the approximation error with the computational budget. We further show that the optimization problem is convex and derive analytic formulas for the optimal number of points at each level.

These important merits distinguish our method from other existing methods for fractional PDEs. Moreover, our method is simple and easy when handling complex geometries and local refinements, and its computer program implementation remains the same for any dimension $d \ge 1$. Extensive numerical experiments are provided to study the performance of our method in both approximating the Dirichlet Laplace operators and solving classical and fractional PDE problems. We show that our method has spectral accuracy and can achieve good approximation even with a small number of points.

The proposed approach combines the modified method of characteristics to deal with convection terms, the finite element discretization to manage irregular geometries, a direct conjugate gradient algorithm to solve the Stokes problem, and an adaptive ${L}^2$-projection using quadrature rules to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the method. In the present study, the gradient of the velocity field is used as an error indicator for adaptation of enrichments by increasing the number of quadrature points where it is needed without refining the mesh. Unlike other adaptive finite element methods for incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, linear systems in the proposed enriched Galerkin-characteristics finite element method preserve the same structure and size at each refinement in the adaptation procedure. We examine the performance of the proposed method for a coupled Burgers problem with known analytical solution and for the benchmark problem of flow past a circular cylinder. We also solve a transport problem in the Mediterranean Sea to demonstrate the ability of the method to resolve complex flow features in irregular geometries. Comparisons to the conventional Galerkin-characteristics finite element method are also carried out in the current work. The computed results support our expectations for an accurate and highly efficient enriched Galerkin-characteristics finite element method for incompressible Navier--Stokes equations.},

  abstract     = {We propose a recurrent neural network for a “model-free” simulation of a dynamical system with unknown parameters without prior knowledge. The deep learning model aims to jointly learn the nonlinear time marching operator and the effects of the unknown parameters from a time series data. We assume that the time series data set consists of an ensemble of trajectories for a range of the parameters. The learning task is formulated as a statistical inference problem by considering the unknown parameters as random variables. A latent variable is introduced to model the effects of the unknown parameters, and a variational inference method is employed to simultaneously train probabilistic models for the time marching operator and an approximate posterior distribution for the latent variable. Unlike the classical variational inference, where a factorized distribution is used to approximate the posterior, we employ a feedforward neural network supplemented by an encoder recurrent neural network to develop a more flexible probabilistic model. The approximate posterior distribution makes an inference on a trajectory to identify the effects of the unknown parameters. The time marching operator is approximated by a recurrent neural network, which takes a latent state sampled from the approximate posterior distribution as one of the input variables, to compute the time evolution of the probability distribution conditioned on the latent variable. In the numerical experiments, it is shown that the proposed variational inference model makes a more accurate simulation compared to the standard recurrent neural networks. It is found that the proposed deep learning model is capable of correctly identifying the dimensions of the random parameters and learning a representation of complex time series data.},

Both first and second order accurate temporal algorithms are considered. In the first order scheme, the convex potential and the surface diffusion terms are updated implicitly, while the concave potential term is updated explicitly. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical justification that this numerical algorithm has a unique solution such that the positivity is always preserved for the phase variable at a pointwise level, so that a singularity is avoided in the scheme. In fact, the singular nature of the Lennard--Jones potential term around the value of 0 prevents the numerical solution reaching such a singular value, so that the positivity structure is always preserved. Moreover, an unconditional energy stability of the numerical scheme is derived, without any restriction for the time step size. In the second order numerical scheme, the BDF temporal stencil is applied, and an alternate convex-concave decomposition is derived, so that the concave part corresponds to a quadratic energy. In turn, the combined Lennard--Jones potential term is treated implicitly, and the concave part is approximated by a second order Adams--Bashforth explicit extrapolation, and an artificial Douglas--Dupont regularization term is added to ensure the energy stability. The unique solvability and the positivity-preserving property for the second order scheme could be similarly established. In addition, optimal rate convergence analysis is provided for both the first and second order accurate schemes. A few numerical simulation results are also presented, which demonstrate the robustness of the numerical schemes.},

Existing strategies for high-dimensional problems often rely on specific, restrictive problem structures or are valid only locally around some nominal trajectory. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to approximate semiglobal solutions to HJB equations for general high-dimensional nonlinear systems and compute candidate optimal feedback controls in real-time. To accomplish this, we model solutions to HJB equations with neural networks (NNs) trained on data generated without discretizing the state space. Training is made more effective and data-efficient by leveraging the known physics of the problem and using the partially trained NN to aid in adaptive data generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by learning solutions to HJB equations corresponding to the attitude control of a six-dimensional nonlinear rigid body and nonlinear systems of dimension up to 30 arising from the stabilization of a Burgers&#39;-type partial differential equation. The trained NNs are then used for real-time feedback control of these systems.},

Phys., 415 (2020), 109485], to achieve the asymptotic preserving (AP) property and unconditional stability in the diffusive regime with $\varepsilon\ll 1$, numerical schemes are developed based on an additional reformulation of the even-odd or micro-macro decomposed version of the equation. The key of the reformulation is to add a weighted diffusive term on both sides of one equation in the decomposed system. The choice of the weight function, however, is problem-dependent and ad-hoc, and it can affect the performance of numerical simulations. To avoid issues related to the choice of the weight function and still obtain the AP property and unconditional stability in the diffusive regime, we propose in this paper a new family of AP schemes, termed as IMEX-DG-S schemes, directly solving the micro-macro decomposed system without any further reformulation. The main ingredients of the IMEX-DG-S schemes include globally stiffly accurate implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge--Kutta temporal discretizations with a new IMEX strategy, discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretizations, discrete ordinate methods for the velocity space, and the application of the Schur complement to the algebraic form of the schemes to control the overall computational cost. The AP property of the schemes is shown formally. With an energy type stability analysis applied to the first order scheme, and Fourier type stability analysis applied to the first to third order schemes, we confirm the uniform stability of the methods with respect to $\varepsilon$ and the unconditional stability in the diffusive regime. A series of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the new schemes.},

  abstract     = {This work develops a new multifidelity ensemble Kalman filter (MFEnKF) algorithm based on a linear control variate framework. The approach allows for rigorous multifidelity extensions of the EnKF, where the uncertainty in coarser fidelities in the hierarchy of models represents control variates for the uncertainty in finer fidelities. Small ensembles of high-fidelity model runs are complemented by larger ensembles of cheaper, lower-fidelity runs to obtain much improved analyses at only small additional computational costs. We investigate the use of reduced order models as coarse fidelity control variates in the MFEnKF and provide analyses to quantify the improvements over the traditional ensemble Kalman filters. We apply these ideas to perform data assimilation with a quasi-geostrophic test problem, using direct numerical simulation and a corresponding proper orthogonal decomposition--Galerkin reduced order model. Numerical results show that the two-fidelity MFEnKF provides better analyses than existing EnKF algorithms at comparable or reduced computational costs.},

  abstract     = {In many applications of practical interest, solutions of partial differential equation models arise as critical points of an underlying (energy) functional. If such solutions are saddle points, rather than being maxima or minima, then the theoretical framework is nonstandard, and the development of suitable numerical approximation procedures turns out to be highly challenging. In this paper, our aim is to present an iterative discretization methodology for the numerical solution of nonlinear variational problems with multiple (saddle point) solutions. In contrast to traditional numerical approximation schemes, which typically fail in such situations, the key idea of the current work is to employ a simultaneous interplay of a previously developed local minimax approach and adaptive Galerkin discretizations. We thereby derive an adaptive local minimax Galerkin (LMMG) method, which combines the search for saddle point solutions and their approximation in finite-dimensional spaces in a highly effective way. Under certain assumptions, we will prove that the generated sequence of approximate solutions converges to the solution set of the variational problem. This general framework will be applied to the specific context of finite element discretizations of (singularly perturbed) semilinear elliptic boundary value problems, and a series of numerical experiments will be presented.},

Second, the inverse problem is formulated as a statistical inference problem using the Bayes&#39; formula. The well-posedness of the posterior distribution is proved.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we design a truly exact perfect absorbing layer (PAL) for domain truncation of the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation in an unbounded domain with bounded scatterers. This technique is based on a complex compression coordinate transformation in polar coordinates and a judicious substitution of the unknown field in the artificial layer. Compared with the widely used perfectly matched layer (PML) methods, the distinctive features of PAL lie in that (i) it is truly exact in the sense that the PAL-solution is identical to the original solution in the bounded domain reduced by the truncation layer; (ii) with the substitution, the PAL-equation is free of singular coefficients and the substituted unknown field is essentially nonoscillatory in the layer; and (iii) the construction is valid for general star-shaped domain truncation. By formulating the variational formulation in Cartesian coordinates, the implementation of this technique using standard spectral-element or finite-element methods can be made easy as a usual coding practice. We provide ample numerical examples to demonstrate that this method is highly accurate and robust for very high wavenumbers and thin layers. It outperforms the classical PML and the recently advocated PML using unbounded absorbing functions. Moreover, it can fix some flaws of the PML approach.},

It is widely accepted that mesh generation is among the most cumbersome parts of the finite element method analysis and often requires human assistance, especially in complex three-dimensional geometries. When using alternative mesh-free approaches, the problem of mesh generation is simplified to the problem of positioning nodes, a much simpler task, though still not trivial. In this paper we present an algorithm for generation of nodes on arbitrary $d$-dimensional surfaces. This algorithm complements a recently published algorithm for generation of nodes in domain interiors and represents another step toward a fully automated dimension-independent solution procedure for solving partial differential equations. The proposed algorithm generates nodes with variable density on surfaces parameterized over arbitrary parametric domains in a dimension-independent way in $O(N\log N)$ time. It is also compared with existing algorithms for generation of surface nodes for mesh-free methods in terms of quality and execution time.},

The kernels are modified near the boundaries to prevent deterioration of the fidelity of the approximation. We implement our scheme using the standard single-level method as well as the multilevel technique designed to improve rates of approximation. Advantages of the proposed quasi-interpolation schemes are twofold. First, our sparse approximation attains almost the same level convergence order as the optimal approximation on the full grid related to the Strang--Fix condition, reducing the amount of data required significantly compared to full grid methods. Second, the single-level approximation performs nearly as well as the multilevel approximation, with much less computation time. We provide a rigorous proof for the approximation orders of our quasi-interpolations. In particular, compared to another quasi-interpolation scheme in the literature based on the Gaussian kernel using the multilevel technique, we show that our methods provide significantly better rates of approximation.

The main idea of these algorithms is to utilize the solutions on the $k$th-level adaptive meshes to find the solutions on the $(k+1)$th-level adaptive meshes which are constructed by performing adaptive element bisections on the $k$th-level adaptive meshes. These algorithms transform nonsymmetric positive definite (non-SPD) PDEs (resp., nonlinear PDEs) into symmetric positive definite (SPD) PDEs (resp., linear PDEs). The proposed algorithms are both accurate and efficient due to the following advantages: They do not need to solve the nonsymmetric or nonlinear systems; the degrees of freedom are very small, they are easily implemented, and the interpolation errors are very small. Next, this paper constructs residual-type a posteriori error estimators which are shown to be reliable and efficient. The key ingredient in proving the efficiency is to establish an upper bound of the oscillation terms, which may not be higher-order terms due to the low regularity of the numerical solution. Furthermore, the convergence of the algorithms is proved when bisection is used for the mesh refinements. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the ATG finite element algorithms compared to regular adaptive finite element algorithms and two-grid finite element algorithms [J.

Robustness with respect to the cuts is achieved by using a cell agglomeration technique, and robustness with respect to the contrast in the diffusion coefficients is achieved by using a different gradient reconstruction on each side of the interface. A key novel feature of the gradient reconstruction is to incorporate a jump term across the interface, thereby releasing the Nitsche penalty parameter from the constraint of being large enough. Error estimates with optimal convergence rates are established. A robust cell agglomeration procedure limiting the agglomerations to the nearest neighbors is devised.

In particular, we use the combined Tucker and quantized tensor train format (TQTT), which allows us to use astronomically large grid sizes. However, due to the ill-conditioning of discretized differential operators, such fine grids lead to numerical instabilities. To obtain a robust solver, we utilize the well-known alternating direction implicit method and modify it to avoid multiplication by differential operators. So as to make the method efficient, we derive an explicit TQTT representation of the iteration matrix and quantized tensor train representations of the inverses of symmetric tridiagonal Toeplitz matrices as an auxiliary result. As an application, we consider accurate solution of elliptic problems with singular potentials arising in electronic Schrödinger&#39;s equation.},

  abstract     = {Solutions to the linear complementarity problem (LCP) are naturally sparse in many applications such as bimatrix games and portfolio section problems. Despite that it gives rise to the hardness, sparsity makes optimization faster and enables relatively large scale computation. Motivated by this, we take the sparse LCP into consideration, investigating the existence and boundedness of its solution set as well as introducing a new merit function, which allows us to convert the problem into a sparsity constrained optimization. The function turns out to be continuously differentiable and twice continuously differentiable for some chosen parameters. Interestingly, it is also convex if the involved matrix is positive semidefinite. We then explore the relationship between the solution set to the sparse LCP and stationary points of the sparsity constrained optimization. Finally, Newton hard thresholding pursuit is adopted to solve the sparsity constrained model. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the problem can be efficiently solved through the new merit function.},

Using Babuška&#39;s theorem, we show well-posedness of the first-order optimality systems for a typical model problem with linear state equations, but without control constraints. This is done for both continuous and discrete levels. Based on these results, we derive discretization error estimates. Then we consider a semilinear parabolic optimal control problem arising from the Schlögl model. The associated nonlinear optimality system is solved by Newton&#39;s method, where a linear system, which is similar to the first-order optimality systems considered for the linear model problems, has to be solved at each Newton step. We present various numerical experiments including results for adaptive space-time finite element discretizations based on residual-type error indicators. In the last two examples, we also consider semilinear parabolic optimal control problems with box constraints imposed on the control.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we investigate the utilization of variadic templates for numerical methods and finite difference schemes. Specifically, an efficient method for defining multivariate functions in the framework of expression templates for array-based computations in C++ and CUDA is introduced. One of the advantages of the method is its ease of use for users of computational fields. The user can define and use his own function with any number of input arguments without having the knowledge of templates programming. For three different functions, the efficiency of the proposed method for arrays of different sizes is compared with that of the other implementations in C++ and also that of Fortran. The Roofline analysis is presented for the C++ implementations. Furthermore, for different compilers, the performance of the method in terms of the compilation time and executable file size and also the vectorization status are demonstrated. A similar comparison on graphics processing units (GPUs) using CUDA is made and the efficiency of the method is shown. The results indicate that, for any array size, the present method has very good performance in terms of the computational time, compilation time, and executable file size. Also, the variadic templates are utilized to define linear and nonlinear finite difference schemes. The performance of three finite difference schemes is compared with that of the plain C implementation. The results show the method proposed for nonlinear schemes has the same performance as that of the plain C implementation. Finally, as a practical application, two numerical simulations, the simulation of the discharge process of a lead-acid battery cell on a CPU and the simulation of a two-dimensional Riemann problem using high-order weighted ENO schemes on a GPU, are carried out.},

It is based on the time-periodic extension of the parareal method, known to accelerate sequential computations via parallelization on the fine grid. The proposed approach reduces the complexity of the periodic parareal solution by introducing a simplified Newton algorithm, which allows an additional parallelization on the coarse grid. In particular, at each Newton iteration a multiharmonic correction is performed, which converts the block-cyclic periodic system in the time domain into a block-diagonal system in the frequency domain, thereby solving for each frequency component in parallel. The convergence analysis of the method is discussed for a one-dimensional model problem. The introduced algorithm and several existing solution approaches are compared via their application to the eddy current problem for both linear and nonlinear models of a coaxial cable. Performance of the considered methods is also illustrated for a three-dimensional transformer model.},

  abstract     = {A Fourier-based library of unbounded Poisson solvers (FLUPS) for 2D and 3D homogeneous distributed grids is presented. It is designed to handle every possible combination of periodic, symmetric, semi-unbounded, and fully unbounded boundary conditions for the Poisson equation on rectangular domains with uniform resolution. FLUPS leverages a dedicated implementation of 3D Fourier transforms to solve the Poisson equation using Green&#39;s functions in a fast and memory-efficient way. Several Green&#39;s functions are available, optionally with explicit regularization, spectral truncation, or using lattice Green&#39;s functions, and provide verified convergence orders from 2 to spectral-like. The algorithm depends on the FFTW library to perform 1D transforms, while message passing interface (MPI) communications enable the required remapping of data in memory. For the latter operation, a first available implementation resorts to the standard all-to-all routines. A second implementation, featuring non-blocking and persistent point-to-point communications, is however shown to be more efficient in a majority of cases and especially while taking advantage of the shared memory parallelism with OpenMP. The scalability of the algorithm, aimed at massively parallel architectures, is demonstrated up to 73720 cores. The results obtained with three different supercomputers show that the weak efficiency remains above 40\% and the strong efficiency above 30\% when the number of cores is multiplied by 16, for typical problems. These figures are slightly better than those expected from a third party 3D fast Fourier transform (FFT) tool, with which a 20\% longer execution time was also measured on average. From the outside, the solving procedure is fully automated so that the user benefits from the optimal performances while not having to handle the complexity associated with memory management, data mapping, and Fourier transform computation.

Experimental (numerical) results on the performance of these preconditioners on inviscid and viscous laminar two-dimensional steady-state test cases are reported. It is found, for these compressible flow problems, that the block variant performs much better in terms of convergence, parallel scalability, and reliability than the original scalar asynchronous ILU preconditioner. For viscous flow, it is found that the ordering of unknowns may determine the success or failure of asynchronous block-ILU preconditioning, and an ordering of grid cells suitable for solving viscous problems is presented.},

Comput., 25 (2004), pp. 1674--1697] or the imaginary time evolution method is one of the most popular techniques for computing the ground states of Bose--Einstein condensates (BECs). In this paper, we revisit the time discretizations for the GFDN and its generalization to the multicomponent BECs. Several widely used time discretizations are demonstrated to be not accurate for computing the ground state solution in the general case, especially for the multicomponent BECs with two or more constraints even for the most accepted linearized backward Euler schemes. More precisely, these schemes usually converge to a solution with an error depending on the time step size. To accurately and efficiently compute the ground state solution of BECs, we propose the gradient flow with Lagrange multiplier (GFLM) method which can be viewed as the modified GFDN by introducing the explicit Lagrange multiplier terms or an approximation of the continuous normalized gradient flow. Through analysis and numerical computation, we clarify that, in order to accurately compute the ground state solution, the GFDN method must be discretized in very special ways in time such as the linearized backward Euler scheme, while the GFLM can be discretized by various schemes and works for multicomponent BEC with multiple constraints. We propose a simple backward-forward Euler scheme to discretize the GFLM, where only a linear system with constant coefficients needs to be solved at each time step. Taking the spin-1 BEC as an example, we demonstrate how the traditional GFDN approach fails in computing the ground state solution of general multicomponent BECs accurately. The proposed GFLM with backward-forward Euler discretization is shown to be accurate and efficient. Extensive numerical results are provided to verify our claims.},

  abstract     = {Mass-conservative reaction-diffusion systems have recently been proposed as a general framework to describe intracellular pattern formation. These systems have been used to model the conformational switching of proteins as they cycle from an inactive state in the cell cytoplasm, to an active state at the cell membrane. The active state then acts as input to downstream effectors. The paradigm of activation by recruitment to the membrane underpins a range of biological pathways, including G-protein signalling, growth control through Ras and PI 3-kinase, and cell polarity through Rac and Rho; all activate their targets by recruiting them from the cytoplasm to the membrane. Global mass conservation lies at the heart of these models, reflecting the property that the total number of active and inactive forms and total number of targets remains constant. Here we present a conservative arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) finite element method for the approximate solution of systems of bulk-surface reaction-diffusion equations on an evolving two-dimensional domain. Fundamental to the success of the method is the robust generation of bulk and surface meshes. For this purpose, we use a moving mesh partial differential equation (MMPDE) approach. Global conservation of the fully discrete finite element solution is established independently of the ALE velocity field and the time step size. The developed method is applied to model problems with known analytical solutions; these experiments indicate that the method is second-order accurate and globally conservative. The method is further applied to a model of a single cell migrating in the presence of an external chemotactic signal.},

It is well known that the accuracy of TT approximations is governed by the decay of the associated singular values, which in turn strongly depends on the ordering of the one-body basis. Here we find that the singular values $s_1\ge s_2\ge \cdots \ge s_d$ of tensors representing ground states of noninteracting Hamiltonians possess a surprising inversion symmetry, $s_1s_d=s_2s_{d-1}$$=s_3s_{d-2}=\ldots,$ thus reducing the tail behavior to the leading singular value and a single hidden invariant, which moreover depends explicitly on the ordering of the basis. For correlated wave functions, we find that the tail is upper bounded by a suitable superposition of the invariants. Optimizing the invariants or their superposition thus provides a new ordering scheme for QC-DMRG. Numerical tests on simple examples, i.e., linear combinations of a few Slater determinants, show that the new scheme reduces the tail of the singular values by several orders of magnitude over existing methods, including the widely used Fiedler order.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we develop novel structure-preserving numerical schemes for a class of nonlinear Fokker--Planck equations with nonlocal interactions. Such equations can cover many cases of importance, such as porous medium equations with external potentials, optimal transport problems, and aggregation-diffusion models. Based on the energetic variational approach, a trajectory equation is first derived by using the balance between the maximal dissipation principle and the least action principle. By a convex splitting technique, we propose energy dissipating numerical schemes for the trajectory equation. Rigorous numerical analysis reveals that the nonlinear numerical schemes are uniquely solvable, naturally respect mass conservation and positivity at the fully discrete level, and preserve steady states in an admissible convex set, where the discrete Jacobian of flow maps is positive. Under certain assumptions on smoothness and a positive Jacobian, the numerical schemes are shown to be second order accurate in space and first order accurate in time. Extensive numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate several valuable features of the proposed schemes. In addition to the preservation of physical structures, such as positivity, mass conservation, discrete energy dissipation, and steady states, numerical simulations further reveal that our numerical schemes are capable of solving degenerate cases of the Fokker--Planck equations effectively and robustly. It is shown that the developed numerical schemes have convergence order even in degenerate cases with the presence of solutions having compact support and can accurately and robustly compute the waiting time of free boundaries without any oscillation. The limitation of numerical schemes due to a singular Jacobian of the flow map is also discussed.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we mainly develop a new numerical methodology to solve a PDE model recently proposed in the literature for pricing interest rate derivatives. More precisely, we use high-order-in-time AMFR-W-methods, which belong to a class of W-methods based on approximate matrix factorization (AMF) and are especially suitable in the presence of mixed spatial derivatives. High-order convergence in time allows larger time steps, which, combined with the splitting of the involved operators, highly reduces the computational time for a given accuracy. Moreover, the consideration of a large number of underlying forward rates makes the PDE problem high dimensional in space, so the use of AMFR-W-methods with a sparse grid combination technique represents another innovative aspect, making AMFR-W more efficient than with full grids and opening the possibility of parallelization. Also, the consideration of new homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions provides another original feature to avoid the difficulties associated to the presence of boundary layers when using Dirichlet ones, especially in advection-dominated regimes. These Neumann boundary conditions motivate the introduction of a modified combination technique to overcome a decrease in the accuracy of the standard combination technique.},

  abstract     = {We consider integration with respect to a $d$-dimensional spherical Gaussian measure arising from computational finance. Importance sampling (IS) is one of the most important variance reduction techniques in Monte Carlo (MC) methods. In this paper, two kinds of IS are studied in randomized quasi-MC (RQMC) setting, namely, the optimal drift IS (ODIS) and the Laplace IS (LapIS). Traditionally, the LapIS is obtained by mimicking the behavior of the optimal IS density with ODIS as its special case. We prove that the LapIS can also be obtained by an approximate optimization procedure based on the Laplace approximation. We study the promises and limitations of IS in RQMC methods and develop efficient RQMC-based IS procedures. We focus on how to properly combine IS with conditional MC (CMC) and dimension reduction methods in RQMC. In our procedures, the integrands are first smoothed by using CMC. Then the LapIS or the ODIS is performed, where several orthogonal matrices are required to be chosen to reduce the effective dimension. Intuitively, designing methods to determine all these optimal matrices seems infeasible. Fortunately, we prove that as long as the last orthogonal matrix is chosen elaborately, the choices of the other matrices can be arbitrary. This helps to significantly simplify the RQMC-based IS procedure. Due to the robustness and the superiority in efficiency of the gradient principal component analysis (GPCA) method, we use the GPCA method as an effective dimension reduction method in our RQMC-based IS procedures. Moreover, we prove the integrands obtained by the GPCA method are statistically equivalent. Numerical experiments illustrate the superiority of our proposed RQMC-based IS procedures.},

  abstract     = {The complex Langevin (CL) method is a classical numerical strategy to alleviate the numerical sign problem in the computation of lattice field theories. Mathematically, it is a simple numerical tool to compute a wide class of high-dimensional and oscillatory integrals. However, it is often observed that the CL method converges but the limiting result is incorrect. The literature has several unclear or even conflicting statements, making the method look mysterious. By an in-depth analysis of a model problem, we reveal the mechanism of how the CL result turns biased as the parameter changes, and it is demonstrated that such a transition is difficult to capture. Our analysis also shows that the method works for any observables only if the probability density function generated by the CL process is localized. To generalize such observations to lattice field theories, we formulate the CL method on general groups using rigorous mathematical languages for the first time, and we demonstrate that such localized probability density function does not exist in the simulation of lattice field theories for general compact groups, which explains the unstable behavior of the CL method. Fortunately, we also find that the gauge cooling technique creates additional velocity that helps confine the samples, so that we can still see localized probability density functions in certain cases. Thereby, the gauge cooling method significantly broadens the application of the CL method. The limitations of gauge cooling are also discussed. In particular, we prove that gauge cooling has no effect for Abelian groups, and we provide an example showing that biased results still exist when gauge cooling is insufficient to confine the probability density function.},

The cost of forming an $m\times n$ randsvd matrix is $m^3 + n^3$ flops, which is prohibitively expensive at extreme scale; moreover, the randsvd construction requires a significant amount of communication, making it unsuitable for distributed memory environments. By dropping the requirement that $U$ and $V$ be Haar distributed and that both be random, we derive new algorithms for forming $A$ that have cost linear in the number of matrix elements and require a low amount of communication and synchronization.

Our method is based on the Galerkin proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method. To facilitate the algorithm design and convergence analysis, we decompose the solution of the viscous G-equation into a mean-free part and a mean part, where their evolution equations can be derived accordingly. We construct the POD basis from the solution snapshots of the mean-free part. With the POD basis, we can efficiently solve the evolution equation for the mean-free part of the solution to the viscous G-equation. After we get the mean-free part of the solution, the mean of the solution can be recovered. We also provide rigorous convergence analysis for our method. Numerical results for viscous G-equations and curvature G-equations are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. In addition, we study the turbulent flame speeds of the viscous G-equations in incompressible cellular flows.},

This problem arises, for instance, in the density matrix renormalization group algorithm (DMRG) for the accurate simulation of quantum chains. The usual approach is to compute the desired set of eigenvectors and then to identify a low rank approximation by truncating the singular value decomposition (SVD). Since SVD truncation is a norm projection, this yields only suboptimal results for the eigenvalues. As an alternative, this article explores a direct trace minimization on the intersection of the Stiefel and a low rank manifold using a Riemannian optimization method, which gives better approximations to the eigenspace. A second algorithm based on alternating optimization is also considered but is less stable. Compared to SVD truncation, the proposed Riemannian method can be seen as a more natural choice for a subsolver in the DMRG algorithm and appears to yield better results when applied to spin chains, for which the singular values of the exact eigenvectors decay only moderately.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic rounding rounds a real number to the next larger or smaller floating-point number with probabilities 1 minus the relative distances to those numbers. It is gaining attention in deep learning because it can increase the success of low precision computations. We compare basic properties of stochastic rounding with those for round to nearest, finding properties in common as well as significant differences. We prove that for stochastic rounding the rounding errors are mean independent random variables with zero mean. We derive a new version of our probabilistic error analysis theorem from [N. J. Higham and T. Mary, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 41 (2019), pp. A2815--A2835], weakening the assumption of independence of the random variables to mean independence. These results imply that for a wide range of linear algebra computations the backward error for stochastic rounding is unconditionally bounded by a multiple of $\sqrt{n}\mkern1muu$ to first order, with a certain probability, where $n$ is the problem size and $u$ is the unit roundoff. This is the first scenario where the rule of thumb that one can replace $nu$ by $\sqrt{n}\mkern1muu$ in a rounding error bound has been shown to hold without any additional assumptions on the rounding errors. We also explain how stochastic rounding avoids the phenomenon of stagnation in sums, whereby small addends are obliterated by round to nearest when they are too small relative to the sum.},

The minimum action method (MAM) plays an important role in seeking the most probable transition pathway induced by small noise. There exist two formulations of the minimum action method: one is the geometric formulation based on the Maupertuis principle, and the other one is the temporal formulation. The geometric formulation relies on the conservation of Hamiltonian corresponding to the Freidlin--Wentzell action functional. For systems with time delays, the Hamiltonian does not conserve due to the explicit dependence on the time delay, which implies that the geometric MAM is not applicable. We work with the temporal formulation of MAM for problems with time delays. By defining an auxiliary path, we remove the optimization with respect to time through the optimal linear time scaling. The pointwise correspondence between the auxiliary path and the delayed transition path is dealt with by a penalty term included into the action functional. The action functional is then discretized by the finite element method, and strategies for $h$-adaptive mesh refinement have been developed. Numerical examples have been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

A notable feature of these schemes is that they are well-balanced for a general known hydrostatic equilibrium state and, at the same time, provably preserve the positivity of density and pressure. In order to achieve the well-balanced and positivity-preserving properties simultaneously, a novel DG spatial discretization is carefully designed with suitable source term reformulation and a properly modified Harten--Lax--van Leer-contact (HLLC) flux. Based on some technical decompositions as well as several key properties of the admissible states and HLLC flux, rigorous positivity-preserving analyses are carried out. It is proven that the resulting well-balanced DG schemes, coupled with strong-stability-preserving time discretizations, satisfy a weak positivity property, which implies that one can apply a simple existing limiter to effectively enforce the positivity-preserving property, without losing high-order accuracy and conservation. The proposed methods and analyses are illustrated with the ideal equation of state (EOS) for notational convenience only, while the extensions to general EOS are straightforward and are discussed in the supplementary material. Extensive one- and two-dimensional numerical tests demonstrate the desired properties of these schemes, including the exact preservation of the equilibrium state, the ability to capture small perturbation of such state, the robustness for solving problems involving low density and/or low pressure, and good resolution for smooth and discontinuous solutions.},

The salient feature of the novel method, which we refer to as SEEM (smooth extension embedding method), is that it reduces the whole boundary value problem to a linear constraint for an appropriate optimization problem formulated in a larger, simpler set containing the domain on which the boundary value problem is posed and which allows for the use of straightforward discretizations. It can also be viewed as a fully discrete meshfree method, which uses a novel class of basis functions and thus builds a bridge between fictitious domain and meshfree methods. The proposed method, in essence, computes a (discrete) extension of the solution to the boundary value problem by selecting it as a smooth element of the complete affine family of solutions of the original equations now yielding an underdetermined problem for an unknown defined in the whole fictitious domain. The actual regularity of this extension is determined by that of the analytic solution and by the choice of objective functional. Numerical experiments demonstrate that it is stable enough to efficiently solve boundary value problems on general geometries and that it produces solutions of tunable (and high) accuracy.},

Phys., 401 (2020), 108998] constituting the highly singular right-hand side in the PBE. From the computational point of view our regularization approach requires only the modification of the right-hand side in the PBE so that it can be implemented within any open-source grid-based software package for solving PBE that already includes some FEM/FDM disretization scheme for elliptic PDE and solver for the arising linear system of equations. The main computational benefits are twofold. First, one applies the chosen PBE solver only for the smooth long-range (regularized) part of the collective potential with the regular right-hand side represented by a low-rank RS tensor with a controllable precision. Thus, we eliminate the numerical treatment of the singularities in the right-hand side and do not change the interface and boundary conditions. And second, the elliptic PDE need not be solved for the singular part in the right-hand side at all, since the short-range part of the target potential of the biomolecule is precomputed independently on a computational grid by simple one-dimensional tensor operations. The total potential is then obtained by adding the numerical solution of the PBE for the smooth long-range part to the directly precomputed tensor representation for the short-range contribution. Numerical tests illustrate that the new regularization scheme, implemented by a simple modification of the right-hand side in the chosen PBE solver, improves the accuracy of the approximate solution on rather coarse grids. The scheme also demonstrates good convergence behavior on a sequence of refined grids.},

  abstract     = {A preconditioner for the mass matrix for high order finite element discretization on tetrahedra is presented and shown to give a condition number that is independent of both the mesh size and the polynomial order of the elements. The preconditioner is described in terms of a new, high order basis which has the usual property whereby individual functions are associated with distinct geometric entities of the tetrahedron. It is shown that the basis enjoys the novel property that the resulting mass matrix is spectrally equivalent to its own diagonal with constants independent of h and p. Although the exposition is based on an explicit basis, the preconditioner can be applied to any choice of basis. In particular, the basis can be used to specify a basis-independent additive Schwarz method, meaning that, in order to apply the preconditioner to an alternative basis, one only need to implement an appropriate change of basis.},

One of the main difficulties in employing the Bayesian approach to such problems is how to extract information from the posterior probability measure. Compared with conventional sampling-type methods, the variational Bayes method (VBM) has been intensively examined in the field of machine learning attributed to its ability in extracting approximately the posterior information with lower computational cost. In this paper, we generalize the conventional finite-dimensional VBM to the infinite-dimensional space to rigorously solve the inverse problems of PDEs. We further establish a general infinite-dimensional mean-field approximate theory and apply it to the linear inverse problems under the Gaussian and Laplace noise assumptions at the abstract level. The results of some numerical experiments substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Particularly, this work focuses on the union operation, which involves multiple independent, generally nonconforming and trimmed, spline patches. Given a series of patches, we overlay them one on top of one another in a certain order. While the invisible part of each patch is trimmed away, the visible parts of all the patches constitute the entire computational domain. We employ Nitsche&#39;s method to weakly couple independent patches through visible interfaces. Moreover, we propose a minimal stabilization method to address the instability issue that arises on the interfaces shared by small trimmed elements. We show, in theory, that our proposed method recovers stability and guarantees well-posedness of the problem as well as optimal error estimates. To conclude, we numerically verify the theory by solving the Poisson&#39;s equation on various geometries that are obtained by the union operation.},

This leads to poor numerical approximations, unless very fine meshes are used. We propose here a new finite difference scheme to do dispersion correction for the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation with constant wavenumber on rectangular domains discretized with finite difference methods on uniform meshes. The main innovations are, first, the use of a real shift in the wavenumber used in the discrete scheme, which is different from the continuous wavenumber, and second, an asymptotic analysis which allows us to determine closed form finite difference schemes without any numerical optimization. We also prove that our asymptotically optimized scheme is sixth order accurate for plane wave solutions. Numerical experiments show that our new optimized scheme has a very small dispersion error when only few points per wavelength are used and can be effective when solving Helmholtz problems using multigrid.},

  abstract     = {What is the fastest way to solve a linear system $Ax= b$ in arithmetic of a given precision when $A$ is symmetric positive definite and otherwise unstructured? The usual answer is by Cholesky factorization, assuming that $A$ can be factorized. We develop an algorithm that can be faster, given an arithmetic of precision lower than the working precision as well as (optionally) one of higher precision. The arithmetics might, for example, be of precisions half, single, and double; half and double, possibly with quadruple; or single and double, possibly with quadruple. We compute a Cholesky factorization at the lower precision and use the factors as preconditioners in GMRES-based iterative refinement. To avoid breakdown of the factorization we shift the matrix by a small multiple of its diagonal. We explain why this is preferable to the common approach of shifting by a multiple of the identity matrix. We also incorporate scaling in order to avoid overflow and reduce the chance of underflow when working in IEEE half precision arithmetic. We extend the algorithm to solve a linear least squares problem with a well-conditioned coefficient matrix by forming and solving the normal equations. In both algorithms most of the work is done at low precision provided that iterative refinement and the inner iterative solver converge quickly. We explain why replacing GMRES by the conjugate gradient method causes convergence guarantees to be lost, but we show that this change has little effect on convergence in practice. Our numerical experiments confirm the potential of the new algorithms to provide faster solutions in environments that support multiple precisions of arithmetic.},

  abstract     = {Tensor network operators, such as the matrix product operator (MPO) and the projected entangled-pair operator (PEPO), can provide efficient representation of certain linear operators in high-dimensional spaces. This paper focuses on the efficient representation of tensor network operators with long-range pairwise interactions such as the Coulomb interaction. For MPOs, we find that all existing efficient methods exploit an upper-triangular low-rank (UTLR) property, i.e., the upper-triangular part of the matrix can be well approximated by a low-rank matrix, while the matrix itself can be full-rank. This allows us to convert the problem of finding the efficient MPO representation into a matrix completion problem. We develop a modified incremental singular value decomposition method (ISVD) to solve this ill-conditioned matrix completion problem. This algorithm yields equivalent MPO representation to that developed in [E. M. Stoudenmire and S. R. White, Phys. Rev. Lett., 119 (2017), 046401]. In order to efficiently treat more general tensor network operators, we develop another strategy for compressing tensor network operators based on hierarchical low-rank matrix formats, such as the hierarchical off-diagonal low-rank (HODLR) format and the $\mathcal{H}$-matrix format. Though the preconstant in the complexity is larger, the advantage of using the hierarchical low-rank matrix format is that it is applicable to both MPOs and PEPOs. For the Coulomb interaction, the operator can be represented by a linear combination of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)\log(N/\epsilon))$ MPOs/PEPOs, each with a constant bond dimension, where $N$ is the system size and $\epsilon$ is the accuracy of the low-rank truncation. Neither the modified ISVD nor the hierarchical low-rank algorithm assumes that the long-range interaction takes a translation-invariant form.},

The crucial aspect of local Fourier analysis is that it can be used to minimize an estimate of the spectral radius of a stationary iteration, or the condition number of a preconditioned system, in terms of a symbol representation of the algorithm. In practice, this is a “minimax” problem, minimizing with respect to solver parameters the appropriate measure of solver work, which involves maximizing over the Fourier frequency. Often, several algorithmic parameters may be determined by local Fourier analysis in order to obtain efficient algorithms. Analytical solutions to minimax problems are rarely possible beyond simple problems; the status quo in local Fourier analysis involves grid sampling, which is prohibitively expensive in high dimensions. In this paper, we propose and explore optimization algorithms to solve these problems efficiently. Several examples, with known and unknown analytical solutions, are presented to show the effectiveness of these approaches.},

Thanks to avoiding all derivatives of PU weight functions as well as all lower derivatives of local approximants, the new method is faster and simpler than the standard RBF-PU method. Besides, the discontinuous PU weight functions can now be utilized to develop the method in a more efficient and less expensive way. Alternatively, the new method is an RBF-generated finite difference (RBF-FD) method in a PU setting which is much faster and in some situations more accurate than the original RBF-FD. The polyharmonic splines are used for local approximations, and the error and stability issues are considered. Some numerical experiments on irregular two- and three-dimensional domains, as well as cost comparison tests, are performed to support the theoretical analysis and to show the efficiency of the new method.},

  abstract     = {As an important Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) algorithm has achieved great success in Bayesian learning and posterior sampling. However, SGLD typically suffers from a slow convergence rate due to its large variance caused by the stochastic gradient. In order to alleviate these drawbacks, we leverage the recently developed Laplacian smoothing technique and propose a Laplacian smoothing stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (LS-SGLD) algorithm. We prove that for sampling from both log-concave and non-log-concave densities, LS-SGLD achieves strictly smaller discretization error in 2-Wasserstein distance, although its mixing rate can be slightly slower. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets verify our theoretical results and demonstrate the superior performance of LS-SGLD on different machine learning tasks including posterior sampling, Bayesian logistic regression, and training Bayesian convolutional neural networks. The code is available at https://github.com/BaoWangMath/LS-MCMC.},

  abstract     = {Polynomial preconditioning can improve the convergence of the Arnoldi method for computing eigenvalues. Such preconditioning significantly reduces the cost of orthogonalization; for difficult problems, it can also reduce the number of matrix-vector products. Parallel computations can particularly benefit from the reduction of communication-intensive operations. The GMRES algorithm provides a simple and effective way of generating the preconditioning polynomial. For some problems high degree polynomials are especially effective, but they can lead to stability problems that must be mitigated. A two-level “double polynomial preconditioning” strategy provides an effective way to generate high-degree preconditioners.},
