  abstract     = {This paper presents new results on nonseparating cocircuits in binary matroids. The first result states that for any 3-connected binary matroid $M$ and for any basis $B$ of $M$, there exists at least two nonseparating $B$-fundamental cocircuits in $M$. The second result provides a weakened version of this result for nonseparable binary matroids that are also simple and cosimple. The final states that if $M$ is a nonseparable binary matroid, $D$ is a nonseparating cocircuit of $M$, and $e$ is an element of $D$, then $M$ is graphic if and only if $M/e$ is graphic and has a realization $H$ in which $D-{e}$ is a subset of the star of some node of $H$. All of these results are shown to lead to efficient algorithms.},

  abstract     = {For a graph $G$, $L(G)^t$ is the $t$th power of the line graph of $G$; that is, vertices of $L(G)^t$ are edges of $G$ and two edges $e,f\in E(G)$ are adjacent in $L(G)^t$ if $G$ contains a path with at most $t$ vertices that starts in a vertex of $e$ and ends in a vertex of $f$. The distance-$t$ chromatic index of $G$ is the chromatic number of $L(G)^t$, and a $t$-strong clique in $G$ is a clique in $L(G)^t$. Finding upper bounds for the distance-$t$ chromatic index and $t$-strong clique are problems related to two famous problems: the conjecture of Erdös and Nešetřil concerning the strong chromatic index, and the degree/diameter problem. We prove that the size of a $t$-strong clique in a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ is at most $1.75\Delta^t+O\left(\Delta^{t-1}\right)$, and for bipartite graphs the upper bound is at most $\Delta^t+O\left(\Delta^{t-1}\right)$. As a corollary, we obtain upper bounds of $1.881\Delta^t +O\left(\Delta^{t-1}\right)$ and $1.9703+O\left(\Delta^{t-1}\right)$ on the distance-$t$ chromatic index of bipartite graphs and general graphs. We also show results for some special classes of graphs: $K_{1,r}$-free graphs and graphs with a large girth.},

An approximation algorithm that finds a solution with value $O({opt}^2 \log m)$ in ${poly}(m,n,{opt})$ time is known, which can be obtained by rounding a linear programming relaxation.

Motivated by these, we consider the stronger properties total positivity from the Toeplitz matrix and Hankel matrix. By using exponential Riordan array methods, we give some criteria for total positivity of the triangular matrix of coefficients of the generalized cycle index polynomials, the Toeplitz matrix and Hankel matrix of the polynomial sequence in terms of the exponential formula, the logarithmic formula, and the fractional formula, respectively. Finally, we apply our criteria to some triangular arrays satisfying some recurrence relations, including Bessel triangles of two kinds and their generalizations, the Lah triangle and its generalization, the idempotent triangle, and some triangles related to binomial coefficients, rook polynomials, and Laguerre polynomials. We not only get total positivity of these lower-triangles, and $q$-Stieltjes moment properties and 3-$q$-log-convexity of their row-generating functions, but also prove that their triangular convolutions preserve the Stieltjes moment property. In particular, we solve a conjecture of Sokal on the $q$-Stieltjes moment property of rook polynomials.},

  abstract     = {Tree-width and its linear variant path-width play a central role for the graph minor relation. In particular, Robertson and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 35 (1983), pp. 39--61] proved that for every tree $T$, the class of graphs that do not contain $T$ as a minor has bounded path-width. For the pivot-minor relation, rank-width and linear rank-width take over the role of tree-width and path-width. As such, it is natural to examine if, for every tree $T$, the class of graphs that do not contain $T$ as a pivot-minor has bounded linear rank-width. We first prove that this statement is false whenever $T$ is a tree that is not a caterpillar. We conjecture that the statement is true if $T$ is a caterpillar. We are also able to give partial confirmation of this conjecture by proving for every tree $T$, the class of $T$-pivot-minor-free distance-hereditary graphs has bounded linear rank-width if and only if $T$ is a caterpillar; for every caterpillar $T$ on at most four vertices, the class of $T$-pivot-minor-free graphs has bounded linear rank-width. To prove our second result, we only need to consider $T=P_4$ and $T=K_{1,3}$, but we follow a general strategy: first we show that the class of $T$-pivot-minor-free graphs is contained in some class of $(H_1,H_2)$-free graphs, which we then show to have bounded linear rank-width. In particular, we prove that the class of $(K_3,S_{1,2,2})$-free graphs has bounded linear rank-width, which strengthens a known result that this graph class has bounded rank-width.},

  abstract     = {The notion of duality is a key element in understanding the interplay between the stability and chromatic numbers of a graph. This notion is a central aspect in the celebrated theory of perfect graphs and is further and deeply developed in the context of the Lovász theta function and its equivalent characterizations and variants. The main achievement of this paper is the introduction of a new family of norms, providing upper bounds for the stability number, that are obtained through duality from the norms motivated by Hoffman&#39;s lower bound for the chromatic number, and which achieve the (complementary) Lovász theta function at their optimum. As a consequence, our norms make it formal that Hoffman&#39;s bound for the chromatic number and the Delsarte--Hoffman ratio bound for the stability number are indeed dual. Further, we show that our new bounds strengthen the convex quadratic bounds for the stability number studied by Luz and Schrijver, and which achieve the Lovász theta function at their optimum. One of the key observations regarding weighted versions of these bounds is that, for any upper bound for the stability number of a graph which is a positive definite monotone gauge function, its gauge dual is a lower bound on the fractional chromatic number, and conversely. Our presentation is elementary and accessible to a wide audience.},

We establish a formula that generates a general upper bound for the fractional chromatic number of triangle-free graphs of maximum degree $\Delta \ge 3$. This upper bound matches that deduced from the fractional version of Reed&#39;s bound for small values of $\Delta$, and improves it when $\Delta\ge 17$, transitioning smoothly to the best possible asymptotic regime, barring a breakthrough in Ramsey theory. Focusing on smaller values of $\Delta$, we also demonstrate that every graph of girth at least $7$ and maximum degree $\Delta$ has fractional chromatic number at most $1+ \min_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \frac{2\Delta + 2^{k-3}}{k}$. In particular, the fractional chromatic number of a graph of girth $7$ and maximum degree $\Delta$ is at most $\frac{2\Delta+9}{5}$ when $\Delta \in [3,8]$, at most $\frac{\Delta+7}{3}$ when $\Delta \in [8,20]$, at most $\frac{2\Delta+23}{7}$ when $\Delta \in [20,48]$, and at most $\frac{\Delta}{4}+5$ when $\Delta \in [48,112]$.

We verify their conjecture for all graphs $H$ that exclude the complete graph on four vertices as a minor. Further, we rule out the existence of a subexponential-time algorithm for the $\oplus{P}$-complete cases, assuming the randomized exponential time hypothesis.

Both players alternately claim a predefined amount of edges (called bias) from the board $X$, and Maker wins the game if she is able to occupy any winning set $F \in \mathcal{F}$. These games are well studied when played on the complete graph $K_n$ or on a random graph $G_{n,p}$. In this paper we consider Maker-Breaker games played on randomly perturbed graphs instead. These graphs consist of the union of a deterministic graph $G_\alpha$ with minimum degree at least $\alpha n$ and a binomial random graph $G_{n,p}$. Depending on $\alpha$ and Breaker&#39;s bias $b$ we determine the order of the threshold probability for winning the Hamiltonicity game and the $k$-connectivity game on $G_{\alpha}\cup G_{n,p}$, and we discuss the $H$-game when $b=1$.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we go one step further in the automatic generation of FPTASes for multistage stochastic dynamic programs with scalar state and action spaces, in which the cost-to-go functions have a monotone structure in the state variable. While there exist a few frameworks for automatic generation of FPTASes, so far none of them is general and simple enough to be extensively used. We believe that our framework has these two attributes and has great potential to attract interest from both the operations research and theoretical computer science communities. Moreover, it seems very reasonable that many intractable problems that currently do not admit an FPTAS, can be formulated as DPs that fit into our framework and therefore will admit a first FPTAS. Our results are achieved by a combination of Bellman equation formulations, the technique of $K$-approximation sets and functions, and in particular the calculus of $K$-approximation functions.},

We consider the existence of prices that are capable of achieving optimal social welfare without a central tie-breaking coordinator. In the case of two buyers with matroid rank valuations, we give polynomial-time algorithms that always find such prices when one of the matroids is a partition matroid or both matroids are strongly base orderable. This result partially answers a question raised by Dütting and Végh [Private communication, 2017]. We further formalize a weighted variant of the conjecture of Dütting and Végh, and show that the weighted variant can be reduced to the unweighted one based on the weight-splitting theorem for weighted matroid intersection by Frank. We also show that a similar reduction technique works for M${}^\natural$-concave functions or, equivalently, for gross substitutes functions.},

  abstract     = {Treewidth is an important graph invariant, relevant for both structural and algorithmic reasons. A necessary condition for a graph class to have bounded treewidth is the absence of large cliques. We study graph classes closed under taking induced subgraphs in which this condition is also sufficient, which we call $({tw},\omega)$-bounded. Such graph classes are known to have useful algorithmic applications related to variants of the clique and $k$-coloring problems. We consider six well-known graph containment relations: the minor, topological minor, subgraph, induced minor, induced topological minor, and induced subgraph relations. For each of them, we give a complete characterization of the graphs $H$ for which the class of graphs excluding $H$ is $({tw},\omega)$-bounded. Our results yield an infinite family of $\chi$-bounded induced-minor-closed graph classes and imply that the class of 1-perfectly orientable graphs is $({tw},\omega)$-bounded, leading to linear-time algorithms for $k$-coloring 1-perfectly orientable graphs for every fixed $k$. This answers a question of Brešar, Hartinger, Kos, and Milanič from 2018 and one of Beisegel, Chudnovsky, Gurvich, Milanič, and Servatius from 2019, respectively. We also reveal some further algorithmic implications of $({tw},\omega)$-boundedness related to list $k$-coloring and clique problems. In addition, we propose a question about the complexity of the maximum weight independent set problem in $({tw},\omega)$-bounded graph classes and prove that the problem is polynomial-time solvable in every class of graphs excluding a fixed star as an induced minor.},

  abstract     = {Given $n$ subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space over a fixed finite field ${\mathbb F}$, we wish to find a “branch-decomposition” of these subspaces of width at most $k$ that is a subcubic tree $T$ with $n$ leaves mapped bijectively to the subspaces such that for every edge $e$ of $T$, the sum of subspaces associated to the leaves in one component of $T-e$ and the sum of subspaces associated to the leaves in the other component have the intersection of dimension at most $k$. This problem includes the problems of computing branch-width of ${\mathbb F}$-represented matroids, rank-width of graphs, branch-width of hypergraphs, and carving-width of graphs. We present a fixed-parameter algorithm to construct such a branch-decomposition of width at most $k$, if it exists, for input subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space over ${\mathbb F}$. Our algorithm is analogous to the algorithm of Bodlaender and Kloks [J. Algorithms, 21 (1996), pp. 358--402] on tree-width of graphs. To extend their framework to branch-decompositions of vector spaces, we developed highly generic tools for branch-decompositions on vector spaces. The only known previous fixed-parameter algorithm for branch-width of ${\mathbb F}$-represented matroids was due to Hliněný and Oum [SIAM J. Comput., 38 (2008), pp. 1012--1032] that runs in time $O(n^3)$ where $n$ is the number of elements of the input ${\mathbb F}$-represented matroid. But their method is highly indirect. Their algorithm uses the nontrivial fact by Geelen et al. [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 88 (2003), pp. 261--265] that the number of forbidden minors is finite and uses the algorithm of Hliněný [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 96 (2006), pp. 325--351] on checking monadic second-order formulas on ${\mathbb F}$-represented matroids of small branch-width. Our result does not depend on such a fact and is completely self-contained, and yet matches their asymptotic running time for each fixed $k$.},

For given groups $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ with $|\Gamma_1| = |\Gamma_2|$, the dual version of a problem raised by Jaeger et al. suggests to investigate whether every $\Gamma_1$-colorable graph $G$ is also $\Gamma_2$-colorable. Recently, Hǔsek, Mohelníková, and Šámal [J. Graph Theory, 93 (2019), pp. 317--327] used computer testing to find the first examples of $\mathbb{Z}_4$-connected but not $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-connected graphs as well as $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-connected but not $\mathbb{Z}_4$-connected graphs. As their examples are nonplanar, the group coloring problem remains unanswered. Group coloring was extended to non-abelian groups in Li and Lai [Discrete Math., 313 (2013), pp. 101--104]. We introduce a group coloring local structure (defined as a snarl in the paper) and use it to construct infinitely many ordered triples $(G, \Gamma_1, \Gamma_2)$ in which $G$ is a graph and $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ are groups with $|\Gamma_1| = |\Gamma_2|$, such that $G$ is $\Gamma_1$-colorable but not $\Gamma_2$-colorable.},

The 6-connectedness is best possible, since there exist infinitely many 5-connected nonrigid graphs. Jackson, Servatius, and Servatius used the idea of “essential connectivity” and proved that every 4-connected “essentially 6-connected” graph is redundantly rigid and thus global rigid. Since 3-connectedness is a necessary condition of global rigidity, it is interesting to study 3-connected graphs for redundant rigidity and thus global rigidity. We utilize a different “essential connectivity” and prove that every 3-connected essentially 9-connected graph is redundantly rigid and thus globally rigid. The essential 9-connectedness is best possible. Under this essential connectivity, we also prove that every 4-connected essentially 6-connected graph is redundantly rigid and thus globally rigid.

  abstract     = {Attempting to recognize a tree inside a phylogenetic network is a fundamental undertaking in evolutionary analysis. In the last few years, therefore, “tree-based” phylogenetic networks, which are defined by a spanning tree called a “subdivision tree” that is an embedding of a phylogenetic tree on the same leaf-set, have attracted the attention of many theoretical biologists. However, the application of such networks is still not easy, due to many important computational problems whose time complexities are unknown or not clearly understood. In this paper, we provide a general framework for solving those various old or new problems on tree-based phylogenetic networks from a coherent perspective, rather than analyzing the complexity of each individual problem or developing an algorithm one by one. More precisely, we establish a structure theorem that gives a way to canonically decompose any rooted binary phylogenetic network $N$ into maximal zig-zag trails that are uniquely determined by $N$, and furthermore use it to characterize the set of subdivision trees of $N$ in the form of a direct product. From these main results, we derive a series of linear time (and linear time delay) algorithms for solving the following problems: given a rooted binary phylogenetic network $N$, (1) determine whether or not $N$ has a subdivision tree and find one if there exists any (decision/search problems); (2) measure the deviation of $N$ from being tree-based (deviation quantification problem); (3) compute the number of subdivision trees of $N$ (counting problem); (4) list all subdivision trees of $N$ (enumeration problem); and (5) find a subdivision tree to maximize or minimize a prescribed objective function (optimization problem). All algorithms proposed here are optimal in terms of time complexity. Our results not only imply and unify various known results in the relevant literature, but also answer many open questions and moreover enable novel applications, such as the estimation of a maximum likelihood tree underlying a tree-based network. The results and algorithms in this paper also apply for a special class of rooted nonbinary phylogenetic networks.},

Furthermore, by combining the mentioned algorithms for $P_5$-free and for ${P_6,{1-subdivided claw}}$-free graphs with a simple branching procedure, we obtain subexponential-time algorithms for Max Partial $H$-Coloring in these classes of graphs. Finally, we show that even a restricted variant of Max Partial $H$-Coloring is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard in the considered subclasses of $P_5$-free graphs if we allow loops on $H$.},

The Voronoi cell of a zonotopal lattice is a zonotope, i.e., a projection of a regular cube. Examples of zonotopal lattices include lattices of Voronoi&#39;s first kind and tensor products of root lattices of type $\mathsf{A}$. The combinatorial structure of zonotopal lattices can be described by regular matroids/totally unimodular matrices. We observe that a linear algebra version of the minimum mean cycle canceling method can be applied for efficiently solving the closest vector problem in a zonotopal lattice if the lattice is given as the integral kernel of a totally unimodular matrix.},

  abstract     = {Finding exact Ramsey numbers is a problem typically restricted to relatively small graphs. The flag algebra method was developed to find asymptotic results for very large graphs, so it seems that the method is not suitable for finding small Ramsey numbers. But this intuition is wrong, and we will develop a technique to do just that in this paper. We find new upper bounds for many small graph and hypergraph Ramsey numbers. As a result, we prove the exact values $R(K_4^-,K_4^-,K_4^-)=28$, $R(K_8,C_5)= 29$, $R(K_9,C_6)= 41$, $R(Q_3,Q_3)=13$, $R(K_{3,5},K_{1,6})=17$, $R(C_3, C_5, C_5)= 17$, and $R(K_4^-,K_5^-;3)= 12$. We hope that this technique will be adapted to address other questions for smaller graphs with the flag algebra method.},

Counts of the number of reactions in these models are often crucial in probabilistic arguments concerning the emergence of autocatalytic networks. In the first part of this paper, we provide the first exact description of the number of reactions under widely applied model assumptions. Conclusions from earlier studies rely on either approximations or asymptotic counting, and we show that the exact counts lead to similar, though not always identical, asymptotic results. In the second part of the paper, we investigate a novel model assumption whereby polymers are invariant under spatial rotation. We outline the biochemical relevance of this condition and again give exact enumerative and asymptotic formulae for the number of reactions.},

We consider the task of adding a minimum-cost edge-set to the graph such that the adversary never wins. We show that this problem is equivalent to covering a digraph with nontrivial strongly connected components at minimal cost. We provide efficient exact and approximation algorithms for this task. In particular, for the unit-cost problem, we give a $\log_2 n$-factor approximation algorithm and a polynomial-time algorithm for chordal-bipartite graphs. Furthermore, we give a fixed parameter algorithm for the problem parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. For general nonnegative weights we give tight upper and lower approximation bounds relative to the directed Steiner forest problem. Additionally, we prove a dichotomy theorem characterizing minor-closed graph classes which allow for a polynomial-time algorithm. To obtain our results, we exploit a close relation to the classical strong connectivity augmentation problem as well as directed Steiner problems.},

  abstract     = {The well-known shortest cycle cover conjecture suggests that every bridgeless graph $G$ can have its edges covered with a collection of cycles of total length not exceeding $\frac75\cdot|E(G)|$. This conjecture is particularly interesting for cubic graphs, where the largest values of the ratio between the length of a shortest cycle cover and the number of edges are known. The covering ratio 7/5 is the best possible, being reached by the Petersen graph whose shortest cycle cover has length 21. There exist infinitely many cubic graphs with cyclic connectivity 2, as well as those with cyclic connectivity 3, whose covering ratio equals 7/5. By contrast, all cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graphs where the length of a shortest cycle cover is known have covering ratio close to the natural lower bound which equals 4/3. In line with this observation, Brinkmannn et al. [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 103 (2013), pp. 468--488] made a conjecture that every cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graph has a cycle cover of length at most $\frac43 m+o(m)$, where $m$ is the number of edges. We disprove this conjecture by exhibiting an infinite family of cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graphs $G_k$, $k\ge 2$, such that the length of a shortest cycle cover of each $G_k$ is at least $(\frac43 + \frac{1}{69})|E(G_k)|$.},

  abstract     = {In the list coloring problem for two matroids, we are given matroids $M_1=(S,{\mathcal{I}}_1)$ and $M_2=(S,{\mathcal{I}}_2)$ on the same ground set $S$, and the goal is to determine the smallest number $k$ such that, given arbitrary lists $L_s$ of $k$ colors for $s\in S$, it is possible to choose a color from each list so that every monochromatic set is independent in both $M_1$ and $M_2$. When both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are partition matroids, Galvin&#39;s celebrated list coloring theorem for bipartite graphs gives the answer. However, not much is known about the general case. One of the main open questions is to decide if there exists a constant $c$ such that if the coloring number is $k$ (i.e., the ground set can be partitioned into $k$ common independent sets), then the list coloring number is at most $c\cdot k$. In the present paper, we consider matroid classes that appear naturally in combinatorial and graph optimization problems, specifically graphic matroids, paving matroids and gammoids. We show that if both matroids are from these fundamental classes, then the list coloring number is at most twice the coloring number. The proof is based on a new approach that reduces a matroid to a partition matroid without increasing its coloring number too much and might be of independent combinatorial interest. In particular, we show that if $M=(S,{\mathcal{I}})$ is a matroid in which $S$ can be partitioned into $k$ independent sets, then there exists a partition matroid $N=(S,{\mathcal{J}})$ with ${\mathcal{J}}\subseteq{\mathcal{I}}$ in which $S$ can be partitioned into (A) $k$ independent sets if $M$ is a transversal matroid, (B) $2k-1$ independent sets if $M$ is a graphic matroid, (C) $\lceil kr/(r-1)\rceil$ independent sets if $M$ is a paving matroid of rank $r$, and (D) $2k-2$ independent sets if $M$ is a gammoid. It should be emphasized that in cases (A), (B), and (D) the rank of $N$ is the same as that of $M$. We further extend our results to a much broader family by showing that taking direct sum, homomorphic image, or truncation of matroids from these classes results in a matroid admitting a reduction to a partition matroid with coloring number at most twice the original one.},

Discrete Math., 29 (2015), pp. 65--78] and Perarnau and Reed [Combin. Probab. Comput., 26 (2017), pp. 448--467] studied these quantities as a function of the maximum degree of $H$. In this paper, we study a generalization for uniform hypergraphs. If $F$ is a complete $r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph with parts of sizes $s_1,s_2,\dots,s_r$ with each $s_{i + 1}$ sufficiently large relative to $s_i$, then with $1/\beta = \sum_{i = 2}^r \prod_{j = 1}^{i - 1} s_j$ we prove that for any $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$ with maximum degree $\Delta$, ${ex}(H,F)\ge \Delta^{-\beta - o(1)} \cdot e(H).$ This is tight as $\Delta \rightarrow \infty$ up to the $o(1)$ term in the exponent, since we show there exists a $\Delta$-regular $r$-graph $H$ such that ${ex}(H,F)=O(\Delta^{-\beta}) \cdot e(H)$. Similar tight results are obtained when $H$ is the random $n$-vertex $r$-graph $H_{n,p}^r$ with edge-probability $p$, extending results of Balogh and Samotij [J. Lond. Math.

  abstract     = {A long-standing conjecture of Zsolt Tuza asserts that the triangle covering number $\tau(G)$ is at most twice the triangle packing number $\nu(G)$, where the triangle packing number $\nu(G)$ is the maximum size of a set of edge-disjoint triangles in $G$ and the triangle covering number $\tau(G)$ is the minimal size of a set of edges intersecting all triangles. In this paper, we prove that Tuza&#39;s conjecture holds in the Erdös--Rényi random graph $G(n,m)$ for all ranges of $m$, closing the “gap” in what was previously known. (Recently, this result was also independently proved by Jeff Kahn and Jinyoung Park.) We employ a random greedy process called the online triangle packing process to produce a triangle packing in $G(n,m)$ and analyze this process by using the differential equations method.},

After a series of papers confirming the conjecture for a number of graph classes, the conjecture is yet refuted by Lafond and Seamone in 2015. Given that their counterexamples are not strongly chordal graphs and they are all only 2-connected, Lafond and Seamone asked the following two questions: (1) Are Hamiltonian strongly chordal graphs cycle extendable? (2) Is there an integer $k$ such that all $k$-connected Hamiltonian chordal graphs are cycle extendable? Later, a conjecture stronger than Hendry&#39;s is proposed. In this paper, we resolve all these questions in the negative. On the positive side, we add to the list of cycle-extendable graphs two more graph classes, namely, Hamiltonian 4-fan-free chordal graphs, where every induced $K_5 - e$ has true twins, and Hamiltonian ${4{\sc -fan}, \overline{A} }$-free chordal graphs.},

Merker showed that $f_3(k) \le 2k + 9$ for any $k \ge 2$, and $f_3(k) \ge 2k + 2$ for any even $k \ge 4$. He conjectured that $f_3(k) \le 2k + 2$ for any $k \ge 2$. This conjecture was disproved by Zamfirescu, who gave an infinite family of counterexamples for every even $k \ge 6$ whose graphs have no cycle length in $[k, 2k + 2]$, i.e., $f_3(k) \ge 2k + 3$ for any even $k \ge 6$. However, the exact value of $f_3(k)$ was only known for $k \le 4$, and it is a natural problem to determine $f_3(k)$ for $k \ge 5$. In this paper, we improve Merker&#39;s upper bound, and give the exact value of $f_3(k)$ for every $k \ge 5$. We show that $f_3(5) = 10$, $f_3(7) = 15$, $f_3(9) = 20$, and $f_3(k) = 2k + 3$ for any $k = 6, 8$ or $\ge 10$. For general 3-connected planar graphs, Merker conjectured that there exists some positive integer $c$ such that $f(k) \le 2k + c$ for any positive integer $k$. We give a complete positive answer to this conjecture. We prove that $f(k) = 5$ for any $k \le 3$, $f(4) = 10$, and $f(k) = 2k + 3$ for any $k \ge 5$.},

  abstract     = {Given a graph $G$, a $q$-open neighborhood conflict-free coloring or $q$-ONCF-coloring is a vertex coloring $c\colon V(G) \rightarrow {1,2,\ldots,q}$ such that for each vertex $v \in V(G)$ there is a vertex in $N(v)$ that is uniquely colored from the rest of the vertices in $N(v)$. When we replace $N(v)$ by the closed neighborhood $N[v]$, then we call such a coloring a $q$-closed neighborhood conflict-free coloring or simply $q$-CNCF-coloring. In this paper, we study the NP-hard decision questions of whether for a constant $q$ an input graph has a $q$-ONCF-coloring or a $q$-CNCF-coloring. We will study these two problems in the parameterized setting. First of all, we study running time bounds on fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for these problems when parameterized by treewidth. We improve the existing upper bounds, and also provide lower bounds on the running time under the exponential time hypothesis and the strong exponential time hypothesis. Second, we study the kernelization complexity of both problems, using vertex cover as the parameter. We show that both $(q \geq 2)$-ONCF-coloring and $(q \geq 3)$-CNCF-coloring cannot have polynomial kernels when parameterized by the size of a vertex cover unless ${\mathsf{NP \subseteq\- coNP/poly}}$. On the other hand, we obtain a polynomial kernel for 2-CNCF-coloring parameterized by vertex cover. We conclude the study with some combinatorial results. Denote $\chi_{ON}(G)$ and $\chi_{CN}(G)$ to be the minimum number of colors required to ONCF-color and CNCF-color $G$, respectively. Upper bounds on $\chi_{CN}(G)$ with respect to structural parameters like minimum vertex cover size, minimum feedback vertex set size, and treewidth are known. To the best of our knowledge only an upper bound on $\chi_{ON}(G)$ with respect to minimum vertex cover size was known. We provide tight bounds for $\chi_{ON}(G)$ with respect to minimum vertex cover size. Also, we provide the first upper bounds on $\chi_{ON}(G)$ with respect to minimum feedback vertex set size and treewidth.},

In this paper, we show that if the link of each face of a pure simplicial complex ${\mathbf K}$ (including the link of the empty face which is the whole ${\mathbf K}$) satisfies the removal-collapsibility condition, then the second barycentric subdivision of ${\mathbf K}$ is vertex decomposable and in particular shellable. This is a higher-dimensional generalization of a result of Hachimori, who proved that if the link of each vertex of a pure 2-dimensional simplicial complex ${\mathbf K}$ is connected and ${\mathbf K}$ becomes simplicially collapsible after removing $\tilde{\chi}({\mathbf K})$ facets, where $\tilde \chi ({\mathbf K})$ denotes the reduced Euler characteristic, then the second barycentric subdivision of ${\mathbf K}$ is shellable.

In saturation problems for 0-1 matrices we are interested in estimating the minimum number of 1 entries in an $m \times n$ matrix that is saturating for $P$, in terms of $m$ and $n$. In other words, we wish to give good estimates for the saturation function of $P$. Recently, Brualdi and Cao [R. A. Brualdi and L. Cao, preprint, arXiv:2005.00379, 2020] initiated the study of saturation problems in the context of 0-1 matrices. We extend their work in several directions. We prove that every 0-1 forbidden matrix has its saturation function either in $\Theta(1)$ or $\Theta(n)$ in the case when we restrict ourselves to square saturating matrices. Then we give a partial answer to a question posed by Brualdi and Cao about the saturation function of $J_k$, which is obtained from the identity matrix $I_k$ by putting the first row after the last row. Furthermore, we exhibit a $5\times 5$ permutation matrix with the saturation function bounded from the above by a fixed constant. We complement this result by identifying large classes of 0-1 matrices with linear saturation function. Finally, we completely resolve the related semisaturation problem as far as the constant versus linear dichotomy is concerned.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we design a framework to obtain efficient algorithms for several problems with a global constraint (acyclicity or connectivity) such as Connected Dominating Set, Node Weighted Steiner Tree, Maximum Induced Tree, Longest Induced Path, and Feedback Vertex Set. We design a meta-algorithm that solves all these problems and whose running time is upper bounded by $2^{O(k)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$, $2^{O(k \log(k))}\cdot n^{O(1)}$, $2^{O(k^2)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$, and $n^{O(k)}$ where $k$ is respectively the clique-width, $\mathbb{Q}$-rank-width, rank-width, and maximum induced matching width of a given decomposition. Our approach simplifies and unifies the known algorithms for each of the parameters and its running time matches asymptotically also the running times of the best known algorithms for basic \sf NP-hard problems such as Vertex Cover and Dominating Set. Our framework is based on the $d$-neighbor equivalence defined in [B. Bui-Xuan, J. A. Telle, and M. Vatshelle, Theoret. Comput. Sci., (2013), pp. 66--76] and the rank-based approach introduced in [H. L. Bodlaender, M. Cygan, S. Kratsch, and J. Nederlof, Inform. and Comput., 243 (2015), pp. 86--111]. The results we obtain highlight the importance of the $d$-neighbor equivalence relation on the algorithmic applications of width measures. We also prove that our framework could be useful for ${\sf W}[1]$-hard problems parameterized by clique-width such as Max Cut and Maximum Minimal Cut. For these latter problems, we obtain $n^{O(k)}$, $n^{O(k)}$, and $n^{2^{O(k)}}$ time algorithms where $k$ is respectively the clique-width, the $\mathbb{Q}$-rank-width, and the rank-width of the input graph.},

Suppose that we partition $[n]$ into $V_1,V_2,\ldots,V_k$ and add edge ${x,y}$ to our graph with probability $p$ if there exists $i$ such that $x,y\in V_i$. Otherwise, we add the edge with probability $q$.

  abstract     = {As is well known, the isomorphism problem for vertex-colored graphs with color multiplicity at most 3 is solvable by the classical two-dimensional Weisfeiler--Leman algorithm (2-WL). On the other hand, the prominent Cai--Fürer--Immerman construction shows that even the multidimensional version of the algorithm does not suffice for graphs with color multiplicity 4. We give an efficient decision procedure that, given a graph $G$ of color multiplicity 4, recognizes whether or not $G$ is identifiable by 2-WL, that is, whether or not 2-WL distinguishes $G$ from every nonisomorphic graph. In fact, we solve the much more general problem of recognizing whether or not a given coherent configuration of maximum fiber size 4 is separable. This extends our recognition algorithm to graphs of color multiplicity 4 with directed and colored edges. Our decision procedure is based on an explicit description of the class of graphs with color multiplicity 4 that are not identifiable by 2-WL. The Cai--Fürer--Immerman graphs of color multiplicity 4 distinctly appear here as a natural subclass, which demonstrates that the Cai--Fürer--Immerman construction is not ad hoc. Our classification reveals also other types of graphs that are hard for 2-WL. One of them arises from patterns known as $(n_3)$-configurations in incidence geometry.},

For each $k$ we construct an infinite family of examples showing our result is the best possible. Our results imply that every planar graph $G$ of girth at least 9 (resp., 8, 7) has a partition of $V(G)$ into an independent set $I$ and a set $F$ such that $G[F]$ is a forest with each component of order at most 3 (resp., 4, 6).

They specifically asked for the value of $g(1,b)$, i.e., the case when $A$ is an independent set. Previously, the only values known were $g(1,4/3)$ and $g(1,2)$.

We consider both the shortest and the longest monotone paths and estimate the monotone diameter and height of polyhedra. Our analysis applies to transportation polytopes, matroid polytopes, matching polytopes, shortest-path polytopes, and the traveling salesman polytope, among others. We begin by showing that combinatorial cubes have monotone diameter and Bland simplex height upper bounded by their dimension and that in fact all monotone paths of zonotopes are no larger than the number of edge directions of the zonotope. We later use this to show that several polytopes have polynomial-size monotone diameter. In contrast, we show that for many well-known combinatorial polytopes, the height is at least exponential. Surprisingly, for some famous pivot rules, e.g., greatest improvement and steepest edge, these same polytopes have polynomial-size simplex paths.},

In this first part, we prove structural properties and show that there exist infinitely many cubic non-Hamiltonian $K_2$-Hamiltonian graphs, both of the 3-edge-colorable and the non-3-edge-colorable variety. In fact, cubic $K_2$-Hamiltonian graphs with chromatic index 4 (such as Petersen&#39;s graph) are a subset of the critical snarks. On the other hand, it is proven that non-Hamiltonian $K_2$-Hamiltonian graphs of any maximum degree exist. Several operations conserving $K_2$-Hamiltonicity are described, one of which leads to the result that there exists an infinite family of non-Hamiltonian $K_2$-Hamiltonian graphs in which, asymptotically, a quarter of vertices has the property that removing such a vertex yields a non-Hamiltonian graph. We extend a celebrated result of Tutte by showing that every planar $K_2$-Hamiltonian graph with minimum degree at least 4 is Hamiltonian. Finally, we investigate $K_2$-traceable graphs and discuss open problems.},

As it is more convenient to take logarithms, we denote by $\psi_n$ the set of all vectors $x$ for which there is a body $T$ such that $x_A=\log |T_A|$ for all $A$. Bollobás and Thomason showed that $\psi_n$ is contained in the polyhedral cone defined by the class of “uniform cover inequalities.” Tan and Zeng conjectured that the convex hull $\operatorname{conv}(\psi_n)$ is equal to the cone given by the uniform cover inequalities. We prove that this conjecture is “nearly” right: the closed convex hull $\overline{\operatorname{conv}}(\psi_n)$ is equal to the cone given by the uniform cover inequalities. However, perhaps surprisingly, we also show that $\operatorname{conv}(\psi_n)$ is not closed for $n\ge 4$, thus disproving the conjecture.},

  abstract     = {Given an $n$-vertex graph $H$ with minimum degree at least $d n$ for some fixed $d &gt; 0$, the distribution $H \cup \mathbb{G}(n,p)$ over the supergraphs of $H$ is referred to as a (random) perturbation of $H$. We consider the distribution of edge-colored graphs arising from assigning each edge of the random perturbation $H \cup \mathbb{G}(n,p)$ a color, chosen independently and uniformly at random from a set of colors of size $r := r(n)$. We prove that edge-colored graphs which are generated in this manner asymptotically almost surely admit rainbow Hamilton cycles whenever the edge-density of the random perturbation satisfies $p := p(n) \geq C/n$ for some fixed $C &gt; 0$ and $r = (1 + o(1))n$. The number of colors used is clearly asymptotically best possible. In particular, this improves on a recent result of Anastos and Frieze [J. Graph Theory, 92 (2019), pp. 405--414] in this regard. As an intermediate result, which may be of independent interest, we prove that randomly edge-colored sparse pseudorandom graphs asymptotically almost surely admit an almost spanning rainbow path.},

Given an $r$-graph $F$, the codegree density $\gamma(F)$ is the largest $\gamma&gt;0$ such that there are $F$-free $r$-graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\delta(G)\ge(\gamma-o(1))n$.

Employing the moment identity of a subset of $PG_{m}(q)$, we prove (1) $\gamma(PG_{2}(q))=\frac{1}{2}$ for prime power $q\equiv2\pmod{3}$; and (2) $\gamma(PG_{3}(q))=\frac{2}{3}$ for prime power $q\equiv1\pmod{2}$ or $q\equiv2\pmod{3}$. Our results partially solve an open problem proposed by Keevash and Zhao [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 97 (2007), pp. 919--928]. Previously, the codegree density problems for projective geometries were settled only for $PG_{2}(2)$, $PG_{3}(2)$, $PG_{3}(3),$ and $PG_{2}(q)$ with odd prime power $q$.},

This computation can be viewed as approximating the partition function of edge-weighted matchings in a bipartite graph. Equivalently, this may be viewed as approximating the partition function of vertex-weighted independent sets in the line graph of a bipartite graph. Line graphs of bipartite graphs are perfect graphs and are known to be precisely the class of (claw, diamond, odd hole)-free graphs. So how far does the result of Jerrum, Sinclair, and Vigoda extend? We first show that it extends to (claw, odd hole)-free graphs, and then show that it extends to the even larger class of (fork, odd hole)-free graphs.

In this paper, we study the same problem with the additional constraint that $G$ is $\ell$-connected. For $2$-connected graphs $G$, we prove a tight bound $P_G(k) \le (k-1)!((k-1)^{n-k+1} + (-1)^{n-k})$ and show that equality is only achieved if $G$ is a $k$-clique with an ear attached. For $\ell \ge 3$, we prove an asymptotically tight upper bound $ P_G(k) \le k!(k-1)^{n-\ell - k + 1} + O((k-2)^n)$ and provide a matching lower bound construction. For the ranges $k \geq \ell$ or $\ell \geq (k-2)(k-1)+1$ we further find the unique graph maximizing $P_G(k)$. We also consider generalizing $\ell$-connected graphs to connected graphs with minimum degree $\delta$.},

  abstract     = {What must one do in order to make acyclic a given oriented graph? Here we look at the structures that must be removed (or reversed) in order to make acyclic a given oriented graph. For a directed acyclic graph $H$ and an oriented graph $G$, let $f_H(G)$ be the maximum number of pairwise disjoint copies of $H$ that can be found in all feedback arc sets of $G$. In particular, to make $G$ acyclic, one must at least remove (or reverse) $f_H(G)$ pairwise disjoint copies of $H$. Perhaps most intriguing is the case where $H$ is a $k$-clique, in which case the parameter is denoted by $f_k(G)$. Determining $f_k(G)$ for arbitrary $G$ seems challenging. Here we essentially answer the problem, precisely, for the family of $k$-partite tournaments. Let $s(G)$ denote the size of the smallest vertex class of a $k$-partite tournament $G$. It is not difficult to show that $f_k(G) \le s(G)-k+1$ (assume that $s(G) \ge k-1$). Our main result is that for all sufficiently large $s=s(G)$, there are $k$-partite tournaments for which $f_k(G) = s(G)-k+1$. In fact, much more can be said: A random $k$-partite tournament $G$ satisfies $f_k(G) = s(G)-k+1$ almost surely (i.e., with probability tending to $1$ as $s(G)$ goes to infinity). In particular, as the title states, $f_k(G) = \lfloor n/k\rfloor-k+1$ almost surely, where $G$ is a random orientation of the Turán graph $T(n,k)$.},

The problem of deciding whether a given spanning tree of a graph is a search tree of a particular search on this graph was introduced by Hagerup in 1985, where the author showed that this problem is efficiently solvable for depth first search (DFS) trees and breadth first search (BFS) trees. If one defines such a search tree in the same way as done for BFS, i.e., by connecting every vertex to its first neighbor, then we call this an ${\cal F}$-tree. If, on the other hand, we connect it with its most recently visited neighbor (as in DFS) we call this an ${\cal L}$-tree. In this paper, we consider related search paradigms. We prove that the search tree problem can be solved in polynomial time for ${\cal L}$-trees of lexicographic depth first search, whereas the ${\cal F}$-tree recognition problem is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete for lexicographic breadth first search, lexicographic depth first search, maximum cardinality search, and maximal neighborhood search. Furthermore, we present polynomial results for both types of trees on chordal graphs.},

This problem has wide applications in various fields such as biology, information theory, and statistical physics, and its close connections to the clustering problem in the setting of the stochastic block model (SBM) have been well established. For SBM, an “information-theoretically-solvable-but-computationally-hard&quot; region, or say “hybrid-hard&quot; phase, appears whenever the reconstruction bound of the corresponding reconstruction on the tree problem is not tight. Inspired by the recently proposed $q_1+q_2$ SBM [F. Ricci-Tersenghi, G. Semerjian, and L. Zdeborová, Phys. Rev. E, 99 (2019), 042109], we extend the classical works on the Ising model [C.

  abstract     = {We provide a comprehensive study of a natural graph optimization problem that arises from transition costs between incident edges. In the problem Minimum Scan Cover with Angular Costs (MSC), we are given a graph $G$ that is embedded in Euclidean space. The edges of $G$ need to be scanned, i.e., probed from both of their vertices. In order to scan their edge, two vertices need to face each other; changing the heading of a vertex takes some time proportional to the corresponding turn angle. Our goal is to minimize the time until all scans are completed, i.e., to compute a schedule of minimum makespan. A real-world motivation arises in the context of satellite communication and astrophysics. We show that MSC is closely related to both graph coloring and the minimum (directed and undirected) cut cover problem; in particular, we show that the minimum scan time for instances in 1D and 2D lies in $\Theta(\log \chi (G))$, while for 3D the minimum scan time is not upper bounded by $\chi (G)$. We use this relationship to prove that the existence of a constant-factor approximation implies P $=$ NP, even for one-dimensional instances. In 2D, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate a minimum scan cover within less than a factor of $\nicefrac{3}{2}$, even for bipartite graphs; conversely, we present a 9/2-approximation algorithm for this scenario. Generally, we give an $O(c)$-approximation for $k$-colored graphs with $k\leq \chi(G)^{c}$. For general metric cost functions, we provide approximation algorithms whose performance guarantees depend on the arboricity of the graph.},

In this paper we consider the quantitative question arising from Whitney&#39;s theorem: Given two 2-isomorphic graphs, can we transform one into another by applying at most $k$ Whitney switches? This problem is already \sf NP-complete for cycles, and we investigate its parameterized complexity. We show that the problem admits a kernel of size $\mathcal{O}(k)$ and thus is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by $k$.},

  abstract     = {The perfect matching index of a cubic graph $G$, denoted by $\pi(G)$, is the smallest number of perfect matchings that cover all the edges of $G$. According to the Berge--Fulkerson conjecture, $\pi(G)\le5$ for every bridgeless cubic graph $G$. The class of graphs with $\pi\ge 5$ is of particular interest as many conjectures and open problems, including the famous cycle double cover conjecture, can be reduced to it. Although nontrivial examples of such graphs are very difficult to find, a few infinite families are known, all with circular flow number $\Phi_c(G)=5$. It has been therefore suggested [Abreu et al., Electron. J. Combin., 23 (2016), P3.54] that $\pi(G)\ge 5$ might imply $\Phi_c(G)\ge 5$. In this article we dispel these hopes and present a family of cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graphs of girth at least 5 with $\pi\ge 5$ and $\Phi_c\le 4+\frac23$.},

  abstract     = {We prove several versions of Alon&#39;s necklace-splitting theorem, subject to additional constraints, as illustrated by the following results. (1) The “almost equicardinal necklace-splitting theorem” claims that, without increasing the number of cuts, one guarantees the existence of a fair splitting such that each thief is allocated almost the same number of pieces of the necklace (including “degenerate pieces” if they exist), provided the number of thieves $r=p^\nu$ is a prime power. By “almost the same” we mean that for each pair of thieves one of them can be given at most one piece more (one piece less) than the other. (2) The “binary splitting theorem” claims that if $r=2^d$ and the thieves are associated with the vertices of a $d$-cube, then, without increasing the number of cuts, one can guarantee the existence of a fair splitting such that adjacent pieces are allocated to thieves that share an edge of the cube. This result provides a positive answer to the “binary splitting necklace conjecture” in the case $r=2^d$ from Conjecture 2.11 in [M. Asada et al., SIAM J. Discrete Math., 32 (2018), pp. 591--610]. (3) An interesting variation arises when the thieves have their own individual preferences. We prove several envy-free, fair necklace-splitting theorems of various level of generality, as illustrated by the envy-free versions of (a) Alon&#39;s original necklace-splitting theorem, (b) the almost equicardinal splitting theorem, and (c) the binary splitting theorem, etc.},

An $n$ by $n$ bipartite graph $G$ is $H$-saturated if $G$ does not contain a subgraph isomorphic to $H$ but adding any missing edge to $G$ creates a copy of $H$. More than half a century ago, Wessel and Bollobás independently solved the problem of minimizing the number of edges in $K_{(s,t)}$-saturated graphs, where $K_{(s,t)}$ is the “ordered” complete bipartite graph with $s$ vertices from the first color class and $t$ from the second. However, the very natural “unordered” analogue of this problem was considered only half a decade ago by Moshkovitz and Shapira. When $s=t$, it can be easily checked that the unordered variant is exactly the same as the ordered case. Later, Gan, Korándi, and Sudakov gave an asymptotically tight bound on the minimum number of edges in $K_{(s,t)}$-saturated $n$ by $n$ bipartite graphs, which is only smaller than the conjecture of Moshkovitz and Shapira by an additive constant. In this paper, we confirm their conjecture for $s=t-1$ with the classification of the extremal graphs. We also improve the estimates of Gan, Korándi, and Sudakov for general $s$ and $t$, and for all sufficiently large $n$.},

A bi-hole of size $t$ in a bipartite graph $G$ with a fixed bipartition is an independent set with exactly $t$ vertices in each part; in other words, it is a copy of $K_{t, t}$ in the bipartite complement of $G$. Let $f(n, \Delta)$ be the largest $k$ for which every $n \times n$ bipartite graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ in one of the parts has a bi-hole of size $k$. Determining $f(n, \Delta)$ is thus the bipartite analogue of finding the largest independent set in graphs with a given number of vertices and bounded maximum degree. It has connections to the bipartite version of the Erdös--Hajnal conjecture, bipartite Ramsey numbers, and the Zarankiewicz problem. Our main result determines the asymptotic behavior of $f(n, \Delta)$. More precisely, we show that for large but fixed $\Delta$ and $n$ sufficiently large, $f(n, \Delta) = \Theta(\frac{\log \Delta}{\Delta} n)$. We further address more specific regimes of $\Delta$, especially when $\Delta$ is a small fixed constant. In particular, we determine $f(n, 2)$ exactly and obtain bounds for $f(n, 3)$, though determining the precise value of $f(n, 3)$ is still open.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the successful application of geometry to proving the Harary--Hill conjecture for “pseudolinear” drawings of $K_n$, we introduce “pseudospherical” drawings of graphs. A spherical drawing of a graph $G$ is a drawing in the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ in which the vertices of $G$ are represented as points---no three on a great circle---and the edges of $G$ are shortest-arcs in $\mathbb{S}^2$ connecting pairs of vertices. Such a drawing has three properties: (1) every edge $e$ is contained in a simple closed curve $\gamma_e$ such that the only vertices in $\gamma_e$ are the ends of $e$; (2) if $e\ne f$, then $\gamma_e\cap\gamma_f$ has precisely two crossings; and (3) if $e\ne f$, then $e$ intersects $\gamma_f$ at most once, in either a crossing or an end of $e$. We use properties (1)--(3) to define a pseudospherical drawing of $G$. Our main result is that for the complete graph, properties (1)--(3) are equivalent to the same three properties but with “precisely two crossings” in (2) replaced by “at most two crossings.” The proof requires a result in the geometric transversal theory of arrangements of pseudocircles. This is proved using the surprising result that the absence of special arcs (coherent spirals) in an arrangement of simple closed curves characterizes the fact that any two curves in the arrangement have at most two crossings. Our studies provide the necessary ideas for exhibiting a drawing of $K_{10}$ that has no extension to an arrangement of pseudocircles and a drawing of $K_9$ that does extend to an arrangement of pseudocircles, but no such extension has all pairs of pseudocircles crossing twice.},

In many cases, our result gives a tight bound on $\delta_l(H)$ for near perfect matchings (e.g., when $l\ge 2k/3$, $n\equiv r \pmod k$, $0\le r&lt;k$, and $r+l\ge k$, we can take $m=\lceil n/k\rceil -2$). When $k=3$, using an absorbing lemma of Hàn, Person, and Schacht, our proof also implies a result of Kühn, Osthus, and Treglown (and, independently, of Khan) on perfect matchings in 3-uniform hypergraphs.},

  abstract     = {Whitney proved in 1931 that 4-connected planar triangulations are Hamiltonian. Hakimi, Schmeichel, and Thomassen conjectured in 1979 that if $G$ is a 4-connected planar triangulation with $n$ vertices, then $G$ contains at least $2(n-2)(n-4)$ Hamiltonian cycles, with equality if and only if $G$ is a double wheel. On the other hand, a recent result of Alahmadi, Aldred, and Thomassen states that there are exponentially many Hamiltonian cycles in 5-connected planar triangulations. In this paper, we consider 4-connected planar $n$-vertex triangulations $G$ that do not have too many separating 4-cycles or have minimum degree 5. We show that if $G$ has $O(n/{\log}_2 n)$ separating 4-cycles, then $G$ has $\Omega(n^2)$ Hamiltonian cycles, and if $\delta(G)\ge 5$, then $G$ has $2^{\Omega(n^{1/4})}$ Hamiltonian cycles. Both results improve previous work. Moreover, the proofs involve a “double wheel” structure, providing further evidence to the above conjecture.},

This is easily seen to be the largest power of a Hamilton cycle one can guarantee, given such a minimum degree assumption. Following a recent trend of studying effects of adding random edges to a dense graph, the model known as the randomly perturbed graph, Dudek et al. showed that if the minimum degree is at least $kn/(k + 1) + \alpha n$, for any constant $\alpha &gt; 0$, then adding $O(n)$ random edges on top almost surely results in a graph which contains the $(k + 1)$st power of a Hamilton cycle. We show that the effect of these random edges is significantly stronger, namely, that one can almost surely find the $(2k + 1)$st power. This is the largest power one can guarantee in such a setting.},

  abstract     = {Given an $n$-vertex $m$-edge graph $G$ with nonnegative edge-weights, a shortest cycle is one minimizing the sum of the weights on its edges. The girth of $G$ is the weight of a shortest cycle. We obtain several new approximation algorithms for computing the girth of weighted graphs: For any graph $G$ with polynomially bounded integer weights, we present a deterministic algorithm that computes, in $\tilde{\cal O}(n^{5/3}+m)$-time, a cycle of weight at most twice the girth of $G$. This matches the approximation factor of the best known subquadratic-time approximation algorithm for the girth of unweighted graphs. Then, we turn our algorithm into a deterministic $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation for graphs with arbitrary nonnegative edge-weights, at the price of a slightly worse running time in $\tilde{\cal O}(n^{5/3}\text{polylog}{(1/\varepsilon)}+m)$. For that, we introduce a generic method in order to obtain a polynomial-factor approximation of the girth in subquadratic time, that may be of independent interest. Finally, if we assume that the adjacency lists are sorted then we can get rid off the dependency in the number $m$ of edges. Namely, we can transform our algorithms into an $\tilde{\cal O}(n^{5/3})$-time randomized 4-approximation for graphs with nonnegative edge-weights. This can be derandomized, thereby leading to an $\tilde{\cal O}(n^{5/3})$-time deterministic 4-approximation for graphs with polynomially bounded integer weights, and an $\tilde{\cal O}(n^{5/3}\text{polylog}{(1/\varepsilon)})$-time deterministic $(4+\varepsilon)$-approximation for graphs with nonnegative edge-weights. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first known subquadratic-time approximation algorithms for computing the girth of weighted graphs.},

  abstract     = {Treedepth, a more restrictive graph width parameter than treewidth and pathwidth, plays a major role in the theory of sparse graph classes. We show that there exists a constant $C$ such that for all positive integers $a,b$ and a graph $G$, if the treedepth of $G$ is at least $Cab$, then the treewidth of $G$ is at least $a$ or $G$ contains a subcubic (i.e., of maximum degree at most 3) tree of treedepth at least $b$ as a subgraph. As a direct corollary, we obtain that every graph of treedepth $\Omega(k^3)$ either is of treewidth at least $k$, contains a subdivision of full binary tree of depth $k$, or contains a path of length $2^k$. This improves the bound of $\Omega(k^5 \log^2 k)$ of Kawarabayashi and Rossman [Proceedings of the 2018 Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp. 234--246]. We also show an application of our techniques for approximation algorithms of treedepth: given a graph $G$ of treedepth $k$ and treewidth $t$, one can in polynomial time compute a treedepth decomposition of $G$ of width $\mathcal{O}(kt \log^{3/2} t)$. This improves upon a bound of $\mathcal{O}(kt^2 \log t)$ stemming from a tradeoff between known results. The main technical ingredient in our result is a proof that every tree of treedepth $d$ contains a subcubic subtree of treedepth at least $d \cdot \log_3 ((1+\sqrt{5})/2)$.},

We add to the study of these local covering numbers with a lower bound construction and some examples. Following Kim et al., we use the results on local covering numbers to provide lower and upper bounds for the local dimension of partially ordered sets of height 2. We discuss the local dimension of some posets related to Boolean lattices and show that the poset induced by the first two layers of the Boolean lattice has local dimension $(1 + o(1))\log_2\log_2 n$.

  abstract     = {We obtain new polynomial kernels and compression algorithms for Path Cover and Cycle Cover, the well-known generalizations of the classical Hamiltonian Path and Hamiltonian Cycle problems. Our choice of parameterization is strongly influenced by the work of Biró, Hujter, and Tuza, who in 1992 introduced $H$-graphs, intersection graphs of connected subgraphs of a subdivision of a fixed (multi-)graph $H$. In this work, we turn to proper $H$-graphs, where the containment relationship between the representations of the vertices is forbidden. As the treewidth of a graph measures how similar the graph is to a tree, the size of graph $H$ is the parameter measuring the closeness of the graph to a proper interval graph. We prove the following results. Path Cover admits a kernel of size $\mathcal{O}(\|H\|^8)$, where $\|H\|$ is the size of graph $H$. In other words, we design an algorithm that for an $n$-vertex graph $G$ and integer $k\geq 1$, in time polynomial in $n$ and $\|H\|$, outputs a graph $G&#39;$ of size $\mathcal{O}(\|H\|^8)$ and $k&#39;\leq |V(G&#39;)|$ such that the vertex set of $G$ is coverable by $k$ vertex-disjoint paths if and only if the vertex set of $G&#39;$ is coverable by $k&#39;$ vertex-disjoint paths. Hamiltonian Cycle admits a kernel of size $\mathcal{O}(\|H\|^8)$. Cycle Cover admits a polynomial kernel. We prove it by providing a compression of size $\mathcal{O}(\|H\|^{10})$ into another \sf NP-complete problem, namely, Prize Collecting Cycle Cover, that is, we design an algorithm that, in time polynomial in $n$ and $\|H\|$, outputs an equivalent instance of Prize Collecting Cycle Cover of size $\mathcal{O}(\|H\|^{10})$. In all our algorithms we assume that a proper $H$-decomposition is given as a part of the input.},

These results suggest that it is possible to fairly allocate goods in practice even when the number of goods is extremely large.

  abstract     = {The problem of constructing hazard-free Boolean circuits (those avoiding electronic glitches) dates back to the 1940s and is an important problem in circuit design and even in cybersecurity. We show that a DeMorgan circuit, that is, a Boolean AND, OR, NOT circuit with negations applied to only input variables, is hazard-free iff the circuit produces (purely syntactically) all prime implicants as well as all prime implicates of the Boolean function it computes. This extends to arbitrary DeMorgan circuits a classical result of Eichelberger [IBM J. Res. Develop., 9 (1965), pp. 90--99] showing this property for circuits producing no terms containing a variable together with its negation. Via an amazingly simple proof, we also strengthen a recent result of Ikenmeyer et al. [J. ACM, 66 (2019), 25]: not only do the complexities of hazard-free and monotone circuits for monotone Boolean functions coincide, but every minimal hazard-free circuit for a monotone Boolean function must be monotone. We also observe that hazard-free implementations of already very simple Boolean functions require a superpolynomial increase of circuit size and depth, such as, for example, the Boolean function which accepts a Boolean square matrix iff every row and every column has exactly one $1$. Finally, we show that the order of growth of the Shannon function of hazard-free circuits is the same as that of unrestricted circuits.},

  abstract     = {In 1969, Tucker characterized proper circular-arc graphs as those graphs whose augmented adjacency matrices have the circularly compatible ones property. Moreover, he also found a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether any given augmented adjacency matrix has the circularly compatible ones property. These results led to the first polynomial-time recognition algorithm for proper circular-arc graphs. However, as remarked there, this work did not solve the problems of finding a structure theorem and an efficient recognition algorithm for the circularly compatible ones property in arbitrary matrices (i.e., not restricted to augmented adjacency matrices only). In the present work, we solve these problems. More precisely, we give a minimal forbidden submatrix characterization for the circularly compatible ones property in arbitrary matrices and a linear-time recognition algorithm for the same property. We derive these results from analogous ones for the related $D$-circular property. Interestingly, these results lead to a minimal forbidden induced subgraph characterization and a linear-time recognition algorithm for proper circular-arc bigraphs, solving a problem first posed by Basu et al. [J. Graph Theory, 73 (2013), pp. 361--376]. Our findings generalize some known results about $D$-interval hypergraphs and proper interval bigraphs.},

Since common fairness notions like envy-freeness and proportionality cannot always be satisfied in this setting, an important question is when allocations satisfying these notions exist. In this paper, we close several gaps in the line of work on asymptotic fair division. First, we prove that the classical round-robin algorithm is likely to produce an envy-free allocation provided that $m=\Omega(n\log n/\log\log n)$, matching the lower bound from prior work. We then show that a proportional allocation exists with high probability as long as $m\geq n$, while an allocation satisfying envy-freeness up to any item (EFX) is likely to be present for any relation between $m$ and $n$. Finally, we consider a related setting where each agent is assigned exactly one item and the remaining items are left unassigned, and show that the transition from nonexistence to existence with respect to envy-free assignments occurs at $m=en$.},

Kim and Kwon in [J. Combin. Theory Ser.

In this paper, we investigate whether or not the class of $H$-subdivisions has the induced Erdös--Pósa property for other graphs $H$. We completely settle the case when $H$ is a forest or a complete bipartite graph. Regarding the general case, we identify necessary conditions on $H$ for the class of $H$-subdivisions to have the induced Erdös--Pósa property. For this, we provide three basic constructions that are useful for proving that the class of the subdivisions of a graph does not have the induced Erdös--Pósa property. Among remaining graphs, we prove that if $H$ is the diamond, the 1-pan, or the 2-pan, then the class of $H$-subdivisions has the induced Erdös--Pósa property.},

  abstract     = {We study the Steiner Tree problem, in which a set of terminal vertices needs to be connected in the cheapest possible way in an edge-weighted graph. This problem has been extensively studied from the viewpoint of approximation and also parameterization. In particular, on one hand Steiner Tree is known to be ${APX}$-hard, and ${W[2]}$-hard on the other, if parameterized by the number of nonterminals (Steiner vertices) in the optimum solution. In contrast to this, we give an efficient parameterized approximation scheme (${EPAS}$), which circumvents both hardness results. Moreover, our methods imply the existence of a polynomial size approximate kernelization scheme (${PSAKS}$) for the considered parameter. We further study the parameterized approximability of other variants of Steiner Tree, such as Directed Steiner Tree and Steiner Forest. For none of these is an ${EPAS}$ likely to exist for the studied parameter. For Steiner Forest an easy observation shows that the problem is ${APX}$-hard, even if the input graph contains no Steiner vertices. For Directed Steiner Tree we prove that approximating within any function of the studied parameter is ${W[1]}$-hard. Nevertheless, we show that an ${EPAS}$ exists for Unweighted Directed Steiner Tree, but a ${PSAKS}$ does not. We also prove that there is an ${EPAS}$ and a ${PSAKS}$ for Steiner Forest if in addition to the number of Steiner vertices, the number of connected components of an optimal solution is considered to be a parameter.},

The randomness complexity of private protocols is of interest both because random bits are considered a scarce resource and because of the relation between that complexity measure and other complexity measures of boolean functions such as the circuit size or the sensitivity of the function being computed [Kushilevitz, Ostrovsky, and Rosén, J. Comput. Syst. Sci., 58 (1999), pp. 129--136] and [Gál and Rosén, SIAM J. Comput., 31 (2002), pp. 1424--1437]. More concretely, we consider the randomness complexity of the basic Boolean function \tt and, that serves as a building block in the design of many private protocols. We show that \tt and cannot be privately computed using a single random bit, thus giving the first nontrivial lower bound on the 1-private randomness complexity of an explicit Boolean function, $f: {0,1}^n \rightarrow {0,1}$. We further show that and, on any number of inputs $n$ (one input bit per player), can be privately computed using 8 random bits (and 7 random bits in the special case of $n=3$ players), improving the upper bound of 73 random bits implicit in [Kushilevitz, Ostrovsky, and Rosén, J. Comput. Syst. Sci., 58 (1999), pp. 129--136]. Together with our lower bound, we thus approach the exact determination of the randomness complexity of \tt and.

Let $f(H)$ be the minimum integer $k$ such that every $k$-connected graph is $H$-linked. Among connected simple graphs $H$ with at least four vertices, the exact value $f(H)$ is only known when $H$ is a star, or a path with four vertices, or a cycle with four vertices. A kite is the graph obtained from $K_4$ by deleting two adjacent edges, i.e., a triangle together with a pendant edge. The exact value of $f(H)$ when $H$ is the kite remains open. In this paper, we settle this problem by showing that every 7-connected graph is kite-linked.},

A (signed) graph is modulo-$(2p+1)$-orientable if it has an orientation such that the indegree is congruent to the outdegree modulo $2p+1$ at each vertex. An integer-valued $\frac{2p+1}{p}$-flow is a flow taking integer values in ${\pm p, \pm (p+1)}$. Extending a fundamental result of Jaeger to signed graphs, we show that a bridgeless signed graph is modulo-$(2p+1)$-orientable if and only if it admits an integer-valued $\frac{2p+1}{p}$-flow. It was conjectured by Raspaud and Zhu that, for any signed graph, the admission of a circular $r$-flow implies the admission of an integer-valued $\lceil r \rceil$-flow. Although this conjecture has been disproved in general, it is confirmed in this paper for bridgeless signed graphs if $r=\frac{2p+1}{p}$ and $p \geq 3$.},

  abstract     = {We unify two popular graph classes, strongly chordal graphs and chordal bigraphs, by introducing an umbrella class that contains both classes and maintains their essential properties. This is done by allowing loops at vertices. Considering loops often has little impact on a class of graphs; it however makes a big difference in this case. We call the new class \itstrongly chordal graphs with possible loops. When all vertices have loops, we recover the usual strongly chordal graphs; when all vertices are loopless, we obtain the usual chordal bigraphs. Moreover, there is a surprizing wealth of graphs in the new class that have loops at some vertices and not at others. These graphs also admit the elegant algorithms previously only applied in the extreme two cases. Formulated in the language of adjacency matrices, we study the class of symmetric 0, 1 matrices that admit a simultaneous row and column permutation avoiding the $\Gamma$ matrix $[ \begin{smallmatrix} 1 \ 1 \\ 1 \ 0 \end{smallmatrix}]$. We give ordering characterizations, matrix characterizations, and forbidden subgraph characterizations of the new class, and illustrate its usefulness by solving the minimum domination problem in this general context. This implies solutions of both the minimum dominating set in strongly chordal graphs and the minimum total dominating set in chordal bigraphs.},

We consider the following question: if $H$ has bounded treewidth, is there a “sparse” graph $G$ that is Ramsey for $H$? Two notions of sparsity are considered. Firstly, we show that if the maximum degree and treewidth of $H$ are bounded, then there is a graph $G$ with $O(|V(H)|)$ edges that is Ramsey for $H$. This was previously only known for the smaller class of graphs $H$ with bounded bandwidth. On the other hand, we prove that in general the treewidth of a graph $G$ that is Ramsey for $H$ cannot be bounded in terms of the treewidth of $H$ alone. In fact, the latter statement is true even if the treewidth is replaced by the degeneracy and $H$ is a tree.},

We determine both their dimensions and minimum distances. In particular, when $N=1$, the codes are primitive, with minimum distance $d=\frac{s}{q-1}(q^m-1)$ and dimension $k = (q-s)^m$. The general result on code dimensions is achieved by applying generating functions and inverse discrete Fourier transforms to an enumeration problem.},

  abstract     = {Clustering is one of the fundamental tasks in data analytics and machine learning. In many situations, different clusterings of the same data set become relevant. For example, different algorithms for the same clustering task may return dramatically different solutions. We are interested in applications in which one clustering has to be transformed into another, e.g., when a gradual transition from an old solution to a new one is required. In this paper, we devise methods for constructing such a transition based on linear programming and network theory. We use a so-called clustering-difference graph to model the desired transformation and provide methods for decomposing the graph into a sequence of elementary moves that accomplishes the transformation. These moves are equivalent to the edge directions, or circuits, of the underlying partition polytopes. Therefore, in addition to a conceptually new metric for measuring the distance between clusterings, we provide new bounds on the circuit diameter of these partition polytopes.},

  abstract     = {Suppose ${\mathcal{F}}$ is a finite family of graphs. We consider the following meta-problem, called $\mathcal{F}$-Immersion Deletion: given a graph $G$ and integer $k$, decide whether the deletion of at most $k$ edges of $G$ can result in a graph that does not contain any graph from $\mathcal{F}$ as an immersion. This problem is a close relative of the $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Deletion problem studied by Fomin et al. [Proceedings of FOCS, IEEE, 2012, pp. 470--479], where one deletes vertices in order to remove all minor models of graphs from $\mathcal{F}$. We prove that whenever all graphs from $\mathcal{F}$ are connected and at least one graph of $\mathcal{F}$ is planar and subcubic, then the $\mathcal{F}$-Immersion Deletion problem admits a constant-factor approximation algorithm running in time $\mathcal{O}(m^3 \cdot n^3 \cdot \log m)$, a linear kernel that can be computed in time $\mathcal{O}(m^4 \cdot n^3 \cdot \log m)$, and a $\mathcal{O}(2^{\mathcal{O}(k)} + m^4 \cdot n^3 \cdot \log m)$-time fixed-parameter algorithm, where $n,m$ count the vertices and edges of the input graph. These results mirror the findings of Fomin et al., who obtained a similar set of algorithmic results for $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Deletion, under the assumption that at least one graph from $\mathcal{F}$ is planar. An important difference is that we are able to obtain a linear kernel for $\mathcal{F}$-Immersion Deletion, while the exponent of the kernel of Fomin et al. for $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Deletion depends heavily on the family $\mathcal{F}$. In fact, this dependence is unavoidable under plausible complexity assumptions, as proven by Giannopoulou et al. [ACM Trans. Algorithms, 13 (2017), p. 35]. This reveals that the kernelization complexity of $\mathcal{F}$-Immersion Deletion is quite different from that of $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Deletion.},

We show that this actually holds for all known topological lower bounds and all fields. We also improve the topological bound he obtained for the minrank parameter over $\mathbb{R}$---an important graph invariant from coding theory---and show that this bound is actually valid for all fields as well. The notion of independent representation over a matroid is introduced and used in a general theorem having these results as corollaries. Related complexity results are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the characterization and the recognition of graph classes. A popular way to characterize a graph class is to list a minimal set of forbidden induced subgraphs. Unfortunately, this strategy rarely leads to a very efficient recognition algorithm. On the other hand, many graph classes can be efficiently recognized by techniques that use some ordering of the nodes, such as the one given by a traversal. We specifically study graphs that have an ordering avoiding some ordered structures. More precisely, we consider structures that we call patterns on three nodes, and we study the complexity of recognizing the classes associated with such patterns. In this domain, there are three key previous works. Independently Skrien [J. Graph Theory, 6 (1982), pp. 309--316] and Damashke [Forbidden ordered subgraphs, in Topics in Combinatorics and Graph Theory, Physica-Verlag HD, 1990, pp. 219--229] noted that several graph classes, such as chordal, bipartite, interval, and comparability graphs, have a characterization in terms of forbidden patterns. On the algorithmic side, Hell, Mohar, and Rafiey [Ordering without forbidden patterns, in Algorithms--ESA 2014, Springer, 2014, pp. 554--565] proved that any class defined by a set of forbidden patterns on three nodes can be recognized in time $O(n^3)$ by using an algorithm based on an extension of 2-SAT. We improve on these two lines of works by systematically characterizing all the classes defined by sets of forbidden patterns (on three nodes) and proving that among the 22 different classes (up to complement) that we find, 20 can actually be recognized in linear time. Beyond these results, we consider that this type of characterization is very useful from an algorithmic perspective, leads to a rich structure of classes, and generates many algorithmic and structural open questions worth investigating.},

Maximization of a $k$-submodular function requires an exponential number of value oracle queries, and approximation algorithms have been studied. For unconstrained $k$-submodular maximization, Iwata, Tanigawa, and Yoshida, [Improved approximation algorithms for $k$-submodular function maximization, in Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, SIAM, Philadelphia, 2016, pp. 404--413] gave a randomized $k/(2k-1)$-approximation algorithm for monotone functions and a randomized 1/2-approximation algorithm for nonmonotone functions. In this paper, we present improved randomized algorithms for nonmonotone functions. Our algorithm gives a $\frac{k^2+1}{2k^2+1}$-approximation for $k\geq 3$. We also give a randomized $\frac{\sqrt{17}-3}{2}$-approximation algorithm for $k=3$.
