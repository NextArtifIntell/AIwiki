Since for $p&gt;2$ both methods are only well-defined for a finite-dimensional approximation, we also study the difference between solving the finite-dimensional and the infinite-dimensional problems.

First, via smoothing the step function in the equation, we study its regularized problem, which meets the regularity requirement of the weak solution in deriving the convergence order for the discrete scheme. Then, based on the regularized approximation, we investigate the error estimate of the linearizing and decoupling temporal semidiscrete scheme. Moreover, by transforming the positivity-preserving FEM with the flux-corrected transport (FEM-FCT) algorithm from the algebraic system generated by the nonlinear equations to the stabilized Galerkin variational form, we deduce the error estimate and unconditional stability for the fully discrete scheme. Analyzing the error in this way, we can avoid the regularity requirement of the spatial approximation, which is difficult to derive because of the strong nonlinear stabilized terms introduced by the FCT technique. Finally, numerical examples are shown to confirm the correctness of the theoretical predictions.},

In recent years, various numerical schemes have been proposed in the literature to study this problem based on appropriate reversible constrained stochastic dynamics. In this paper we present and analyze a nonreversible generalization of the projection-based scheme developed by Zhang [ESAIM M2AN, 54 (2020), pp. 391--430]. This scheme consists of two steps: starting from a state on the submanifold, we first update the state using a nonreversible stochastic differential equation which takes the state away from the submanifold, and in the second step we project the state back onto the manifold using the long-time limit of an ordinary differential equation. We prove the consistency of this numerical scheme and provide quantitative error estimates for estimators based on finite-time running averages. Furthermore, we present theoretical analysis which shows that this scheme outperforms its reversible counterpart in terms of asymptotic variance. We demonstrate our findings on an illustrative test example.},

It is shown that numerical solutions of these schemes are uniformly bounded without any restriction on time step size. These uniform bounds enable us to carry out a rigorous error analysis for the schemes up to fifth-order in a unified form and derive global error estimates in $l^\infty(0,T;H^1)\cap l^2(0,T;H^2)$ in the two-dimensional case as well as local error estimates in $l^\infty(0,T;H^1)\cap l^2(0,T;H^2)$ in the three-dimensional case.

By constructing a Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator and introducing a transparent boundary condition, the scattering problem is reduced equivalently to a boundary value problem in a bounded domain. The discrete problem with the truncated DtN operator is solved by using the a posteriori error estimate based adaptive finite element method. The estimate takes account of both the finite element approximation error and the truncation error of the DtN operator, where the latter is shown to converge exponentially with respect to the truncation parameter. Moreover, the generalized Woodbury matrix identity is utilized to solve the resulting linear system efficiently.

However, previous proofs of shadowing methods wrongly assume that shadowing trajectories are representative. In contrast, the linear response formula is proved rigorously but is more difficult to compute. We prove that $v$ gives only a part, which is called the shadowing contribution, of the linear response; hence, the other part, the unstable contribution, is the systematic error of shadowing methods. For systems with a small ratio of unstable dimensions, with some further statistical assumptions, we show that the unstable contribution is small. We also briefly describe an algorithm for the unstable contribution, which is simpler to derive but less efficient than the fast linear response algorithm. Moreover, we prove the convergence of the nonintrusive shadowing algorithm, the fastest shadowing algorithm, to $v$ and to the shadowing contribution.},

  abstract     = {We propose a structure-preserving parametric finite element method (SP-PFEM) for discretizing the surface diffusion of a closed curve in two dimensions (2D) or a surface in three dimensions (3D). Here the “structure-preserving” refers to preserving the two fundamental geometric structures of the surface diffusion flow: (i) the conservation of the area/volume enclosed by the closed curve/surface and (ii) the decrease of the perimeter/total surface area of the curve/surface. For simplicity of notations, we begin with the surface diffusion of a closed curve in 2D and present a weak (variational) formulation of the governing equation. Then we discretize the variational formulation by using the backward Euler method in time and piecewise linear parametric finite elements in space with a proper approximation of the unit normal vector by using the information of the curves at the current and next time step. The constructed numerical method is shown to preserve the two geometric structures and also enjoys the good property of asymptotic equal mesh distribution. The proposed SP-PFEM is “weakly” implicit (or almost semi-implicit), and the nonlinear system at each time step can be solved very efficiently and accurately by Newton&#39;s iterative method. The SP-PFEM is then extended to discretize the surface diffusion of a closed surface in 3D. Extensive numerical results, including convergence tests, structure-preserving property, and asymptotic equal mesh distribution, are reported to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed SP-PFEM for simulating surface diffusion in 2D and 3D.},

To counter oscillations due to dominating convection we add a stabilization based on a bulk term in the form of a residual-based least squares stabilization of the vorticity equation supplemented by a penalty term on (certain components of) the gradient jump over the elements faces. Since the stabilization is based on the vorticity equation, it is independent of the pressure gradients, which makes it pressure-robust. Thus, we prove pressure-independent error estimates in the linearized case, known as Oseen&#39;s problem. In fact, we prove an $O(h^{k+\frac12})$ error estimate in the $L^2$-norm that is known to be the best that can be expected for this type of problem. Numerical examples are provided that, in addition to confirming the theoretical results, show that the present method compares favorably to the classical residual-based streamline upwind Petrov--Galerkin stabilization.},

  abstract     = {In most applications, functions are often given by sampled data. Approximation of functions from observed data is often needed. This has been widely studied in the literature when data is exact and the underlying function is smooth. However, the observed data is often contaminated with noise and the underlying function may be nonsmooth (e.g., contains singularities). To properly handle noisy data, any effective approximation scheme must contain a noise removal component. To well approximate nonsmooth functions, one needs to have a sparse approximation in, for example, the wavelet domain. Sparsity-based noise removal schemes have been proven effective empirically. This paper presents theoretical analysis of such noise removal schemes through the lens of function approximation. For a given sample size, approximation from uniform grid data and scattered data is investigated. The error of the approximation scheme, the bias of the denoising model, and the noise level of data are analyzed, respectively. In addition, when the amount of data is large enough, a new approximation scheme is proposed to grant sufficient reduction on the noise level and ensure asymptotic convergence.},

  abstract     = {We consider finite difference approximations of the second derivative, exemplified in Poisson&#39;s equation, the heat equation, and the wave equation. The finite difference operators satisfy a summation-by-parts (SBP) property, which mimics the integration-by-parts principle. Since the operators approximate the second derivative, they are singular by construction. When imposing boundary conditions weakly, these operators are modified using simultaneous approximation terms. The modification makes the discretization matrix nonsingular for most choices of boundary conditions. Recently, inverses of such matrices were derived. However, for problems with only Neumann boundary conditions, the modified matrices are still singular. For such matrices, we have derived an explicit expression for the Moore--Penrose inverse, which can be used for solving elliptic problems and some time-dependent problems. For this explicit expression to be valid, it is required that the modified matrix does not have more than one zero eigenvalue. This condition holds for the SBP operators with second and fourth order accurate interior stencil. For the sixth order accurate case, we have reconstructed the operator with a free parameter and show that there can be more than one zero eigenvalue. We have performed a detailed analysis on the free parameter to improve the properties of the second derivative SBP operator. We complement the derivations by numerical experiments to demonstrate the improvements.},

The new methods are designed for elliptic problems with highly heterogeneous coefficients. The methods are of the nonoverlapping type, and the subdomain interactions are obtained via the coarse space. The first method is the minimum energy Schwarz (MES) method. MES has the minimum energy for the coarse space with constant extension inside each subdomain. The condition number of the MES method is always smaller than in the AAS method. The second class of methods is the nonoverlapping spectral additive Schwarz (NOSAS) methods based on low-rank discrete energy harmonic extension in each subdomain. To achieve the low-rank, we solve a generalized eigenvalue problem in each subdomain. NOSAS methods have the minimum energy for a given rank of the coarse space. The condition number of the NOSAS methods does not depend on the coefficients. Additionally, the NOSAS methods have good parallelization properties. The size of the global problem is equal to the total number of eigenvalues chosen in each subdomain. For a class of coefficients, the number of eigenvalues is only related to the number of high-permeable islands that touch the subdomains&#39; interface.},

We develop a novel multiscale transform to decompose an arbitrary vector-valued function into multiple Gaussian wavepackets with various resolutions. We consider both periodic and Dirichlet boundary conditions, and we further derive various reflection rules to compute crucial multiscale Gaussian beam ingredients so as to enforce these boundary conditions. To improve efficiency and accuracy of multiscale beam propagation, we develop a new reinitialization strategy based on the stationary phase approximation so that we can sharpen each single beam. Such a reinitialization strategy is especially useful and necessary to treat the shear-wave reflection. Numerical examples in different setups demonstrate correctness and robustness of the new method. We also show numerically that the convergence rate of the proposed multiscale Gaussian beam method follows that of the classical Gaussian beam solution, i.e., $O\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega}}\big)$, where $\omega$ is the largest frequency in the underlying wave motion.},

Moreover, it also serves as a key component in several other numerical methods in which scattering computations involving arbitrarily shaped objects are accelerated by enclosing the objects in artificial cylinders. A fundamental question is that of how fast the approximation error of the MEM converges to zero as the truncation number goes to infinity. Despite the fact that the MEM was introduced in 1913, and has been in widespread usage as a numerical technique since as far back as 1955, a precise characterization of the asymptotic rate of convergence of the MEM has not been obtained. In this work, we provide a resolution to this issue. While our focus in this paper is on the Dirichlet scattering problem, this is merely for convenience and our results actually establish convergence rates that hold for all MEM formulations irrespective of the specific boundary conditions or boundary integral equation solution representation chosen.},

Addressing shortcomings flagged by Weideman [SIAM. J. Numer.

These approximations, moreover, provably achieve small relative errors throughout the upper complex half-plane where $w(z)$ is nonzero. Numerical tests suggest that this new method is competitive, in accuracy and computation times, with existing methods for computing $w(z)$ for complex $z$.},

The scheme preserves the formal gradient-flow or entropy structure and preserves the nonnegativity of the population densities. The key idea is to consider a suitable mean of the mobilities in such a way that a discrete chain rule is fulfilled and a discrete analogue of the entropy inequality holds. The existence of finite-volume solutions and the convergence of the scheme are proven. Furthermore, numerical experiments in one and two space dimensions for two and three species are presented.

  abstract     = {Dynamical low-rank algorithms are a class of numerical methods that compute low-rank approximations of dynamical systems. This is accomplished by projecting the dynamics onto a low-dimensional manifold and writing the solution directly in terms of the low-rank factors. The approach has been successfully applied to many types of differential equations. Recently, efficient dynamical low-rank algorithms have been proposed in [L. Einkemmer, A Low-Rank Algorithm for Weakly Compressible Flow, arXiv:1804.04561, 2018; L. Einkemmer and C. Lubich, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 40 (2018), pp. B1330--B1360] to treat kinetic equations, including the Vlasov--Poisson and the Boltzmann equation. There it was demonstrated that the methods are able to capture the low-rank structure of the solution and significantly reduce numerical cost, while often maintaining high accuracy. However, no numerical analysis is currently available. In this paper, we perform an error analysis for a dynamical low-rank algorithm applied to the multiscale linear Boltzmann equation (a classical model in kinetic theory) to showcase the validity of the application of dynamical low-rank algorithms to kinetic theory. The equation, in its parabolic regime, is known to be rank 1 theoretically, and we will prove that the scheme can dynamically and automatically capture this low-rank structure. This work thus serves as the first mathematical error analysis for a dynamical low-rank approximation applied to a kinetic problem.},

A priori $H^k$-regularity ($k\in{1,2}$) estimates for the solution of stochastic Maxwell equations are presented, which have not been reported before to the best of our knowledge. These $H^k$-regularities are vital to making the assumptions of the mean-square convergence analysis on the initial fields, the noise, and the medium coefficients, but not on the solution itself. The convergence order of the symplectic dG full discretization is shown to be $k/2$ in the temporal direction and $k-1/2$ in the spatial direction. Meanwhile we reveal the small noise asymptotic behaviors of the exact and numerical solutions via the large deviation principle, and show that the fully discrete method preserves the divergence relations in a weak sense.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a simple and rigorous Fourier-matching method to study transverse-magnetic-polarized electro-magnetic resonances by a perfectly conducting slab with a finite number of subwavelength slits of width $h\ll 1$. Since variable separation is applicable in the region outside the slits, by Fourier transforming its governing equation, a magnetic field can be represented in terms of its derivative on the aperture. Next, inside each slit where variable separation is still available, the field can be represented as a Fourier series in terms of a countable set of basis functions with unknown Fourier coefficients. Finally, by matching the two subdomain representations on the aperture, we establish a linear system of an infinite number of equations governing the countable Fourier coefficients; the unknowns are further rescaled to be in the standard $\ell^2$ space. By the asymptotic expansion of each entry of the coefficient matrix, we rigorously show that its certain principal submatrix is invertible so that the infinite-dimensional linear system can be reduced to a finite-dimensional linear system. Resonance frequencies are exactly those frequencies making the linear system rank-deficient. This in turn leads to an asymptotic formula of accuracy ${\cal O}(h^3\log h)$ for computing the resonance frequencies. We emphasize that the new formula is more accurate than all existing results and is the first formula for slits of number more than two to the best of our knowledge. Numerical experiments are carried out finally to validate the proposed formula and demonstrate its accuracy.},

For the general strong magnetic field case, the modulated Fourier expansions of the exact and the numerical solutions are constructed to obtain a favorable dependence of the error on the strength of the magnetic field.

Our established results include convergence rates of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. The framework introduced is based on the following ideas: to interpret the domain truncation as Galerkin approximation, to apply theory on holomorphic Fredholm operator eigenvalue approximation theory to a linear eigenvalue problem, to employ the notion of weak T-coercivity and T-compatible approximations, to construct a suitable T-operator as multiplication operator, to smooth its symbol, and to apply the discrete commutator technique.},

We consider failure events that are expressed in terms of a limit-state function, which depends on the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE). In many applications, the PDE cannot be solved analytically. We can only evaluate an approximation of the exact PDE solution. Therefore, the probability of rare events is estimated with respect to an approximation of the limit-state function. This leads to an approximation error in the estimate of the probability of rare events. Indeed, we prove an error bound for the approximation error of the probability of failure, which behaves like the discretization accuracy of the PDE multiplied by an approximation of the probability of failure, the first-order reliability method (FORM) estimate. This bound requires convexity of the failure domain. For nonconvex failure domains, we prove an error bound for the relative error of the FORM estimate. Hence, we derive a relationship between the required accuracy of the probability of rare events estimate and the PDE discretization level. This relationship can be used to guide practicable reliability analyses and, for instance, multilevel methods.},

  abstract     = {The integral fractional Laplacian of order $s \in (0,1)$ is a nonlocal operator. It is known that solutions to the Dirichlet problem involving such an operator exhibit an algebraic boundary singularity regardless of the domain regularity. This, in turn, deteriorates the global regularity of solutions and as a result the global convergence rate of the numerical solutions. For finite element discretizations, we derive local error estimates in the $H^s$-seminorm and show optimal convergence rates in the interior of the domain by only assuming meshes to be shape-regular. These estimates quantify the fact that the reduced approximation error is concentrated near the boundary of the domain. We illustrate our theoretical results with several numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {The time discrete scheme of characteristics type is especially effective for convection-dominated diffusion problems. The scheme has been used in various engineering areas with different approximations in spatial direction. The lowest-order mixed method is the most popular one for miscible flow in porous media. The method is based on a linear Lagrange approximation to the concentration and the zero-order Raviart--Thomas approximation to the pressure/velocity. However, the analysis for the lowest-order characteristics-mixed finite element method (FEM) has not been well done, although significant effort has been made in the last several decades. In all previous works, only first-order accuracy in spatial direction was proved under certain time-step and mesh size restrictions. The main purpose of this paper is to establish optimal error estimates, i.e., the second order in the $L^2$-norm for the concentration and the first order for the pressure/velocity, while the concentration is the more important physical component. For this purpose, an elliptic quasi-projection is introduced in our analysis to clean up the pollution of the numerical velocity through the nonlinear dispersion-diffusion tensor and the concentration-dependent viscosity. Moreover, the numerical pressure/velocity of the second-order accuracy can be obtained by re-solving the (elliptic) pressure equation at a given time level with a higher-order approximation. Numerical results presented in this paper confirm our theoretical analysis.},

A detailed and rigorous error analysis is presented for the discrete method. An important property in the analysis is that the local energy projector commutes with the divergence operator. With the help of a divergence-free interpolation operator onto a generalized Raviart--Thomas element space, a pressure-robust nonconforming virtual element method is developed by simply modifying the right-hand side of the previous discretization.

This allows us for the first time to overcome the severe restriction to periodic boundary conditions, to embed in the same framework parabolic and dispersive equations, and to handle nonlinearities that are not polynomial. In particular, as our new formalism does no longer require periodicity of the problem, one may couple the new time discretization technique not only with spectral methods, but rather with various spatial discretizations. We apply our general theory to the time discretization of various concrete PDEs, such as the nonlinear heat equation, the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, the complex Ginzburg--Landau equation, the half-wave and Klein--Gordon equations, set in $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $d \leq 3$, with suitable boundary conditions.},

Using a sample from a distribution, it approximates the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of associated Laplace--Beltrami operators. Theoretical bounds on the approximation error are, however, generally much weaker than the rates that are seen in practice. This paper uses new approaches to improve the error bounds in the model case where the distribution is supported on a hypertorus. For the data sampling (variance) component of the error we make spatially localized compact embedding estimates on certain Hardy spaces; we study the deterministic (bias) component as a perturbation of the Laplace--Beltrami operator&#39;s associated PDE and apply relevant spectral stability results. Using these approaches, we match long-standing pointwise error bounds for both the spectral data and the norm convergence of the operator discretization. We also introduce an alternative normalization for diffusion maps based on Sinkhorn weights. This normalization approximates a Langevin diffusion on the sample and yields a symmetric operator approximation. We prove that it has better convergence compared with the standard normalization on flat domains, and we present a highly efficient rigorous algorithm to compute the Sinkhorn weights.},

  abstract     = {Generalized plane waves (GPWs) were introduced to take advantage of Trefftz methods for problems modeled by variable coefficient equations. Despite the fact that GPWs do not satisfy the Trefftz property, i.e., they are not exact solutions to the governing equation, they instead satisfy a quasi-Trefftz property: They are only approximate solutions. They lead to high-order numerical methods, and this quasi-Trefftz property is critical for their numerical analysis. The present work introduces a new family of GPWs: amplitude-based. The motivation lies in the poor behavior of the phase-based GPW approximations in the preasymptotic regime, which will be tamed by avoiding high-degree polynomials within an exponential. The new functions&#39; construction and the study of their approximation properties are guided by the road map proposed in [L.-M. Imbert-Gérard and G. Sylvand, Numer. Math., to appear]. For the sake of clarity, the first focus is on the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation with spatially varying wave number. The extension to a range of operators allowing for anisotropy in the first- and second-order terms follows. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical study of the new quasi-Trefftz functions.},

The method has been used in many areas in the past several decades, while analysis has not been explored. In this paper, we present optimal error analysis of a backward Euler and a Crank--Nicolson semi-implicit projection finite difference scheme for the Landau--Lifshitz equation.

In the appropriate limit, this family of methods may be seen as a discretization of a family of second-order ODEs for which we construct (continuous) Lyapunov functions by means of the LMI framework. The continuous Lyapunov functions may alternatively be obtained by studying the limiting behavior of their discrete counterparts. Finally, we show that the majority of typical discretizations of the of the family of ODEs, such as the heavy ball method, do not possess Lyapunov functions with properties similar to those of the Lyapunov function constructed here for the Nesterov method.},

  abstract     = {Shape gradients have been widely used in numerical shape gradient descent algorithms for shape optimization. The two types of shape gradients, i.e., the distributed one and the boundary type, are equivalent at the continuous level but exhibit different numerical behaviors after finite element discretization. To be more specific, the boundary type shape gradient is more popular in practice due to its concise formulation and convenience in combining with shape optimization algorithms but has lower numerical accuracy. In this paper we provide a simple yet useful boundary correction for the normal derivatives of the state and adjoint equations, motivated by their continuous variational forms, to increase the accuracy and possible effectiveness of the boundary shape gradient in PDE-constrained shape optimization. We consider particularly the state equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and provide a preliminary error estimate for the correction. Numerical results show that the corrected boundary type shape gradient has comparable accuracy to that of the distributed one. Moreover, we give a theoretical explanation for the comparable numerical accuracy of the boundary type shape gradient with that of the distributed shape gradient for Neumann boundary value problems.},

Both algorithms are based on approximations of the theoretical solutions by neural networks, the latter being characterized by their architecture and a set of parameters. This allows the use of modern machine learning tools, and efficient implementations of stochastic gradient descent. The first algorithm is based on the idiosyncrasies of the ergodic optimal control problem. We provide a mathematical proof of the convergence of the approximation scheme, and we analyze rigorously the approximation by controlling the different sources of error. The second method is an adaptation of the deep Galerkin method to the system of partial differential equations issued from the optimality condition. We demonstrate the efficiency of these algorithms on several numerical examples, some of them being chosen to show that our algorithms succeed where existing ones failed. We also argue that both methods can easily be applied to problems in dimensions larger than what can be found in the existing literature. Finally, we illustrate the fact that, although the first algorithm is specifically designed for mean field control problems, the second one is more general and can also be applied to the partial differential equation systems arising in the theory of mean field games.},

From these rates, suitable strategies are devised for discretization of the occurring domains/variables and are first established for the Radon transform. In particular, discretizing the detector in the same magnitude as the image pixels (which is standard practice) might not be ideal and, in fact, pixels that are asymptotically smaller than detectors lead to convergence. Possible adjustments to limited-angle and sparse-angle Radon transforms are discussed, and similar convergence results are shown. In the same vein, convergence results are readily extended to a novel pixel-driven approach to the fanbeam transform. Numerical aspects of the discretization scheme are discussed, and it is shown in particular that with the correct discretization strategy, the typical high-frequency artifacts can be avoided.},

It is interesting to see that for boundary singularities, one may get faster convergence rate on the Jacobi or Gegenbauer projection as $(\alpha,\beta)$ and $\lambda$ increases. The larger values of parameters, the higher convergence rates can be achieved. In particular, the truncated error of Legendre projection has one half order higher than that of Chebyshev projection.

The minimizers may be nonunique in the primal variable but lead to a unique stress $\sigma \in H({div},\Omega;\mathbb{M})$. Examples include the $p$-Laplacian, an optimal design problem in topology optimization, and the convexified double-well problem. The approximation by hybrid high-order methods (HHO) utilizes a reconstruction of the gradients with piecewise Raviart--Thomas or Brezzi--Douglas--Marini finite elements without stabilization on a regular triangulation into simplices. The application of this HHO method to the class of degenerate convex minimization problems allows for a unique $H({div})$ conforming stress approximation $\sigma_h$. The main results are a priori and a posteriori error estimates for the stress error $\sigma-\sigma_h$ in Lebesgue norms and a computable lower energy bound.

For the rational case, our convergence analysis is based on an exactness result that is connected to work by Bernstein and Van Loan on rank-one updates of rational matrix functions. We demonstrate the usefulness of the derived error bounds for guiding the choice of poles in the rational Krylov method for the exponential function and Markov functions. Low-rank updates of the matrix sign function require additional attention; we develop and analyze a combination of our methods with a squaring trick for this purpose. A curious connection between such updates and existing rational Krylov subspace methods for Sylvester matrix equations is pointed out.},

Usually, the high order linear numerical schemes would generate spurious oscillations when the solution of the hyperbolic conservation laws contains discontinuities. The spurious oscillations may be harmful to the numerical simulation, as it not only generates some artificial structures not belonging to the problems, but also causes many overshoots and undershoots that make the numerical scheme less robust. To overcome this difficulty, in this paper we introduce a numerical damping term to control spurious oscillations based on the classic DG formulation. In comparison to the classic DG method, the proposed DG method still maintains many good properties, such as the extremely local data structure, conservation, $L^2$-boundedness, optimal error estimates, and superconvergence. We also provide some numerical examples to show the good performance of the proposed DG scheme and verify our theoretical results.},

The suboptimality in terms of the polynomial degree is fully explicit and grows at most algebraically. Our analysis does not require the existence of a $\mathcal{C}^1$-conforming piecewise polynomial space and is instead based on an elliptic reconstruction of the discrete solution to the $H^2$ space and a generalized Helmholtz decomposition of the error.

The exact sequence property implies that the discrete solution to the Stokes problem is pointwise divergence free and hence mass conserving. In addition, it is shown that, under these conditions, the pair ${V}^{h,k}_0(\Omega) \times Q_{0}^{h,k}(\Omega)$ satisfies the inf-sup condition for Stokes flow uniformly in both the mesh size $h$ and polynomial degree $k$. The main tool is the construction of a continuous right inverse of the divergence operator on the space $Q^{h,k}_{0}(\Omega)$ which is bounded uniformly in both $h$ and $k$. Finally, we compute the actual values of the inf-sup constant. In subsequent work, we establish optimal $hp$ approximation results for these spaces. In summary, this means that the pair ${V}_{0}^{h,k}(\Omega) \times Q_{0}^{h,k}(\Omega)$ (a) is pointwise mass conserving, (b) is uniformly inf-sup stable in both $h$ and $k$, and (c) gives optimal error estimates in both $h$ and $k$.

The method is closely related to the (generalized) Taylor--Hood pairing. In this case the general theory of saddle-point problems with penalty cannot exclude that the convergence speed for the rotation is limited by the lower rate expected for the displacement. However, in this paper, it is shown that the rotations are approximated at optimal order of accuracy.

Our numerical method uses second-order accurate reconstruction-based schemes for local conservation laws in conjunction with appropriate numerical integration. We show that the resulting method is total variation diminishing (TVD) and converges towards a weak solution. In fact, in contrast to local conservation laws, our second-order reconstruction-based method converges towards the unique entropy solution provided that the nonlocal interaction kernel satisfies a certain growth condition near zero. Furthermore, as the nonlocal horizon parameter in our method approaches zero we recover a well-known second-order method for local conservation laws. In addition, we answer several questions from the paper by Du, Huang, and LeFloch [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 55 (2017), pp. 2465--2489] concerning regularity of solutions. In particular, we prove that any discontinuity present in a weak solution must be stationary and that if the interaction kernel satisfies a certain growth condition, then weak solutions are unique. We present a series of numerical experiments in which we investigate the accuracy of our second-order scheme, demonstrate shock formation in the nonlocal pair-interaction model, and examine how the regularity of the solution depends on the choice of flux function.},

We derive existence and uniqueness results, first order optimality conditions, and regularity estimates for the optimal variables. To discretize the state equation we propose a fully discrete scheme that relies on an implicit finite difference discretization in time combined with a piecewise linear finite element discretization in space. We derive stability results and a novel $L^2(0,T;L^2(\Omega))$ a priori error estimate. On the basis of the aforementioned solution technique, we propose a fully discrete scheme for our optimal control problem that discretizes the control variable with piecewise constant functions, and we derive a priori error estimates for it. We illustrate the theory with one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {In this work we consider the dual-mixed variational formulation of the Poisson equation with a line source. The analysis and approximation of this problem is nonstandard, as the line source causes the solutions to be singular. We start by showing that this problem admits a solution in appropriately weighted Sobolev spaces. Next, we show that given some assumptions on the problem parameters, the solution admits a splitting into higher- and lower-regularity terms. The lower-regularity terms are here explicitly known and capture the solution singularities. The higher-regularity terms, meanwhile, are defined as the solution of an associated mixed Poisson equation. With the solution splitting in hand, we then define a singularity removal--based mixed finite element method in which only the higher-regularity terms are approximated numerically. This method yields a significant improvement in the convergence rate when compared to approximating the full solution. In particular, we show that the singularity removal--based method yields optimal convergence rates for lowest-order Raviart--Thomas and discontinuous Lagrange elements.},

In this regime, the solution highly oscillates in time with wavelength at $O({\varepsilon}^2)$. The splitting methods surprisingly show superresolution, i.e., the methods can capture the solution accurately even if the time step size $\tau$ is much larger than the sampled wavelength at $O({\varepsilon}^2)$. Similar to the linear case, $S_1$ and $S_2$ both exhibit $1/2$ order convergence uniformly with respect to ${\varepsilon}$. Moreover, if $\tau$ is nonresonant, i.e., $\tau$ is away from a certain region determined by ${\varepsilon}$, $S_1$ would yield an improved uniform first order $O(\tau)$ error bound, while $S_2$ would give improved uniform $3/2$ order convergence. Numerical results are reported to confirm these rigorous results. Furthermore, we note that superresolution is still valid for higher order splitting methods.},

The global convergence of the proposed algorithm naturally arises from the proof of the Lipschitz stability of the corresponding inverse problem for both sufficiently large observation time and boundary using global Carleman inequalities. The speed of propagation is supposed to be independent of time but varying in space with a trace and normal derivative known at the boundary and belonging to a certain admissible set that limits the speed fluctuations with respect to a given exterior point $x_0$. In order to recover the speed, we also require a single experiment with null initial velocity and initial deformation having some monotonicity properties in the direction of $x-x_0$. We perform numerical simulations in the discrete setting in order to illustrate and to validate the feasibility of the algorithm in both one and two dimensions in space. As proved theoretically, we verify that the numerical reconstruction is achieved for any admissible initial guess, even in the presence of small random disturbances on the measurements.},

Phys., 415 (2020), 109485], a family of high-order asymptotic preserving (AP) methods, termed IMEX-LDG methods, are designed to solve some linear kinetic transport equations, including the one-group transport equation in slab geometry and the telegraph equation, in a diffusive scaling. As the Knudsen number $\varepsilon$ goes to zero, the limiting schemes are implicit discretizations to the limiting diffusive equation. Both Fourier analysis and numerical experiments imply the methods are unconditionally stable in the diffusive regime when $\varepsilon\ll1$. In this paper, we develop an energy approach to establish the numerical stability of the IMEX1-LDG method, the subfamily of the methods that is first-order accurate in time and arbitrary order in space, for the model with general material properties. Our analysis is the first to simultaneously confirm unconditional stability when $\varepsilon\ll 1$ and the uniform stability property with respect to $\varepsilon$. To capture the unconditional stability, we propose a novel discrete energy and explore various stabilization mechanisms of the method and their relative contributions in different regimes. A general form of the weight function, introduced to obtain the unconditional stability for $\varepsilon\ll 1$, is also for the first time considered in such stability analysis. Based on uniform stability, a rigorous asymptotic analysis is then carried out to show the AP property.},

The crux for constructing such a numerical operator is to introduce a stabilization term, which is called a “numerical moment” and corresponds to the numerical viscosity term in the original Lax--Friedrichs scheme for first order PDEs. It is proved that the proposed Lax--Friedrichs-like scheme has a unique solution and is stable in both the $\ell^2$-norm and the $\ell^\infty$-norm.

A space decomposition as in FETI and BDCC induces an embarrassingly parallel preprocessing and leads to a final system of size independent of the coefficients. The resulting solution is in equilibrium, and all PDEs involved are elliptic. One of the problems in the pre-processing step is nonlocal but with exponentially decaying solutions, enabling a practical scheme where the basis functions have an extended, but still local, support. To make the method robust with respect to high-contrast coefficients, we enrich the space solution via local eigenvalue problems, obtaining an optimal a priori error estimate that mitigates the effect of having coefficients with different magnitudes. The technique developed is dimensional independent and easy to extend to other elliptic problems such as elasticity.},

We derive such a stable decomposition for this family of domains and analyze how the stability “constant&quot; depends on relevant geometric properties of the domain. For this, we introduce new descriptors that are used to formalize the geometry for the family of domains. We show how, for an increasing number of subdomains, the rate of convergence of the Schwarz method depends on specific local geometry descriptors and on one global geometry descriptor. The analysis also naturally provides lower bounds in terms of the descriptors for the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplace eigenvalue problem for this family of domains.},

  abstract     = {We consider in this work the convergence of the random batch method proposed in our previous work [Jin et al., J. Comput. Phys., 400(2020), 108877] for interacting particles to the case of disparate species and weights. We show that the strong error is of $O(\sqrt{\tau})$ while the weak error is of $O(\tau)$ where $\tau$ is the time step between two random divisions of batches. Both types of convergence are uniform in $N$, the number of particles. The proof of strong convergence follows closely the proof in [Jin et al., J. Comput. Phys., 400(2020), 108877] for indistinguishable particles, but there are still some differences: Since there is no exchangeability now, we have to use a certain weighted average of the errors; some refined auxiliary lemmas have to be proved compared with our previous work. To show that the weak convergence of empirical measure is uniform in $N$, certain sharp estimates for the derivatives of the backward equations have been used. The weak convergence analysis is also illustrating for the convergence of the Random Batch Method for $N$-body Liouville equations.},

Particular attention is on the nonlinearity and the piecewise Sobolev embeddings required in the resulting trilinear form in the weak formulation of the nonconforming discretization. The discrete reliability follows with a conforming companion for the discrete Morley functions from the medius analysis. The quasiorthogonality also relies on a novel piecewise $H^1$ a priori error estimate and a careful analysis of the nonlinearity.},

By duality, the related norm can be evaluated by means of the solution of an elliptic quasi-stationary boundary value problem. When eliminating the control, we end up with the reduced optimality system that is nothing but the variational formulation of the coupled forward-backward primal and adjoint equations. Using Babuška&#39;s theorem, we prove unique solvability in the continuous case. Furthermore, we establish the discrete inf-sup condition for any conforming space-time finite element discretization yielding quasi-optimal discretization error estimates. Various numerical examples confirm the theoretical findings. We emphasize that the energy regularization results in a more localized control with sharper contours for discontinuous target functions, which is demonstrated by a comparison with an $L^2$-regularization and with a sparse optimal control approach.},

The distributed strategy allows parallel computing for data processing and model selection. It reduces computational cost for each server while preserving the approximation capability compared to the filtered hyperinterpolation.

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider compressible single-phase flow problems in a porous medium containing a fracture. In the fracture, a nonlinear pressure-velocity relation is prescribed. Using a non-overlapping domain decomposition procedure, we reformulate the global problem into a nonlinear interface problem. We then introduce two new algorithms that are able to efficiently handle the nonlinearity and the coupling between the fracture and the matrix, both based on linearization by the so-called L-scheme. The first algorithm, named MoLDD, uses the L-scheme to resolve for the nonlinearity, requiring at each iteration to solve the dimensional coupling via a domain decomposition approach. The second algorithm, called ItLDD, uses a sequential approach in which the dimensional coupling is part of the linearization iterations. For both algorithms, the computations are reduced only to the fracture by precomputing, in an offline phase, a multiscale flux basis (the linear Robin-to-Neumann codimensional map), that represent the flux exchange between the fracture and the matrix. We present extensive theoretical findings X and in particular, t. The stability and the convergence of both schemes are obtained, where user-given parameters are optimized to minimize the number of iterations. Examples on two important fracture models are computed with the library PorePy and agree with the developed theory.},

We address mixed-dimensional PDEs on three-dimensional (3D) and one-dimensional (1D) domains, which gives rise to a 3D-1D coupled problem. Such a problem poses several challenges from the standpoint of existence of solutions and numerical approximation. For the coupling conditions across dimensions, we consider the combination of essential and natural conditions, which are basically the combination of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions. To ensure a meaningful formulation of such conditions, we use the Lagrange multiplier method suitably adapted to the mixed-dimensional case. The well-posedness of the resulting saddle-point problem is analyzed. Then, we address the numerical approximation of the problem in the framework of the finite element method. The discretization of the Lagrange multiplier space is the main challenge. Several options are proposed, analyzed, and compared, with the purpose of determining a good balance between the mathematical properties of the discrete problem and flexibility of implementation of the numerical scheme. The results are supported by evidence based on numerical experiments.},

We present a detailed stability analysis in the continuous and the discrete setting where the stream function $\psi$ and its approximation $\psi_h$ are elements of $H({curl})$ and the $H({curl})$-conforming Nédélec finite element space, respectively. We conclude with an error analysis revealing optimal convergence rates for the error of the discrete velocity $u_h = {curl}(\psi_h)$ measured in a discrete $H^1$-norm.

Traditionally they are applied to solve for the state given the dynamics (the forward problem), but here we consider their application for learning the dynamics given the state (the inverse problem). This repurposing of LMMs is largely motivated by growing interest in data-driven modeling of dynamics, but the behavior and analysis of LMMs for discovery turn out to be significantly different from the well-known, existing theory for the forward problem. Assuming a highly idealized setting of being given the exact state with a zero residual of the discrete dynamics, we establish for the first time a rigorous framework based on refined notions of consistency and stability to yield convergence using LMMs for discovery. When applying these concepts to three popular $M$-step LMMs, the Adams--Bashforth, Adams--Moulton, and backward differentiation formula schemes, the new theory suggests that Adams--Bashforth for $M$ ranging from 1 and 6, Adams--Moulton for $M=0$ and $M=1$, and backward differentiation formula for all positive $M$ are convergent, and, otherwise, the methods are not convergent in general.

  abstract     = {We propose and analyze an efficient, unconditionally stable, second order convergent, artificial compressibility Crank--Nicolson leap-frog (CNLFAC) method for numerically solving the Stokes--Darcy equations. The method decouples the fully coupled Stokes--Darcy system into two smaller subphysics problems, which reduces the size of the linear systems to be solved, at each time step, and allows parallel computing of the two subphysics problems. It also decouples the computation of the velocity and pressure in the free flow region. The pressure only needs to be updated at each time step without solving a Poisson equation, avoiding pressure errors in boundary layers due to imposing artificial boundary conditions. We prove that the method is unconditionally long time stable and second order convergent. We also propose an unconditionally stable ensemble algorithm based on the CNLFAC method. The ensemble algorithm results in a common coefficient matrix for all realizations and consequently allows the use of efficient direct or iterative solvers to reduce the computational cost. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the second order convergence and unconditional stability of the CNLFAC method. Moreover, the CNLFAC ensemble algorithm is demonstrated to reduce the computational time of a Crank--Nicolson leap-frog nonensemble algorithm by 95\% in our tests.},

The solution can be decomposed to a sum of two projections, one in the range of the system operator and the other in its null space. The range projection can be computed with a shift-and-invert Krylov subspace method. The other projection can be computed with the algebraic equations. Differing from the ordinary Arnoldi method, the orthogonality in the Krylov subspace is replaced with the semi-inner product induced by the positive semidefinite system operator. With proper adjustment, numerical ranges of the Krylov operator lie in the right half-plane, and we obtain theoretical convergence analysis for the modified Arnoldi algorithm in computing phi-functions. Last, simulations on RLC networks are demonstrated to validate the effectiveness of the Arnoldi algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) stabilized methods for the Navier--Stokes equations are considered and analyzed. We consider two cases: the case in which the snapshots are based on a non inf-sup stable method and the case in which the snapshots are based on an inf-sup stable method. For both cases we construct approximations to the velocity and the pressure. For the first case, we analyze a method in which the snapshots are based on a stabilized scheme with equal order polynomials for the velocity and the pressure with local projection stabilization (LPS) for the gradient of the velocity and the pressure. For the POD method we add the same kind of LPS stabilization for the gradient of the velocity and the pressure as the direct method, together with grad-div stabilization. In the second case, the snapshots are based on an inf-sup stable Galerkin method with grad-div stabilization and for the POD model we also apply grad-div stabilization. In this case, since the snapshots are discretely divergence-free, the pressure can be removed from the formulation of the POD approximation to the velocity. To approximate the pressure, needed in many engineering applications, we use a supremizer pressure recovery method. Error bounds with constants independent of inverse powers of the viscosity parameter are proved for both methods. Numerical experiments show the accuracy and performance of the schemes.},

A time integration method for tree tensor networks of prescribed tree rank is presented and analyzed. It extends the known projector-splitting integrators for dynamical low-rank approximation by matrices and rank-constrained Tucker tensors and is shown to inherit their favorable properties. The integrator is based on recursively applying the low-rank Tucker tensor integrator. In every time step, the integrator climbs up and down the tree: it uses a recursion that passes from the root to the leaves of the tree for the construction of initial value problems on subtree tensor networks using appropriate restrictions and prolongations, and another recursion that passes from the leaves to the root for the update of the factors in the tree tensor network. The integrator reproduces given time-dependent tree tensor networks of the specified tree rank exactly and is robust to the typical presence of small singular values in matricizations of the connection tensors, in contrast to standard integrators applied to the differential equations for the factors in the dynamical low-rank approximation by tree tensor networks.},

Furthermore, we establish the convergence of discrete solutions toward suitable weak solutions of the original model. This serves also as an additional pathway to establish existence of weak solutions. Furthermore, we present simulations underlining the practicality of the proposed scheme and investigate its experimental order of convergence.},

Kolmogorov&#39;s equation serves as a sufficiently rich, for our purposes, model problem for kinetic-type equations and is characterized by diffusion in one of the two (or three) spatial directions only. Nonetheless, its solution typically admits decay properties to some long-time equilibrium, depending on closure by suitable boundary/decay-at-infinity conditions. A key attribute of the proposed family of methods is that they also admit similar decay properties at the (semi)discrete level for very general families of triangulations. The method construction uses ideas by the general theory of hypocoercivity developed by Villani, along with a judicious choice of numerical flux functions. These developments turn out to be sufficient to imply that the proposed finite element methods admit a priori error bounds with constants independent of the final time, despite the Kolmogorov equation&#39;s degenerate diffusion nature. Thus, the new methods provably allow for robust error analysis for final times tending to infinity. The extension to three spatial dimensions is also briefly discussed.},

However, finding an optimal tension parameter is a very important and difficult problem, indeed a topic of active research. In this regard, this study introduces a practical approach to determine an optimal tension parameter by taking into account the relationship between the tension parameter and the accuracy of the exponential polynomial interpolation under the setting of the fifth-order WENO scheme. As a result, the proposed WENO scheme attains an improved order of accuracy (that is, sixth-order) better than other fifth-order WENO methods without loss of accuracy at critical points. A detailed analysis is provided to verify the improved convergence rate. Further, we present modified nonlinear weights based on an $L^1$-norm approach along with a new global smoothness indicator. The proposed nonlinear weights reduce numerical dissipation significantly, while attaining better resolution in smooth regions. Some experimental results for various benchmark test problems are presented to demonstrate the ability of the new scheme.},

  abstract     = {Reproducing kernel (RK) approximations are meshfree methods that construct shape functions from sets of scattered data. We present an asymptotically compatible (AC) RK collocation method for nonlocal diffusion models with Dirichlet boundary condition. The numerical scheme is shown to be convergent to both nonlocal diffusion and its corresponding local limit as nonlocal interaction vanishes. The analysis is carried out on a special family of rectilinear Cartesian grids for a linear RK method with designed kernel support. The key idea for the stability of the RK collocation scheme is to compare the collocation scheme with the standard Galerkin scheme, which is stable. In addition, assembling the stiffness matrix of the nonlocal problem requires costly computational resources because high-order Gaussian quadrature is necessary to evaluate the integral. We thus provide a remedy to the problem by introducing a quasi-discrete nonlocal diffusion operator for which no numerical quadrature is further needed after applying the RK collocation scheme. The quasi-discrete nonlocal diffusion operator combined with RK collocation is shown to be convergent to the correct local diffusion problem by taking the limits of nonlocal interaction and spatial resolution simultaneously. The theoretical results are then validated with numerical experiments. We additionally illustrate a connection between the proposed technique and an existing optimization based approach based on generalized moving least squares.},

We show that this phenomenon is captured by particular Lagrangian discretizations of the porous medium and the thin film equations, and we obtain sufficient criteria for the occurrence of waiting times that are consistent with the known ones for the original PDEs. For the spatially discrete solution, the waiting time phenomenon refers to a deviation of the edge of support from its original position by a quantity comparable to the mesh width, over a mesh-independent time interval. Our proof is based on estimates on the fluid velocity in Lagrangian coordinates. Combining weighted entropy estimates with an iteration technique à la Stampacchia leads to upper bounds on free boundary propagation. Numerical simulations show that the phenomenon is already clearly visible for relatively coarse discretizations.},

We propose the concept of asymptotical preservation of numerical methods for large deviations principles associated with the exact solutions of the general stochastic Hamiltonian systems. Considering that the linear stochastic oscillator is one of the typical stochastic Hamiltonian systems, we take it as the test equation in this paper to obtain precise results about the rate functions of large deviations principles for both exact and numerical solutions. Based on the Gärtner--Ellis theorem, we first study the large deviations principles of the mean position and the mean velocity for both the exact solution and its numerical approximations. Then, we prove that stochastic symplectic methods asymptotically preserve these two large deviations principles, but nonsymplectic ones do not. This indicates that stochastic symplectic methods are able to approximate well the exponential decay speed of the “hitting probability&quot; of the mean position and mean velocity of the stochastic oscillator. Finally, numerical experiments are performed to show the superiority of stochastic symplectic methods in computing the large deviations rate functions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result about applying the large deviations principle to reveal the superiority of stochastic symplectic methods compared with nonsymplectic ones in the existing literature.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we develop a staggered discontinuous Galerkin method for the Stokes and Darcy--Forchheimer problems coupled with the Beavers--Joseph--Saffman conditions. The method is defined by imposing staggered continuity for all the variables involved and the interface conditions are enforced by switching the roles of the variables met on the interface, which eliminate the hassle of introducing additional variables. This method can be flexibly applied to rough grids such as the highly distorted grids and the polygonal grids. In addition, the method allows nonmatching grids on the interface thanks to the special inclusion of the interface conditions, which is highly appreciated from a practical point of view. A new discrete trace inequality and a generalized Poincaré--Friedrichs inequality are proved, which enables us to prove the optimal convergence estimates under reasonable regularity assumptions. Finally, several numerical experiments are given to illustrate the performances of the proposed method, and the numerical results indicate that the proposed method is accurate and efficient, and in addition, it is a good candidate for practical applications.},
