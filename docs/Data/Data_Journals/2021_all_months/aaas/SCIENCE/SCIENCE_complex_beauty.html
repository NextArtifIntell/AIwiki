  abstract     = {Many studies have examined the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants on neutralizing antibody activity after they have become dominant strains. Here, we evaluate the consequences of further viral evolution. We demonstrate mechanisms through which the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) can tolerate large numbers of simultaneous antibody escape mutations and show that pseudotypes containing up to seven mutations, as opposed to the one to three found in previously studied variants of concern, are more resistant to neutralization by therapeutic antibodies and serum from vaccine recipients. We identify an antibody that binds the RBD core to neutralize pseudotypes for all tested variants but show that the RBD can acquire an N-linked glycan to escape neutralization. Our findings portend continued emergence of escape variants as SARS-CoV-2 adapts to humans.},

Visualizing atomic-scale electronic wave functions with scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), we resolved microscopic signatures of valley ordering in QHFM phases and spectral features of fractional quantum Hall phases of graphene. At charge neutrality, we observed a field-tuned continuous quantum phase transition from a valley-polarized state to an intervalley coherent state, with a Kekulé distortion of its electronic density. Mapping the valley texture extracted from STS measurements of the Kekulé phase, we could visualize valley skyrmion excitations localized near charged defects. Our techniques can be applied to examine valley-ordered phases and their topological excitations in a wide range of materials.},

The most studied putative non-abelian state is the spin-polarized filling factor (ν) = 5/2, which permits different topological orders that can be abelian or non-abelian. We developed a method that interfaces the studied quantum state with another state and used it to identify the topological order of ν = 5/2 state. The interface between two half-planes, one hosting the ν = 5/2 state and the other an integer ν = 3 state, supports a fractional ν = 1/2 charge mode and a neutral Majorana mode. The counterpropagating chirality of the Majorana mode, probed by measuring partition noise, is consistent with the particle-hole Pfaffian (PH-Pf) topological order and rules out the anti-Pfaffian order.},

Polymerase inhibition within in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase assays established for RSV and SARS-CoV-2 revealed transcriptional stalling after incorporation. Once-daily oral treatment was highly efficacious at 5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) in RSV-infected mice or 20 mg/kg in ferrets infected with different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, initiated 24 or 12 hours after infection, respectively.

We describe the structure of prefusion Gc bound to the antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of two neutralizing antibodies that display synergy when combined, as well as the structure of trimeric, postfusion Gc. The structures show the two Fabs acting in concert to block membrane fusion, with one targeting the fusion loops and the other blocking Gc trimer formation.

We used single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of human GPR158 alone and bound to an RGS signaling complex. The structures reveal a homodimeric organization stabilized by a pair of phospholipids and the presence of an extracellular Cache domain, an unusual ligand-binding domain in GPCRs. We further demonstrate the structural basis of GPR158 coupling to RGS7-Gβ5. Together, these results provide insights into the unusual biology of orphan receptors and the formation of GPCR-RGS complexes.},

Spines are biochemical compartments but might also electrically modify synaptic potentials. Using two-photon microscopy and a genetically encoded voltage indicator, we measured membrane potentials in spines and dendrites from pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex of mice during spontaneous activity and sensory stimulation. Spines and dendrites were depolarized together during action potentials, but, during subthreshold and resting potentials, spines often experienced different voltages than parent dendrites, even activating independently. Spine voltages remained compartmentalized after two-photon optogenetic activation of individual spine heads. We conclude that spines are elementary voltage compartments. The regulation of voltage compartmentalization could be important for synaptic function and plasticity, dendritic integration, and disease states.},

The substrate-bound U2 snRNP shows that SF3B6 stabilizes the BS:U2 snRNA duplex, which could aid binding of introns with poor sequence complementarity. ATP-dependent remodeling uncoupled from substrate binding captures U2 snRNA in a conformation that competes with BS recognition, providing a selection mechanism based on branch helix stability.},

  abstract     = {In the coronavirus efficacy (COVE) phase 3 clinical trial, vaccine recipients were assessed for neutralizing and binding antibodies as correlates of risk for COVID-19 disease and as correlates of protection. These immune markers were measured at the time of second vaccination and 4 weeks later, with values reported in standardized World Health Organization international units. All markers were inversely associated with COVID-19 risk and directly associated with vaccine efficacy. Vaccine recipients with postvaccination 50\% neutralization titers 10, 100, and 1000 had estimated vaccine efficacies of 78\% (95\% confidence interval, 54 to 89\%), 91\% (87 to 94\%), and 96\% (94 to 98\%), respectively. These results help define immune marker correlates of protection and may guide approval decisions for messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines and other COVID-19 vaccines.},

Here, we report that the clotting factor fibrin is a critical regulator of neutrophil function at the oral mucosal barrier. We demonstrate that commensal microbiota trigger extravascular fibrin deposition in the oral mucosa. Fibrin engages neutrophils through the α M β 2 integrin receptor and activates effector functions, including the production of reactive oxygen species and neutrophil extracellular trap formation. These immune-protective neutrophil functions become tissue damaging in the context of impaired plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis in mice and humans. Concordantly, genetic polymorphisms in PLG , encoding plasminogen, are associated with common forms of periodontal disease. Thus, fibrin is a critical regulator of neutrophil effector function, and fibrin-neutrophil engagement may be a pathogenic instigator for a prevalent mucosal disease.},

High primary production of modern oceans is considered a prerequisite for the emergence of cetacean giants, but that condition cannot explain gigantism in Triassic ichthyosaurs. We describe the new giant ichthyosaur Cymbospondylus youngorum sp. nov. with a 2-meter-long skull from the Middle Triassic Fossil Hill Fauna of Nevada, USA, underscoring rapid size evolution despite the absence of many modern primary producers. Surprisingly, the Fossil Hill Fauna rivaled the composition of modern marine mammal faunas in terms of size range, and energy-flux models suggest that Middle Triassic marine food webs were able to support several large-bodied ichthyosaurs at high trophic levels, shortly after ichthyosaur origins.},

How do human subsistence strategies accommodate our expanded energy budgets? We found that relative to other great apes, human hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers spend more energy but less time on subsistence, acquire substantially more energy per hour, and achieve similar energy efficiencies. These findings revise our understanding of human energetic evolution by indicating that humans afford expanded energy budgets primarily by increasing rates of energy acquisition, not through energy-saving adaptations such as economical bipedalism or sophisticated tool use that decrease subsistence costs and improve the energetic efficiency of subsistence. We argue that the time saved by human subsistence strategies provides more leisure time for social interaction and social learning in central-place locations and would have been critical for cumulative cultural evolution.},

Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics to reconstruct the protophloem developmental trajectory from the birth of cell progenitors to terminal differentiation in the Arabidopsis thaliana root. PHLOEM EARLY DNA-BINDING-WITH-ONE-FINGER (PEAR) transcription factors mediate lineage bifurcation by activating guanosine triphosphatase signaling and prime a transcriptional differentiation program. This program is initially repressed by a meristem-wide gradient of PLETHORA transcription factors. Only the dissipation of PLETHORA gradient permits activation of the differentiation program that involves mutual inhibition of early versus late meristem regulators. Thus, for phloem development, broad maturation gradients interface with cell-type-specific transcriptional regulators to stage cellular differentiation.},

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (SC2-VLPs) can package and deliver exogenous transcripts, enabling analysis of mutations within all structural proteins and at multiple steps in the viral life cycle. In SC2-VLPs, four nucleocapsid (N) mutations found universally in more-transmissible variants independently increased messenger RNA delivery and expression ~10-fold, and in a reverse genetics model, the serine-202→arginine (S202R) and arginine-203→methionine (R203M) mutations each produced &gt;50 times as much virus. SC2-VLPs provide a platform for rapid testing of viral variants outside of a biosafety level 3 setting and demonstrate N mutations and particle assembly to be mechanisms that could explain the increased spread of variants, including B.1.617.2 (Delta, which contains the R203M mutation).},

The efficiency of angular momentum and energy transfer between spins and the lattice imposes fundamental speed limits on the ability to control spins in spintronics, magnonics, and magnetic data storage. We report on an efficient nonlinear mechanism of spin-lattice coupling driven by terahertz light pulses. A nearly single-cycle terahertz pulse resonantly interacts with a coherent magnonic state in the antiferromagnet cobalt difluoride (CoF 2 ) and excites the Raman-active terahertz phonon. The results reveal the distinctive functionality of antiferromagnets that allows ultrafast spin-lattice coupling using light.},

  abstract     = {Efforts to stabilize photoactive formamidinium (FA)–based halide perovskites for perovskite photovoltaics have focused on the growth of cubic formamidinium lead iodide (α-FAPbI 3 ) phases by empirically alloying with cesium, methylammonium (MA) cations, or both. We show that such stabilized FA-rich perovskites are noncubic and exhibit ~2° octahedral tilting at room temperature. This tilting, resolvable only with the use of local nanostructure characterization techniques, imparts phase stability by frustrating transitions from photoactive to hexagonal phases. Although the bulk phase appears stable when examined macroscopically, heterogeneous cation distributions allow microscopically unstable regions to form; we found that these transitioned to hexagonal polytypes, leading to local trap-assisted performance losses and photoinstabilities. Using surface-bound ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, we engineered an octahedral tilt into pure α-FAPbI 3 thin films without any cation alloying. The templated photoactive FAPbI 3 film was extremely stable against thermal, environmental, and light stressors.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the worrying increase in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, there is a need to electrify fossil-fuel–powered chemical processes such as the Haber-Bosch ammonia synthesis. Lithium-mediated electrochemical nitrogen reduction has shown preliminary promise but still lacks sufficient faradaic efficiency and ammonia formation rate to be industrially relevant. Here, we show that oxygen, previously believed to hinder the reaction, actually greatly improves the faradaic efficiency and stability of the lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction when added to the reaction atmosphere in small amounts. With this counterintuitive discovery, we reach record high faradaic efficiencies of up to 78.0 ± 1.3\% at 0.6 to 0.8 mole\% oxygen in 20 bar of nitrogen. Experimental x-ray analysis and theoretical microkinetic modeling shed light on the underlying mechanism.},

  abstract     = {DNA methylation affects gene expression and maintains genome integrity. The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), together with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RDR2, produces double-stranded small interfering RNA precursors essential for establishing and maintaining DNA methylation in plants. We determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of the Pol IV–RDR2 holoenzyme and the backtracked transcription elongation complex. These structures reveal that Pol IV and RDR2 form a complex with their active sites connected by an interpolymerase channel, through which the Pol IV–generated transcript is handed over to the RDR2 active site after being backtracked, where it is used as the template for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) synthesis. Our results describe a ‘backtracking-triggered RNA channeling’ mechanism underlying dsRNA synthesis and also shed light on the evolutionary trajectory of eukaryotic RNA polymerases.},

During June and July 2021, we observed sustained exponential growth with an average doubling time of 25 days, driven by complete replacement of the Alpha variant by Delta and by high prevalence at younger, less-vaccinated ages. Prevalence among unvaccinated people [1.21\% (95\% credible interval 1.03\%, 1.41\%)] was three times that among double-vaccinated people [0.40\% (95\% credible interval 0.34\%, 0.48\%)]. However, after adjusting for age and other variables, vaccine effectiveness for double-vaccinated people was estimated at between ~50\% and ~60\% during this period in England. Increased social mixing in the presence of Delta had the potential to generate sustained growth in infections, even at high levels of vaccination.},

We used Giraffe to genotype 167,000 structural variants, discovered in long-read studies, in 5202 diverse human genomes that were sequenced using short reads.

We investigated how drought affects carbon and water fluxes as well as soil-plant-atmosphere interactions by tracing 13 CO 2 and deep water 2 H 2 O label pulses and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in an enclosed experimental rainforest. Ecosystem dynamics were driven by different plant functional group responses to drought. Drought-sensitive canopy trees dominated total fluxes but also exhibited the strongest response to topsoil drying. Although all canopy-forming trees had access to deep water, these reserves were spared until late in the drought. Belowground carbon transport was slowed, yet allocation of fresh carbon to VOCs remained high. Atmospheric VOC composition reflected increasing stress responses and dynamic soil-plant-atmosphere interactions, potentially affecting atmospheric chemistry and climate feedbacks. These interactions and distinct functional group strategies thus modulate drought impacts and ecosystem susceptibility to climate change.},

Reading the ion current signal through the nanopore enabled discrimination of single–amino acid substitutions in single reads. Molecular dynamics simulations showed these signals to result from size exclusion and pore binding. We also demonstrate the capability to “rewind” peptide reads, obtaining numerous independent reads of the same molecule, yielding an error rate of &lt;10 −6 in single amino acid variant identification.

A lot of focus has been on maximizing the radiative cooling power of roof coating in the hot daytime using static, cooling-optimized material properties. However, the resultant overcooling in cold night or winter times exacerbates the heating cost, especially in climates where heating dominates energy consumption. We approached thermal regulation from an all-season perspective by developing a mechanically flexible coating that adapts its thermal emittance to different ambient temperatures. The fabricated temperature-adaptive radiative coating (TARC) optimally absorbs the solar energy and automatically switches thermal emittance from 0.20 for ambient temperatures lower than 15°C to 0.90 for temperatures above 30°C, driven by a photonically amplified metal-insulator transition. Simulations show that this system outperforms existing roof coatings for energy saving in most climates, especially those with substantial seasonal variations.},

An empirical understanding of the biological stresses associated with these migrations will play a key role in the development of social, political, and medical strategies for alleviating adverse effects and risk of death. We model physiological stress associated with undocumented migration across a commonly traversed section of the southern border of the United States and find that locations of migrant death are disproportionately clustered within regions of greatest predicted physiological stress (evaporative water loss). Minimum values of estimated evaporative water loss were sufficient to cause severe dehydration and associated proximate causes of mortality. Integration of future climate predictions into models increased predicted physiological costs of migration by up to 34.1\% over the next 30 years.},

Robust locomotion control was specifically identified in Tac1 (substance P)–expressing (SuM Tac1+ ) neurons, the activation of which selectively controlled the activity of speed-modulated hippocampal neurons. By contrast, Tac1 -deficient (SuM Tac1− ) cells weakly regulated locomotion but potently controlled the spike timing of hippocampal neurons and were sufficient to entrain local network oscillations.

Our images indicate helical stripe domains, in contrast to bulk, and associated helimagnetic domain walls. In combination with micromagnetic modeling, we can deduce the three-dimensional (3D) orientation of the helical wave vectors, and we find that three helical domains can meet in two distinct ways to produce either a “target-like” or a “π-like” topological spin texture.

Understanding this process, known as quantum scrambling, is key to resolving several open questions in physics. Here, by measuring the time-dependent evolution and fluctuation of out-of-time-order correlators, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of quantum scrambling on a 53-qubit quantum processor. We engineer quantum circuits that distinguish operator spreading and operator entanglement and experimentally observe their respective signatures. We show that whereas operator spreading is captured by an efficient classical model, operator entanglement in idealized circuits requires exponentially scaled computational resources to simulate. These results open the path to studying complex and practically relevant physical observables with near-term quantum processors.},

  abstract     = {The discrete time crystal (DTC) is a nonequilibrium phase of matter that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. Disorder-induced many-body localization can stabilize the DTC phase by breaking ergodicity and preventing thermalization. Here, we observe the hallmark signatures of the many-body–localized DTC using a quantum simulation platform based on individually controllable carbon-13 nuclear spins in diamond. We demonstrate long-lived period-doubled oscillations and confirm that they are robust for generic initial states, thus showing the characteristic time-crystalline order across the many-body spectrum. Our results are consistent with the realization of an out-of-equilibrium Floquet phase of matter and introduce a programmable quantum simulator based on solid-state spins for exploring many-body physics.},

  abstract     = {Spin quantum beats prove the quantum nature of reactions involving radical pairs, the key species of spin chemistry. However, such quantum beats remain hidden to transient absorption–based optical observation because the spin hardly affects the absorption properties of the radical pairs. We succeed in demonstrating such quantum beats in the photoinduced charge-separated state (CSS) of an electron donor–acceptor dyad by using two laser pulses—one for pumping the sample and another one, with variable delay, for further exciting the CSS to a higher electronic state, wherein ultrafast recombination to distinct, optically detectable products of singlet or triplet multiplicity occurs. This represents a spin quantum measurement of the spin state of the CSS at the time instant of the second (push) pulse.},

Zinc-based Calgary Framework 20 (CALF-20) physisorbs CO 2 with high capacity but is also selective over water. Competitive separations on structured CALF-20 show not just preferential CO 2 physisorption below 40\% relative humidity but also suppression of water sorption by CO 2 , which was corroborated by computational modeling. CALF-20 has a low enthalpic regeneration penalty and shows durability to steam (&gt;450,000 cycles) and wet acid gases. It can be prepared in one step, formed as composite materials, and its synthesis can be scaled to multikilogram batches.},

We use a combination of RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold to screen through paired multiple sequence alignments for 8.3 million pairs of yeast proteins, identify 1505 likely to interact, and build structure models for 106 previously unidentified assemblies and 806 that have not been structurally characterized.

Alteration of ESCRT function can lead to cataract, but the underlying mechanism and its relation to cytokinesis are unclear. We found a lens-specific cytokinetic process that required PI3K-C2α (phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 2α), its lipid product PI(3,4)P 2 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate), and the PI(3,4)P 2 –binding ESCRT-II subunit VPS36 (vacuolar protein-sorting-associated protein 36). Loss of each of these components led to impaired cytokinesis, triggering premature senescence in the lens of fish, mice, and humans. Thus, an evolutionarily conserved pathway underlies the cell type–specific control of cytokinesis that helps to prevent early onset cataract by protecting from senescence.},

In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the emergence of cell diversity in the human ganglionic eminences, the transitory structures of the human fetal brain where striatal and cortical GABAergic neurons are generated. We identified regional and temporal diversity among progenitor cells underlying the generation of a variety of projection neurons and interneurons. We found that these cells are specified within the human ganglionic eminences by transcriptional programs similar to those previously identified in rodents. Our findings reveal an evolutionarily conserved regulatory logic controlling the specification, migration, and differentiation of GABAergic neurons in the human telencephalon.},

Variations in NPC diameter have been reported, but the physiological circumstances and the molecular details remain unknown. Here, we combined cryo–electron tomography with integrative structural modeling to capture a molecular movie of the respective large-scale conformational changes in cellulo. Although NPCs of exponentially growing cells adopted a dilated conformation, they reversibly constricted upon cellular energy depletion or conditions of hypertonic osmotic stress. Our data point to a model where the nuclear envelope membrane tension is linked to the conformation of the NPC.},

However, the singular orbital magnetism of undoped graphene, a fundamental signature of the characteristic Berry phase of graphene’s electronic wave functions, has been challenging to measure in a single flake. Using a highly sensitive giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensor, we have measured the gate voltage–dependent magnetization of a single graphene monolayer encapsulated between boron nitride crystals. The signal exhibits a diamagnetic peak at the Dirac point whose magnetic field and temperature dependences agree with long-standing theoretical predictions. Our measurements offer a means to monitor Berry phase singularities and explore correlated states generated by the combined effects of Coulomb interactions, strain, or moiré potentials.},

The selector switches are mostly amorphous-chalcogenide Ovonic threshold switches (OTSs), operating with a nonlinear current response above a threshold voltage in the amorphous state. However, they currently suffer from the chemical complexity introduced by the quaternary or even more diverse chalcogenide compositions used. We present a single-element tellurium (Te) volatile switch with a large (≥11 megaamperes per square centimeter) drive current density, ~10 3 ON/OFF current ratio, and faster than 20 nanosecond switching speed. The low OFF current arises from the existence of a ~0.95–electron volt Schottky barrier at the Te–electrode interface, whereas a transient, voltage pulse–induced crystal-liquid melting transition of the pure Te leads to a high ON current. Our discovery of a single-element electrical switch may help realize denser memory chips.},

  abstract     = {Density functional theory describes matter at the quantum level, but all popular approximations suffer from systematic errors that arise from the violation of mathematical properties of the exact functional. We overcame this fundamental limitation by training a neural network on molecular data and on fictitious systems with fractional charge and spin. The resulting functional, DM21 (DeepMind 21), correctly describes typical examples of artificial charge delocalization and strong correlation and performs better than traditional functionals on thorough benchmarks for main-group atoms and molecules. DM21 accurately models complex systems such as hydrogen chains, charged DNA base pairs, and diradical transition states. More crucially for the field, because our methodology relies on data and constraints, which are continually improving, it represents a viable pathway toward the exact universal functional.},

  abstract     = {A sufficiently large supercurrent can close the energy gap in a superconductor and create gapless quasiparticles through the Doppler shift of quasiparticle energy caused by finite Cooper pair momentum. In this gapless superconducting state, zero-energy quasiparticles reside on a segment of the normal-state Fermi surface, whereas the remaining Fermi surface is still gapped. We use quasiparticle interference to image the field-controlled Fermi surface of bismuth telluride (Bi 2 Te 3 ) thin films under proximity effect from the superconductor niobium diselenide (NbSe 2 ). A small applied in-plane magnetic field induces a screening supercurrent, which leads to finite-momentum pairing on the topological surface states of Bi 2 Te 3 . We identify distinct interference patterns that indicate a gapless superconducting state with a segmented Fermi surface. Our results reveal the strong impact of finite Cooper pair momentum on the quasiparticle spectrum.},

  abstract     = {The sheathing leaf found in grasses and other monocots is an evolutionary innovation, yet its origin has been a subject of long-standing debate. Here, we revisit the problem in the light of developmental genetics and computational modeling. We show that the sheathing leaf likely arose through WOX- gene-dependent extension of a primordial zone straddling concentric domains around the shoot apex. Patterned growth within this zone, oriented by two polarity fields, accounts for wild-type, mutant and mosaic grass leaf development, whereas zone contraction and growth remodeling accounts for eudicot leaf development. In contrast to the prevailing view, our results suggest that the sheath derives from petiole, whereas the blade derives from the lamina of the eudicot leaf, consistent with homologies proposed in the 19th century.},

  abstract     = {Tropical forests disappear rapidly because of deforestation, yet they have the potential to regrow naturally on abandoned lands. We analyze how 12 forest attributes recover during secondary succession and how their recovery is interrelated using 77 sites across the tropics. Tropical forests are highly resilient to low-intensity land use; after 20 years, forest attributes attain 78\% (33 to 100\%) of their old-growth values. Recovery to 90\% of old-growth values is fastest for soil (12 decades). Network analysis shows three independent clusters of attribute recovery, related to structure, species diversity, and species composition. Secondary forests should be embraced as a low-cost, natural solution for ecosystem restoration, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation.},

However, both the hydrophobic–water interfacial molecular structure and the origin of the negative zeta potential of hydrophobic droplets in water are heavily contested. We report polarimetric vibrational sum-frequency scattering of the O–D and C-H stretch modes of 200-nanometer hexadecane oil droplets dispersed in water. An unusually broad spectral distribution (2550 to 2750 per centimeter) of interfacial water molecules that were not hydrogen bonded to other water molecules was observed, as well as a blue shift in the vibrational frequency of the interfacial hexadecane C-H stretch modes. Oil and water frequency shifts correlated with the negative electrostatic charge. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the unexpected strong charge-transfer interactions arose from interfacial C–H∙∙∙O hydrogen bonds.},

Here, we report a Sabatier principle of metal-support interaction for stabilizing metal nanocatalysts against sintering based on the kinetic simulations of 323 metal-support pairs using scaling relations from 1252 energetics data. Too strong of an interaction is shown to trigger Ostwald ripening, whereas too weak of an interaction stimulates particle migration and coalescence. High-throughput screening of supports enables the sintering resistance of nanocatalysts to reach the Tammann temperature on homogeneous supports and far beyond it on heteroenergetic supports. This theory, which is substantiated by first-principles neural network molecular dynamics simulations and experiments, paves the way for the design of ultrastable nanocatalysts.},

We report the structure, function, and antigenicity of its full-length spike (S) trimer as well as those of the Gamma and Kappa variants, and compare their characteristics with the G614, Alpha, and Beta variants. Delta S can fuse membranes more efficiently at low levels of cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and its pseudotyped viruses infect target cells substantially faster than the other five variants, possibly accounting for its heightened transmissibility. Each variant shows different rearrangement of the antigenic surface of the amino-terminal domain of the S protein but only makes produces changes in the receptor binding domain (RBD), making the RBD a better target for therapeutic antibodies.},

After boost, animals had increased neutralizing antibody responses across all VOCs, which was sustained for at least 8 weeks after boost. Nine weeks after boost, animals were challenged with the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant. Viral replication was low to undetectable in bronchoalveolar lavage and significantly reduced in nasal swabs in all boosted animals, suggesting that booster vaccinations may be required to sustain immunity and protection.},

In this study, we longitudinally profiled vaccine responses in SARS-CoV-2–naïve and –recovered individuals for 6 months after vaccination. Antibodies declined from peak levels but remained detectable in most subjects at 6 months. By contrast, mRNA vaccines generated functional memory B cells that increased from 3 to 6 months postvaccination, with the majority of these cells cross-binding the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants. mRNA vaccination further induced antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and early CD4 + T cell responses correlated with long-term humoral immunity. Recall responses to vaccination in individuals with preexisting immunity primarily increased antibody levels without substantially altering antibody decay rates. Together, these findings demonstrate robust cellular immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants for at least 6 months after mRNA vaccination.},

Its recapitulation in vitro may facilitate derivation of tissues and organs with in vivo–like complexity. Proper understanding of the primitive streak and what it entails in human development is key to achieving such research objectives. Here we provide an overview of the primitive streak and conclude that this structure is neither conserved nor necessary for gastrulation or early lineage diversification. We offer a model in which the primitive streak is viewed as part of a morphologically diverse yet molecularly conserved process of spatial coordinate acquisition. We predict that recapitulation of the primitive streak is dispensable for development in vitro.},

We report two classes of pyridine-pyridone ligands that enable divergent dehydrogenation reactions through palladium-catalyzed β-methylene C–H activation of carboxylic acids, leading to the direct syntheses of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids or γ-alkylidene butenolides. The directed nature of this pair of reactions allows chemoselective dehydrogenation of carboxylic acids in the presence of other enolizable functionalities such as ketones, providing chemoselectivity that is not possible by means of existing carbonyl desaturation protocols. Product inhibition is overcome through ligand-promoted preferential activation of C(sp 3 )–H bonds rather than C(sp 2 )–H bonds or a sequence of dehydrogenation and vinyl C–H alkynylation. The dehydrogenation reaction is compatible with molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant.},

In this study, we constrained Southern Ocean air-sea CO 2 exchange by relating fluxes to horizontal and vertical CO 2 gradients in atmospheric transport models and applying atmospheric observations of these gradients to estimate fluxes. Aircraft-based measurements of the vertical atmospheric CO 2 gradient provide robust flux constraints. We found an annual mean flux of –0.53 ± 0.23 petagrams of carbon per year (net uptake) south of 45°S during the period 2009–2018. This is consistent with the mean of atmospheric inversion estimates and surface-ocean partial pressure of CO 2 ( P co 2 )–based products, but our data indicate stronger annual mean uptake than suggested by recent interpretations of profiling float observations.},

We converted approximately 10-micrometer-wavelength incoming light to visible light by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) in doubly resonant antennas that enhanced upconversion by more than 10 10 . We showed 140\% amplification of the SERS anti-Stokes emission when an MIR pump was tuned to a molecular vibrational frequency, obtaining lowest detectable powers of 1 to 10 microwatts per square micrometer at room temperature. These results have potential for low-cost and large-scale infrared detectors and spectroscopic techniques.},

  abstract     = {Coherent upconversion of terahertz and mid-infrared signals into visible light opens new horizons for spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing but represents a challenge for conventional nonlinear optics. Here, we used a plasmonic nanocavity hosting a few hundred molecules to demonstrate optomechanical transduction of submicrowatt continuous-wave signals from the mid-infrared (32 terahertz) onto the visible domain at ambient conditions. The incoming field resonantly drives a collective molecular vibration, which imprints a coherent modulation on a visible pump laser and results in upconverted Raman sidebands with subnatural linewidth. Our dual-band nanocavity offers an estimated 13 orders of magnitude enhancement in upconversion efficiency per molecule. Our results demonstrate that molecular cavity optomechanics is a flexible paradigm for frequency conversion leveraging tailorable molecular and plasmonic properties.},

Surprisingly, however, this radical substitution manifold has not been generally deployed as a design element in synthetic C–C bond formation. We found that the S H 2 mechanism can be leveraged to enable a biomimetic sp 3 -sp 3 cross-coupling platform that furnishes quaternary sp 3 -carbon centers, a long-standing challenge in organic molecule construction. This heteroselective radical-radical coupling uses the capacity of iron porphyrin to readily distinguish between the S H 2 bond-forming roles of open-shell primary and tertiary carbons, combined with photocatalysis to generate both radical classes simultaneously from widely abundant functional groups. Mechanistic studies confirm the intermediacy of a primary alkyl–Fe(III) species prior to coupling and provide evidence for the S H 2 displacement pathway in the critical quaternary sp 3 -carbon bond formation step.},

Here, we report that an error-prone Okazaki fragment maturation (OFM) pathway is activated at restrictive temperatures in rad27 Δ yeast cells. Restrictive temperature stress activated Dun1, facilitating transformation of unprocessed 5′ flaps into 3′ flaps, which were removed by 3′ nucleases, including DNA polymerase δ (Polδ). However, at certain regions, 3′ flaps formed secondary structures that facilitated 3′ end extension rather than degradation, producing alternative duplications with short spacer sequences, such as pol3 internal tandem duplications. Consequently, little 5′ flap was formed, suppressing rad27 Δ-induced lethality at restrictive temperatures. We define a stress-induced, error-prone OFM pathway that generates mutations that counteract replication defects and drive cellular evolution and survival.},

Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to rapidly generate a cell-resolution map of the maize root, revealing an alternative configuration of the tissue formative transcription factor SHORT-ROOT (SHR) adjacent to an expanded cortex. We show that maize SHR protein is hypermobile, moving at least eight cell layers into the cortex. Higher-order SHR mutants in both maize and Setaria have reduced numbers of cortical layers, showing that the SHR pathway controls expansion of cortical tissue to elaborate anatomical complexity.},

Such phases feature long-range quantum entanglement that can potentially be exploited to realize robust quantum computation. We used a 219-atom programmable quantum simulator to probe quantum spin liquid states. In our approach, arrays of atoms were placed on the links of a kagome lattice, and evolution under Rydberg blockade created frustrated quantum states with no local order. The onset of a quantum spin liquid phase of the paradigmatic toric code type was detected by using topological string operators that provide direct signatures of topological order and quantum correlations. Our observations enable the controlled experimental exploration of topological matter and protected quantum information processing.},

Realizing topologically ordered states has proven to be challenging in both condensed matter and synthetic quantum systems. We prepared the ground state of the toric code Hamiltonian using an efficient quantum circuit on a superconducting quantum processor. We measured a topological entanglement entropy near the expected value of –ln2 and simulated anyon interferometry to extract the braiding statistics of the emergent excitations. Furthermore, we investigated key aspects of the surface code, including logical state injection and the decay of the nonlocal order parameter.

  abstract     = {For electrons to continuously enter and flow through the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), they must ultimately land on a terminal electron acceptor (TEA), which is known to be oxygen in mammals. Paradoxically, we find that complex I and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) can still deposit electrons into the ETC when oxygen reduction is impeded. Cells lacking oxygen reduction accumulate ubiquinol, driving the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex in reverse to enable electron deposition onto fumarate. Upon inhibition of oxygen reduction, fumarate reduction sustains DHODH and complex I activities. Mouse tissues display varying capacities to use fumarate as a TEA, most of which net reverse the SDH complex under hypoxia. Thus, we delineate a circuit of electron flow in the mammalian ETC that maintains mitochondrial functions under oxygen limitation.},

This active mode of adsorption has been realized on surfaces of metal-organic frameworks grafted with arrays of molecular pumps. Adsorbates are transported from one well-defined compartment, the bulk, to another well-defined compartment, the interface, thereby creating large potential gradients in the form of chemical capacitors wherein energy is stored in metastable states.

Now, plans for new road infrastructure (4) suggest that the Chaco Serrano forest will continue to shrink, further fragmenting the forest ecosystem. The Córdoba provincial government has granted an environmental license for the construction of two additional roads that will cut through areas of Chaco Serrano forest in the Punilla and Paravachasca valleys. These recently burned forest areas of high conservation priority, according to national laws (5, 6), should be protected without exception.},

Each memory is distinct, separable, and has its own physiological impact, collectively endowing these stem cells with heightened regenerative ability to heal wounds and broadening their tissue-regenerating tasks relative to their naïve counterparts.},

Community policing is a celebrated reform with that aim, which is now adopted on six continents. However, the evidence base is limited, studying reform components in isolation in a limited set of countries, and remaining largely silent on citizen-police trust. We designed six field experiments with Global South police agencies to study locally designed models of community policing using coordinated measures of crime and the attitudes and behaviors of citizens and police. In a preregistered meta-analysis, we found that these interventions led to mixed implementation, largely failed to improve citizen-police relations, and did not reduce crime. Societies may need to implement structural changes first for incremental police reforms such as community policing to succeed.},

We studied the adaptive codivergence in wing shape, flight behavior, and aerodynamic efficiency among Morpho butterflies living in different forest strata by combining high-speed videography in the field with morphometric analyses and aerodynamic modeling. By comparing canopy and understory species, we show that adaptation to an open canopy environment resulted in increased glide efficiency. Moreover, this enhanced glide efficiency was achieved by different canopy species through distinct combinations of flight behavior, wing shape, and aerodynamic mechanisms, highlighting the multiple pathways of adaptive evolution.},

In plants, DICER-LIKE PROTEIN 3 (DCL3) produces 24-nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that determine the specificity of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. Here, we determined the structure of a DCL3–pre-siRNA complex in an active dicing-competent state. The 5′-phosphorylated A1 of the guide strand and the 1-nt 3′ overhang of the complementary strand are specifically recognized by a positively charged pocket and an aromatic cap, respectively. The 24-nt siRNA length dependence relies on the separation between the 5′-phosphorylated end of the guide RNA and dual cleavage sites formed by the paired ribonuclease III domains. These structural studies, complemented by functional data, provide insight into the dicing principle for Dicers in general.},

Using time-periodic driving, a naturally given many-body Hamiltonian of a closed quantum system can be transformed into an effective target Hamiltonian that exhibits vastly different dynamics. We demonstrate such Floquet engineering with a system of spins represented by Rydberg states in an ultracold atomic gas. By applying a sequence of spin manipulations, we change the symmetry properties of the effective Heisenberg XYZ Hamiltonian. As a consequence, the relaxation behavior of the total spin is drastically modified. The observed dynamics can be qualitatively captured by a semiclassical simulation. Engineering a wide range of Hamiltonians opens vast opportunities for implementing quantum simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics in a single experimental setting.},

Here, we used late Quaternary large-bodied herbivore extinctions as a global exclusion experiment to examine the responses of grassy ecosystem paleofire activity (through charcoal proxies) to continental differences in extinction severity. Grassy ecosystem fire activity increased in response to herbivore extinction, with larger increases on continents that suffered the largest losses of grazers; browser declines had no such effect. These shifts suggest that herbivory can have Earth system–scale effects on fire and that herbivore impacts should be explicitly considered when predicting changes in past and future global fire activity.},

Using single-spin quantum magnetometry, we directly visualized nanoscale magnetic domains and periodic patterns, a signature of moiré magnetism, and measured domain size and magnetization. In twisted bilayer CrI 3 , we observed the coexistence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) domains with disorder-like spatial patterns. In twisted double-trilayer CrI 3 , AFM and FM domains with periodic patterns appear, which is in good agreement with the calculated spatial magnetic structures that arise from the local stacking-dependent interlayer exchange interactions in CrI 3 moiré superlattices.

We showcase the power of this strategy for the challenging problem of speciation of palladium (Pd) catalysts, for which a mechanistic rationale is currently lacking. From a total space of 348 ligands, the algorithm predicted, and we experimentally verified, a number of phosphine ligands (including previously never synthesized ones) that give dinuclear Pd (I) complexes over the more common Pd (0) and Pd (II) species.},

  abstract     = {Humans differ in their susceptibility to infectious disease, partly owing to variation in the immune response after infection. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify variation in the response to influenza infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from European- and African-ancestry males. Genetic ancestry effects are common but highly cell type specific. Higher levels of European ancestry are associated with increased type I interferon pathway activity in early infection, which predicts reduced viral titers at later time points. Substantial population-associated variation is explained by cis - expression quantitative trait loci that are differentiated by genetic ancestry. Furthermore, genetic ancestry–associated genes are enriched among genes correlated with COVID-19 disease severity, suggesting that the early immune response contributes to ancestry-associated differences for multiple viral infection outcomes.},

  abstract     = {The roaming chemical reaction mechanism involves near-dissociation of an energized molecule to radicals that leads instead to intramolecular reaction after reorientation at long range. Surprisingly, no clear quantum signatures of roaming have been observed to date, despite the quantum nature of the roaming event. We found evidence of quantum dynamics in the photodissociation of formaldehyde near the roaming threshold. This is ascribed to resonances associated to H+HCO( K a = 1) that have a profound impact on the CO rotational and translational energy distributions and cause the roaming fraction to vary by a factor of 2 over an energy range of 10 cm –1 . The roaming pathway serves both to modulate and report on the complex vibrational dynamics and coupling among the three dissociation pathways in the excited molecule as it decays to products.},

  abstract     = {During eukaryotic transcription elongation, RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) is regulated by a chorus of factors. Here, we identified a common binary interaction module consisting of TFIIS N-terminal domains (TNDs) and natively unstructured TND-interacting motifs (TIMs). This module was conserved among the elongation machinery and linked complexes including transcription factor TFIIS, Mediator, super elongation complex, elongin, IWS1, SPT6, PP1-PNUTS phosphatase, H3K36me3 readers, and other factors. Using nuclear magnetic resonance, live-cell microscopy, and mass spectrometry, we revealed the structural basis for these interactions and found that TND-TIM sequences were necessary and sufficient to induce strong and specific colocalization in the crowded nuclear environment. Disruption of a single TIM in IWS1 induced robust changes in gene expression and RNAP2 elongation dynamics, which underscores the functional importance of TND-TIM surfaces for transcription elongation.},

To understand the contribution of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia, we studied postmortem human samples. We found that adult-born dentate granule cells showed abnormal morphological development and changes in the expression of differentiation markers. The ratio of quiescent to proliferating hippocampal neural stem cells shifted, and the homeostasis of the neurogenic niche was altered. Aging and neurodegenerative diseases reduced the phagocytic capacity of microglia, triggered astrogliosis, and altered the microvasculature of the dentate gyrus. Thus, enhanced vulnerability of AHN to neurodegeneration might underlie hippocampal dysfunction during physiological and pathological aging in humans.},

Recent research reveals that cross-talk along the gut-brain axis regulates inflammatory nociception, inflammatory responses, and immune homeostasis. Here, we discuss molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the signaling of inflammation across the gut-brain axis.

Clinical inflammation occurs if steady-state cell-intrinsic and leukocytic immunity to viruses fails. Inflammation attests to the attempts of newly recruited and activated leukocytes to resolve infection in the blood or tissues. In the confusing battle between a myriad of viruses and cells, studies of human genetics can separate the root cause of inflammation and disease from its consequences. Single-gene inborn errors of cell-intrinsic or leukocytic immunity underlying diverse infections in the skin, brain, or lungs can help to clarify the human determinants of viral disease. The genetic elucidation of immunological deficits in a single patient with a specific vulnerability profile can reveal mechanisms of inflammation and disease that may be triggered by other causes, inherited or otherwise, in other patients. This human genetic dissection of viral infections is giving rise to a new biology and a new medicine.},

However, excessive or chronic inflammation promotes tissue damage and disease, as in arthritis, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and COVID-19. Intracellular constituents released from dying cells are among the stimuli that trigger proinflammatory gene expression programs in innate immune cells. We explore how programmed cell death mechanisms—apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis—may contribute to inflammatory disease. We discuss inhibition of cell death as a potential therapeutic strategy, focusing on the targets RIPK1 (receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 1), NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3), and GSDMD (gasdermin D) as important mediators of lytic cell death. We also consider the potential benefits of limiting membrane rupture rather than cell death by targeting NINJ1.},

These include intermittent fasting, fasting-mimicking diets, ketogenic diets, time-restricted feeding, protein restriction, and dietary restriction of specific amino acids. Despite mainstream popularization of some of these diets, many questions remain about their efficacy outside of a laboratory setting. Studies of these interventions support at least partially overlapping mechanisms of action and provide insights into what appear to be highly conserved mechanisms of biological aging.},

We elucidated a distinct mechanism for X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in cynomolgus monkeys, a model for human development. The trophectoderm and cytotrophoblast acquire XCI around implantation through an active intermediate bearing repressive modifications and compacted structure, whereas the amnion, epiblast, and hypoblast maintain such an intermediate protractedly, attaining XCI by a week after implantation. Males achieve X chromosome up-regulation (XCU) progressively, whereas females show XCU coincidentally with XCI, both establishing the X:autosome dosage compensation by 1 week after implantation. Conversely, primordial germ cells undergo X chromosome reactivation by reversing the XCI pathway early during their development. Our findings establish a foundation for clarifying the dosage compensation mechanisms in primates, including humans.},

We found that the insular cortex acts as a state-dependent regulator of fear that is necessary to establish an equilibrium between the extinction and maintenance of fear memories in mice. Whereas insular cortex responsiveness to fear-evoking cues increased with their certainty to predict harm, this activity was attenuated through negative bodily feedback that arose from heart rate decelerations during freezing. Perturbation of body-brain communication by vagus nerve stimulation disrupted the balance between fear extinction and maintenance similar to insular cortex inhibition. Our data reveal that the insular cortex integrates predictive sensory and interoceptive signals to provide graded and bidirectional teaching signals that gate fear extinction and illustrate how bodily feedback signals are used to maintain fear within a functional equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {Metal-binding natural products contribute to metal acquisition and bacterial virulence, but their roles in metal stress response are underexplored. We show that a five-enzyme pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa synthesizes a small-molecule copper complex, fluopsin C, in response to elevated copper concentrations. Fluopsin C is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that contains a copper ion chelated by two minimal thiohydroxamates. Biosynthesis of the thiohydroxamate begins with cysteine and requires two lyases, two iron-dependent enzymes, and a methyltransferase. The iron-dependent enzymes remove the carboxyl group and the α carbon from cysteine through decarboxylation, N-hydroxylation, and methylene excision. Conservation of the pathway in P. aeruginosa and other bacteria suggests a common role for fluopsin C in the copper stress response, which involves fusing copper into an antibiotic against other microbes.},

  abstract     = {Infection with one of dengue viruses 1 to 4 (DENV1-4) induces protective antibodies against homotypic infection. However, a notable feature of dengue viruses is the ability to use preexisting heterotypic antibodies to infect Fcγ receptor–bearing immune cells, leading to higher viral load and immunopathological events that augment disease. We tracked the antigenic dynamics of each DENV serotype by using 1944 sequenced isolates from Bangkok, Thailand, between 1994 and 2014 (348 strains), in comparison with regional and global DENV antigenic diversity (64 strains). Over the course of 20 years, the Thailand DENV serotypes gradually evolved away from one another. However, for brief periods, the serotypes increased in similarity, with corresponding changes in epidemic magnitude. Antigenic evolution within a genotype involved a trade-off between two types of antigenic change (within-serotype and between-serotype), whereas genotype replacement resulted in antigenic change away from all serotypes. These findings provide insights into theorized dynamics in antigenic evolution.},

During April 2021, the city became overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases and fatalities, as a new variant, B.1.617.2 (Delta), replaced B.1.1.7 (Alpha). A Bayesian model explains the growth advantage of Delta through a combination of increased transmissibility and reduced sensitivity to immune responses generated against earlier variants (median estimates: 1.5-fold greater transmissibility and 20\% reduction in sensitivity). Seropositivity of an employee and family cohort increased from 42\% to 87.5\% between March and July 2021, with 27\% reinfections, as judged by increased antibody concentration after a previous decline. The likely high transmissibility and partial evasion of immunity by the Delta variant contributed to an overwhelming surge in Delhi.},

Epidemic waves may result when restrictions are lifted or poorly adhered to, variants with new phenotypic properties successfully invade, or infection spreads to susceptible subpopulations. Three COVID-19 epidemic waves have been observed in Kenya. Using a mechanistic mathematical model, we explain the first two distinct waves by differences in contact rates in high and low social-economic groups, and the third wave by the introduction of higher-transmissibility variants. Reopening schools led to a minor increase in transmission between the second and third waves. Socioeconomic and urban–rural population structure are critical determinants of viral transmission in Kenya.},

In this study, we controllably introduced gradient nanoscaled dislocation cell structures in a stable single-phase HEA with face-centered cubic structure, thus resulting in enhanced strength without apparent loss of ductility. Upon application of strain, the sample-level structural gradient induces progressive formation of a high density of tiny stacking faults (SFs) and twins, nucleating from abundant low-angle dislocation cells. Furthermore, the SF-induced plasticity and the resultant refined structures, coupled with intensively accumulated dislocations, contribute to plasticity, increased strength, and work hardening. These findings offer a promising paradigm for tailoring properties with gradient dislocation cells at the nanoscale and advance our fundamental understanding of the intrinsic deformation behavior of HEAs.},

The radiative decay of an excited atomic state has been suppressed by reducing the density of electromagnetic vacuum modes near the atomic transition. Likewise, reducing the density of available momentum modes of the atomic motion when it is embedded inside a Fermi sea will suppress spontaneous emission and photon scattering rates. Here we report the experimental demonstration of suppressed light scattering in a quantum degenerate Fermi gas. We systematically measured the dependence of the suppression factor on the temperature and Fermi energy of a strontium quantum gas and achieved suppression of scattering rates by up to a factor of 2 compared with a thermal gas.},

  abstract     = {Pauli blocking of spontaneous emission is responsible for the stability of atoms. Electrons cannot decay to lower-lying internal states that are already occupied. Pauli blocking also occurs when free atoms scatter light elastically (Rayleigh scattering) and the final external momentum states are already populated. This was predicted more than 30 years ago but is challenging to realize experimentally. Here, we report on Pauli blocking of light scattering in a dense quantum-degenerate Fermi gas of ultracold lithium atoms. When the Fermi momentum is larger than the photon recoil, most final momentum states are within the Fermi surface. At low temperature, we find that light scattered even at large angles is suppressed by 37\% compared with higher temperatures, where atoms scatter at the single-atom Rayleigh scattering rate.},

The implications of this are profound; for example, it accounts for the electronic shell structure of atoms. Here, we performed measurements on the scattering of light from ultracold ensembles of atoms. For a Fermi gas in the quantum degenerate regime, we observed a marked suppression in scattering compared with a similarly prepared Bose gas. The observed decrease in fluorescence and the corresponding increase in light transmission results from Pauli blocking, where Fermi-Dirac statistics limits the number of accessible states for a scattering atom in a large Fermi sea. Our work confirms a fundamental result on the optical response of quantum gases and may contribute to cooling and thermometry schemes.},

We examined the gravity signature of the GRS using data from 12 encounters of the Juno spacecraft with the planet, including two direct overflights of the vortex. Localized density anomalies due to the presence of the GRS caused a shift in the spacecraft line-of-sight velocity. Using two different approaches to infer the GRS depth, which yielded consistent results, we conclude that the GRS is contained within the upper 500 kilometers of Jupiter’s atmosphere.},

Using cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we visualized the structure of the mysterious viral transfer RNA (tRNA)–like structure (TLS) from the brome mosaic virus, which affects replication, translation, and genome encapsidation. Structures in isolation and those bound to tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) show that this ~55-kilodalton purported tRNA mimic undergoes large conformational rearrangements to bind TyrRS in a form that differs substantially from that of tRNA. Our study reveals how viral RNAs can use a combination of static and dynamic RNA structures to bind host machinery through highly noncanonical interactions, and we highlight the utility of cryo-EM for visualizing small, conformationally dynamic structured RNAs.},

Despite precarious funding for science compared with high-income countries, in 2020, Brazil was ranked 11th among nations that produced knowledge to fight the COVID-19 pandemic (6). Brazil’s meaningful contributions are driven by early career researchers (5), but without proper investment, these young scientists will have no choice but to abandon their academic career or leave the country (5).},

  abstract     = {Brazil has been facing a wave of institutionalized scientific denialism that negatively affects public policies in areas such as education, environmental preservation (1, 2), and public health (3). Among the institutionalized setbacks are the systemic cuts to the scientific budget (4–6), including a 92\% cut to the National Fund for Science and Technology Development budget in October, equivalent to US$106.3 million (4). Less scientific funding threatens the careers of young scientists (7) and the productivity of senior researchers, who will likely see a decrease in students’ motivation to develop their projects. Reducing Brazil’s scientific output will exacerbate the wide-ranging consequences of the government’s antiscience policies.},

This proteo-genomic map provides a framework to connect etiologically related diseases, to provide biological context for new or emerging disorders, and to integrate different biological domains to establish mechanisms for known gene-disease links. Our results identify proteo-genomic connections within and between diseases and establish the value of cis-protein variants for annotation of likely causal disease genes at loci identified in genome-wide association studies, thereby addressing a major barrier to experimental validation and clinical translation of genetic discoveries.},

We used long-read sequencing to generate the Col-CEN Arabidopsis thaliana genome assembly that resolves all five centromeres. The centromeres consist of megabase-scale tandemly repeated satellite arrays, which support CENTROMERE SPECIFIC HISTONE H3 (CENH3) occupancy and are densely DNA methylated, with satellite variants private to each chromosome. CENH3 preferentially occupies satellites that show the least amount of divergence and occur in higher-order repeats. The centromeres are invaded by ATHILA retrotransposons, which disrupt genetic and epigenetic organization. Centromeric crossover recombination is suppressed, yet low levels of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks occur that are regulated by DNA methylation. We propose that Arabidopsis centromeres are evolving through cycles of satellite homogenization and retrotransposon-driven diversification.},

In the linguistic domain, syntax is the cognitive function handling interdependent elements. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we detected common neurofunctional substrates in the basal ganglia subserving both tool use and syntax in language. The two abilities elicited similar patterns of neural activity, indicating the existence of shared functional resources. Manual actions and verbal working memory did not contribute to this common network. Consistent with the existence of shared neural resources, we observed bidirectional behavioral enhancement of tool use and syntactic skills in language so that training one function improves performance in the other. This reveals supramodal syntactic processes for tool use and language.},

Efforts to understand the underpinnings of this plasticity have almost exclusively focused on the functional and underlying structural changes that neurons undergo at neurochemical synapses. What has received comparatively little attention is the involvement of activity-dependent myelination in such plasticity and the functional output of circuits controlling behavior. The traditionally held view of myelin as a passive insulator of axons is changing to one of lifelong changes in myelin, modulated by neuronal activity and experience. We review the nascent evidence of the functional role of myelin plasticity in strengthening circuit functions that underlie learning and behavior.},

To test whether the microbial degradability of coal limits microbial methane, we monitored methoxyl group demethylation—a reaction that feeds methanogenesis—in a global sample suite ranging in maturity from wood to bituminous coal. Carbon isotopic compositions of residual methoxyl groups were inconsistent with a thermal reaction, instead implying a substrate-limited biologic process. This suggests that deep biosphere communities participated in transforming plant matter to coal on geologic time scales and that methoxyl abundance influences coal-bed methane yield. Carbon isotopic enrichments resulting from microbial methylotrophy also explain an enigmatic offset in the carbon-13 content of microbial methane from coals and conventional hydrocarbon deposits.},

  abstract     = {Calcium silicate perovskite, CaSiO 3 , is arguably the most geochemically important phase in the lower mantle, because it concentrates elements that are incompatible in the upper mantle, including the heat-generating elements thorium and uranium, which have half-lives longer than the geologic history of Earth. We report CaSiO 3 -perovskite as an approved mineral (IMA2020-012a) with the name davemaoite. The natural specimen of davemaoite proves the existence of compositional heterogeneity within the lower mantle. Our observations indicate that davemaoite also hosts potassium in addition to uranium and thorium in its structure. Hence, the regional and global abundances of davemaoite influence the heat budget of the deep mantle, where the mineral is thermodynamically stable.},

  abstract     = {Orbital data indicate that the youngest volcanic units on the Moon are basalt lavas in Oceanus Procellarum, a region with high levels of the heat-producing elements potassium, thorium, and uranium. The Chang’e-5 mission collected samples of these young lunar basalts and returned them to Earth for laboratory analysis. We measure an age of 1963 ± 57 million years for these lavas and determine their chemical and mineralogical compositions. This age constrains the lunar impact chronology of the inner Solar System and the thermal evolution of the Moon. There is no evidence for high concentrations of heat-producing elements in the deep mantle of the Moon that generated these lavas, so alternate explanations are required for the longevity of lunar magmatism.},

Here we present evidence about the effect of guaranteed payments on COVID-19 vaccination uptake. We ran a large preregistered randomized controlled trial (with 8286 participants) in Sweden and linked the data to population-wide administrative vaccination records. We found that modest monetary payments of 24 US dollars (200 Swedish kronor) increased vaccination rates by 4.2 percentage points ( P = 0.005), from a baseline rate of 71.6\%. By contrast, behavioral nudges increased stated intentions to become vaccinated but had only small and not statistically significant impacts on vaccination rates. The results highlight the potential of modest monetary incentives to raise vaccination rates.},

Here, we show that the microtubule (MT) minus end-stabilizing protein Patronin/CAMSAP marks the future Drosophila oocyte and is required for oocyte specification. The spectraplakin Shot recruits Patronin to the fusome, a branched structure extending into all cyst cells. Patronin stabilizes more MTs in the cell with the most fusome material. Our data suggest that this weak asymmetry is amplified by Dynein-dependent transport of Patronin-stabilized MTs. This forms a polarized MT network, along which Dynein transports oocyte determinants into the presumptive oocyte. Thus, Patronin amplifies a weak fusome anisotropy to break symmetry and select one cell to become the oocyte.},

Here, we observed T cells adjacent to Lewy bodies and dopaminergic neurons in postmortem LBD brains. Single-cell RNA sequencing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) identified up-regulated expression of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) in CD4 + T cells in LBD. CSF protein levels of the CXCR4 ligand, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), were associated with neuroaxonal damage in LBD. Furthermore, we observed clonal expansion and up-regulated interleukin 17A expression by CD4 + T cells stimulated with a phosphorylated α-synuclein epitope. Thus, CXCR4-CXCL12 signaling may represent a mechanistic target for inhibiting pathological interleukin-17–producing T cell trafficking in LBD.},

However, the spatial resolution of such anisotropic charge distributions on an atom represents a long-standing experimental challenge. In particular, the existence of the σ-hole on halogen atoms has been demonstrated only indirectly through the determination of the crystal structures of organic molecules containing halogens or with theoretical calculations, consequently calling for its direct experimental visualization. We show that Kelvin probe force microscopy with a properly functionalized probe can image the anisotropic charge of the σ-hole and the quadrupolar charge of a carbon monoxide molecule. This opens a new way to characterize biological and chemical systems in which anisotropic atomic charges play a decisive role.},

Although synaptic plasticity is key to these processes, its precise spatiotemporal profile remains poorly understood. Using optogenetics to selectively erase long-term potentiation (LTP) within a defined temporal window, we found that distinct phases of synaptic plasticity play differential roles. The first wave acts locally in the hippocampus to confer context specificity. The second wave, during sleep on the same day, organizes these neurons into synchronously firing assemblies. Finally, LTP in the anterior cingulate cortex during sleep on the second day is required for further stabilization of the memory. This demonstrates the precise localization, timing, and characteristic contributions of the plasticity events that underlie the early phase of memory consolidation.},

Here, we describe peptide amphiphile supramolecular polymers containing two distinct signals and test them in a mouse model of severe spinal cord injury. One signal activates the transmembrane receptor β1-integrin and a second one activates the basic fibroblast growth factor 2 receptor. By mutating the peptide sequence of the amphiphilic monomers in nonbioactive domains, we intensified the motions of molecules within scaffold fibrils. This resulted in notable differences in vascular growth, axonal regeneration, myelination, survival of motor neurons, reduced gliosis, and functional recovery. We hypothesize that the signaling of cells by ensembles of molecules could be optimized by tuning their internal motions.},

We de novo assembled the genomes of 88 rockfish species and from these identified repeated signatures of positive selection in DNA repair pathways in long-lived taxa and 137 longevity-associated genes with direct effects on life span through insulin signaling and with pleiotropic effects through size and environmental adaptations. A genome-wide screen of structural variation reveals copy number expansions in the immune modulatory butyrophilin gene family in long-lived species. The evolution of different rockfish life histories is coupled to genetic diversity and reshapes the mutational spectrum driving segregating CpG→TpG variants in long-lived species. These analyses highlight the genetic innovations that underlie life history trait adaptations and, in turn, how they shape genomic diversity.},

O’Keefe justified his decision by citing Webb’s prominent role in the Apollo program and his acknowledged record of championing space science. Now, however, deeper questions have emerged about whether Webb deserves the honor—a debate that is tarnishing the telescope’s name just as NASA is trying to celebrate its launch.},

  abstract     = {During development, neural circuit formation requires the stabilization of active γ-aminobutyric acid–mediated (GABAergic) synapses and the elimination of inactive ones. Here, we demonstrate that, although the activation of postsynaptic GABA type A receptors (GABA A Rs) and adenosine A 2A receptors (A 2A Rs) stabilizes GABAergic synapses, only A 2A R activation is sufficient. Both GABA A R- and A 2A R-dependent signaling pathways act synergistically to produce adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate through the recruitment of the calcium–calmodulin–adenylyl cyclase pathway. Protein kinase A, thus activated, phosphorylates gephyrin on serine residue 303, which is required for GABA A R stabilization. Finally, the stabilization of pre- and postsynaptic GABAergic elements involves the interaction between gephyrin and the synaptogenic membrane protein Slitrk3. We propose that A 2A Rs act as detectors of active GABAergic synapses releasing GABA, adenosine triphosphate, and adenosine to regulate their fate toward stabilization or elimination.},

We show that small proline-rich protein 2A (SPRR2A) is an intestinal antibacterial protein that is phylogenetically unrelated to previously discovered mammalian AMPs. In this study, SPRR2A was expressed in Paneth cells and goblet cells and selectively killed Gram-positive bacteria by disrupting their membranes. SPRR2A shaped intestinal microbiota composition, restricted bacterial association with the intestinal surface, and protected against Listeria monocytogenes infection. SPRR2A differed from other intestinal AMPs in that it was induced by type 2 cytokines produced during helminth infection. Moreover, SPRR2A protected against helminth-induced bacterial invasion of intestinal tissue. Thus, SPRR2A is a distinctive AMP triggered by type 2 immunity that protects the intestinal barrier during helminth infection.},

Knowledge of past 14 C levels improves our understanding of climate processes, the Sun, the geodynamo, and the carbon cycle. Recently updated radiocarbon calibration curves (IntCal20, SHCal20, and Marine20) provide unprecedented accuracy in our estimates of 14 C levels back to the limit of the 14 C technique (~55,000 years ago). Such improved detail creates new opportunities to probe the Earth and climate system more reliably and at finer scale. We summarize the advances that have underpinned this revised set of radiocarbon calibration curves, survey the broad scientific landscape where additional detail on past 14 C provides insight, and identify open challenges for the future.},

We developed a technique that combines mosaic mutagenesis with color labeling of HSPCs to study how acquired mutations affect clonal fitness in a native environment. Mutations in clonal hematopoiesis–associated genes such as asxl1 promoted clonal dominance. Single-cell transcriptional analysis revealed that mutations stimulated expression of proinflammatory genes in mature myeloid cells and anti-inflammatory genes in progenitor cells of the mutant clone. Biallelic loss of one such immunomodulator, nr4a1 , abrogated the ability of asxl1- mutant clones to establish clonal dominance. These results support a model where clonal fitness of mutant clones is driven by enhanced resistance to inflammatory signals from their mutant mature cell progeny.},

We used Nissl-based structure tensor analysis to extract fine details of axonal architecture and demonstrated its applicability in multiple datasets of humans and nonhuman primates.

  abstract     = {Fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 , particles with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers) in the atmosphere is associated with severe negative impacts on human health, and the gases sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and ammonia are the main PM 2.5 precursors. However, their contribution to global health impacts has not yet been analyzed. Here, we show that nitrogen accounted for 39\% of global PM 2.5 exposure in 2013, increasing from 30\% in 1990 with rising reactive nitrogen emissions and successful controls on sulfur dioxide. Nitrogen emissions to air caused an estimated 23.3 million years of life lost in 2013, corresponding to an annual welfare loss of 420 billion United States dollars for premature death. The marginal abatement cost of ammonia emission is only 10\% that of nitrogen oxides emission globally, highlighting the priority for ammonia reduction.},

We report the discovery of enantioselective, catalytic 1,2-boronate rearrangements for the synthesis of α-chloro pinacol boronic esters from readily available boronic esters and dichloromethane. The chiral building blocks produced in these reactions can undergo two sequential stereospecific elaborations to generate a wide assortment of trisubstituted stereocenters. The enantioselective reaction is catalyzed by a lithium-isothiourea-boronate complex, which is proposed to promote rearrangement through a dual–lithium-induced chloride abstraction orchestrated by Lewis basic functionality on the catalyst scaffold.},

  abstract     = {A surface-promoted sulfate-reducing ammonium oxidation reaction was discovered to spontaneously take place on common inorganic aerosol surfaces undergoing solvation. Several key intermediate species—including elemental sulfur (S 0 ), bisulfide (HS − ), nitrous acid (HONO), and aqueous ammonia [NH 3(aq) ]—were identified as reaction components associated with the solvation process. Depth profiles of relative species abundance showed the surface propensity of key species. The species assignments and depth profile features were supported by classical and first-principles molecular dynamics calculations, and a detailed mechanism was proposed to describe the processes that led to unexpected products during salt solvation. This discovery revealed chemistry that is distinctly linked to a solvating surface and has great potential to illuminate current puzzles within heterogeneous chemistry.},

Despite substantial efforts devoted to avoiding ammonia and cryogenic conditions, the traditional, cumbersome, and dangerous procedure remains the standard. The Benkeser reduction with lithium in ethylenediamine converts arenes to a mixture of cyclohexenes and cyclohexanes; this is operationally easier than the Birch reduction but does not afford 1,4-cyclohexadienes. Here, we report a Birch reduction promoted by lithium and ethylenediamine (or analogs) in tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature. Our method is easy to set up, inexpensive, scalable, rapid, accessible to any chemical laboratory, and capable of reducing both electron-rich and electron-deficient substrates. Our protocol is also compatible with organocuprate chemistry for further functionalization.},

In this work, we describe a simple one- or two-pot protocol that transposes a ketone to the vicinal carbon. This approach first converts the ketone to the corresponding alkenyl triflate, which can then undergo the palladium- and norbornene-catalyzed regioselective α-amination and ipso-hydrogenation enabled by a bifunctional hydrogen and nitrogen donor. The resulting “transposed enamine” intermediate can subsequently be hydrolyzed to produce the 1,2-carbonyl–migrated product. This method allows rapid access to unusual bioactive analogs through late-stage functionalization.},

By channeling protein-tethered substrates across multiple active sites in a defined linear sequence, these enzymes facilitate programmed small-molecule syntheses that could theoretically be harnessed to access countless polyketide product structures. Using cryogenic electron microscopy to study DEBS module 1, we present a structural model describing this substrate-channeling phenomenon. Our 3.2- to 4.3-angstrom-resolution structures of the intact module reveal key domain-domain interfaces and highlight an unexpected module asymmetry. We also present the structure of a product-bound module that shines light on a recently described “turnstile” mechanism for transient gating of active sites along the assembly line.},

These structures revealed how the constituent domains are positioned relative to each other, how they rearrange depending on the step in the reaction cycle, and the specific interactions formed between the domains. Like the evolutionarily related mammalian fatty acid synthase, Lsd14 contains two reaction chambers, but only one chamber in Lsd14 has the full complement of catalytic domains, indicating that only one chamber produces the polyketide product at any given time.},

Visualizing neuroid cells by correlative x-ray and electron microscopy revealed secretory vesicles and cellular projections enwrapping choanocyte microvilli and cilia.

The Perseverance rover landed in Jezero crater in February 2021. We analyze images taken by the rover in the 3 months after landing. The fan has outcrop faces, which were invisible from orbit, that record the hydrological evolution of Jezero crater. We interpret the presence of inclined strata in these outcrops as evidence of deltas that advanced into a lake. In contrast, the uppermost fan strata are composed of boulder conglomerates, which imply deposition by episodic high-energy floods. This sedimentary succession indicates a transition from sustained hydrologic activity in a persistent lake environment to highly energetic short-duration fluvial flows.},

Intracellular antiviral defenses can inhibit the replication of viruses and reduce disease severity. To better understand the antiviral defenses relevant to COVID-19, we used interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression screening to reveal that 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), through ribonuclease L, potently inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We show that a common splice-acceptor single-nucleotide polymorphism (Rs10774671) governs whether patients express prenylated OAS1 isoforms that are membrane-associated and sense-specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs or if they only express cytosolic, nonprenylated OAS1 that does not efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2. In hospitalized patients, expression of prenylated OAS1 was associated with protection from severe COVID-19, suggesting that this antiviral defense is a major component of a protective antiviral response.},

We leveraged a new dataset of Indigenous land dispossession and forced migration to statistically compare features of historical tribal lands to present-day tribal lands at the aggregate and individual tribe level. Results show a near-total aggregate reduction of Indigenous land density and spread. Indigenous peoples were forced to lands that are more exposed to climate change risks and hazards and are less likely to lie over valuable subsurface oil and gas resources. Agricultural suitability and federal land proximity results—which affect Indigenous movements, management, and traditional uses—are mixed. These findings have substantial policy implications related to heightened climate vulnerability, extensive land reduction, and diminished land value.},

Here, we report that the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 places cells under immunosurveillance to establish a biological timer mechanism that controls cell fate. p21 activates retinoblastoma protein (Rb)–dependent transcription at select gene promoters to generate a complex bioactive secretome, termed p21-activated secretory phenotype (PASP). The PASP includes the chemokine CXCL14, which promptly attracts macrophages. These macrophages disengage if cells normalize p21 within 4 days, but if p21 induction persists, they polarize toward an M1 phenotype and lymphocytes mount a cytotoxic T cell response to eliminate target cells, including preneoplastic cells. Thus, p21 concurrently induces proliferative arrest and immunosurveillance of cells under duress.},

The master regulator NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) controls many aspects of nodule initiation, and we demonstrate that it also regulates the transition to nitrogen fixation via proteolytic processing by a signal peptidase complex. Processing of NIN results in a carboxyl-terminal NIN fragment containing the DNA binding motifs, which activates a suite of genes associated with symbiosome development and nitrogen fixation. Similar NIN processing is observed in Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus , implying a conserved mechanism of cell state transition. These findings explain how legume nodules transition to a nitrogen-fixing state and a mechanism by which a single transcription factor can regulate many different developmental processes necessary in the activation and regulation of nitrogen fixation.},

We found that the NIN-like protein (NLP) transcription factors NLP2 and NIN directly activate the expression of leghemoglobins through a promoter motif, resembling a “double” version of the nitrate-responsive elements (NREs) targeted by other NLPs, that has conserved orientation and position across legumes. CRISPR knockout of the NRE-like element resulted in strongly decreased expression of the associated leghemoglobin. Our findings indicate that the origins of the NLP-leghemoglobin module for O 2 buffering in nodules can be traced to an ancient pairing of NLPs with nonsymbiotic hemoglobins that function in hypoxia.},

Barriers for their applications, however, lie in their polymorphism, instability to polar solvents, phase segregation, and susceptibility to the leaching of lead ions. We report a family of scalable composites fabricated through liquid-phase sintering of LHPs and metal-organic framework glasses. The glass acts as a matrix for LHPs, effectively stabilizing nonequilibrium perovskite phases through interfacial interactions. These interactions also passivate LHP surface defects and impart bright, narrow-band photoluminescence with a wide gamut for creating white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The processable composites show high stability against immersion in water and organic solvents as well as exposure to heat, light, air, and ambient humidity. These properties, together with their lead self-sequestration capability, can enable breakthrough applications for LHPs.},

We constructed a nearly ideal easy-plane system, a single CrCl 3 monolayer on graphene/6H-SiC(0001), and observed robust ferromagnetic ordering with critical scaling characteristic of a 2D-XY system. These observations indicate the realization of a finite-size Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in a large-area, quasi–free-standing van der Waals monolayer magnet with an XY universality class. This offers a material platform to host 2D superfluid spin transport and topological magnetic textures.},

  abstract     = {Electrical switching of a metal-to-insulator transition would provide a building block for integrated electro-optically active plasmonics. In this work, we realize plasmonic nanoantennas from metallic polymers, which show well-pronounced localized plasmon resonances in their metallic state. As a result of the electrochemically driven optical metal-to-insulator transition of the polymer, the plasmonic resonances can be electrically switched fully off and back on at video-rate frequencies of up to 30 hertz by applying alternating voltages of only ±1 volt. With the use of this concept, we demonstrate electrically switchable beam-steering metasurfaces with a 100\% contrast ratio in transmission. Our approach will help to realize ultrahigh efficiency plasmonic-based integrated active optical devices, including high-resolution augmented and virtual reality technologies.},

We used scanning tunneling noise spectroscopy to show that preformed Cooper pairs exist up to temperatures much higher than T c in the disordered superconductor titanium nitride by observing an enhancement in the shot noise that is equivalent to a change of the effective charge from one to two electron charges. We further show that the spectroscopic gap fills up rather than closes with increasing temperature. Our results demonstrate the existence of a state above T c that, much like an ordinary metal, has no (pseudo)gap but carries charge through paired electrons.},

In this work, we use Tara Oceans metabarcoding data, which cover all major ocean basins, combined with a probabilistic model of taxon co-occurrence to compare the biogeography of 70 major groups of eukaryotic plankton. We uncover two main axes of biogeographic variation. First, more-diverse groups display clearer biogeographic patterns. Second, large-bodied consumers are structured by oceanic basins, mostly through the main current systems, whereas small-bodied phototrophs are structured by latitude and follow local environmental conditions. Our study highlights notable differences in biogeographies across plankton groups and investigates their determinants at the global scale.},

We reveal that cell type–specific association and scaffolding of DNA loci around nuclear bodies organize the nuclear architecture and correlate with differential expression levels in different cell types. At the submegabase level, active and inactive X chromosomes access similar domain structures in single cells despite distinct epigenetic and expression states. This work represents a major step forward in linking single-cell three-dimensional nuclear architecture, gene expression, and epigenetic modifications in a native tissue context.},

Although many are promising drug targets, their mechanisms of modulation by small-molecule inhibitors remain largely unknown. Two first-generation inhibitors of the MsbA transporter, tetrahydrobenzothiophene 1 (TBT1) and G247, induce opposite effects on ATP hydrolysis. Using single-particle cryo–electron microscopy and functional assays, we show that TBT1 and G247 bind adjacent yet separate pockets in the MsbA transmembrane domains. Two TBT1 molecules asymmetrically occupy the substrate-binding site, which leads to a collapsed inward-facing conformation with decreased distance between the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). By contrast, two G247 molecules symmetrically increase NBD distance in a wide inward-open state of MsbA. The divergent mechanisms of action of these MsbA inhibitors provide important insights into ABC transporter pharmacology.},

They reflect the precisely timed activity of underlying neural circuits. Here, we review how these electrical signatures have been guiding our understanding of the circuits and processes sustaining memory consolidation during sleep, focusing on hippocampal theta oscillations and sharp-wave ripples and how they coordinate with cortical patterns.

  abstract     = {Thambisetty et al.’s assertion that “trial data do not support any clinical benefit of amyloid plaque reduction” in Alzheimer’s disease is not supported by close analysis of all publicly available trial data. Some β-amyloid antibodies but not others have decreased amyloid deposits in brain regions serving cognition, accompanied by slowing of decline on some tests of cognition and activities of daily living. The US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Clinical Pharmacology Review of aducanumab concluded that its reduction of amyloid plaques correlated with slowing of cognitive decline and that this “is consistent across all 6 other programs of β-amyloid antibodies over the past decade” [(1), p. 30, see Fig. 5]. The FDA said that the negative aducanumab ENGAGE trial (NCT02477800) was the only exception to this relationship, suggesting that it was a “potential outlier or chance finding” [(1), p. 29].},

  abstract     = {In his Perspective “Treatments for Alzheimer’s disease emerge” (6 August, p. 624), D. J. Selkoe asserts that some trials testing potential treatments for Alzheimer’s disease have shown “evidence of disease modification.” He cites reductions in amyloid plaques (hypothesized to cause cognitive decline) and some modest reductions in cognitive decline shown in four potential drugs that target amyloid. However, hardly any trials have shown an effect, and even the trials with statistically significant results show effects that are too small to be clinically significant or to justify moving forward with the treatments. β-amyloid antibodies can lower amyloid plaques (extracellular aggregated insoluble β-amyloid), but available data show that decreasing amyloid plaques does not in itself lead to reduction in cognitive decline.},

The authors immediately informed Science and requested that an Erratum be published and the paper be corrected. At this time, the authors also updated the publicly available GWAS summary statistics for this work and contacted those who had downloaded the summary statistics and advised them to download the corrected summary statistics. The error affected only the regional cortical thickness imaging phenotypes in this cohort. The error occurred when the file was sorted by participant ID and resulted in the randomization of IDs within this file. This meant that in the GWAS meta-analyses for the regional cortical thickness imaging phenotypes, the GWAS results from this cohort contributed random noise rather than true signal. None of the other 59 cohorts contributing to the meta-analysis were affected; the average cortical thickness was not affected by this error, nor were the total or regional cortical surface area phenotypes.},

Vaccine-generated spike-specific memory CD4 + T cells 6 months after the second dose of the vaccine were comparable in quantity and quality to COVID-19 cases, including the presence of T follicular helper cells and interferon-γ–expressing cells.

  abstract     = {Extreme climatic events, including marine heatwaves (MHWs), are altering ecosystems globally, often with profound socioeconomic impacts. We examine how MHWs have affected the provision of ecosystem services and evaluate the socioeconomic consequences for human society. Ecological impacts range from harmful algal blooms and mass mortality events to reconfigurations of entire ecosystems, affecting provisioning, habitat, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services globally. Reported economic costs of individual MHW events exceed US$800 million in direct losses or &gt;US$3.1 billion in indirect losses of ecosystem services for multiple years. However, biological responses to MHWs can also increase human-ocean interactions, providing opportunities for coastal societies. Our study provides a global perspective on the far-reaching impacts of MHWs on human societies and highlights the urgent need to develop robust approaches to mitigation and adaptation.},

Yet understanding the neural processes that underlie the interactive behavior of groups or by which neurons solve the basic problem of coding for multiple agents has remained a challenge. By tracking the interindividual dynamics of groups of three interacting rhesus macaques, we discover detailed representations of the groups’ behavior by neurons in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, reflecting not only the other agents’ identities but also their specific interactions, social context, actions, and outcomes. We show how these cells collectively represent the interaction between specific group members and their reciprocation, retaliation, and past behaviors. We also show how they influence the animals’ own upcoming decisions and their ability to form beneficial agent-specific interactions. Together, these findings reveal prefrontal neurons that code for the agency identity of others and a cellular mechanism that could support the interactive behavior of social groups.},

The neural representation of group social communication remains largely unexplored. We conducted simultaneous wireless electrophysiological recordings from the frontal cortices of groups of Egyptian fruit bats engaged in both spontaneous and task-induced vocal interactions. We found that the activity of single neurons distinguished between vocalizations produced by self and by others, as well as among specific individuals. Coordinated neural activity among group members exhibited stable bidirectional interbrain correlation patterns specific to spontaneous communicative interactions. Tracking social and spatial arrangements within a group revealed a relationship between social preferences and intra- and interbrain activity patterns. Combined, these findings reveal a dedicated neural repertoire for group social communication within and across the brains of freely communicating groups of bats.},

We found that susceptibility to viral killing in marine Vibrio is mediated by large and highly diverse mobile genetic elements. These phage defense elements display exceedingly fast evolutionary turnover, resulting in differential phage susceptibility among clonal bacterial strains while phage receptors remain invariant. Protection is cumulative, and a single bacterial genome can harbor 6 to 12 defense elements, accounting for more than 90\% of the flexible genome among close relatives. The rapid turnover of these elements decouples phage resistance from other genomic features. Thus, resistance to phages in the wild follows evolutionary trajectories alternative to those predicted from laboratory-based evolutionary experiments.},

We examined the impacts of ivory poaching during the Mozambican Civil War (1977 to 1992) on the evolution of African savanna elephants ( Loxodonta africana ) in Gorongosa National Park. Poaching resulted in strong selection that favored tusklessness amid a rapid population decline. Survey data revealed tusk-inheritance patterns consistent with an X chromosome–linked dominant, male-lethal trait. Whole-genome scans implicated two candidate genes with known roles in mammalian tooth development ( AMELX and MEP1a ), including the formation of enamel, dentin, cementum, and the periodontium. One of these loci ( AMELX ) is associated with an X-linked dominant, male-lethal syndrome in humans that diminishes the growth of maxillary lateral incisors (homologous to elephant tusks). This study provides evidence for rapid, poaching-mediated selection for the loss of a prominent anatomical trait in a keystone species.},

However, innovations in either new materials or new processing technologies can seldom be successful without a synergistic combination. We demonstrate an in situ design approach to make alloys spatially modulated in concentration by using laser-powder bed fusion. We show that the partial homogenization of two dissimilar alloy melts—Ti-6Al-4V and a small amount of 316L stainless steel—allows us to produce micrometer-scale concentration modulations of the elements that are contained in 316L in the Ti-6Al-4V matrix. The corresponding phase stability modulation creates a fine scale–modulated β + α′ dual-phase microstructure that exhibits a progressive transformation-induced plasticity effect, which leads to a high tensile strength of ~1.3 gigapascals with a uniform elongation of ~9\% and an excellent work-hardening capacity of &gt;300 megapascals. This approach creates a pathway for concentration-modulated heterogeneous alloy design for structural and functional applications.},

After breaking down wood’s lignin component and closing the vessels and fibers by evaporating water, we partially re-swell the wood in a rapid water-shock process that selectively opens the vessels. This forms a distinct wrinkled cell wall structure that allows the material to be folded and molded into desired shapes. The resulting 3D-molded wood is six times stronger than the starting wood and comparable to widely used lightweight materials such as aluminum alloys. This approach widens wood’s potential as a structural material, with lower environmental impact for buildings and transportation applications.},

The first water molecules strongly bind to the polar organic linkers; they are followed by additional water molecules forming isolated clusters, then chains of clusters, and finally a water network. This evolution of water structures led us to modify the pores by the multivariate approach, thereby precisely modulating the binding strength of the first water molecules and deliberately shaping the water uptake behavior. This resulted in higher water productivity, as well as tunability of regeneration temperature and enthalpy, without compromising capacity and stability.},

We previously identified a gut vascular barrier that controls the dissemination of bacteria from the intestine to the liver. Here, we describe a vascular barrier in the brain choroid plexus (PVB) that is modulated in response to intestinal inflammation through bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide. The inflammatory response induces PVB closure after gut vascular barrier opening by the up-regulation of the wingless-type, catenin-beta 1 (Wnt/β-catenin) signaling pathway, rendering it inaccessible to large molecules. In a model of genetically driven closure of choroid plexus endothelial cells, we observed a deficit in short-term memory and anxiety-like behavior, suggesting that PVB closure may correlate with mental deficits. Inflammatory bowel disease–related mental symptoms may thus be the consequence of a deregulated gut–brain vascular axis.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal–catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are some of the most widely used methods in chemical synthesis. However, despite notable advantages of iron (Fe) as a potentially cheaper, more abundant, and less toxic transition metal catalyst, its practical application in multicomponent cross-couplings remains largely unsuccessful. We demonstrate 1,2-bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ethane Fe–catalyzed coupling of α-boryl radicals (generated from selective radical addition to vinyl boronates) with Grignard reagents. Then, we extended the scope of these radical cascades by developing a general and broadly applicable Fe-catalyzed multicomponent annulation–cross-coupling protocol that engages a wide range of π-systems and permits the practical synthesis of cyclic fluorous compounds. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a bisarylated Fe(II) species being responsible for alkyl radical generation to initiate catalysis, while carbon-carbon bond formation proceeds between a monoarylated Fe(II) center and a transient alkyl radical.},

  abstract     = {The progression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in Africa has so far been heterogeneous, and the full impact is not yet well understood. In this study, we describe the genomic epidemiology using a dataset of 8746 genomes from 33 African countries and two overseas territories. We show that the epidemics in most countries were initiated by importations predominantly from Europe, which diminished after the early introduction of international travel restrictions. As the pandemic progressed, ongoing transmission in many countries and increasing mobility led to the emergence and spread within the continent of many variants of concern and interest, such as B.1.351, B.1.525, A.23.1, and C.1.1. Although distorted by low sampling numbers and blind spots, the findings highlight that Africa must not be left behind in the global pandemic response, otherwise it could become a source for new variants.},

We found that in rodents, neuronal activity raised the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ) in astrocyte processes located near action potential–generating sites in the axon initial segment (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier of myelinated axons. This released adenosine triphosphate, which was converted extracellularly to adenosine and thus, through A 2a receptors, activated HCN2-containing cation channels that regulate two aspects of myelinated axon function: excitability of the AIS and speed of action potential propagation. Variations in astrocyte-derived adenosine level between wake and sleep states or during energy deprivation could thus control white matter information flow and neural circuit function.},

Although CTLs show an increased reliance on glycolysis upon acquisition of effector function, we found an essential requirement for mitochondria in target cell–killing. Acute mitochondrial depletion in USP30 (ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 30)–deficient CTLs markedly diminished killing capacity, although motility, signaling, and secretion were all intact. Unexpectedly, the mitochondrial requirement was linked to mitochondrial translation, inhibition of which impaired CTL killing. Impaired mitochondrial translation triggered attenuated cytosolic translation, precluded replenishment of secreted killing effectors, and reduced the capacity of CTLs to carry out sustained killing. Thus, mitochondria emerge as a previously unappreciated homeostatic regulator of protein translation required for serial CTL killing.},

Mouse muscle injury triggers a signaling cascade involving calcium, Cdc42, and phosphokinase C that attracts myonuclei to the damaged site via microtubules and dynein. These nuclear movements accelerate sarcomere repair and locally deliver messenger RNA (mRNA) for cellular reconstruction. Myofiber self-repair is a cell-autonomous protective mechanism and represents an alternative model for understanding the restoration of muscle architecture in health and disease.},

By manipulating mechanical forces in vivo, we show here that shear stress is necessary and sufficient to promote valvulogenesis. We found that valve formation is associated with the activation of an extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–dependent purinergic receptor pathway, specifically triggering calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) pulses and nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (Nfatc1) activation. Thus, mechanical forces are converted into discrete bioelectric signals by an ATP-Ca 2+ -Nfatc1–mechanosensitive pathway to generate positional information and control valve formation.},

In budding yeast, the G 1 cyclin Cln3-Cdk1 complex is thought to directly phosphorylate the Whi5 protein, thereby releasing the transcription factor SBF and committing cells to division. We report that Whi5 is a poor substrate of Cln3-Cdk1, which instead phosphorylates the RNA polymerase II subunit Rpb1’s C-terminal domain on S 5 of its heptapeptide repeats. Cln3-Cdk1 binds SBF-regulated promoters and Cln3’s function can be performed by the canonical S 5 kinase Ccl1-Kin28 when synthetically recruited to SBF. Thus, we propose that Cln3-Cdk1 triggers cell division by phosphorylating Rpb1 at SBF-regulated promoters to promote transcription. Our findings blur the distinction between cell cycle and transcriptional Cdks to highlight the ancient relationship between these two processes.},

This synchronization, which we refer to as the boundary current synchronization (BCS), is reproduced in global climate models with high spatial resolution. Both in observations and model simulations, BCS is associated with meridional migrations of the atmospheric jet stream. Changes in the strength and path of the ocean currents associated with the jet shifts lead to the synchronicity of surface temperatures. Numerical simulations using a conceptual model and an atmospheric general circulation model are consistent with a notion that BCS is an interbasin air-sea coupled mode. Air temperature patterns similar to the one associated with BCS have been repeatedly observed, including in July of 1994 and 2018.},

We investigated a MoSe 2 homobilayer structure where interlayer coherent tunneling allows for electric field–controlled manipulation and measurement of the ground-state hole-layer pseudospin. We observed an electrically tunable two-dimensional Feshbach resonance in exciton-hole scattering, which allowed us to control the strength of interactions between excitons and holes located in different layers.

Electronic health records spanning 86,000 deliveries suggest that if the prior patient had complications in one delivery mode, the physician will be more likely to switch to the other—and likely inappropriate—delivery mode for the subsequent patient, regardless of patient indications.

  abstract     = {Although dexterity relies on the constant transmission of sensory information, unchecked feedback can be disruptive. Yet how somatosensory feedback from the hands is regulated and whether this modulation influences movement remain unclear. We found that mouse tactile afferents recruit neurons in the brainstem cuneate nucleus, whose activity is modulated by distinct classes of local inhibitory neurons. Manipulation of these inhibitory circuits suppresses or enhances the transmission of tactile information, which affects manual behaviors. Top-down cortical pathways innervate cuneate in a complementary pattern, with somatosensory cortical neurons targeting the core tactile region of cuneate and a large rostral cortical population driving feed-forward inhibition of tactile transmission through an inhibitory shell. These findings identify a circuit basis for tactile feedback modulation that enables the effective execution of dexterous movement.},

In this work, we controlled phase selectivity in templated zeolite synthesis from first principles by combining high-throughput atomistic simulations, literature mining, human-computer interaction, synthesis, and characterization. Proposed binding metrics distilled from more than 586,000 zeolite-molecule simulations reproduced the extracted literature and rationalized framework competition in the design of organic structure-directing agents. Energetic, geometric, and electrostatic descriptors of template molecules were found to regulate synthetic accessibility windows and aluminum distributions in pure-phase zeolites. Furthermore, these parameters allowed us to realize an intergrowth zeolite through a single bi-selective template. The computation-first approach enables control of both zeolite synthesis and structure composition using a priori theoretical descriptors.},

In this study, we developed a broadly applicable and quantitative classification workflow that identifies reactivity cliffs in 11 Ni- and Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling datasets using monodentate phosphine ligands. A distinctive ligand steric descriptor, minimum percent buried volume [\% V bur (min)], is found to divide these datasets into active and inactive regions at a similar threshold value. Organometallic studies demonstrate that this threshold corresponds to the binary outcome of bisligated versus monoligated metal and that\% V bur (min) is a physically meaningful and predictive representation of ligand structure in catalysis.},

Today, practices such as fines, fees, forfeitures, prison charges, and bail premiums transfer billions of dollars from oppressed communities to governments and corporations. Guided by scholarship on racial capitalism, we argue that to understand how and why criminal justice operates as it does today, one must attend to its predatory dimensions. Analytically and politically, the concept of predation connects diverse forms of criminal legal takings to one another, to the extractive regimes of earlier eras, and to contemporary businesses that financially exploit subjugated communities. Analyses that focus on predatory relations encourage a reconsideration of some dominant understandings in the study of criminal justice today.},

Here we offer a psychological account for how Americans have come to tolerate a system that is so at odds with their professed egalitarian values. We argue that beliefs about the nature of racism—as being solely due to prejudiced individuals rather than structural factors that disadvantage marginalized racial groups—work to uphold racial stratification in the criminal justice system. Although acknowledging structural racism facilitates the perception of and willingness to reduce racial inequality in criminal justice outcomes, many Americans appear willfully ignorant of structural racism in society. We reflect on the role of psychological science in shaping popular understandings of racism and discuss how to contribute more meaningfully to its reduction.},

I offer a parsimonious framework describing how the Black incarceration rate has been affected by the dynamics of exploitation and exclusion over time and across space. This framework helps to explain otherwise puzzling facts, like why the Black incarceration rate was lower in the South than in the North for much of the 20th century, why it was lowest in the South’s cotton belt, and why it began to tick upward when it did. It also enables us to better understand recent changes in racial and class inequality in incarceration in the United States.},

First, family member incarceration is now common for American families. Second, individuals who will eventually have a family member incarcerated are worse off than those who never will, even before the incarceration takes place. Third, family member incarceration has negative effects on families above and beyond these preexisting disadvantages. And finally, policy interventions that address the precursors to family member incarceration and seek to minimize family member incarceration would best enhance family well-being. If the goal is to help all American families thrive, then the importance of simultaneous changes in social and criminal justice policy cannot be overstated.},

Here, we review how spatial self-organization can aid complex systems to evade tipping points and can therefore be a signal of resilience instead. Evading tipping points through various pathways of spatial pattern formation may be relevant for many ecosystems and Earth system components that hitherto have been identified as tipping prone, including for the entire Earth system. We propose a systematic analysis that may reveal the broad range of conditions under which tipping is evaded and resilience emerges.},

We identified a universal immunodominant coronavirus-specific spike peptide (S816-830) and demonstrate that preexisting spike- and S816-830–reactive T cells were recruited into immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their frequency correlated with anti–SARS-CoV-2-S1-IgG antibodies. Spike–cross-reactive T cells were also activated after primary BNT162b2 COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccination and displayed kinetics similar to those of secondary immune responses. Our results highlight the functional contribution of preexisting spike–cross-reactive T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. Cross-reactive immunity may account for the unexpectedly rapid induction of immunity after primary SARS-CoV-2 immunization and the high rate of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 disease courses.},

We report reconstitution of a complete cyanobacterial circadian clock in vitro, including the central oscillator, signal transduction pathways, downstream transcription factor, and promoter DNA. The entire system oscillates autonomously and remains phase coherent for many days with a fluorescence-based readout that enables real-time observation of each component simultaneously without user intervention. We identified the molecular basis for loss of cycling in an arrhythmic mutant and explored fundamental mechanisms of timekeeping in the cyanobacterial clock. We find that SasA, a circadian sensor histidine kinase associated with clock output, engages directly with KaiB on the KaiC hexamer to regulate period and amplitude of the central oscillator. SasA uses structural mimicry to cooperatively recruit the rare, fold-switched conformation of KaiB to the KaiC hexamer to form the nighttime repressive complex and enhance rhythmicity of the oscillator, particularly under limiting concentrations of KaiB. Thus, the expanded in vitro clock reveals previously unknown mechanisms by which the circadian system of cyanobacteria maintains the pace and rhythmicity under variable protein concentrations.},

By combining the strong coupling between topological photons with phonons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we demonstrate a platform to control and guide hybrid states of light and lattice vibrations. The observed topological edge states of phonon-polaritons are found to carry nonzero angular momentum locked to their propagation direction, which enables their robust transport. Thus, these topological quasiparticles enable the funneling of infrared phonons mediated by helical infrared photons along arbitrary pathways and across sharp bends, thereby offering opportunities for applications ranging from Raman and vibrational spectroscopy with structured phonon-polaritons to directional heat dissipation.},

The contribution of the gut microbiota to the emergence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has not yet been addressed. We found that androgen deprivation in mice and humans promotes the expansion of defined commensal microbiota that contributes to the onset of castration resistance in mice. Specifically, the intestinal microbial community in mice and patients with CRPC was enriched for species capable of converting androgen precursors into active androgens. Ablation of the gut microbiota by antibiotic therapy delayed the emergence of castration resistance even in immunodeficient mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from CRPC mice and patients rendered mice harboring prostate cancer resistant to castration. In contrast, tumor growth was controlled by FMT from hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients and Prevotella stercorea administration. These results reveal that the commensal gut microbiota contributes to endocrine resistance in CRPC by providing an alternative source of androgens.},

The dense entanglements enable transmission of tension in a polymer chain along its length and to many other chains. The sparse cross-links prevent the polymer chains from disentangling. These polymers have high toughness, strength, and fatigue resistance. After submersion in water, the polymers swell to equilibrium, and the resulting hydrogels have low hysteresis, low friction, and high wear resistance.},

In this study, we investigated the byssus formation process in the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis , combining traditional and advanced methods to identify how and when metals are incorporated. Mussels store iron and vanadium ions in intracellular metal storage particles (MSPs) complexed with previously unknown catechol-based biomolecules. During adhesive formation, stockpiled secretory vesicles containing concentrated fluid proteins are mixed with MSPs within a microfluidic-like network of interconnected channels where they coalesce, forming protein-metal bonds within the nascent byssus. These findings advance our understanding of metal use in biological materials with implications for next-generation metallopolymers and adhesives.},

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves Parkinson’s disease symptoms acutely but does not differentiate between neuronal circuits, and its effects decay rapidly if stimulation is discontinued. Recent findings suggest that optogenetic manipulation of distinct neuronal subpopulations in the external globus pallidus (GPe) provides long-lasting therapeutic effects in dopamine-depleted (DD) mice. We used synaptic differences to excite parvalbumin-expressing GPe neurons and inhibit lim-homeobox-6–expressing GPe neurons simultaneously using brief bursts of electrical stimulation. In DD mice, circuit-inspired DBS provided long-lasting therapeutic benefits that far exceeded those induced by conventional DBS, extending several hours after stimulation. These results establish the feasibility of transforming knowledge of circuit architecture into translatable therapeutic approaches.},

However, KRAS mutations prevent the catalytic arginine of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) from enhancing an otherwise slow hydrolysis rate. If KRAS mutants are indeed insensitive to GAPs, it is unclear how KRAS G12C hydrolyzes sufficient GTP to allow inactive state–selective inhibition. Here, we show that RGS3, a GAP previously known for regulating G protein–coupled receptors, can also enhance the GTPase activity of mutant and wild-type KRAS proteins. Our study reveals an unexpected mechanism that inactivates KRAS and explains the vulnerability to emerging clinically effective therapeutics.},

  abstract     = {The utility and lifetime of materials made from polymer networks, including hydrogels, depend on their capacity to stretch and resist tearing. In gels and elastomers, those mechanical properties are often limited by the covalent chemical structure of the polymer strands between cross-links, which is typically fixed during the material synthesis. We report polymer networks in which the constituent strands lengthen through force-coupled reactions that are triggered as the strands reach their nominal breaking point. In comparison with networks made from analogous control strands, reactive strand extensions of up to 40\% lead to hydrogels that stretch 40 to 50\% further and exhibit tear energies that are twice as large. The enhancements are synergistic with those provided by double-network architectures and complement other existing toughening strategies.},

  abstract     = {Grain boundary velocity has been believed to be correlated to curvature, and this is an important relationship for modeling how polycrystalline materials coarsen during annealing. We determined the velocities and curvatures of approximately 52,000 grain boundaries in a nickel polycrystal using three-dimensional orientation maps measured by high-energy diffraction microscopy before and after annealing at 800°C. Unexpectedly, the grain boundary velocities and curvatures were uncorrelated. Instead, we found strong correlations between the boundary velocity and the five macroscopic parameters that specify grain boundary crystallography. The sensitivity of the velocity to grain boundary crystallography might be the result of defect-mediated grain boundary migration or the anisotropy of the grain boundary energy. The absence of a correlation between velocity and curvature likely results from the constraints imposed by the grain boundary network and implies the need for a new model for grain boundary migration.},

  abstract     = {Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been infecting humans for millennia and remains a global health problem, but its past diversity and dispersal routes are largely unknown. We generated HBV genomic data from 137 Eurasians and Native Americans dated between ~10,500 and ~400 years ago. We date the most recent common ancestor of all HBV lineages to between ~20,000 and 12,000 years ago, with the virus present in European and South American hunter-gatherers during the early Holocene. After the European Neolithic transition, Mesolithic HBV strains were replaced by a lineage likely disseminated by early farmers that prevailed throughout western Eurasia for ~4000 years, declining around the end of the 2nd millennium BCE. The only remnant of this prehistoric HBV diversity is the rare genotype G, which appears to have reemerged during the HIV pandemic.},

However, experimental methods for investigating chemical reaction dynamics are typically not conformer-sensitive. We report on a gas-phase megaelectronvolt ultrafast electron diffraction investigation of α-phellandrene undergoing an electrocyclic ring-opening reaction. We directly imaged the evolution of a specific set of α-phellandrene conformers into the product isomer predicted by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules in real space and time. Our experimental results are in quantitative agreement with nonadiabatic quantum molecular dynamics simulations, which provide considerable detail of how conformation influences the time scale and quantum efficiency of photoinduced ring-opening reactions.},

We found a family of methoxyethyl-amine chelants that greatly promote interfacial charge transfer kinetics and suppress side reactions on both the cathode and metal anode through solvation sheath reorganization, thus enabling stable and highly reversible cycling of the RMB and RCB full cells with energy densities of 412 and 471 watt-hours per kilogram, respectively. This work provides a versatile electrolyte design strategy for divalent metal batteries.},

Two challenges—how to comprehensively map such systems and how to identify which are under mutational selection—have hindered this understanding. Accordingly, we created a comprehensive map of cancer protein systems integrating both new and published multi-omic interaction data at multiple scales of analysis. We then developed a unified statistical model that pinpoints 395 specific systems under mutational selection across 13 cancer types. This map, called NeST (Nested Systems in Tumors), incorporates canonical processes and notable discoveries, including a PIK3CA-actomyosin complex that inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling and recurrent mutations in collagen complexes that promote tumor proliferation. These systems can be used as clinical biomarkers and implicate a total of 548 genes in cancer evolution and progression. This work shows how disparate tumor mutations converge on protein assemblies at different scales.},

To help mechanistically understand such alterations in breast-invasive carcinoma, we applied affinity purification–mass spectrometry to delineate comprehensive biophysical interaction networks for 40 frequently altered breast cancer (BC) proteins, with and without relevant mutations, across three human breast cell lines. These networks identify cancer-specific protein-protein interactions (PPIs), interconnected and enriched for common and rare cancer mutations, that are substantially rewired by the introduction of key BC mutations. Our analysis identified BPIFA1 and SCGB2A1 as PIK3CA-interacting proteins, which repress PI3K-AKT signaling, and uncovered USP28 and UBE2N as functionally relevant interactors of BRCA1. We also show that the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit spinophilin interacts with and regulates dephosphorylation of BRCA1 to promote DNA double-strand break repair. Thus, PPI landscapes provide a powerful framework for mechanistically interpreting disease genomic data and can identify valuable therapeutic targets.},

Prioritization of cancer-enriched interactions reveals a previously unidentified association of the fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase 3 with Daple, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor, resulting in activation of Gαi- and p21-activated protein kinase 1/2 to promote cancer cell migration. Additionally, we observe mutation-enriched interactions between the human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) receptor tyrosine kinase and PIK3CA (the alpha catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) that can inform the response to HER3 inhibition in vivo.

Mouse PSCs can be induced into functional oocytes and spermatozoa, whereas human PSCs can be induced into early oocytes and prospermatogonia, promoting mechanistic understanding of mammalian germ cell development. The prospect for inducing human gametes with appropriate functions has been heightened, and such advances will create possibilities in reproductive medicine, including modeling infertility to explore remedies. The use of IVG-derived gametes for human reproduction will require careful legal and ethical discussions.},

Understanding the mechanisms enabling persistence of highly transmissible pathogens in host populations is thus a central problem in disease ecology. Through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we investigated how highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease viruses persist in the African buffalo, which serves as their wildlife reservoir. We found that viral persistence through transmission among acutely infected hosts alone is unlikely. However, the inclusion of occasional transmission from persistently infected carriers reliably rescues the most infectious viral strain from fade-out. Additional mechanisms such as antigenic shift, loss of immunity, or spillover among host populations may be required for persistence of less transmissible strains.},

The nanodomains are scaled down to polar clusters of several unit cells so that polarization switching hysteresis is nearly eliminated while relatively high polarization is maintained. We achieve an ultrahigh energy density of 152 joules per cubic centimeter with markedly improved efficiency (&gt;90\% at an electric field of 3.5 megavolts per centimeter) in superparaelectric samarium-doped bismuth ferrite–barium titanate films.

Using a liquid-phase ultrafast electron diffraction technique to measure the intermolecular oxygen···oxygen and oxygen···hydrogen bonds, we captured the short-lived radical-cation complex OH(H 3 O + ) that was formed within 140 femtoseconds through a direct oxygen···oxygen bond contraction and proton transfer, followed by the radical-cation pair dissociation and the subsequent structural relaxation of water within 250 femtoseconds.

Conventional observables, such as spin susceptibility, are furthermore computed from the microscopic snapshots of the system. Starting from a magnetic polaron regime, we find the system evolves into a Fermi liquid featuring incommensurate magnetic fluctuations and fundamentally altered correlations. The crossover is completed for hole dopings around 30\%. Our work benchmarks theoretical approaches and discusses possible connections to lower-temperature phenomena.},

  abstract     = {The sustainable, undirected, and selective catalytic hydroxylation of arenes remains an ongoing research challenge because of the relative inertness of aryl carbon-hydrogen bonds, the higher reactivity of the phenolic products leading to over-oxidized by-products, and the frequently insufficient regioselectivity. We report that iron coordinated by a bioinspired l -cystine–derived ligand can catalyze undirected arene carbon-hydrogen hydroxylation with hydrogen peroxide as the terminal oxidant. The reaction is distinguished by its broad substrate scope, excellent selectivity, and good yields, and it showcases compatibility with oxidation-sensitive functional groups, such as alcohols, polyphenols, aldehydes, and even a boronic acid. This method is well suited for the synthesis of polyphenols through multiple carbon-hydrogen hydroxylations, as well as the late-stage functionalization of natural products and drug molecules.},

  abstract     = {Mitigating life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of plastics is perceived as energy intensive and costly. We developed a bottom-up model that represents the life cycle of 90\% of global plastics to examine pathways to net-zero emission plastics. Our results show that net-zero emission plastics can be achieved by combining biomass and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) utilization with an effective recycling rate of 70\% while saving 34 to 53\% of energy. Operational costs for net-zero emission plastics are in the same range as those for linear fossil-based production with carbon capture and storage and could even be substantially reduced. Realizing the full cost-saving potential of 288 billion US dollars requires low-cost supply of biomass and CO 2 , high-cost supply of oil, and incentivizing large-scale recycling and lowering investment barriers for all technologies that use renewable carbon feedstock.},

  abstract     = {Symbiotic nitrogen fixation is an energy-expensive process, and the light available to plants has been proposed to be a primary influencer. We demonstrate that the light-induced soybean TGACG-motif binding factor 3/4 (GmSTF3/4) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (GmFTs), which move from shoots to roots, interdependently induce nodule organogenesis. Rhizobium-activated calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) phosphorylates GmSTF3, triggering GmSTF3–GmFT2a complex formation, which directly activates expression of nodulation signaling pathway1 ( NSP1 ), nodule inception ( NIN ) and nuclear factor Y ( NF - YA1 and NF-YB1 ). Accordingly, the CCaMK–STF–FT module integrates aboveground light signals with underground symbiotic signaling, ensuring that the host plant informs its roots that the aboveground environment is prepared to sustainably supply the carbohydrate necessary for symbiosis. These results suggest approaches that could enhance the balance of carbon and nitrogen in the biosphere.},

Using evolutionary analysis, RNA sequencing, and biochemical experiments, we reconstructed the evolution of CRISPR-Cas9 systems from IS200/IS605 transposons. We found that IscB uses a single noncoding RNA for RNA-guided cleavage of double-stranded DNA and can be harnessed for genome editing in human cells. We also demonstrate the RNA-guided nuclease activity of TnpB, another IS200/IS605 transposon-encoded protein and the likely ancestor of Cas12 endonucleases. This work reveals a widespread class of transposon-encoded RNA-guided nucleases, which we name OMEGA (obligate mobile element–guided activity), with strong potential for developing as biotechnologies.},

The most conserved UPR sensor, IRE1α, spans the ER membrane and activates through oligomerization. IRE1α oligomers accumulate in dynamic foci. We determined the in situ structure of IRE1α foci by cryogenic correlated light and electron microscopy combined with electron cryo-tomography and complementary immuno–electron microscopy in mammalian cell lines. IRE1α foci localized to a network of narrow anastomosing ER tubes (diameter, ~28 nm) with complex branching. The lumen of the tubes contained protein filaments, which were likely composed of arrays of IRE1α lumenal domain dimers that were arranged in two intertwined, left-handed helices. This specialized ER subdomain may play a role in modulating IRE1α signaling.},

To examine the potential epidemiological and evolutionary impacts of “vaccine nationalism,” we extend previous models to include simple scenarios of stockpiling between two regions. In general, when vaccines are widely available and the immunity they confer is robust, sharing doses minimizes total cases across regions. A number of subtleties arise when the populations and transmission rates in each region differ, depending on evolutionary assumptions and vaccine availability. When the waning of natural immunity contributes most to evolutionary potential, sustained transmission in low-access regions results in an increased potential for antigenic evolution, which may result in the emergence of novel variants that affect epidemiological characteristics globally. Overall, our results stress the importance of rapid, equitable vaccine distribution for global control of the pandemic.},

By contrast, fetal hearts display considerable regenerative potential owing to the presence of less mature CMs that still have the ability to proliferate. In this study, we demonstrate that heart-specific expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) induces adult CMs to dedifferentiate, conferring regenerative capacity to adult hearts. Transient, CM-specific expression of OSKM extends the regenerative window for postnatal mouse hearts and induces a gene expression program in adult CMs that resembles that of fetal CMs. Extended expression of OSKM in CMs leads to cellular reprogramming and heart tumor formation. Short-term OSKM expression before and during myocardial infarction ameliorates myocardial damage and improves cardiac function, demonstrating that temporally controlled dedifferentiation and reprogramming enable cell cycle reentry of mammalian CMs and facilitate heart regeneration.},

To determine whether retinoids regulate the root clock, we used a chemical reporter for retinaldehyde (retinal)–binding proteins. We found that retinal binding precedes the root clock and predicts sites of lateral root organogenesis. Application of retinal increased root clock oscillations and promoted lateral root formation. Expression of an Arabidopsis protein with homology to vertebrate retinoid-binding proteins, TEMPERATURE INDUCED LIPOCALIN (TIL), oscillates in the region of retinal binding to the reporter, confers retinal-binding activity in a heterologous system, and, when mutated, decreases retinal sensitivity. These results demonstrate a role for retinal and its binding partner in lateral root organogenesis.},

The artificial starch anabolic pathway (ASAP), consisting of 11 core reactions, was drafted by computational pathway design, established through modular assembly and substitution, and optimized by protein engineering of three bottleneck-associated enzymes. In a chemoenzymatic system with spatial and temporal segregation, ASAP, driven by hydrogen, converts CO 2 to starch at a rate of 22 nanomoles of CO 2 per minute per milligram of total catalyst, an ~8.5-fold higher rate than starch synthesis in maize.

We demonstrate that high-temperature steam pretreatment of palladium catalysts provides a 12-fold increase in the mass-specific reaction rate for carbon-hydrogen (C–H) activation in methane oxidation compared with conventional pretreatments. Through a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, we demonstrate that an increase in the grain boundary density through crystal twinning is achieved during the steam pretreatment and oxidation and is responsible for the increased reactivity. The grain boundaries are highly stable during reaction and show specific rates at least two orders of magnitude higher than other sites on the palladium on alumina (Pd/Al 2 O 3 ) catalysts. Theoretical calculations show that strain introduced by the defective structure can enhance C–H bond activation.

For underdoped cuprates, this behavior is lost below the pseudogap temperature T *, where charge density waves (CDWs), together with other intertwined local orders, characterize the ground state. We found that the T -linear resistivity of highly strained, ultrathin, underdoped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7–δ films is restored when the CDW amplitude, detected by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, is suppressed. This observation suggests an intimate connection between the onset of CDWs and the departure from T -linear resistivity in underdoped cuprates.

We developed methods to estimate VNTR lengths from whole-exome sequencing data and impute VNTR alleles into single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes. Analyzing 118 protein-altering VNTRs in 415,280 UK Biobank participants for association with 786 phenotypes identified some of the strongest associations of common variants with human phenotypes, including height, hair morphology, and biomarkers of health. Accounting for large-effect VNTRs further enabled fine-mapping of associations to many more protein-coding mutations in the same genes.

Microsilicon full cells were assembled and found to achieve high areal current density, wide operating temperature range, and high areal loadings for the different cells.

  abstract     = {Microbial ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE) converts the C3–C4 fragment of the ubiquitous primary metabolite 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) to its namesake alkene product. This reaction is very different from the simple decarboxylation of 2OG to succinate promoted by related enzymes and has inspired disparate mechanistic hypotheses. We show that EFE produces stereochemically random (equal cis and trans) 1,2-[ 2 H 2 ]-ethylene from (3 S ,4 R )-[ 2 H 2 ]-2OG, appends an oxygen from O 2 on the C1-derived (bi)carbonate, and can be diverted to ω-hydroxylated monoacid products by modifications to 2OG or the enzyme. These results implicate an unusual radical-polar hybrid mechanism involving iron(II)-coordinated acylperoxycarbonate and alkylcarbonate intermediates. The mechanism explains how EFE accesses a high-energy carboxyl radical to initiate its fragmentation cascade, and it hints at capabilities of 2OG-dependent enzymes that may await discovery and exploitation.},

Here, we highlight the importance of multimodal data integration in understanding the molecular evolution of malignant cell states across the cancer life cycle. The widespread presence of driver mutations and epigenetic alterations in normal-appearing tissues is prompting a reassessment of how cancer initiation is defined. In later-stage cancers, studying the roles of clonal selection, epigenomic adaptation, and persister cells in metastasis and therapy resistance is an emerging field. Finally, the importance of tumor ecosystems in driving cancer development is being unraveled by single-cell and spatial technologies at unprecedented resolution. Improving cancer risk assessment and accelerating therapeutic discovery for patients will require robust, comprehensive, and integrated temporal, spatial, and multilevel tumor atlases across the cancer life cycle.},

Common diseases are polygenic, with many loci contributing to phenotype, and the cumulative burden of risk alleles determines individual risk in conjunction with environmental factors. Most risk loci occur in noncoding regions of the genome regulating cell- and context-specific gene expression. Although the effect sizes of most risk alleles are small, their cumulative effects in individuals, quantified as a polygenic (risk) score, can identify people at increased risk of disease, thereby facilitating prevention or early intervention.},

Although the scale of this challenge is daunting, better methods for functional variant interpretation will have transformative consequences for disease diagnosis, risk prediction, and the development of new therapies. An array of new methods for characterizing variant impact at scale, using patient tissue samples as well as in vitro models, are already being applied to dissect variant mechanisms across a range of human cell types and environments. These approaches are also increasingly being deployed in clinical settings. We discuss the rationale, approaches, applications, and future outlook for characterizing the molecular and cellular effects of genetic variants.},

  abstract     = {The interaction between free electrons and light stands at the base of both classical and quantum physics, with applications in free-electron acceleration, radiation sources, and electron microscopy. Yet to this day, all experiments involving free-electron–light interactions are fully explained by describing the light as a classical wave. We observed quantum statistics effects of photons on free-electron–light interactions. We demonstrate interactions that pass continuously from Poissonian to super-Poissonian and up to thermal statistics, revealing a transition from quantum walk to classical random walk on the free-electron energy ladder. The electron walker serves as the probe in nondestructive quantum detection, measuring the second-order photon-correlation g (2) (0) and higher-orders g ( n ) (0). Unlike conventional quantum-optical detectors, the electron can perform both quantum weak measurements and projective measurements by evolving into an entangled joint state with the photons. These findings inspire hitherto inaccessible concepts in quantum optics, including free-electron–based ultrafast quantum tomography of light.},

  abstract     = {Inflammation is a major risk factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). When occurring in the context of pancreatitis, KRAS mutations accelerate tumor development in mouse models. We report that long after its complete resolution, a transient inflammatory event primes pancreatic epithelial cells to subsequent transformation by oncogenic KRAS. Upon recovery from acute inflammation, pancreatic epithelial cells display an enduring adaptive response associated with sustained transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming. Such adaptation enables the reactivation of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) upon subsequent inflammatory events, thereby limiting tissue damage through a rapid decrease of zymogen production. We propose that because activating mutations of KRAS maintain an irreversible ADM, they may be beneficial and under strong positive selection in the context of recurrent pancreatitis.},

Here, nonhuman primates (NHPs) received either no vaccine or doses ranging from 0.3 to 100 μg of the mRNA-1273 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. mRNA-1273 vaccination elicited circulating and mucosal antibody responses in a dose-dependent manner. Viral replication was significantly reduced in bronchoalveolar lavages and nasal swabs after SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vaccinated animals and most strongly correlated with levels of anti–S antibody and neutralizing activity. Lower antibody levels were needed for reduction of viral replication in the lower airway than in the upper airway. Passive transfer of mRNA-1273–induced immunoglobulin G to naïve hamsters was sufficient to mediate protection. Thus, mRNA-1273 vaccine–induced humoral immune responses are a mechanistic correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 in NHPs.},

Retinoic acid (RA)–producing myeloid cells are central to this process, but how myeloid cells acquire retinol for conversion to RA is unknown. Here, we show that serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins—retinol-binding proteins induced in intestinal epithelial cells by the microbiota—deliver retinol to myeloid cells. We identify low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor–related protein 1 (LRP1) as an SAA receptor that endocytoses SAA-retinol complexes and promotes retinol acquisition by RA-producing intestinal myeloid cells. Consequently, SAA and LRP1 are essential for vitamin A–dependent immunity, including B and T cell homing to the intestine and immunoglobulin A production. Our findings identify a key mechanism by which vitamin A promotes intestinal immunity.},

  abstract     = {Morphological complexity is a notable feature of multicellular life, although whether it evolves gradually or in early bursts is unclear. Vascular plant reproductive structures, such as flowers, are familiar examples of complex morphology. In this study, we use a simple approach based on the number of part types to analyze changes in complexity over time. We find that reproductive complexity increased in two pulses separated by ~250 million years of stasis, including an initial rise in the Devonian with the radiation of vascular plants and a pronounced increase in the Late Cretaceous that reflects flowering plant diversification. These pulses are associated with innovations that increased functional diversity, suggesting that shifts in complexity are linked to changes in function regardless of whether they occur early or late in the history of vascular plants.},

  abstract     = {Nanostructured metals are usually strong because the ultrahigh density of internal boundaries restricts the mean free path of dislocations. Usually, they are also more brittle because of their diminished work-hardening ability. Nanotwinned materials, with coherent interfaces of mirror symmetry, can overcome this inherent trade-off. We show a bulk nanostructuring method that produces a multiscale, hierarchical twin architecture in a hexagonal closed-packed, solute-free, and coarse-grained titanium (Ti), with a substantial enhancement of tensile strength and ductility. Pure Ti achieved an ultimate tensile strength of almost 2 gigapascals and a true failure strain close to 100\% at 77 kelvin. The multiscale twin structures are thermally stable up to 873 kelvin, which is above the critical temperature for many applications in extreme environments. Our results demonstrate a practical route to achieve attractive mechanical properties in Ti without involving exotic and often expensive alloying elements.},

However, equivalent experiments with ultracold Fermi gases have remained largely unexplored. Here, we report an experimental realization of a superradiant quantum phase transition of a degenerate Fermi gas in a transversely pumped optical cavity. The self-ordering checkerboard density pattern of Fermi gases and superradiant transitions of the cavity field spontaneously emerge by increasing the pumping intensity above a threshold value. The effects of Fermi statistics are manifested by an inverse square root scaling of the threshold with atom number and the slow dynamics of low–atomic momentum states. Our work provides an ideal platform for studying nonequilibirium dynamics of many-body states for long-range interacting Fermi gases.},

Thus, exploration of homogeneous devices for these components is key for improving module integration and resistance matching. Inspired by the ferroelectric proximity effect on two-dimensional (2D) materials, we present a tungsten diselenide–on–lithium niobate cascaded architecture as a basic device that functions as a nonlinear transistor, assisting the design of operational amplifiers for analog signal processing (ASP). This device also functions as a nonvolatile memory cell, achieving memory operating (MO) functionality. On the basis of this homogeneous architecture, we also investigated an ASP-MO integrated system for binary classification and the design of ternary content-addressable memory for potential use in neuromorphic hardware.},

Here, we describe a type III-E effector from Candidatus “Scalindua brodae” ( Sb -gRAMP), which is natively encoded by a single gene with several type III domains fused together. This effector uses CRISPR RNA to guide target RNA recognition and cleaves single-stranded RNA at two defined positions six nucleotides apart. Sb -gRAMP physically combines with the caspase-like TPR-CHAT peptidase to form the CRISPR-guided caspase (Craspase) complex, suggesting a potential mechanism of target RNA–induced protease activity to gain viral immunity.},

Achieving well-controlled directional steering remains challenging because the liquid-solid interaction mainly occurs in the two-dimensional (2D) domain. We show that the spreading direction of liquids with different surface tensions can be tailored by designing 3D capillary ratchets that create an asymmetric and 3D spreading profile both in and out of the surface plane. Such directional steering is also accompanied by self-propulsion and high flow velocity, all of which are preferred in liquid transport.},

However, when this state cannot realize a continuous symmetry of the many-body Hamiltonian, a fragmented condensate exhibiting the expected symmetry may emerge. Here, we produced a three-fragment condensate for a mesoscopic spin-1 gas of about 100 atoms, with anti-ferromagnetic interactions and vanishing collective spin. Using a spin-resolved detection approaching single-atom resolution, we show that the reconstructed state is close to the expected many-body ground state, whereas one-body observables are the same as for a completely mixed state. Our results highlight how the interplay between symmetry and interactions generates entanglement in a mesoscopic quantum system.},

However, the current MFCs typically exhibit unsatisfactorily low power densities that are largely limited by the sluggish transmembrane and extracellular electron-transfer processes. Here, we report a rational strategy to boost the charge-extraction efficiency in Shewanella MFCs substantially by introducing transmembrane and outer-membrane silver nanoparticles. The resulting Shewanella -silver MFCs deliver a maximum current density of 3.85 milliamperes per square centimeter, power density of 0.66 milliwatts per square centimeter, and single-cell turnover frequency of 8.6 × 10 5 per second, which are all considerably higher than those of the best MFCs reported to date. Additionally, the hybrid MFCs feature an excellent fuel-utilization efficiency, with a coulombic efficiency of 81\%.},

We performed in vivo CRISPR screens in syngeneic mouse tumor models to examine requirements for tumorigenesis both with and without adaptive immune selective pressure. In each tumor type tested, we found a marked enrichment for the loss of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in the presence of an adaptive immune system relative to immunocompromised mice. Nearly one-third of TSGs showed preferential enrichment, often in a cancer- and tissue-specific manner. These results suggest that clonal selection of recurrent mutations found in cancer is driven largely by the tumor’s requirement to avoid the adaptive immune system.},

We report the high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structures of maturing human small subunit (SSU) processomes at resolutions of 2.7 to 3.9 angstroms. These structures reveal the molecular mechanisms that enable crucial progressions during SSU processome maturation. RNA folding states within these particles are communicated to and coordinated with key enzymes that drive irreversible steps such as targeted exosome-mediated RNA degradation, protein-guided site-specific endonucleolytic RNA cleavage, and tightly controlled RNA unwinding. These conserved mechanisms highlight the SSU processome’s impressive structural plasticity, which endows this 4.5-megadalton nucleolar assembly with the distinctive ability to mature the small ribosomal subunit from within.},

The thalamus is a likely site of secondary damage because of its reciprocal connections with the cortex. Using a mouse model of mild TBI (mTBI), we found a chronic increase in C1q expression specifically in the corticothalamic system. Increased C1q expression colocalized with neuron loss and chronic inflammation and correlated with disruption in sleep spindles and emergence of epileptic activities. Blocking C1q counteracted these outcomes, suggesting that C1q is a disease modifier in mTBI. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing demonstrated that microglia are a source of thalamic C1q. The corticothalamic circuit could thus be a new target for treating TBI-related disabilities.},

We report a flexible and efficient [P(V)]–based platform that can install a wide variety of phosphate linkages at will into oligonucleotides. This approach uses readily accessible reagents and can install not only stereodefined or racemic thiophosphates but any combination of ( S , R or rac )–PS with native phosphodiester (PO 2 ) and phosphorodithioate (PS 2 ) linkages into DNA and other modified nucleotide polymers.

They have mainly been realized as a degeneracy of resonances; however, a degeneracy associated with the absorption of waves can exhibit distinct and interesting physical features. Here, we demonstrate such an absorbing exceptional point by engineering degeneracies in the absorption spectrum of dissipative optical microcavities. We experimentally distinguished the conditions to realize an absorbing exceptional point versus a resonant exceptional point. Furthermore, when the optical loss was tuned to achieve perfect absorption at an absorbing exceptional point, we observed its signature, an anomalously broadened line shape in the absorption spectrum. The distinct scattering properties of the absorbing exceptional point create opportunities for both fundamental study and applications of non-Hermitian degeneracies.},

Here, we report the discovery of a correlated electron-hole state in double-bilayer graphene twisted to 2.37°. At this angle, the moiré states retain much of their isolated bilayer character, allowing their bilayer projections to be separately controlled by gates. We use this property to generate an energetic overlap between narrow isolated electron and hole bands with good nesting properties. Our measurements reveal the formation of ordered states with reconstructed Fermi surfaces, consistent with a density-wave state. This state can be tuned without introducing chemical dopants, enabling studies of correlated electron-hole states and their interplay with superconductivity.},

While mesolimbic dopamine signaling is sufficient to drive compulsion, psychostimulants such as cocaine also boost extracellular serotonin (5-HT) by inhibiting reuptake. We used SERT Met172 knockin (SertKI) mice carrying a transporter that no longer binds cocaine to abolish 5-HT transients during drug self-administration. SertKI mice showed an enhanced transition to compulsion. Conversely, pharmacologically elevating 5-HT reversed the inherently high rate of compulsion transition with optogenetic dopamine self-stimulation. The bidirectional effect on behavior is explained by presynaptic depression of orbitofrontal cortex–to–dorsal striatum synapses induced by 5-HT via 5-HT 1B receptors. Consequently, in projection-specific 5-HT 1B receptor knockout mice, the fraction of individuals compulsively self-administering cocaine was elevated.},

AACP-origin hydration of the stratosphere has a poorly constrained role in ozone destruction and surface warming. In this study, we use large eddy simulations corroborated by radar observations to understand the physics of AACP generation. We show that the overshooting top of a simulated supercell can act as a topographic obstacle and drive a hydraulic jump downstream at the tropopause, similar to a windstorm moving down the slope of a mountain but without solid topography. Once the jump is established, water vapor injection deep into the stratosphere may exceed 7 tonnes per second.},

In this study, we demonstrate a switching current density of ~0.1 mega-ampere per square centimeter in flexible superlattice PCM, a value that is one to two orders of magnitude lower than in conventional PCM on flexible or silicon substrates. This reduced switching current density is enabled by heat confinement in the superlattice material, assisted by current confinement in a pore-type device and the thermally insulating flexible substrate. Our devices also show multilevel operation with low resistance drift. The low switching current and good resistance on/off ratio are retained before, during, and after repeated bending and cycling. These results pave the way to low-power memory for flexible electronics and also provide key insights for PCM optimization on conventional silicon substrates.},

  abstract     = {In the cuprates, one-dimensional (1D) chain compounds provide a distinctive opportunity to understand the microscopic physics, owing to the availability of reliable theories. However, progress has been limited by the challenge of controllably doping these materials. We report the synthesis and spectroscopic analysis of the 1D cuprate Ba 2- x Sr x CuO 3+δ over a wide range of hole doping. Our angle-resolved photoemission experiments reveal the doping evolution of the holon and spinon branches. We identify a prominent folding branch whose intensity fails to match predictions of the simple Hubbard model. An additional strong near-neighbor attraction, which may arise from coupling to phonons, quantitatively explains experiments for all accessible doping levels. Considering structural and quantum chemistry similarities among cuprates, this attraction may play a similarly important role in high-temperature cuprate superconductors.},

  abstract     = {Glasses have numerous applications because of their exceptional transparency and stiffness; however, poor fracture, impact resistance, and mechanical reliability limit the range of their applications. Recent bioinspired glasses have shown superior mechanical performance, but they still suffer from reduced optical quality. Here, we present a nacreous glass composite that offers a combination of strength, toughness, and transparency. Micrometer-sized glass tablets and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were mixed and structured by centrifugation, creating dense PMMA-glass layers. A transparent composite was created by tuning the refractive index of PMMA to that of glass and using chemical functionalization to create continuous interfaces. The fabrication method is robust and scalable, and the composite may prove to be a glass alternative in diverse applications.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the mechanistic coupling of molecular oxygen reduction and proton pumping for adenosine triphosphate synthesis during cellular respiration is the primary goal of research on heme-copper oxidases—the terminal complex in the membrane-bound electron transport chain. Cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen bond by the heme-copper oxidases forms the key intermediate P M , which initiates proton pumping. This intermediate is now experimentally defined by variable-temperature, variable-field magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy on a previously unobserved excited state feature associated with its heme iron(IV)-oxo center. These data provide evidence that the iron(IV)-oxo in P M is magnetically coupled to both a copper(II) and a cross-linked tyrosyl radical in the active site. These results provide new insight into the oxygen-oxygen bond cleavage and proton-pumping mechanisms of heme-copper oxidases.},

  abstract     = {Biomolecular condensates are cellular compartments that can form by phase separation in the absence of limiting membranes. Studying the P granules of Caenorhabditis elegans , we find that condensate dynamics are regulated by protein clusters that adsorb to the condensate interface. Using in vitro reconstitution, live observations, and theory, we demonstrate that localized assembly of P granules is controlled by MEG-3, an intrinsically disordered protein that forms low dynamic assemblies on P granules. Following classic Pickering emulsion theory, MEG-3 clusters lower surface tension and slow down coarsening. During zygote polarization, MEG-3 recruits the DYRK family kinase MBK-2 to accelerate spatially regulated growth of the P granule emulsion. By tuning condensate-cytoplasm exchange, interfacial clusters regulate the structural integrity of biomolecular condensates, reminiscent of the role of lipid bilayers in membrane-bound organelles.},

Understanding how specific patterns of synaptic connectivity can implement specific neural computations will help to bridge the huge gap between the biology of the individual neuron and the function of the entire brain, allow us to better understand the neural basis of behavior, and may inspire new advances in artificial intelligence.},

  abstract     = {Oncogenes only transform cells under certain cellular contexts, a phenomenon called oncogenic competence. Using a combination of a human pluripotent stem cell–derived cancer model along with zebrafish transgenesis, we demonstrate that the transforming ability of BRAF V600E along with additional mutations depends on the intrinsic transcriptional program present in the cell of origin. In both systems, melanocytes are less responsive to mutations, whereas both neural crest and melanoblast populations are readily transformed. Profiling reveals that progenitors have higher expression of chromatin-modifying enzymes such as ATAD2, a melanoma competence factor that forms a complex with SOX10 and allows for expression of downstream oncogenic and neural crest programs. These data suggest that oncogenic competence is mediated by regulation of developmental chromatin factors, which then allow for proper response to those oncogenes.},

CMT mutant tRNA synthetases inhibit protein synthesis by an unknown mechanism. We found that CMT mutant glycyl-tRNA synthetases bound tRNA Gly but failed to release it, resulting in tRNA Gly sequestration. This sequestration potentially depleted the cellular tRNA Gly pool, leading to insufficient glycyl-tRNA Gly supply to the ribosome. Accordingly, we found ribosome stalling at glycine codons and activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) in affected motor neurons. Moreover, transgenic overexpression of tRNA Gly rescued protein synthesis, peripheral neuropathy, and ISR activation in Drosophila and mouse CMT disease type 2D (CMT2D) models. Conversely, inactivation of the ribosome rescue factor GTPBP2 exacerbated peripheral neuropathy. Our findings suggest a molecular mechanism for CMT2D, and elevating tRNA Gly levels may thus have therapeutic potential.},

Genetic evidence in mouse and Drosophila models suggests a gain-of-function mechanism. In this study, we used in vivo, cell type–specific transcriptional and translational profiling to show that mutant tRNA synthetases activate the integrated stress response (ISR) through the sensor kinase GCN2 (general control nonderepressible 2). The chronic activation of the ISR contributed to the pathophysiology, and genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of Gcn2 alleviated the peripheral neuropathy. The activation of GCN2 suggests that the aberrant activity of the mutant tRNA synthetases is still related to translation and that inhibiting GCN2 or the ISR may represent a therapeutic strategy in CMT.},

Here, we report enzymological and structural characterizations of Fdh-Hdr-Fmd complexes from Methanospirillum hungatei . The complexes catalyze this reaction using electrons from formate and the reduced form of the electron carrier F 420 . Conformational changes in HdrA mediate electron bifurcation, and polyferredoxin FmdF directly transfers electrons to the CO 2 reduction site, as evidenced by methanofuran-dependent flavin-based electron bifurcation even without free ferredoxin, a diffusible electron carrier between Hdr and Fmd.

We show that the Arabidopsis thaliana mobile florigen FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) interacts with the negatively charged phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG) at cellular membranes and binds the lipid bilayer. Perturbing PG biosynthesis in phloem companion cells leads to temperature-insensitive early flowering. Low temperatures facilitate FT sequestration in the cellular membrane of the companion cell, thus reducing soluble FT levels and delaying flowering. A mutant in PHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROLPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 1 accumulates more soluble FT at lower temperatures and exhibits reduced temperature sensitivity. Thus, cellular membranes sequester FT through their ability to bind the phospholipid PG, and this sequestration modulates the plant’s response to temperature changes.},

Using structural and functional studies, we show that the mAb with the greatest breadth (S2P6) neutralizes pseudotyped viruses from three different subgenera through the inhibition of membrane fusion, and we delineate the molecular basis for its cross-reactivity. S2P6 reduces viral burden in hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 through viral neutralization and Fc-mediated effector functions.

  abstract     = {Angular momentum plays a central role in quantum mechanics, recurring in every length scale from the microscopic interactions of light and matter to the macroscopic behavior of superfluids. Vortex beams, carrying intrinsic orbital angular momentum (OAM), are now regularly generated with elementary particles such as photons and electrons. Thus far, the creation of a vortex beam of a nonelementary particle has never been demonstrated experimentally. We present vortex beams of atoms and molecules, formed by diffracting supersonic beams of helium atoms and dimers off transmission gratings. This method is general and could be applied to most atomic and molecular gases. Our results may open new frontiers in atomic physics, using the additional degree of freedom of OAM to probe collisions and alter fundamental interactions.},

In this study, we investigated the regulatory basis of mouse cerebellum development from early neurogenesis to adulthood. By acquiring snATAC-seq (single-nucleus assay for transposase accessible chromatin using sequencing) profiles for ~90,000 cells spanning 11 stages, we mapped cerebellar cell types and identified candidate cis - regulatory elements (CREs). We detected extensive spatiotemporal heterogeneity among progenitor cells and a gradual divergence in the regulatory programs of cerebellar neurons during differentiation. Comparisons to vertebrate genomes and snATAC-seq profiles for ∼20,000 cerebellar cells from the marsupial opossum revealed a shared decrease in CRE conservation during development and differentiation as well as differences in constraint between cell types. Our work delineates the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of gene regulation in cerebellar cells and provides insights into mammalian organ development.},

How maternal infection experienced at distinct developmental stages shapes the offspring immune system remains poorly understood. Here, we show that during pregnancy, maternally restricted infection can have permanent and tissue-specific impacts on offspring immunity. Mechanistically, maternal interleukin-6 produced in response to infection can directly impose epigenetic changes on fetal intestinal epithelial stem cells, leading to long-lasting impacts on intestinal immune homeostasis. As a result, offspring of previously infected dams develop enhanced protective immunity to gut infection and increased inflammation in the context of colitis. Thus, maternal infection can be coopted by the fetus to promote long-term, tissue-specific fitness, a phenomenon that may come at the cost of predisposition to inflammatory disorders.},

The long-standing definitions of droplet and airborne transmission do not account for the mechanisms by which virus-laden respiratory droplets and aerosols travel through the air and lead to infection. In this Review, we discuss current evidence regarding the transmission of respiratory viruses by aerosols—how they are generated, transported, and deposited, as well as the factors affecting the relative contributions of droplet-spray deposition versus aerosol inhalation as modes of transmission. Improved understanding of aerosol transmission brought about by studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection requires a reevaluation of the major transmission pathways for other respiratory viruses, which will allow better-informed controls to reduce airborne transmission.},

Time-resolved crystallography can reveal time-dependent structural changes that occur within protein crystals, yielding chemical insights in unparalleled detail. Serial crystallography approaches developed at x-ray free-electron lasers are now routinely used for time-resolved diffraction studies of macromolecules. These techniques are increasingly being applied at synchrotron radiation sources and to a growing diversity of macromolecules. Here, we review recent progress in the field, including visualizing ultrafast structural changes that guide the initial trajectories of light-driven reactions as well as capturing biologically important conformational changes on slower time scales, for which bacteriorhodopsin and photosystem II are presented as illustrative case studies.},

  abstract     = {RNA molecules adopt three-dimensional structures that are critical to their function and of interest in drug discovery. Few RNA structures are known, however, and predicting them computationally has proven challenging. We introduce a machine learning approach that enables identification of accurate structural models without assumptions about their defining characteristics, despite being trained with only 18 known RNA structures. The resulting scoring function, the Atomic Rotationally Equivariant Scorer (ARES), substantially outperforms previous methods and consistently produces the best results in community-wide blind RNA structure prediction challenges. By learning effectively even from a small amount of data, our approach overcomes a major limitation of standard deep neural networks. Because it uses only atomic coordinates as inputs and incorporates no RNA-specific information, this approach is applicable to diverse problems in structural biology, chemistry, materials science, and beyond.},

However, many of the molecular mechanisms that influence host response to immunotherapy remain elusive. In this study, we show that members of the bacterial genus Enterococcus improve checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in mouse tumor models. Active enterococci express and secrete orthologs of the NlpC/p60 peptidoglycan hydrolase SagA that generate immune-active muropeptides. Expression of SagA in nonprotective E. faecalis was sufficient to promote immunotherapy response, and its activity required the peptidoglycan sensor NOD2. Notably, SagA-engineered probiotics or synthetic muropeptides also augmented anti–PD-L1 antitumor efficacy. Taken together, our data suggest that microbiota species with specialized peptidoglycan remodeling activity and muropeptide-based therapeutics may enhance cancer immunotherapy and could be leveraged as next-generation adjuvants.},

Using model simulations, we demonstrate that there exists a threshold in the level of astronomically induced insolation below which abrupt changes at the end of interglacials of the past 800,000 years occur. When decreasing insolation reaches the critical value, it triggers a strong, abrupt weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and a cooler mean climate state accompanied by high-amplitude variations lasting for several thousand years. The mechanism involves sea ice feedbacks in the Nordic and Labrador Seas. The ubiquity of this threshold suggests its fundamental role in terminating the warm climate conditions at the end of interglacials.},

The analysis of a sequencing dataset (TOPMed) reveals nine processes that explain the variation in mutation properties between loci. We provide a biological interpretation for seven of these processes. We associate one process with bulky DNA lesions that are resolved asymmetrically with respect to transcription and replication. Two processes track direction of replication fork and replication timing, respectively. We identify a mutagenic effect of active demethylation primarily acting in regulatory regions and a mutagenic effect of long interspersed nuclear elements. We localize a mutagenic process specific to oocytes from population sequencing data. This process appears transcriptionally asymmetric.},

We show that there is a positive relationship between the number of species in an area, the number of ecological functional groups, and oceanic temperature in the shallow-marine fossil record of New Zealand over a time span of ~40 million years. One implication of this relationship is that functional redundancy increases with temperature.

We present a float assembly method to fabricate a nanomembrane that meets all these requirements. The method enables a compact assembly of nanomaterials at the water–oil interface and their partial embedment in an ultrathin elastomer membrane, which can distribute the applied strain in the elastomer membrane and thus lead to a high elasticity even with the high loading of the nanomaterials. Furthermore, the structure allows cold welding and bilayer stacking, resulting in high conductivity. These properties are preserved even after high-resolution patterning by using photolithography. A multifunctional epidermal sensor array can be fabricated with the patterned nanomembranes.},

BiOCl and Bi 2 O 2 Se encapsulate these design principles for longitudinal and transverse modes, respectively, and the bulk superlattice material Bi 4 O 4 SeCl 2 combines these effects by ordering both interface types within its unit cell to reach an extremely low thermal conductivity of 0.1 watts per kelvin per meter at room temperature along its stacking direction. This value comes within a factor of four of the thermal conductivity of air. We demonstrated that chemical control of the spatial arrangement of distinct interfaces can synergically modify vibrational modes to minimize thermal conductivity.},

This unconventional transformation is orthogonal to traditional ring contractions, challenging the paradigm for diversification of heterocycles including piperidine, morpholine, thiane, tetrahydropyran, and tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives. The success of this Norrish type II variant rests on reactivity differences between photoreactive ketone groups in specific chemical environments.

HERC1 identified unassembled PSMC5 by its cognate assembly chaperone PAAF1. Because PAAF1 only dissociates after assembly, HERC1 could also engage later assembly intermediates such as the PSMC4-PSMC5-PAAF1 complex. A missense mutant of HERC1 that causes neurodegeneration in mice was impaired in the recognition and ubiquitination of the PSMC5-PAAF1 complex.

In this study, we generated a constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase DYF-5 (DYF-5CA) in Caenorhabditis elegans that disrupted sensory cilia. Genetic suppressor screens identified that mutations of ADR-2, an RNA adenosine deaminase, rescued ciliary phenotypes of dyf-5CA . We found that dyf-5CA animals abnormally transcribed antisense RNAs that pair with dyf-5CA messenger RNA (mRNA) to form double-stranded RNA, recruiting ADR-2 to edit the region ectopically. RNA editing impaired dyf-5CA mRNA splicing, and the resultant intron retentions blocked DYF-5CA protein translation and activated nonsense-mediated dyf-5CA mRNA decay. The kinase RNA editing requires kinase hyperactivity. The similar RNA editing–dependent feedback regulation restricted the other ciliary kinases NEKL-4/NEK10 and DYF-18/CCRK, which suggests a widespread mechanism that underlies kinase regulation.},

Policy-makers tasked with sustainable water resources management require an assessment of the rivers’ current status and potential future changes. We show that glacier and snow melt are important components of HK rivers, with greater hydrological importance for the Indus basin than for the Ganges and Brahmaputra basins. Total river runoff, glacier melt, and seasonality of flow are projected to increase until the 2050s, with some exceptions and large uncertainties. Critical knowledge gaps severely affect modeled contributions of different runoff components, future runoff volumes, and seasonality. Therefore, comprehensive field observation–based and remote sensing–based methods and models are needed.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression (“noise”) are often considered detrimental, but fluctuations can also be exploited for benefit (e.g., dither). We show here that DNA base excision repair amplifies transcriptional noise to facilitate cellular reprogramming. Specifically, the DNA repair protein Apex1, which recognizes both naturally occurring and unnatural base modifications, amplifies expression noise while homeostatically maintaining mean expression levels. This amplified expression noise originates from shorter-duration, higher-intensity transcriptional bursts generated by Apex1-mediated DNA supercoiling. The remodeling of DNA topology first impedes and then accelerates transcription to maintain mean levels. This mechanism, which we refer to as “discordant transcription through repair” (“DiThR,” which is pronounced “dither”), potentiates cellular reprogramming and differentiation. Our study reveals a potential functional role for transcriptional fluctuations mediated by DNA base modifications in embryonic development and disease.},

Twenty drugs significantly inhibited replication of both viruses in cultured human cells. Eight of these drugs inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro, with the most potent being masitinib, an orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor. X-ray crystallography and biochemistry show that masitinib acts as a competitive inhibitor of 3CLpro. Mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 and then treated with masitinib showed &gt;200-fold reduction in viral titers in the lungs and nose, as well as reduced lung inflammation. Masitinib was also effective in vitro against all tested variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1).},

To examine the three most common severe malaria phenotypes from catchment populations across East Africa, we assembled a dataset of 6506 hospital admissions for malaria in children aged 3 months to 9 years from 2006 to 2020. Admissions were paired with data from community parasite infection surveys. A Bayesian procedure was used to calibrate uncertainties in exposure (parasite prevalence) and outcomes (severe malaria phenotypes). Each 25\% increase in prevalence conferred a doubling of severe malaria admission rates. Severe malaria remains a burden predominantly among young children (3 to 59 months) across a wide range of community prevalence typical of East Africa. This study offers a quantitative framework for linking malaria parasite prevalence and severe disease outcomes in children.},

  abstract     = {Babbling is a production milestone in infant speech development. Evidence for babbling in nonhuman mammals is scarce, which has prevented cross-species comparisons. In this study, we investigated the conspicuous babbling behavior of Saccopteryx bilineata , a bat capable of vocal production learning. We analyzed the babbling of 20 bat pups in the field during their 3-month ontogeny and compared its features to those that characterize babbling in human infants. Our findings demonstrate that babbling in bat pups is characterized by the same eight features as babbling in human infants, including the conspicuous features reduplication and rhythmicity. These parallels in vocal ontogeny between two mammalian species offer future possibilities for comparison of cognitive and neuromolecular mechanisms and adaptive functions of babbling in bats and humans.},

  abstract     = {Zoonotic avian influenza A virus (IAV) infections are rare. Sustained transmission of these IAVs between humans has not been observed, suggesting a role for host genes. We used whole-genome sequencing to compare avian IAV H7N9 patients with healthy controls and observed a strong association between H7N9 infection and rare, heterozygous single-nucleotide variants in the MX1 gene. MX1 codes for myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA), an interferon-induced antiviral guanosine triphosphatase known to control IAV infections in transgenic mice. Most of the MxA variants identified lost the ability to inhibit avian IAVs, including H7N9, in transfected human cell lines. Nearly all of the inactive MxA variants exerted a dominant-negative effect on the antiviral function of wild-type MxA, suggesting an MxA null phenotype in heterozygous carriers. Our study provides genetic evidence for a crucial role of the MX1 -based antiviral defense in controlling zoonotic IAV infections in humans.},

Some biological composites, such as bone, have hierarchical microstructures that tolerate cracks but cannot withstand high elongation. We demonstrate a directionally solidified eutectic high-entropy alloy (EHEA) that successfully reconciles crack tolerance and high elongation. The solidified alloy has a hierarchically organized herringbone structure that enables bionic-inspired hierarchical crack buffering. This effect guides stable, persistent crystallographic nucleation and growth of multiple microcracks in abundant poor-deformability microstructures. Hierarchical buffering by adjacent dynamic strain–hardened features helps the cracks to avoid catastrophic growth and percolation. Our self-buffering herringbone material yields an ultrahigh uniform tensile elongation (~50\%), three times that of conventional nonbuffering EHEAs, without sacrificing strength.},

Although it is known that metallization takes place through filament formation, the details of how this process initiates and evolves remain elusive. We use in-operando optical reflectivity to capture the growth dynamics of the metallic phase with space and time resolution. We demonstrate that filament formation is triggered by nucleation at hotspots, with a subsequent expansion over several decades in time. By comparing three case studies (VO 2 , V 3 O 5 , and V 2 O 3 ), we identify the resistivity change across the transition as the crucial parameter governing this process. Our results provide a spatiotemporal characterization of volatile resistive switching in Mott insulators, which is important for emerging technologies, such as optoelectronics and neuromorphic computing.},

We found that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is a liquid additive broadly applied to enhance perovskite film morphology, was trapped during film formation and led to voids at perovskite-substrate interfaces that accelerated the film degradation under illumination. Partial replacement of DMSO with solid-state carbohydrazide reduces interfacial voids. A maximum stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.6\% was realized for blade-coated p-type/intrinsic/n-type (p-i-n) structure PSCs with no efficiency loss after 550-hour operational stability tests at 60°C.

We analyzed four ions that could indicate water impact from unconventional development. We found very small concentration increases associated with new HF wells for barium, chloride, and strontium but not bromide. All ions showed larger, but still small-in-magnitude, increases 91 to 180 days after well spudding. Our estimates were most pronounced for wells with larger amounts of produced water, wells located over high-salinity formations, and wells closer and likely upstream from water monitors.},

We investigated the spatial invasion dynamics of lineage B.1.1.7 by jointly analyzing UK human mobility, virus genomes, and community-based polymerase chain reaction data. We identified a multistage spatial invasion process in which early B.1.1.7 growth rates were associated with mobility and asymmetric lineage export from a dominant source location, enhancing the effects of B.1.1.7’s increased intrinsic transmissibility. We further explored how B.1.1.7 spread was shaped by nonpharmaceutical interventions and spatial variation in previous attack rates. Our findings show that careful accounting of the behavioral and epidemiological context within which variants of concern emerge is necessary to interpret correctly their observed relative growth rates.},

Among these are homologs of the capsid protein (known as Gag) of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and retroviruses. We identified several mammalian Gag homologs that form virus-like particles and one LTR retrotransposon homolog, PEG10, that preferentially binds and facilitates vesicular secretion of its own messenger RNA (mRNA). We showed that the mRNA cargo of PEG10 can be reprogrammed by flanking genes of interest with Peg10 ’s untranslated regions. Taking advantage of this reprogrammability, we developed selective endogenous encapsidation for cellular delivery (SEND) by engineering both mouse and human PEG10 to package, secrete, and deliver specific RNAs. Together, these results demonstrate that SEND is a modular platform suited for development as an efficient therapeutic delivery modality.},

We found that the two eukaryotic release factors bound together to recognize stop codons rapidly and elicit termination through a tightly regulated, multistep process that resembles transfer RNA selection during translation elongation. Because the release factors are conserved from yeast to humans, the molecular events that underlie yeast translation termination are likely broadly fundamental to eukaryotic protein synthesis.},

The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking.

Here, we present par-seqFISH (parallel sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization), a transcriptome-imaging approach that records gene expression and spatial context within microscale assemblies at a single-cell and molecule resolution. We applied this approach to the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa , analyzing about 600,000 individuals across dozens of conditions in planktonic and biofilm cultures. We identified numerous metabolic- and virulence-related transcriptional states that emerged dynamically during planktonic growth, as well as highly spatially resolved metabolic heterogeneity in sessile populations. Our data reveal that distinct physiological states can coexist within the same biofilm just several micrometers away, underscoring the importance of the microenvironment. Our results illustrate the complex dynamics of microbial populations and present a new way of studying them at high resolution.},

Two antibodies are ultrapotent, with subnanomolar neutralization titers [half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) 0.3 to 11.1 nanograms per milliliter; IC 80 1.5 to 34.5 nanograms per milliliter).

Pharmacologically, nAChRs are responsible for tobacco addiction and are targeted by medicines for hypertension and dementia. Nicotinic AChRs were the first ion channels to be isolated. Recent studies have identified molecules that control nAChR biogenesis, trafficking, and function. These nAChR accessories include protein and chemical chaperones as well as auxiliary subunits. Whereas some factors act on many nAChRs, others are receptor specific. Discovery of these regulatory mechanisms is transforming nAChR research in cells and tissues ranging from central neurons to spinal ganglia to cochlear hair cells. Nicotinic AChR–specific accessories also enable drug discovery on high-confidence targets for psychiatric, neurological, and auditory disorders.},

RBS residues Glu 484 , Lys 417 , and Asn 501 are mutated in variants first described in South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1). We analyzed their effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding, as well as the effects of two of these mutations (K417N and E484K) on nAbs isolated from COVID-19 patients. Binding and neutralization of the two most frequently elicited antibody families (IGHV3-53/3-66 and IGHV1-2), which can both bind the RBS in alternative binding modes, are abrogated by K417N, E484K, or both. These effects can be structurally explained by their extensive interactions with RBS nAbs. However, nAbs to the more conserved, cross-neutralizing CR3022 and S309 sites were largely unaffected. The results have implications for next-generation vaccines and antibody therapies.},

However, whether diet-induced changes in intestinal physiology can alter the metabolic capacity of the microbiota remains unknown. Using a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, we show that chronic exposure to a high-fat diet escalates Escherichia coli choline catabolism by altering intestinal epithelial physiology. A high-fat diet impaired the bioenergetics of mitochondria in the colonic epithelium to increase the luminal bioavailability of oxygen and nitrate, thereby intensifying respiration-dependent choline catabolism of E. coli . In turn, E. coli choline catabolism increased levels of circulating trimethlamine N -oxide, which is a potentially harmful metabolite generated by gut microbiota.},

We analyzed a large, diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 years. Total expenditure increased with fat-free mass in a power-law manner, with four distinct life stages. Fat-free mass–adjusted expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates to ~50\% above adult values at ~1 year; declines slowly to adult levels by ~20 years; remains stable in adulthood (20 to 60 years), even during pregnancy; then declines in older adults. These changes shed light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the life span.},

Here we use high temporal resolution sequential analyses of strontium isotope ratios along an entire 1.7-meter-long tusk to reconstruct the movements of an Arctic woolly mammoth that lived 17,100 years ago, during the last ice age. We use an isotope-guided random walk approach to compare the tusk’s strontium and oxygen isotope profiles to isotopic maps. Our modeling reveals patterns of movement across a geographically extensive range during the animal’s ~28-year life span that varied with life stages. Maintenance of this level of mobility by megafaunal species such as mammoth would have been increasingly difficult as the ice age ended and the environment changed at high latitudes.},

  abstract     = {An unconventional superconducting state was recently discovered in uranium ditelluride (UTe 2 ), in which spin-triplet superconductivity emerges from the paramagnetic normal state of a heavy-fermion material. The coexistence of magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity, together with the crystal structure of this material, suggests that a distinctive set of symmetries, magnetic properties, and topology underlie the superconducting state. Here, we report observations of a nonzero polar Kerr effect and of two transitions in the specific heat upon entering the superconducting state, which together suggest that the superconductivity in UTe 2 is characterized by a two-component order parameter that breaks time-reversal symmetry. These data place constraints on the symmetries of the order parameter and inform the discussion on the presence of topological superconductivity in UTe 2 .},

  abstract     = {Molecular time trees indicating that embryophytes originated around 500 million years ago (Ma) during the Cambrian are at odds with the record of fossil plants, which first appear in the mid-Silurian almost 80 million years later. This time gap has been attributed to a missing fossil plant record, but that attribution belies the case for fossil spores. Here, we describe a Tremadocian (Early Ordovician, about 480 Ma) assemblage with elements of both Cambrian and younger embryophyte spores that provides a new level of evolutionary continuity between embryophytes and their algal ancestors. This finding suggests that the molecular phylogenetic signal retains a latent evolutionary history of the acquisition of the embryophytic developmental genome, a history that perhaps began during Ediacaran-Cambrian time but was not completed until the mid-Silurian (about 430 Ma).},

Physical processes in the accretion flow lead to stochastic variability of this emission on a wide range of time scales. We measured the optical continuum variability observed in 67 active galactic nuclei and the characteristic time scale at which the variability power spectrum flattens. We found a correlation between this time scale and the black hole mass extending over the entire mass range of supermassive black holes. This time scale is consistent with the expected thermal time scale at the ultraviolet-emitting radius in standard accretion disk theory. Accreting white dwarfs lie close to this correlation, suggesting a common process for all accretion disks.},

Polyacetals are promising candidates for CRM but lack useful tensile strengths owing to the low molecular weights produced using current uncontrolled cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) methods. Here, we present reversible-deactivation CROP of cyclic acetals using a commercial halomethyl ether initiator and an indium(III) bromide catalyst. Using this method, we synthesize poly(1,3-dioxolane) (PDXL), which demonstrates tensile strength comparable to some commodity polyolefins. Depolymerization of PDXL using strong acid catalysts returns monomer in near-quantitative yield and even proceeds from a commodity plastic waste mixture. Our efficient polymerization method affords a tough thermoplastic that can undergo selective depolymerization to monomer.},

By merging two optical tweezers, each containing a single molecule, we probed collisions in three dimensions. The correct combination of microwave frequency and power created an effective repulsive shield, which suppressed the inelastic loss rate by a factor of six, in agreement with theoretical calculations. The demonstrated microwave shielding shows a general route to the creation of long-lived, dense samples of ultracold polar molecules and evaporative cooling.},

We report the discovery of a family of copper-dependent lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) in plant pathogenic oomycetes and its role in plant infection by P. infestans . We show that LPMO-encoding genes are up-regulated early during infection and that the secreted enzymes oxidatively cleave the backbone of pectin, a charged polysaccharide in the plant cell wall. The crystal structure of the most abundant of these LPMOs sheds light on its ability to recognize and degrade pectin, and silencing the encoding gene in P. infestans inhibits infection of potato, indicating a role in host penetration. The identification of LPMOs as virulence factors in pathogenic oomycetes opens up opportunities in crop protection and food security.},

We used cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to define the mechanism that underlies this process by characterizing the transposition regulator, TnsC, from a type V-K CRISPR-transposase system. In this scenario, polymerization of adenosine triphosphate–bound TnsC helical filaments could explain how polarity information is passed to the transposase. TniQ caps the TnsC filament, representing a universal mechanism for target information transfer in Tn7/Tn7-like elements. Transposase-driven disassembly establishes delivery of the element only to unused protospacers. Finally, TnsC transitions to define the fixed point of insertion, as revealed by structures with the transition state mimic ADP•AlF 3 . These mechanistic findings provide the underpinnings for engineering CRISPR-associated transposition systems for research and therapeutic applications.},

Barrett’s esophagus is a common metaplastic condition that increases the risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma, and its cellular origin is enigmatic. To address this, we harvested tissues spanning the gastroesophageal junction from healthy and diseased donors, including isolation of esophageal submucosal glands. A combination of single-cell transcriptomic profiling, in silico lineage tracing from methylation, open chromatin and somatic mutation analyses, and functional studies in organoid models showed that Barrett’s esophagus originates from gastric cardia through c-MYC and HNF4A-driven transcriptional programs. Furthermore, our data indicate that esophageal adenocarcinoma likely arises from undifferentiated Barrett’s esophagus cell types even in the absence of a pathologically identifiable metaplastic precursor, illuminating early detection strategies.},

We combined cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), binding, and computational analyses to study variant spikes, including one that was involved in transmission between minks and humans, and others that originated and spread in human populations. All variants showed increased angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding and increased propensity for receptor binding domain (RBD)–up states. While adaptation to mink resulted in spike destabilization, the B.1.1.7 (UK) spike balanced stabilizing and destabilizing mutations. A local destabilizing effect of the RBD E484K mutation was implicated in resistance of the B.1.1.28/P.1 (Brazil) and B.1.351 (South Africa) variants to neutralizing antibodies. Our studies revealed allosteric effects of mutations and mechanistic differences that drive either interspecies transmission or escape from antibody neutralization.},

Gag is subsequently cleaved into its component domains, causing structural maturation to repurpose the virion for cell entry. We determined the structure and arrangement of MA within immature and mature HIV-1 through cryo–electron tomography. We found that MA rearranges between two different hexameric lattices upon maturation. In mature HIV-1, a lipid extends out of the membrane to bind with a pocket in MA. Our data suggest that proteolytic maturation of HIV-1 not only assembles the viral capsid surrounding the genome but also repurposes the membrane-bound MA lattice for an entry or postentry function and results in the partial removal of up to 2500 lipids from the viral membrane.},

Their success at making split-second, potentially life-threatening decisions of biomechanical capability depends on their skillful use of acrobatic maneuvers and learning from past efforts. Here, we found that free-ranging fox squirrels ( Sciurus niger ) leaping across unfamiliar, simulated branches decided where to launch by balancing a trade-off between gap distance and branch-bending compliance. Squirrels quickly learned to modify impulse generation upon repeated leaps from unfamiliar, compliant beams. A repertoire of agile landing maneuvers enabled targeted leaping without falling. Unanticipated adaptive landing and leaping “parkour” behavior revealed an innovative solution for particularly challenging leaps. Squirrels deciding and learning how to launch and land demonstrates the synergistic roles of biomechanics and cognition in robust gap-crossing strategies.},

Through scalable industrial textile manufacturing routes, our metafabrics exhibit desirable mechanical strength, waterproofness, and breathability for commercial clothing while maintaining efficient radiative cooling ability. Practical application tests demonstrated that a human body covered by our metafabric could be cooled ~4.8°C lower than one covered by commercial cotton fabric. The cost-effectiveness and high performance of our metafabrics present substantial advantages for intelligent garments, smart textiles, and passive radiative cooling applications.},

Such monolayer electrolytes show promise in achieving bioinspired functionalities through molecular control of ion transport. However, the understanding of ion dynamics in these systems is still scarce. Here, we develop an analytical theory, backed up by molecular dynamics simulations, that predicts strongly nonlinear effects in ion transport across quasi–two-dimensional slits. We show that under an electric field, ions assemble into elongated clusters, whose slow dynamics result in hysteretic conduction. This phenomenon, known as the memristor effect, can be harnessed to build an elementary neuron. As a proof of concept, we carry out molecular simulations of two nanofluidic slits that reproduce the Hodgkin-Huxley model and observe spontaneous emission of voltage spikes characteristic of neuromorphic activity.},

Eliminating diffusive interfaces by fabricating single crystals or heavily alloying helps to address this issue but does not inhibit atomic diffusion at high homologous temperatures. We discovered that the Schwarz crystal structure was effective at suppressing atomic diffusion in a supersaturated aluminum–magnesium alloy with extremely fine grains. By forming these stable structures, diffusion-controlled intermetallic precipitation from the nanosized grains and their coarsening were inhibited up to the equilibrium melting temperature, around which the apparent across-boundary diffusivity was reduced by about seven orders of magnitude. Developing advanced engineering alloys using the Schwarz crystal structure may lead to useful properties for high-temperature applications.},

Direct time-domain measurements of •QOOH unimolecular dissociation rates over a wide range of energies were found to be in accord with those predicted theoretically using state-of-the-art electronic structure characterizations of the transition state barrier region. Unimolecular decay was enhanced by substantial heavy-atom tunneling involving O-O elongation and C-C-O angle contraction along the reaction pathway. Master equation modeling yielded a fully a priori prediction of the pressure-dependent thermal unimolecular dissociation rates for the •QOOH intermediate—again increased by heavy-atom tunneling—which are required for global models of atmospheric and combustion chemistry.},

Here, we realize a many-body quantum-enhanced sensor to detect displacements and electric fields using a crystal of ~150 trapped ions. The center-of-mass vibrational mode of the crystal serves as a high- Q mechanical oscillator, and the collective electronic spin serves as the measurement device. By entangling the oscillator and collective spin and controlling the coherent dynamics via a many-body echo, a displacement is mapped into a spin rotation while avoiding quantum back-action and thermal noise. We achieve a sensitivity to displacements of 8.8 ± 0.4 decibels below the standard quantum limit and a sensitivity for measuring electric fields of 240 ± 10 nanovolts per meter in 1 second. Feasible improvements should enable the use of trapped ions in searches for dark matter.},

Pair -knockout mice exhibited excessive blood phenylalanine (Phe), musty odor, hypopigmentation, growth retardation, and progressive neurological symptoms including seizures, which faithfully models human PKU. HULC depletion led to reduced PAH enzymatic activities in human induced pluripotent stem cell–differentiated hepatocytes. Mechanistically, HULC modulated the enzymatic activities of PAH by facilitating PAH-substrate and PAH-cofactor interactions. To develop a therapeutic strategy for restoring liver lncRNAs, we designed GalNAc-tagged lncRNA mimics that exhibit liver enrichment.

  abstract     = {We report de novo genome assemblies, transcriptomes, annotations, and methylomes for the 26 inbreds that serve as the founders for the maize nested association mapping population. The number of pan-genes in these diverse genomes exceeds 103,000, with approximately a third found across all genotypes. The results demonstrate that the ancient tetraploid character of maize continues to degrade by fractionation to the present day. Excellent contiguity over repeat arrays and complete annotation of centromeres revealed additional variation in major cytological landmarks. We show that combining structural variation with single-nucleotide polymorphisms can improve the power of quantitative mapping studies. We also document variation at the level of DNA methylation and demonstrate that unmethylated regions are enriched for cis-regulatory elements that contribute to phenotypic variation.},

Plasma from individuals vaccinated with a Wuhan-1 isolate–based messenger RNA vaccine or from convalescent individuals exhibited neutralizing titers that were reduced 2- to 3.5-fold against the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant relative to wild-type pseudoviruses. The L452R mutation reduced neutralizing activity in 14 of 34 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The S13I and W152C mutations resulted in total loss of neutralization for 10 of 10 NTD-specific mAbs because the NTD antigenic supersite was remodeled by a shift of the signal peptide cleavage site and the formation of a new disulfide bond, as revealed by mass spectrometry and structural studies.},

We report here cryo–electron microscopy structures of the full-length spike (S) trimers of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, as well as their biochemical and antigenic properties. Amino acid substitutions in the B.1.1.7 protein increase both the accessibility of its receptor binding domain and the binding affinity for receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The enhanced receptor engagement may account for the increased transmissibility. The B.1.351 variant has evolved to reshape antigenic surfaces of the major neutralizing sites on the S protein, making it resistant to some potent neutralizing antibodies. These findings provide structural details on how SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to enhance viral fitness and immune evasion.},

Scatter-hoarding rodents benefit plant species by carrying seeds to areas with more space for growth and increasing the number of seeds that germinate and grow. Forest fragmentation has compromised scatter-hoarding rodent habitats, causing population declines worldwide. In turn, disruption of dispersal mutualisms may predispose some trees to population decline or even local extinction (1). However, compared with large mammals, scatter-hoarding rodents have been largely overlooked in conservation plans.},

However, molecular insight into the reciprocal dynamics of phage-bacterial adaptations in nature is lacking, particularly in clinical contexts where there is need to inform phage therapy efforts and to understand how phages drive pathogen evolution. Using time-shift experiments, we uncovered fluctuations in Vibrio cholerae ’s resistance to phages in clinical samples. We mapped phage resistance determinants to SXT integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), which notoriously also confer antibiotic resistance. We found that SXT ICEs, which are widespread in γ-proteobacteria, invariably encode phage defense systems localized to a single hotspot of genetic exchange. We identified mechanisms that allow phage to counter SXT-mediated defense in clinical samples, and document the selection of a novel phage-encoded defense inhibitor. Phage infection stimulates high-frequency SXT ICE conjugation, leading to the concurrent dissemination of phage and antibiotic resistances.},

Here, we show that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) stimulates T cells to induce selective white adipose loss, which protects against obesity, improves glucose metabolism, and mitigates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Unexpectedly, adipose loss was not caused by alterations in food intake, absorption, or energy expenditure. Rather, it was induced by the excessive loss of lipids through the skin as sebum. TSLP and T cells regulated sebum release and sebum-associated antimicrobial peptide expression in the steady state. In human skin, TSLP expression correlated directly with sebum-associated gene expression. Thus, we establish a paradigm in which adipose loss can be achieved by means of sebum hypersecretion and uncover a role for adaptive immunity in skin barrier function through sebum secretion.},

Here, we show in aged mice that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling insufficiency, which is caused by increased production of decoy receptors, may drive physiological aging across multiple organ systems. Increasing VEGF signaling prevented age-associated capillary loss, improved organ perfusion and function, and extended life span. Healthier aging was evidenced by favorable metabolism and body composition and amelioration of aging-associated pathologies including hepatic steatosis, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, “inflammaging” (age-related multiorgan chronic inflammation), and increased tumor burden. These results indicate that VEGF signaling insufficiency affects organ aging in mice and suggest that modulating this pathway may result in increased mammalian life span and improved overall health.},

Pp PIEZO1 and Pp PIEZO2 redundantly contribute to the normal growth, size, and cytoplasmic calcium oscillations of caulonemal cells. Both Pp PIEZO1 and Pp PIEZO2 localized to vacuolar membranes. Loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and overexpression mutants revealed that moss PIEZO homologs promote increased complexity of vacuolar membranes through tubulation, internalization, and/or fission. Arabidopsis PIEZO1 also localized to the tonoplast and is required for vacuole tubulation in the tips of pollen tubes. We propose that in plant cells the tonoplast has more freedom of movement than the plasma membrane, making it a more effective location for mechanosensory proteins.},

These cells responded to faces that were personally familiar.

They discriminated between familiar identities, as fast as a general face identity area. The discovery of these cells establishes a new pathway for the fast recognition of familiar individuals.},

The ground state is classically described by the ice rule, and we achieved control over a fragile degeneracy point, leading to a Coulomb phase. The ability to pin individual spins allows us to demonstrate Gauss’s law for emergent effective monopoles in two dimensions.

Although hybrid perovskites have potential in various device applications, challenges remain in the development of high-quality materials with simultaneously improved processing reproducibility and scalability. Here, we report a liquid medium annealing (LMA) technology that creates a robust chemical environment and constant heating field to modulate crystal growth over the entire film. Our method produces films with high crystallinity, fewer defects, desired stoichiometry, and overall film homogeneity. The resulting perovskite solar cells (PSCs) yield a stabilized power output of 24.04\% (certified 23.7\%, 0.08 cm 2 ) and maintain 95\% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 2000 hours of operation. In addition, the 1-cm 2 PSCs exhibit a stabilized power output of 23.15\% (certified PCE 22.3\%) and keep 90\% of their initial PCE after 1120 hours of operation, which illustrates their feasibility for scalable fabrication. LMA is less climate dependent and produces devices in-house with negligible performance variance year round. This method thus opens a new and effective avenue to improving the quality of perovskite films and photovoltaic devices in a scalable and reproducible manner.},

For all of the 23 cationic amphiphilic drugs we tested, including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, amiodarone, and four others already in clinical trials, phospholipidosis was monotonically correlated with antiviral efficacy. Conversely, drugs active against the same targets that did not induce phospholipidosis were not antiviral. Phospholipidosis depends on the physicochemical properties of drugs and does not reflect specific target-based activities—rather, it may be considered a toxic confound in early drug discovery. Early detection of phospholipidosis could eliminate these artifacts, enabling a focus on molecules with therapeutic potential.},

  abstract     = {Interkingdom competition occurs between hymenopteran parasitoids and insect viruses sharing the same insect hosts. It has been assumed that parasitoid larvae die with the death of the infected host or as result of competition for host resources. Here we describe a gene family, parasitoid killing factor ( pkf ), that encodes proteins toxic to parasitoids of the Microgastrinae group and determines parasitism success. Pkfs are found in several entomopathogenic DNA virus families and in some lepidopteran genomes. We provide evidence of equivalent and specific toxicity against endoparasites for PKFs found in entomopoxvirus, ascovirus, baculovirus, and Lepidoptera through a mechanism that elicits apoptosis in the cells of susceptible parasitoids. This highlights the evolutionary arms race between parasitoids, viruses, and their insect hosts.},

Promising pharmacological advances in insulin therapy include the refinement of extremely rapid insulin analogs, alternate insulin-delivery routes, liver-selective insulins, add-on drugs that enhance insulin effect, and glucose-responsive insulin molecules. The greatest future impact will come from combining these pharmacological solutions with existing automated insulin delivery methods that integrate insulin pumps and glucose sensors. These systems will use algorithms enhanced by machine learning, supplemented by technologies that include activity monitors and sensors for other key metabolites such as ketones. The future challenges facing clinicians and researchers will be those of access and broad clinical implementation.},

Genetic and environmental factors increase T1D risk by compromising immune homeostasis. Although the discovery and use of insulin have transformed T1D treatment, insulin therapy does not change the underlying disease or fully prevent complications. Over the past two decades, research has identified multiple immune cell types and soluble factors that destroy insulin-producing β cells. These insights into disease pathogenesis have enabled the development of therapies to prevent and modify T1D. In this review, we highlight the key events that initiate and sustain pancreatic islet inflammation in T1D, the current state of the immunological therapies, and their advantages for the treatment of T1D.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that monitoring for pancreatic islet autoantibodies, combined with genetic risk assessment, can identify most children who will develop T1D when they still have sufficient β cell function to control glucose concentrations without the need for insulin. In addition, there has been recent success in secondary prevention using immunotherapy to delay the progression of preclinical disease, and primary prevention approaches to inhibiting the initiating autoimmune process have entered large-scale clinical trials. By changing the focus of T1D management from late diagnosis and insulin replacement to early diagnosis and β cell preservation, we can anticipate a future without the need for daily insulin injections for children with T1D.},

B cells reach the meninges from the calvaria through specialized vascular connections. This calvarial–meningeal path of B cell development may provide the CNS with a constant supply of B cells educated by CNS antigens. Conversely, we show that a subset of antigen-experienced B cells that populate the meninges in aging mice are blood-borne. These results identify a private source for meningeal B cells, which may help maintain immune privilege within the CNS.},

We uncovered extensive kinetic partitioning to a misfolded state and isolated catalytic effects, revealing spatially contiguous regions of residues linked to particular aspects of function.

Here, we report that the mouse meninges contain a pool of monocytes and neutrophils supplied not from the blood but by adjacent skull and vertebral bone marrow. Under pathological conditions, including spinal cord injury and neuroinflammation, CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells can originate from brain borders and display transcriptional signatures distinct from their blood-derived counterparts. Thus, CNS borders are populated by myeloid cells from adjacent bone marrow niches, strategically placed to supply innate immune cells under homeostatic and pathological conditions. These findings call for a reinterpretation of immune-cell infiltration into the CNS during injury and autoimmunity and may inform future therapeutic approaches that harness meningeal immune cells.},

Although the liver generates most of the HDL in the blood, HDL synthesis also occurs in the small intestine. Here, we show that intestine-derived HDL traverses the portal vein in the HDL 3 subspecies form, in complex with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–binding protein (LBP). HDL 3 , but not HDL 2 or low-density lipoprotein, prevented LPS binding to and inflammatory activation of liver macrophages and instead supported extracellular inactivation of LPS. In mouse models involving surgical, dietary, or alcoholic intestinal insult, loss of intestine-derived HDL worsened liver injury, whereas outcomes were improved by therapeutics that elevated and depended upon raising intestinal HDL. Thus, protection of the liver from injury in response to gut-derived LPS is a major function of intestinally synthesized HDL.},

Spontaneous retinal activity prior to eye opening guides the refinement of retinotopy and eye-specific segregation in mammals, but its role in the development of higher-order visual response properties remains unclear. Here, we describe a transient window in neonatal mouse development during which the spatial propagation of spontaneous retinal waves resembles the optic flow pattern generated by forward self-motion. We show that wave directionality requires the same circuit components that form the adult direction-selective retinal circuit and that chronic disruption of wave directionality alters the development of direction-selective responses of superior colliculus neurons. These data demonstrate how the developing visual system patterns spontaneous activity to simulate ethologically relevant features of the external world and thereby instruct self-organization.},

Analysis of 160 direct observations revealed individual styles and site-specific differences. We describe a full pathway from the spread of innovation to emergence of geographic variation, evidencing foraging cultures in parrots and indicating the existence of cultural complexity in parrots.

Strong quenching of the triplet lifetime is observed if oxygen molecules are coadsorbed in close proximity. By means of single-molecule manipulation techniques, different arrangements with oxygen molecules were created and characterized with atomic precision, allowing for the direct correlation of molecular arrangements with the lifetime of the quenched triplet. Such electrical addressing of long-lived triplets of single molecules, combined with atomic-scale manipulation, offers previously unexplored routes to control and study local spin-spin interactions.},

Nonradiative processes proportionately reduce photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY), a performance metric that directly dictates the maximum device efficiency. Although transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers exhibit near-unity PL QY at low exciton densities, nonradiative exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) enhanced by van-Hove singularity (VHS) rapidly degrades their PL QY at high exciton densities and limits their utility in practical applications. Here, by applying small mechanical strain (less than 1\%), we circumvented VHS resonance and markedly suppressed EEA in monolayer TMDCs, resulting in near-unity PL QY at all exciton densities despite the presence of a high native defect density. Our findings can enable light-emitting devices that retain high efficiency at all brightness levels.},

We detected reflections of seismic waves from the core-mantle boundary of Mars using InSight seismic data and inverted these together with geodetic data to constrain the radius of the liquid metal core to 1830 ± 40 kilometers. The large core implies a martian mantle mineralogically similar to the terrestrial upper mantle and transition zone but differing from Earth by not having a bridgmanite-dominated lower mantle. We inferred a mean core density of 5.7 to 6.3 grams per cubic centimeter, which requires a substantial complement of light elements dissolved in the iron-nickel core. The seismic core shadow as seen from InSight’s location covers half the surface of Mars, including the majority of potentially active regions—e.g., Tharsis—possibly limiting the number of detectable marsquakes.},

Here, we determine the structure of the crust beneath the InSight landing site on Mars using both marsquake recordings and the ambient wavefield. By analyzing seismic phases that are reflected and converted at subsurface interfaces, we find that the observations are consistent with models with at least two and possibly three interfaces. If the second interface is the boundary of the crust, the thickness is 20 ± 5 kilometers, whereas if the third interface is the boundary, the thickness is 39 ± 8 kilometers. Global maps of gravity and topography allow extrapolation of this point measurement to the whole planet, showing that the average thickness of the martian crust lies between 24 and 72 kilometers. Independent bulk composition and geodynamic constraints show that the thicker model is consistent with the abundances of crustal heat-producing elements observed for the shallow surface, whereas the thinner model requires greater concentration at depth.},

  abstract     = {For 2 years, the InSight lander has been recording seismic data on Mars that are vital to constrain the structure and thermochemical state of the planet. We used observations of direct ( P and S ) and surface-reflected ( PP , PPP , SS , and SSS ) body-wave phases from eight low-frequency marsquakes to constrain the interior structure to a depth of 800 kilometers. We found a structure compatible with a low-velocity zone associated with a thermal lithosphere much thicker than on Earth that is possibly related to a weak S -wave shadow zone at teleseismic distances. By combining the seismic constraints with geodynamic models, we predict that, relative to the primitive mantle, the crust is more enriched in heat-producing elements by a factor of 13 to 20. This enrichment is greater than suggested by gamma-ray surface mapping and has a moderate-to-elevated surface heat flow.},

  abstract     = {Two promising architectures for solid-state quantum information processing are based on electron spins electrostatically confined in semiconductor quantum dots and the collective electrodynamic modes of superconducting circuits. Superconducting electrodynamic qubits involve macroscopic numbers of electrons and offer the advantage of larger coupling, whereas semiconductor spin qubits involve individual electrons trapped in microscopic volumes but are more difficult to link. We combined beneficial aspects of both platforms in the Andreev spin qubit: the spin degree of freedom of an electronic quasiparticle trapped in the supercurrent-carrying Andreev levels of a Josephson semiconductor nanowire. We performed coherent spin manipulation by combining single-shot circuit–quantum-electrodynamics readout and spin-flipping Raman transitions and found a spin-flip time T S = 17 microseconds and a spin coherence time T 2E = 52 nanoseconds. These results herald a regime of supercurrent-mediated coherent spin-photon coupling at the single-quantum level.},

  abstract     = {The Crab Nebula is a bright source of gamma rays powered by the Crab Pulsar’s rotational energy through the formation and termination of a relativistic electron-positron wind. We report the detection of gamma rays from this source with energies from 5 × 10 −4 to 1.1 peta–electron volts with a spectrum showing gradual steepening over three energy decades. The ultrahigh-energy photons imply the presence of a peta–electron volt electron accelerator (a pevatron) in the nebula, with an acceleration rate exceeding 15\% of the theoretical limit. We constrain the pevatron’s size between 0.025 and 0.1 parsecs and the magnetic field to ≈110 microgauss. The production rate of peta–electron volt electrons, 2.5 × 10 36 ergs per second, constitutes 0.5\% of the pulsar spin-down luminosity, although we cannot exclude a contribution of peta–electron volt protons to the production of the highest-energy gamma rays.},

  abstract     = {Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) regulate immunity and cell death. In Arabidopsis , a subfamily of “helper” NLRs is required by many “sensor” NLRs. Active NRG1.1 oligomerized, was enriched in plasma membrane puncta, and conferred cytoplasmic calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) influx in plant and human cells. NRG1.1-dependent Ca 2+ influx and cell death were sensitive to Ca 2+ channel blockers and were suppressed by mutations affecting oligomerization or plasma membrane enrichment. Ca 2+ influx and cell death mediated by NRG1.1 and ACTIVATED DISEASE RESISTANCE 1 (ADR1), another helper NLR, required conserved negatively charged N-terminal residues. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings demonstrated that Arabidopsis helper NLRs form Ca 2+ -permeable cation channels to directly regulate cytoplasmic Ca 2+ levels and consequent cell death. Thus, helper NLRs transduce cell death signals directly.},

  abstract     = {Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates metabolism in response to the cellular energy states. Under energy stress, AMP stabilizes the active AMPK conformation, in which the kinase activation loop (AL) is protected from protein phosphatases, thus keeping the AL in its active, phosphorylated state. At low AMP:ATP (adenosine triphosphate) ratios, ATP inhibits AMPK by increasing AL dynamics and accessibility. We developed conformation-specific antibodies to trap ATP-bound AMPK in a fully inactive, dynamic state and determined its structure at 3.5-angstrom resolution using cryo–electron microscopy. A 180° rotation and 100-angstrom displacement of the kinase domain fully exposes the AL. On the basis of the structure and supporting biophysical data, we propose a multistep mechanism explaining how adenine nucleotides and pharmacological agonists modulate AMPK activity by altering AL phosphorylation and accessibility.},

We show that the population distribution of viral loads observed under random or symptom-based surveillance—in the form of cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained from reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing—changes during an epidemic. Thus, Ct values from even limited numbers of random samples can provide improved estimates of an epidemic’s trajectory. Combining data from multiple such samples improves the precision and robustness of this estimation. We apply our methods to Ct values from surveillance conducted during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in a variety of settings and offer alternative approaches for real-time estimates of epidemic trajectories for outbreak management and response.},

  abstract     = {Activation of cell-autonomous defense by the immune cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is critical to the control of life-threatening infections in humans. IFN-γ induces the expression of hundreds of host proteins in all nucleated cells and tissues, yet many of these proteins remain uncharacterized. We screened 19,050 human genes by CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis and identified IFN-γ–induced apolipoprotein L3 (APOL3) as a potent bactericidal agent protecting multiple non–immune barrier cell types against infection. Canonical apolipoproteins typically solubilize mammalian lipids for extracellular transport; APOL3 instead targeted cytosol-invasive bacteria to dissolve their anionic membranes into human-bacterial lipoprotein nanodiscs detected by native mass spectrometry and visualized by single-particle cryo–electron microscopy. Thus, humans have harnessed the detergent-like properties of extracellular apolipoproteins to fashion an intracellular lysin, thereby endowing resident nonimmune cells with a mechanism to achieve sterilizing immunity.},

The formation of GCs has been studied in detail, but less is known about what leads to their regression and eventual termination, factors that ultimately limit the extent to which antibodies mature within a single reaction. We show that contraction of immunization-induced GCs is immediately preceded by an acute surge in GC-resident Foxp3 + T cells, attributed at least partly to up-regulation of the transcription factor Foxp3 by T follicular helper (T FH ) cells. Ectopic expression of Foxp3 in T FH cells is sufficient to decrease GC size, implicating the natural up-regulation of Foxp3 by T FH cells as a potential regulator of GC lifetimes.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the pronounced vulnerability of the elderly and chronically ill to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)–induced morbidity and mortality. Cellular senescence contributes to inflammation, multiple chronic diseases, and age-related dysfunction, but effects on responses to viral infection are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that senescent cells (SnCs) become hyper-inflammatory in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-1, increasing expression of viral entry proteins and reducing antiviral gene expression in non-SnCs through a paracrine mechanism. Old mice acutely infected with pathogens that included a SARS-CoV-2–related mouse β-coronavirus experienced increased senescence and inflammation, with nearly 100\% mortality. Targeting SnCs by using senolytic drugs before or after pathogen exposure significantly reduced mortality, cellular senescence, and inflammatory markers and increased antiviral antibodies. Thus, reducing the SnC burden in diseased or aged individuals should enhance resilience and reduce mortality after viral infection, including that of SARS-CoV-2.},

  abstract     = {Oocytes mature in a specialized fluid-filled sac, the ovarian follicle, which provides signals needed for meiosis and germ cell growth. Methods have been developed to generate functional oocytes from pluripotent stem cell–derived primordial germ cell–like cells (PGCLCs) when placed in culture with embryonic ovarian somatic cells. In this study, we developed culture conditions to recreate the stepwise differentiation process from pluripotent cells to fetal ovarian somatic cell–like cells (FOSLCs). When FOSLCs were aggregated with PGCLCs derived from mouse embryonic stem cells, the PGCLCs entered meiosis to generate functional oocytes capable of fertilization and development to live offspring. Generating functional mouse oocytes in a reconstituted ovarian environment provides a method for in vitro oocyte production and follicle generation for a better understanding of mammalian reproduction.},

However, surfaces used in diverse real-world applications need to effectively control the accrual of matter across multiple phases and fouling length scales. We discuss the surface design strategies aimed at controlling the accretion of different states of matter, particularly those that work across multiple length scales and different foulants.

Using stroboscopic electron diffraction, we perform synchronized time-resolved measurements of atomic motions and electronic transport in operating vanadium dioxide (VO 2 ) switches. We discover an electrically triggered, isostructural state that forms transiently on microsecond time scales, which is shown by phase-field simulations to be stabilized by local heterogeneities and interfacial interactions between the equilibrium phases. This metastable phase is similar to that formed under photoexcitation within picoseconds, suggesting a universal transformation pathway. Our results establish electrical excitation as a route for uncovering nonequilibrium and metastable phases in correlated materials, opening avenues for engineering dynamical behavior in nanoelectronics.},

Relationships between offspring and other hyenas bear resemblance to those of their mothers for as long as 6 years, and the degree of similarity increases with maternal social rank. Mother-offspring relationship strength affects social inheritance and is positively correlated with offspring longevity. These results support the hypothesis that social inheritance of relationships can structure animal social networks and be subject to adaptive tradeoffs.},

Between vertebrate clades, however, these regions are anatomically distinct and appear to produce different spatial patterns of neural activity. We asked whether hippocampal activity is fundamentally different even between distant vertebrates that share a strong dependence on spatial memory. We studied tufted titmice, food-caching birds capable of remembering many concealed food locations. We found mammalian-like neural activity in the titmouse hippocampus, including sharp-wave ripples and anatomically organized place cells. In a non–food-caching bird species, spatial firing was less informative and was exhibited by fewer neurons. These findings suggest that hippocampal circuit mechanisms are similar between birds and mammals, but that the resulting patterns of activity may vary quantitatively with species-specific ethological needs.},

We present a wafer-scale approach to creating piezoelectric biomaterial thin films based on γ-glycine crystals. The thin film has a sandwich structure, where a crystalline glycine layer self-assembles and automatically aligns between two polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) thin films. The heterostructured glycine-PVA films exhibit piezoelectric coefficients of 5.3 picocoulombs per newton or 157.5 × 10 −3 volt meters per newton and nearly an order of magnitude enhancement of the mechanical flexibility compared with pure glycine crystals. With its natural compatibility and degradability in physiological environments, glycine-PVA films may enable the development of transient implantable electromechanical devices.},

Current technologies based on zeolites deactivate too rapidly for practical application. We found that similar active sites hosted in different zeolite lattices can exhibit markedly different reactivity with methane, depending on the size of the zeolite pore apertures. Whereas zeolite with large pore apertures deactivates completely after a single turnover, 40\% of active sites in zeolite with small pore apertures are regenerated, enabling a catalytic cycle. Detailed spectroscopic characterization of reaction intermediates and density functional theory calculations show that hindered diffusion through small pore apertures disfavors premature release of CH 3 radicals from the active site after C-H activation, thereby promoting radical recombination to form methanol rather than deactivated Fe-OCH 3 centers elsewhere in the lattice.},

After an evaluation, these bans were strengthened in 2018 (3). In May, the Court of Justice of the European Union upheld the legality of these bans (4). However, this decision does not address a loophole used by many EU member states to continue to permit the use of neonicotinoids.},

  abstract     = {Bees and other pollinators play vital roles in biodiversity and food security, and they are a source of income and inspiration. Yet, bees&#39; biodiversity and abundance are decreasing every day. Their decline, driven by pesticides (1–3), poses serious threats to the environment, ecosystems, and human health. The European pesticide authorization framework states that a pesticide can only be put on the market if it has no harmful effects on human health or animal health and no unacceptable effects on the environment (4). EU ministries met in June to decide what constitutes an “acceptable” effect of a pesticide on bees (5). Despite scientific evidence indicating that the current level of protection is barely adequate, they tentatively agreed to provide even less protection moving forward (5). We call on EU governments to apply the maximum level of protection of pollinators from pesticides (6).},

  abstract     = {After publication of the Report “Global acceleration in rates of vegetation change over the past 18,000 years,” a bug was detected in the R-Ratepol code that affected the assignment of ages to individual time bins. The code should have assigned the average age estimate of the bin to each bin but instead assigned the average of the ages based on samples in that same bin. Correcting this error tends to further amplify Late Holocene rates of change relative to earlier periods while having no effect on the main conclusions drawn in the paper. Figures 2, 3, and 4 have been corrected, and reference 40 has been updated to direct readers to the corrected code. An alternative analysis with rates of change calculated only between adjacent time bins did not substantively differ from the corrected results. The authors thank R. Telford for drawing attention to these potential concerns.

We examined 25,381 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Germany, including 6110 from test centers attended by presymptomatic, asymptomatic, and mildly symptomatic (PAMS) subjects, 9519 who were hospitalized, and 1533 B.1.1.7 lineage infections. The viral load of the youngest subjects was lower than that of the older subjects by 0.5 (or fewer) log 10 units, and they displayed an estimated ~78\% of the peak cell culture replication probability; in part this was due to smaller swab sizes and unlikely to be clinically relevant. Viral loads above 10 9 copies per swab were found in 8\% of subjects, one-third of whom were PAMS, with a mean age of 37.6 years. We estimate 4.3 days from onset of shedding to peak viral load (10 8.1 RNA copies per swab) and peak cell culture isolation probability (0.75). B.1.1.7 subjects had mean log 10 viral load 1.05 higher than that of non-B.1.1.7 subjects, and the estimated cell culture replication probability of B.1.1.7 subjects was higher by a factor of 2.6.},

Because Down syndrome leukemogenesis initiates during fetal development, we characterized the cellular and developmental context of preleukemic initiation and leukemic progression using gene editing in human disomic and trisomic fetal hematopoietic cells and xenotransplantation. GATA binding protein 1 ( GATA1 ) mutations caused transient preleukemia when introduced into trisomy 21 long-term hematopoietic stem cells, where a subset of chromosome 21 microRNAs affected predisposition to preleukemia. By contrast, progression to leukemia was independent of trisomy 21 and originated in various stem and progenitor cells through additional mutations in cohesin genes. CD117 + /KIT proto-oncogene (KIT) cells mediated the propagation of preleukemia and leukemia, and KIT inhibition targeted preleukemic stem cells.},

Such hybrid states can be generated by simply placing a material in the spatially confined electromagnetic field of an optical resonator, such as that provided by two parallel mirrors. This occurs even in the dark because it is electromagnetic fluctuations of the cavity (the vacuum field) that strongly couple with the material. Experimental and theoretical studies have shown that the mere presence of these hybrid states can enhance properties such as transport, magnetism, and superconductivity and modify (bio)chemical reactivity. This emerging field is highly multidisciplinary, and much of its potential has yet to be explored.},

However, active navigation, especially at high speeds, may require representing navigational information beyond the present moment. Using wireless electrophysiological recordings in freely flying bats, we demonstrate that neural activity in area CA1 predominantly encodes nonlocal spatial information up to meters away from the bat’s present position. This spatiotemporal representation extends both forward and backward in time, with an emphasis on future locations, and is found during both random exploration and goal-directed navigation. The representation of position thus extends along a continuum, with each moment containing information about past, present, and future, and may provide a key mechanism for navigating along self-selected and remembered paths.},

We found that the catalytic subunit of the RdRp, nsp12, ligates two iron-sulfur metal cofactors in sites that were modeled as zinc centers in the available cryo–electron microscopy structures of the RdRp complex. These metal binding sites are essential for replication and for interaction with the viral helicase. Oxidation of the clusters by the stable nitroxide TEMPOL caused their disassembly, potently inhibited the RdRp, and blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. These iron-sulfur clusters thus serve as cofactors for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and are targets for therapy of COVID-19.},

Many other organisms rely instead on RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by a specialized Dicer protein that cleaves viral double-stranded RNA. Whether RNAi also contributes to mammalian antiviral immunity remains controversial. We identified an isoform of Dicer, named antiviral Dicer (aviD), that protects tissue stem cells from RNA viruses—including Zika virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—by dicing viral double-stranded RNA to orchestrate antiviral RNAi. Our work sheds light on the molecular regulation of antiviral RNAi in mammalian innate immunity, in which different cell-intrinsic antiviral pathways can be tailored to the differentiation status of cells.},

In this study, we identify a single early sensory shift of the umami receptor (the T1R1-T1R3 heterodimer) that conferred sweet-sensing abilities in songbirds, a large evolutionary radiation containing nearly half of all living birds. We demonstrate sugar responses across species with diverse diets, uncover critical sites underlying carbohydrate detection, and identify the molecular basis of sensory convergence between songbirds and nectar-specialist hummingbirds. This early shift shaped the sensory biology of an entire radiation, emphasizing the role of contingency and providing an example of the genetic basis of convergence in avian evolution.},

As a thermogenic adaptation for living in cool water, sea otters have a basal metabolic rate approximately three times that of the predicted rate; however, the tissue-level source of this hypermetabolism is unknown. Because skeletal muscle is a major determinant of whole-body metabolism, we characterized respiratory capacity and thermogenic leak in sea otter muscle. Compared with that of previously sampled mammals, thermogenic muscle leak capacity was elevated and could account for sea otter hypermetabolism. Muscle respiratory capacity was modestly elevated and reached adult levels in neonates. Premature metabolic development and high leak rate indicate that sea otter muscle metabolism is regulated by thermogenic demand and is the source of basal hypermetabolism.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates brings us tantalizingly close to a material class that mirrors the cuprate superconductors. We measured the magnetic excitations in these nickelates using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering at the Ni L 3 -edge. Undoped NdNiO 2 possesses a branch of dispersive excitations with a bandwidth of approximately 200 milli–electron volts, which is reminiscent of the spin wave of strongly coupled, antiferromagnetically aligned spins on a square lattice. The substantial damping of these modes indicates the importance of coupling to rare-earth itinerant electrons. Upon doping, the spectral weight and energy decrease slightly, whereas the modes become overdamped. Our results highlight the role of Mottness in infinite-layer nickelates.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic effects are an important determinant of chemical reactivity and selectivity, but the deliberate manipulation of atomic motions during a chemical transformation is not straightforward. Here, we demonstrate that extrinsic force exerted upon cyclobutanes by stretching pendant polymer chains influences product selectivity through force-imparted nonstatistical dynamic effects on the stepwise ring-opening reaction. The high product stereoselectivity is quantified by carbon-13 labeling and shown to depend on external force, reactant stereochemistry, and intermediate stability. Computational modeling and simulations show that, besides altering energy barriers, the mechanical force activates reactive intramolecular motions nonstatistically, setting up “flyby trajectories” that advance directly to product without isomerization excursions. A mechanistic model incorporating nonstatistical dynamic effects accounts for isomer-dependent mechanochemical stereoselectivity.},

  abstract     = {Successive earthquakes can drive landscape evolution. However, the mechanism and pace with which landscapes respond remain poorly understood. Offset channels in the Carrizo Plain, California, capture the fluvial response to lateral slip on the San Andreas Fault on millennial time scales. We developed and tested a model that quantifies competition between fault slip, which elongates channels, and aggradation, which causes channel infilling and, ultimately, abandonment. Validation of this model supports a transport-limited fluvial response and implies that measurements derived from present-day channel geometry are sufficient to quantify the rate of bedload transport relative to slip rate. Extension of the model identifies the threshold for which persistent change in transport capacity, obliquity in slip, or advected topography results in reorganization of the drainage network.},

  abstract     = {Mars’ sedimentary rock record preserves information on geological (and potential astrobiological) processes that occurred on the planet billions of years ago. The Curiosity rover is exploring the lower reaches of Mount Sharp, in Gale crater on Mars. A traverse from Vera Rubin ridge to Glen Torridon has allowed Curiosity to examine a lateral transect of rock strata laid down in a martian lake ~3.5 billion years ago. We report spatial differences in the mineralogy of time-equivalent sedimentary rocks &lt;400 meters apart. These differences indicate localized infiltration of silica-poor brines, generated during deposition of overlying magnesium sulfate–bearing strata. We propose that destabilization of silicate minerals driven by silica-poor brines (rarely observed on Earth) was widespread on ancient Mars, because sulfate deposits are globally distributed.},

  abstract     = {Throughout development, plant meristems regularly produce organs in defined spiral, opposite, or whorl patterns. Cauliflowers present an unusual organ arrangement with a multitude of spirals nested over a wide range of scales. How such a fractal, self-similar organization emerges from developmental mechanisms has remained elusive. Combining experimental analyses in an Arabidopsis thaliana cauliflower-like mutant with modeling, we found that curd self-similarity arises because the meristems fail to form flowers but keep the “memory” of their transient passage in a floral state. Additional mutations affecting meristem growth can induce the production of conical structures reminiscent of the conspicuous fractal Romanesco shape. This study reveals how fractal-like forms may emerge from the combination of key, defined perturbations of floral developmental programs and growth dynamics.},

We demonstrate that ice grown as single-crystal ice microfibers (IMFs) with diameters ranging from 10 micrometers to less than 800 nanometers is highly elastic. Under cryotemperature, we could reversibly bend the IMFs up to a maximum strain of 10.9\%, which approaches the theoretical elastic limit. We also observed a pressure-induced phase transition of ice from Ih to II on the compressive side of sharply bent IMFs. The high optical quality allows for low-loss optical waveguiding and whispering-gallery-mode resonance in our IMFs. The discovery of these flexible ice fibers opens opportunities for exploring ice physics and ice-related technology on micro- and nanometer scales.},

Here, we leveraged 16,234 gut microbiome profiles, collected over 14 years from 585 wild baboons, to reveal that host genetic effects on the gut microbiome are nearly universal. Controlling for diet, age, and socioecological variation, 97\% of microbiome phenotypes were significantly heritable, including several reported as heritable in humans. Heritability was typically low (mean = 0.068) but was systematically greater in the dry season, with low diet diversity, and in older hosts. We show that longitudinal profiles and large sample sizes are crucial to quantifying microbiome heritability, and indicate scope for selection on microbiome characteristics as a host phenotype.},

  abstract     = {The plant male germline undergoes DNA methylation reprogramming, which methylates genes de novo and thereby alters gene expression and regulates meiosis. Here, we reveal the molecular mechanism underlying this reprogramming. We demonstrate that genic methylation in the male germline, from meiocytes to sperm, is established by 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) transcribed from transposons with imperfect sequence homology. These siRNAs are synthesized by meiocyte nurse cells (tapetum) through activity of CLSY3, a chromatin remodeler absent in other anther cells. Tapetal siRNAs govern germline methylation throughout the genome, including the inherited methylation patterns in sperm. Tapetum-derived siRNAs also silence germline transposons, safeguarding genome integrity. Our results reveal that tapetal siRNAs are sufficient to reconstitute germline methylation patterns and drive functional methylation reprogramming throughout the male germline.},

We sequenced the exomes of 645,626 individuals from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Mexico and estimated associations of rare coding variants with body mass index (BMI). We identified 16 genes with an exome-wide significant association with BMI, including those encoding five brain-expressed G protein–coupled receptors ( CALCR , MC4R , GIPR , GPR151 , and GPR75 ). Protein-truncating variants in GPR75 were observed in ~4/10,000 sequenced individuals and were associated with 1.8 kilograms per square meter lower BMI and 54\% lower odds of obesity in the heterozygous state. Knock out of Gpr75 in mice resulted in resistance to weight gain and improved glycemic control in a high-fat diet model. Inhibition of GPR75 may provide a therapeutic strategy for obesity.},

  abstract     = {The mechanisms by which macrophages regulate energy storage remain poorly understood. We identify in a genetic screen a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)–family ortholog, Pvf3, that is produced by macrophages and is required for lipid storage in fat-body cells of Drosophila larvae. Genetic and pharmacological experiments indicate that the mouse Pvf3 ortholog PDGFcc, produced by adipose tissue–resident macrophages, controls lipid storage in adipocytes in a leptin receptor– and C-C chemokine receptor type 2–independent manner. PDGFcc production is regulated by diet and acts in a paracrine manner to control lipid storage in adipose tissues of newborn and adult mice. At the organismal level upon PDGFcc blockade, excess lipids are redirected toward thermogenesis in brown fat. These data identify a macrophage-dependent mechanism, conducive to the design of pharmacological interventions, that controls energy storage in metazoans.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic biological networks comprising fast, reversible reactions could enable engineering of new cellular behaviors that are not possible with slower regulation. Here, we created a bistable toggle switch in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a cross-repression topology comprising 11 protein-protein phosphorylation elements. The toggle is ultrasensitive, can be induced to switch states in seconds, and exhibits long-term bistability. Motivated by our toggle’s architecture and size, we developed a computational framework to search endogenous protein pathways for other large and similar bistable networks. Our framework helped us to identify and experimentally verify five formerly unreported endogenous networks that exhibit bistability. Building synthetic protein-protein networks will enable bioengineers to design fast sensing and processing systems, allow sophisticated regulation of cellular processes, and aid discovery of endogenous networks with particular functions.},

Here, we report the 0.99-angstrom-resolution structure of the proposed ethane-activating enzyme and describe the specific traits that distinguish it from methane-generating and -consuming methyl-coenzyme M reductases. The widened catalytic chamber, harboring a dimethylated nickel-containing F 430 cofactor, would adapt the chemistry of methyl-coenzyme M reductases for a two-carbon substrate. A sulfur from methionine replaces the oxygen from a canonical glutamine as the nickel lower-axial ligand, a feature conserved in thermophilic ethanotrophs. Specific loop extensions, a four-helix bundle dilatation, and posttranslational methylations result in the formation of a 33-angstrom-long hydrophobic tunnel, which guides the ethane to the buried active site as confirmed with xenon pressurization experiments.},

However, current spatial transcriptomics methods either average local contexts or are restricted to limited fields of view. Here, we introduce sci-Space, which retains single-cell resolution while resolving spatial heterogeneity at larger scales. Applying sci-Space to developing mouse embryos, we captured approximate spatial coordinates and whole transcriptomes of about 120,000 nuclei. We identify thousands of genes exhibiting anatomically patterned expression, leverage spatial information to annotate cellular subtypes, show that cell types vary substantially in their extent of spatial patterning, and reveal correlations between pseudotime and the migratory patterns of differentiating neurons. Looking forward, we anticipate that sci-Space will facilitate the construction of spatially resolved single-cell atlases of mammalian development.},

Such an imbalance promoted the search for a missing plastic sink that could explain the rapid removal of river-sourced plastics from the ocean surface. On the basis of an in-depth statistical reanalysis of updated data on microplastics—a size fraction for which both ocean and river sampling rely on equal techniques—we demonstrate that current river flux assessments are overestimated by two to three orders of magnitude. Accordingly, the average residence time of microplastics at the ocean surface rises from a few days to several years, strongly reducing the theoretical need for a missing sink.},

Nonetheless, their inherent thermal instability has precluded any catalytic application so far. By using multiple inorganic cation and charge density mismatch approaches, we synthesized PST-32 and PST-2, a thermally stable aluminosilicate version of UCSB-10 and the hypothetical SBS / SBT intergrowth family member, respectively. This study suggests that many hypothetical cage-based zeolite structures with multidimensional channel systems can be synthesized as compositionally robust forms by systematically exploring the synergy effect of inorganic and organic structure–directing agents.},

We report heterogeneously integrated laser soliton microcombs combining both indium phospide/silicon (InP/Si) semiconductor lasers and ultralow-loss silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4 ) microresonators on a monolithic silicon substrate. Thousands of devices can be produced from a single wafer by using complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor–compatible techniques. With on-chip electrical control of the laser-microresonator relative optical phase, these devices can output single-soliton microcombs with a 100-gigahertz repetition rate. Furthermore, we observe laser frequency noise reduction due to self-injection locking of the InP/Si laser to the Si 3 N 4 microresonator. Our approach provides a route for large-volume, low-cost manufacturing of narrow-linewidth, chip-based frequency combs for next-generation high-capacity transceivers, data centers, space and mobile platforms.},

In this study, we demonstrate that the appearance of subgap states in such structures is actually governed by the junction region in tunneling spectroscopy measurements and not the full-shell nanowire itself. Short tunneling regions never show subgap states, whereas longer junctions always do. This can be understood in terms of quantum dots forming in the junction and hosting Andreev levels in the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov regime. The intricate magnetic field dependence of the Andreev levels, through both the Zeeman and Little-Parks effects, may result in robust zero-bias peaks—features that could be easily misinterpreted as originating from Majorana zero modes but are unrelated to topological superconductivity.},

Unconventional astrocyte connexin signaling hinders expression of extracellular matrix–degrading enzyme matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) through RhoA–guanosine triphosphatase activation.

At the elemental level, plastics are predominantly carbon. The comparison of plastic stocks and fluxes to those of carbon reveals that the quantities of plastics present in some ecosystems rival the quantity of natural organic carbon and suggests that geochemists should now consider plastics in their analyses. Acknowledging plastics as geomaterials and adopting geochemical insights and methods can expedite our understanding of plastics in the Earth system. Plastics also can be used as global-scale tracers to advance Earth system science.},

  abstract     = {Plastics have become an essential material of the modern global consumer economy, yet many of the properties that make them useful in so many applications also make them a serious environmental threat. As for much new technology, their development and proliferation occurred with little consideration for their impacts, but now it is impossible to deny their dark side as we confront a rapidly growing plastic pollution problem. In this special issue, we examine a range of topics related to plastics, from their distribution in the environment to their development into an evolutionary trap for animals to ways we can rethink them to create a better future. A series of Reviews discusses how plastics are best understood as novel geomaterials, the evolutionary and ecological dimensions of plastic ingestion by wildlife, the accumulation and effects of plastic pollution in the environment, and how innovations in upcycling and recycling may affect the fate of plastics and drive advances in next-generation materials design. Complementing these Reviews, a Policy Forum and a pair of Perspectives discuss efforts to develop a global agreement to combat plastic pollution, provide an overview of the history of environmental bioplastics and their implications, and offer suggestions for designing plastics for a circular bioeconomy. Finally, a brace of News Features explores how enzymes are being used to aid in plastic recycling efforts and how museums are trying to stop plastics in their exhibits from breaking down. The time for preventing plastic pollution is long past—the time for changing the future of plastics in our world, however, is now.},

A genome-wide CRISPR screen to uncover mediators of caspase-8–dependent pyroptosis identified an unexpected role of the lysosomal folliculin (FLCN)–folliculin-interacting protein 2 (FNIP2)–Rag-Ragulator supercomplex, which regulates metabolic signaling and the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). In response to Yersinia infection, Fas-associated death domain (FADD), RIPK1, and caspase-8 were recruited to Rag-Ragulator, causing RIPK1 phosphorylation and caspase-8 activation. Pyroptosis activation depended on Rag guanosine triphosphatase activity and lysosomal tethering of Rag-Ragulator but not mTORC1. Thus, the lysosomal metabolic regulator Rag-Ragulator instructs the inflammatory response to Yersinia .},

The composition and assembly of stress granules is well understood, but little is known about the mechanisms that govern disassembly. Impaired disassembly has been implicated in some diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and multisystem proteinopathy. Using cultured human cells, we found that stress granule disassembly was context-dependent: Specifically in the setting of heat shock, disassembly required ubiquitination of G3BP1, the central protein within the stress granule RNA-protein network. We found that ubiquitinated G3BP1 interacted with the endoplasmic reticulum–associated protein FAF2, which engaged the ubiquitin-dependent segregase p97/VCP (valosin-containing protein). Thus, targeting of G3BP1 weakened the stress granule–specific interaction network, resulting in granule disassembly.},

Here we show that mouse MeCP2 is a microsatellite binding protein that specifically recognizes hydroxymethylated CA repeats. Depletion of MeCP2 alters chromatin organization of CA repeats and lamina-associated domains and results in nucleosome accumulation on CA repeats and genome-wide transcriptional dysregulation. The structure of MeCP2 in complex with a hydroxymethylated CA repeat reveals a characteristic DNA shape, with considerably modified geometry at the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, which is recognized specifically by Arg 133 , a key residue whose mutation causes Rett syndrome. Our work identifies MeCP2 as a microsatellite DNA binding protein that targets the 5hmC-modified CA-rich strand and maintains genome regions nucleosome-free, suggesting a role for MeCP2 dysfunction in Rett syndrome.},

The primary function of this ubiquitination is thought to be for tagging damaged or misfolded proteins for degradation. Here, working in mammalian cultured cells, we found that different stresses elicited distinct ubiquitination patterns. For heat stress, ubiquitination targeted specific proteins associated with cellular activities that are down-regulated during stress, including nucleocytoplasmic transport and translation, as well as stress granule constituents. Ubiquitination was not required for the shutdown of these processes or for stress granule formation but was essential for the resumption of cellular activities and for stress granule disassembly. Thus, stress-induced ubiquitination primes the cell for recovery after heat stress.},

Synthesizing monoliths is much more difficult because sintering techniques can destroy continuity and limit mechanical strength. We manufactured inorganic monoliths of amorphous calcium carbonate by the fusion of particles while regulating structurally bound water and external pressure. Our monoliths are transparent, owing to their structural continuity, with a mechanical strength approaching that of single-crystal calcite. Dynamic water channels within the amorphous bulk are synergistically controlled by water content and applied pressure and promote mass transportation for particle fusion. Our strategy provides an alternative to traditional sintering methods that should be attractive for constructing monoliths of temperature-sensitive biominerals and biomaterials.},

Here, we report a stable ferroelectric order emerging at the interface between two naturally grown flakes of hexagonal boron nitride, which are stacked together in a metastable non-centrosymmetric parallel orientation. We observe alternating domains of inverted normal polarization, caused by a lateral shift of one lattice site between the domains. Reversible polarization switching coupled to lateral sliding is achieved by scanning a biased tip above the surface. Our calculations trace the origin of the phenomenon to a subtle interplay between charge redistribution and ionic displacement and provide intuitive insights to explore the interfacial polarization and its distinctive “slidetronics” switching mechanism.},

Parallel-stacked bilayer boron nitride exhibits out-of-plane electric polarization that reverses depending on the stacking order. The polarization switching is probed through the resistance of an adjacently stacked graphene sheet. Twisting the boron nitride sheets by a small angle changes the dynamics of switching because of the formation of moiré ferroelectricity with staggered polarization. The ferroelectricity persists to room temperature while keeping the high mobility of graphene, paving the way for potential ultrathin nonvolatile memory applications.},

We detected a PDW state whose electron-pair density and energy gap modulate spatially at the wave vectors of the preexisting charge density wave (CDW) state. The PDW couples linearly to both the s -wave superconductor and the CDW and exhibits commensurate domains with discommensuration phase slips at the boundaries, conforming those of the lattice-locked commensurate CDW. Nevertheless, we found a global δ Φ ≅ ± 2 π / 3 phase difference between the PDW and CDW states, possibly owing to the Cooper-pair wave function orbital content.

  abstract     = {Airborne transmission by droplets and aerosols is important for the spread of viruses. Face masks are a well-established preventive measure, but their effectiveness for mitigating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission is still under debate. We show that variations in mask efficacy can be explained by different regimes of virus abundance and are related to population-average infection probability and reproduction number. For SARS-CoV-2, the viral load of infectious individuals can vary by orders of magnitude. We find that most environments and contacts are under conditions of low virus abundance (virus-limited), where surgical masks are effective at preventing virus spread. More-advanced masks and other protective equipment are required in potentially virus-rich indoor environments, including medical centers and hospitals. Masks are particularly effective in combination with other preventive measures like ventilation and distancing.},

  abstract     = {DNA methylation is associated with transcriptional repression of eukaryotic genes and transposons, but the downstream mechanism of gene silencing is largely unknown. Here, we describe two Arabidopsis thaliana methyl-CpG–binding domain proteins, MBD5 and MBD6, that are recruited to chromatin by recognition of CG methylation, and redundantly repress a subset of genes and transposons without affecting DNA methylation levels. These methyl readers recruit a ﻿J-domain protein, SILENZIO, that acts as a transcriptional repressor in loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments. J-domain proteins often serve as co-chaperones with HSP70s. Indeed, we found that SILENZIO’s conserved J-domain motif was required for its interaction with HSP70s and for its silencing function. These results uncover an unprecedented role of a molecular chaperone J-domain protein in gene silencing downstream of DNA methylation.},

Radiometric ages, along with cultural and stratigraphic considerations, suggest that the fossils are 140,000 to 120,000 years old, chronologically overlapping with H. sapiens in western Asia. Lithic analysis reveals that MP Homo mastered stone-tool production technologies, previously known only among H. sapiens and Neanderthals. The Levallois knapping methods they used are indistinguishable from that of concurrent H. sapiens in western Asia. The most parsimonious explanation for such a close similarity is the cultural interactions between these two populations. These findings constitute evidence of contacts and interactions between H. sapiens and MP Homo .},

  abstract     = {It has long been believed that Neanderthals originated and flourished on the European continent. However, recent morphological and genetic studies have suggested that they may have received a genetic contribution from a yet unknown non-European group. Here we report on the recent discovery of archaic Homo fossils from the site of Nesher Ramla, Israel, which we dated to 140,000 to 120,000 years ago. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analyses of the parietal bones, mandible, and lower second molar revealed that this Homo group presents a distinctive combination of Neanderthal and archaic features. We suggest that these specimens represent the late survivors of a Levantine Middle Pleistocene paleodeme that was most likely involved in the evolution of the Middle Pleistocene Homo in Europe and East Asia.},

We analyzed T and B cell responses after first-dose vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech messenger RNA vaccine BNT162b2 in health care workers (HCW) followed longitudinally, with or without prior Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 infection. After one dose, individuals with prior infection showed enhanced T cell immunity, antibody-secreting memory B cell response to the spike protein, and neutralizing antibodies effective against variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. By comparison, HCW receiving one vaccine dose without prior infection showed reduced immunity against variants. B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 spike mutations resulted in increased, abrogated, or unchanged T cell responses, depending on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms. Single-dose vaccination with BNT162b2 in the context of prior infection with a heterologous variant substantially enhances neutralizing antibody responses against variants.},

We examined whether sera from recovered and naïve donors, collected before and after immunizations with existing messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, could neutralize the Wuhan-Hu-1 and B.1.351 variants. Prevaccination sera from recovered donors neutralized Wuhan-Hu-1 and sporadically neutralized B.1.351, but a single immunization boosted neutralizing titers against all variants and SARS-CoV-1 by up to 1000-fold. Neutralization was a result of antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain and was not boosted by a second immunization. Immunization of naïve donors also elicited cross-neutralizing responses but at lower titers. Our study highlights the importance of vaccinating both uninfected and previously infected persons to elicit cross-variant neutralizing antibodies.},

The lack of alignment between research priorities of foreign funders and developing nations can lead to local research activities that do not benefit local communities. For that reason, member states of the African Union recently agreed to spend 1\% of their gross domestic product (GDP) on research and development (R&amp;D) to promote responsibility and ownership of their own economic growth (3).

However, this proposed legislation is not solely about funding science and technology. As J. Mervis explains in his News story “Senate panel backs funding ban on US researchers in Chinese talent programs” (13 May, https://scim.ag/3vCoxOF), Section 303 of the bill prohibits scholars who participate in China&#39;s national talent program from receiving US national funding, serving as the primary applicant in US federal grants, and, “to the extent possible,” being listed on US federal grant applications. Even beyond Section 303, the bill is unequivocally framed as a response to the “China threat,” building on the Cold War rhetoric of space races and iron curtains. The Act intends to set the United States on a path to out-innovate, out-produce, and out-compete China in strategic emerging industries. Healthy competition between prosperous nation-states should be welcomed on the global stage, but the latent Cold War rhetoric is at best misplaced and at worst counterproductive.},

Genome-wide association analysis identified 109 associated loci, 30 of which were detected by tract-specific functional principal components analysis. A number of loci colocalized with brain diseases, such as glioma and stroke. Genetic correlations were observed between white matter microstructure and 57 complex traits and diseases. Common variants associated with white matter microstructure altered the function of regulatory elements in glial cells, particularly oligodendrocytes. This large-scale tract-specific study advances the understanding of the genetic architecture of white matter and its genetic links to a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Neutrophils communicate with each other to form swarms in infected organs. Coordination of this population response is critical for the elimination of bacteria and fungi. Using transgenic mice, we found that neutrophils have evolved an intrinsic mechanism to self-limit swarming and avoid uncontrolled aggregation during inflammation. G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) desensitization acts as a negative feedback control to stop migration of neutrophils when they sense high concentrations of self-secreted attractants that initially amplify swarming. Interference with this process allows neutrophils to scan larger tissue areas for microbes. Unexpectedly, this does not benefit bacterial clearance as containment of proliferating bacteria by neutrophil clusters becomes impeded. Our data reveal how autosignaling stops self-organized swarming behavior and how the finely tuned balance of neutrophil chemotaxis and arrest counteracts bacterial escape.},

Here, we show that soft-furred tree mice ( Typhlomys ) echolocate based on multiple independent lines of evidence. Behavioral experiments show that these mice can locate and avoid obstacles in darkness using hearing and ultrasonic pulses. The proximal portion of their stylohyal bone fuses with the tympanic bone, a form previously only seen in laryngeally echolocating bats. Further, we found convergence of hearing-related genes across the genome and of the echolocation-related gene prestin between soft-furred tree mice and echolocating mammals. Together, our findings suggest that soft-furred tree mice are capable of echolocation, and thus are a new lineage of echolocating mammals.},

Brandon, the principal investigator (PI), expressed gratitude for the work of a team member, Chris, then bemoaned the big shoes that would be left to fill if Chris was hit by a bus. Not long before, a friend and colleague had died suddenly, and we had seen the people who worked most closely with him worry and wonder, in the midst of their grief, who would continue the research, advise the graduate students, track down the data files, and lead the national coordinating center. We had both taken steps toward personal end-of-life planning since the onset of the pandemic, and we realized it could be relevant to our work lives, too. But it wasn&#39;t until our team meeting that the reality really hit home. “As the PI, I have details and documents no one else has access to,” Brandon realized. “What happens if I get hit by a bus?”},

  abstract     = {The epigenome of macrophages can be reprogrammed by extracellular cues, but the extent to which different stimuli achieve this is unclear. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor that is activated by all pathogen-associated stimuli and can reprogram the epigenome by activating latent enhancers. However, we show that NF-κB does so only in response to a subset of stimuli. This stimulus specificity depends on the temporal dynamics of NF-κB activity, in particular whether it is oscillatory or non-oscillatory. Non-oscillatory NF-κB opens chromatin by sustained disruption of nucleosomal histone–DNA interactions, enabling activation of latent enhancers that modulate expression of immune response genes. Thus, temporal dynamics can determine a transcription factor’s capacity to reprogram the epigenome in a stimulus-specific manner.},

  abstract     = {Women engage in less commercial patenting and invention than do men, which may affect what is invented. Using text analysis of all U.S. biomedical patents filed from 1976 through 2010, we found that patents with all-female inventor teams are 35\% more likely than all-male teams to focus on women’s health. This effect holds over decades and across research areas. We also found that female researchers are more likely to discover female-focused ideas. These findings suggest that the inventor gender gap is partially responsible for thousands of missing female-focused inventions since 1976. More generally, our findings suggest that who benefits from innovation depends on who gets to invent.},

This process, called marine ice cliff instability, could lead to catastrophic retreat of sections of West Antarctica on decadal-to-century time scales. Here we use a model that resolves flow and failure of ice to show that dynamic thinning can slow or stabilize cliff retreat, but when ice thickness increases rapidly upstream from the ice cliff, there is a transition to catastrophic collapse. However, even if vulnerable locations like Thwaites Glacier start to collapse, small resistive forces from sea-ice and calved debris can slow down or arrest retreat, reducing the potential for sustained ice sheet collapse.},

By characterizing 2943 S-reactive T cell clones from 34 individuals, we found that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) is highly immunogenic and that 33\% of RBD-reactive clones and 94\% of individuals recognized a conserved immunodominant S346–S365 region comprising nested human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR)– and HLA-DP–restricted epitopes. Using pre– and post–COVID-19 samples and S proteins from endemic coronaviruses, we identified cross-reactive T cells targeting multiple S protein sites.

  abstract     = {The motion of a mechanical object, even a human-sized object, should be governed by the rules of quantum mechanics. Coaxing them into a quantum state is, however, difficult because the thermal environment masks any quantum signature of the object’s motion. The thermal environment also masks the effects of proposed modifications of quantum mechanics at large mass scales. We prepared the center-of-mass motion of a 10-kilogram mechanical oscillator in a state with an average phonon occupation of 10.8. The reduction in temperature, from room temperature to 77 nanokelvin, is commensurate with an 11 orders-of-magnitude suppression of quantum back-action by feedback and a 13 orders-of-magnitude increase in the mass of an object prepared close to its motional ground state. Our approach will enable the possibility of probing gravity on massive quantum systems.},

High-quality large-area films are achieved through controlled nucleation and growth of a lead halide• N -methyl-2-pyrrolidone adduct that can react in situ with embedded FAI/CsI to directly form α-phase perovskite, sidestepping the phase transformation from δ-phase. A nonencapsulated device with 23\% efficiency and excellent long-term thermal stability (at 85°C) in ambient air (~80\% efficiency retention after 500 hours) is achieved with further addition of potassium hexafluorophosphate. The slot die–printed minimodules achieve champion efficiencies of 20.42\% (certified efficiency 19.3\%) and 19.54\% with an active area of 17.1 and 65.0 square centimeters, respectively.},

We find a magnetization of several Bohr magnetons per charge carrier, demonstrating that the magnetism is primarily orbital in nature. Our measurements reveal a large change in the magnetization as the chemical potential is swept across the quantum anomalous Hall gap, consistent with the expected contribution of chiral edge states to the magnetization of an orbital Chern insulator. Mapping the spatial evolution of field-driven magnetic reversal, we find a series of reproducible micrometer-scale domains pinned to structural disorder.},

We implement squeezing of this geometric quantum uncertainty, resulting in a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate occupying a single Landau gauge wave function. We resolve the extent of zero-point cyclotron orbits and demonstrate geometric squeezing of the orbits’ centers 7 decibels below the standard quantum limit. The condensate attains an angular momentum exceeding 1000 quanta per particle and an interatomic distance comparable to the cyclotron orbit. This offers an alternative route toward strongly correlated bosonic fluids.},

Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of a translating mammalian ribosome primed for frameshifting on the viral RNA. The viral RNA adopts a pseudoknot structure that lodges at the entry to the ribosomal messenger RNA (mRNA) channel to generate tension in the mRNA and promote frameshifting, whereas the nascent viral polyprotein forms distinct interactions with the ribosomal tunnel. Biochemical experiments validate the structural observations and reveal mechanistic and regulatory features that influence frameshifting efficiency. Finally, we compare compounds previously shown to reduce frameshifting with respect to their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, establishing coronavirus frameshifting as a target for antiviral intervention.},

Here we integrate research on retreat, transformational adaptation, climate damages and losses, and design and decision support to chart a roadmap for strategic, managed retreat. At its core, this roadmap requires a fundamental reconceptualization of what it means for retreat to be strategic and managed.

The dead zone, which is largely the result of pollution from agricultural and urban runoff, recurs every summer primarily because the Clean Water Act has failed to address this kind of pollution. When the Clean Water Act was passed in 1972 (2), unregulated pollution from sites such as factories and sewage treatment plants—point source pollution—was causing widespread water quality degradation across the nation (3). Today, the leading cause of compromised water quality is rainwater or snowmelt that picks up contaminants as it flows across the land surface and carries them into bodies of water—nonpoint source pollution—as happens in the Gulf of Mexico and countless other inland and coastal waters (4). Because the primary cause of pollution has changed, the Clean Water Act should be updated.},

This idea is a step in the right direction, but ESA is framing the decision as a way to be more inclusive rather than a way to make all astronauts safer and more effective. This short-sighted perspective may explain why the fine print of the announcement limits “acceptable” disabilities to lower-limb deficiencies. By not including a range of disabilities, ESA is discounting the potential of people with disabilities, ignoring the fact that disabilities are in great part barriers imposed by society (2), and missing an opportunity to better prepare all astronauts to adapt to in-flight trauma. To live up to its own standards, provide inspiration to the next generation [including the 15\% (2) who have a disability], and improve mission safety, the ESA should broaden its criteria for eligible disabilities.},

MXenes have shown useful and tunable electronic, optical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties, leading to applications ranging from optoelectronics, electromagnetic interference shielding, and wireless antennas to energy storage, catalysis, sensing, and medicine. Here we present a forward-looking review of the field of MXenes. We discuss the challenges to be addressed and outline research directions that will deepen the fundamental understanding of the properties of MXenes and enable their hybridization with other 2D materials in various emerging technologies.},

To elucidate mechanisms of Xist RNA cis-confinement, we established a sequential dual-color labeling, super-resolution imaging approach to trace individual Xist RNA molecules over time, which enabled us to define fundamental parameters of spreading. We demonstrate a feedback mechanism linking Xist RNA synthesis and degradation and an unexpected physical coupling between preceding and newly synthesized Xist RNA molecules. Additionally, we find that the protein SPEN, a key factor for Xist-mediated gene silencing, has a distinct function in Xist RNA localization, stability, and coupling behaviors. Our results provide insights toward understanding the distinct dynamic properties of Xist RNA.},

Image analysis and data handling components were drawn from the field of astronomy. Using this “AstroPath” whole-slide platform and only six markers, we identified key features in pretreatment melanoma specimens that predicted response to anti–programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)–based therapy, including CD163 + PD-L1 – myeloid cells and CD8 + FoxP3 + PD-1 low/mid T cells.

However, a transition into another state may often be invoked by a series of minor synergistic perturbations rather than a single big one. We show how resilience can be estimated in terms of average life expectancy, accounting for this natural regime of variability. We use time series to fit a model that captures the stochastic as well as the deterministic components. The model is then used to estimate the mean exit time from the basin of attraction. This approach offers a fresh angle to anticipating the chance of a critical transition at a time when high-resolution time series are becoming increasingly available.},

We conducted a 10-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the effect of NMN supplementation on metabolic function in postmenopausal women with prediabetes who were overweight or obese. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, assessed by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and skeletal muscle insulin signaling [phosphorylation of protein kinase AKT and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)] increased after NMN supplementation but did not change after placebo treatment. NMN supplementation up-regulated the expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β and other genes related to muscle remodeling. These results demonstrate that NMN increases muscle insulin sensitivity, insulin signaling, and remodeling in women with prediabetes who are overweight or obese (clinicaltrial.gov NCT 03151239).},

Revealing remarkable convergence on the molecular hallmarks of natural viruses, the accompanying changes reorganized the protein building blocks into an interlaced 240-subunit icosahedral capsid that is impermeable to nucleases, and emergence of a robust RNA stem-loop packaging cassette ensured high encapsidation yields and specificity. In addition to evincing a plausible evolutionary pathway for primordial viruses, these findings highlight practical strategies for developing nonviral carriers for diverse vaccine and delivery applications.},

Before they can function as signaling molecules, Hedgehog precursor proteins must undergo amino-terminal palmitoylation by Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT). We present cryo–electron microscopy structures of human HHAT in complex with its palmitoyl–coenzyme A substrate and of a product complex with a palmitoylated Hedgehog peptide at resolutions of 2.7 and 3.2 angstroms, respectively. The structures reveal how HHAT overcomes the challenges of bringing together substrates that have different physiochemical properties from opposite sides of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane within a membrane-embedded active site for catalysis. These principles are relevant to related enzymes that catalyze the acylation of Wnt and of the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin. The structural and mechanistic insights may advance the development of inhibitors for cancer.},

Here we show that platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) is expressed by adult V-SVZ NSCs that generate olfactory bulb interneurons and glia. Selective deletion of PDGFRβ in adult V-SVZ NSCs leads to their release from quiescence, uncovering gliogenic domains for different glial cell types. These domains are also recruited upon injury. We identify an intraventricular oligodendrocyte progenitor derived from NSCs inside the brain ventricles that contacts supraependymal axons. Together, our findings reveal that the adult V-SVZ contains spatial domains for gliogenesis, in addition to those for neurogenesis. These gliogenic NSC domains tend to be quiescent under homeostasis and may contribute to brain plasticity.},

The [C ii ] gas kinematics shows a steep velocity rise near the galaxy center and has a two-armed spiral morphology, which extends from about 2 to 5 kiloparsecs in radius. We interpret these features as due to a central compact structure such as a bulge, a rotating gas disk, and either spiral arms or tidal tails.

  abstract     = {We explored the bonding properties of the quantum corral (a circle of 48 iron atoms placed on a copper surface) reported by Crommie et al. in 1993, along with variants, as an artificial atom using an atomic force microscope (AFM). The original corral geometry confines 102 electrons to 28 discrete energy states, and we found that these states can form a bond to the front atom of the AFM with an energy of about 5 millielectron volts. The measured forces are about 1/1000 of typical forces in atomically resolved AFM. The confined electrons showed covalent attraction to metal tips and Pauli repulsion to CO-terminated tips. The repulsion at close distance was evident from the response of corral states created by deliberately placing single iron atoms inside the corral. The forces scaled appropriately with a 24-atom corral.},

  abstract     = {Extending the framework of statistical physics to the nonequilibrium setting has led to the discovery of previously unidentified phases of matter, often catalyzed by periodic driving. However, preventing the runaway heating that is associated with driving a strongly interacting quantum system remains a challenge in the investigation of these newly discovered phases. In this work, we utilize a trapped-ion quantum simulator to observe the signatures of a nonequilibrium driven phase without disorder—the prethermal discrete time crystal. Here, the heating problem is circumvented not by disorder-induced many-body localization, but rather by high-frequency driving, which leads to an expansive time window where nonequilibrium phases can emerge. Floquet prethermalization is thus presented as a general strategy for creating, stabilizing, and studying intrinsically out-of-equilibrium phases of matter.},

Alternative, zero-carbon emission NH 3 synthesis methods being explored include the promising electrochemical lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction reaction, which has nonetheless required sacrificial sources of protons. In this study, a phosphonium salt is introduced as a proton shuttle to help resolve this limitation. The salt also provides additional ionic conductivity, enabling high NH 3 production rates of 53 ± 1 nanomoles per second per square centimeter at 69 ± 1\% faradaic efficiency in 20-hour experiments under 0.5-bar hydrogen and 19.5-bar nitrogen. Continuous operation for more than 3 days is demonstrated.},

Probing of the dynamical phenomena of 2D polaritons requires simultaneous spatial and temporal imaging capabilities and could reveal unknown coherent optical phenomena in 2D materials. Here, we present a spatiotemporal measurement of 2D wave packet dynamics, from its formation to its decay, using an ultrafast transmission electron microscope driven by femtosecond midinfrared pulses. The ability to coherently excite phonon-polariton wave packets and probe their evolution in a nondestructive manner reveals intriguing dispersion-dependent dynamics that includes splitting of multibranch wave packets and, unexpectedly, wave packet deceleration and acceleration. Having access to the full spatiotemporal dynamics of 2D wave packets can be used to illuminate puzzles in topological polaritons and discover exotic nonlinear optical phenomena in 2D materials.},

  abstract     = {How eukaryotic cells assess and maintain sizes specific for their species and cell type remains unclear. We show that in the Arabidopsis shoot stem cell niche, cell size variability caused by asymmetric divisions is corrected by adjusting the growth period before DNA synthesis. KIP-related protein 4 (KRP4) inhibits progression to DNA synthesis and associates with mitotic chromosomes. The F BOX-LIKE 17 (FBL17) protein removes excess KRP4. Consequently, daughter cells are born with comparable amounts of KRP4. Inhibitor dilution models predicted that KRP4 inherited through chromatin would robustly regulate size, whereas inheritance of excess free KRP4 would disrupt size homeostasis, as confirmed by mutant analyses. We propose that a cell cycle regulator, stabilized by association with mitotic chromosomes, reads DNA content as a cell size–independent scale.},

We identified cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) as the primary generator of H 2 S in two major human pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and discovered small molecules that inhibit bacterial CSE. These inhibitors potentiate bactericidal antibiotics against both pathogens in vitro and in mouse models of infection. CSE inhibitors also suppress bacterial tolerance, disrupting biofilm formation and substantially reducing the number of persister bacteria that survive antibiotic treatment. Our results establish bacterial H 2 S as a multifunctional defense factor and CSE as a drug target for versatile antibiotic enhancers.},

The 26-subunit Mediator stimulates transcription and cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7)–mediated phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD). We determined the structures of human Mediator in the Tail module–extended (at near-atomic resolution) and Tail-bent conformations and structures of TFIID-based PIC-Mediator (76 polypeptides, ~4.1 megadaltons) in four distinct conformations. PIC-Mediator assembly induces concerted reorganization (Head-tilting and Middle-down) of Mediator and creates a Head-Middle sandwich, which stabilizes two CTD segments and brings CTD to CDK7 for phosphorylation; this suggests a CTD-gating mechanism favorable for phosphorylation. The TFIID-based PIC architecture modulates Mediator organization and TFIIH stabilization, underscoring the importance of TFIID in orchestrating PIC-Mediator assembly.},

Whether this polarity is driven by recognition or signaling constraints remains unclear. Using “reversed-docking” TCRβ-variable (TRBV) 17 + TCRs from the naïve mouse CD8 + T cell repertoire that recognizes the H-2D b –NP 366 epitope, we demonstrate that their inability to support T cell activation and in vivo recruitment is a direct consequence of reversed docking polarity and not TCR–pMHCI binding or clustering characteristics. Canonical TCR–pMHCI docking optimally localizes CD8/Lck to the CD3 complex, which is prevented by reversed TCR–pMHCI polarity. The requirement for canonical docking was circumvented by dissociating Lck from CD8. Thus, the consensus TCR–pMHC docking topology is mandated by T cell signaling constraints.},

Here, I review the first 5 years of gravitational-wave detections. More than 50 gravitational-wave events have been found, emitted by pairs of merging compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes. These signals yield insights into the formation of compact objects and their progenitor stars, enable stringent tests of general relativity, and constrain the behavior of matter at densities higher than that of an atomic nucleus. Mergers that emit both gravitational and electromagnetic waves probe the formation of short gamma-ray bursts and the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements, and they measure the local expansion rate of the Universe.},

Proteomic deconvolution of the IgG repertoire to the spike glycoprotein in convalescent subjects revealed that the response is directed predominantly (&gt;80\%) against epitopes residing outside the receptor binding domain (RBD). In one subject, just four IgG lineages accounted for 93.5\% of the response, including an amino (N)-terminal domain (NTD)–directed antibody that was protective against lethal viral challenge. Genetic, structural, and functional characterization of a multidonor class of “public” antibodies revealed an NTD epitope that is recurrently mutated among emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. These data show that “public” NTD-directed and other non-RBD plasma antibodies are prevalent and have implications for SARS-CoV-2 protection and antibody escape.},

  abstract     = {Shark populations have been decimated in recent decades because of overfishing and other anthropogenic stressors; however, the long-term impacts of such changes in marine predator abundance and diversity are poorly constrained. We present evidence for a previously unknown major extinction event in sharks that occurred in the early Miocene, ~19 million years ago. During this interval, sharks virtually disappeared from open-ocean sediments, declining in abundance by &gt;90\% and morphological diversity by &gt;70\%, an event from which they never recovered. This abrupt extinction occurred independently from any known global climate event and ~2 million to 5 million years before diversifications in the highly migratory, large-bodied predators that dominate pelagic ecosystems today, indicating that the early Miocene was a period of rapid, transformative change for open-ocean ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Although antiviral antibodies generally confer protective functions, antibodies against dengue virus (DENV) are associated with enhanced disease susceptibility. Antibodies can mediate DENV infection of leukocytes via Fcγ receptors, likely contributing to dengue disease pathogenesis. To determine if this mechanism accounts for variable disease severity, we examined Fab and Fc structures of anti-DENV antibodies from patients before and after infection and with variable disease outcomes. Neither antibody titers nor neutralizing activity correlated with disease severity in DENV-infected populations. Rather, DENV infection induced a specific increase in immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) afucosylation, and the levels of afucosylated IgG1 were predictive of dengue disease severity. Thus, the IgG1 fucosylation status represents a robust prognostic tool for dengue disease, highlighting the key role of the Fc glycan structure in dengue pathogenesis.},

Here, we reconstruct the magnitude and spatial pattern of Last Glacial Maximum surface cooling in Antarctica using borehole thermometry and firn properties in seven ice cores. West Antarctic sites cooled ~10°C relative to the preindustrial period. East Antarctic sites show a range from ~4° to ~7°C cooling, which is consistent with the results of global climate models when the effects of topographic changes indicated with ice core air-content data are included, but less than those indicated with the use of water-stable isotopes calibrated against modern spatial gradients. An altered Antarctic temperature inversion during the glacial reconciles our estimates with water-isotope observations.},

Data from a massive online survey in the United States indicate an increased risk of COVID-19–related outcomes among respondents living with a child attending school in person. School-based mitigation measures are associated with significant reductions in risk, particularly daily symptoms screens, teacher masking, and closure of extracurricular activities. A positive association between in-person schooling and COVID-19 outcomes persists at low levels of mitigation, but when seven or more mitigation measures are reported, a significant relationship is no longer observed. Among teachers, working outside the home was associated with an increase in COVID-19–related outcomes, but this association is similar to that observed in other occupations (e.g., health care or office work). Although in-person schooling is associated with household COVID-19 risk, this risk can likely be controlled with properly implemented school-based mitigation measures.},

Here, we investigated the genetic and functional architecture of a genomic region within the FTO gene that is strongly associated with obesity risk. We show that multiple variants on a common haplotype modify the regulatory properties of several enhancers targeting IRX3 and IRX5 from megabase distances. We demonstrate that these enhancers affect gene expression in multiple tissues, including adipose and brain, and impart regulatory effects during a restricted temporal window. Our data indicate that the genetic architecture of disease-associated loci may involve extensive pleiotropy, allelic heterogeneity, shared allelic effects across tissues, and temporally restricted effects.},

The low luminosity and redshift of GRB 190829A reduce both internal and external absorption, allowing determination of its intrinsic energy spectrum. Between energies of 0.18 and 3.3 tera–electron volts, this spectrum is described by a power law with photon index of 2.07 ± 0.09, similar to the x-ray spectrum. The x-ray and VHE gamma-ray light curves also show similar decay profiles. These similar characteristics in the x-ray and gamma-ray bands challenge GRB afterglow emission scenarios.},

In the medial network, Ten3-expressing (Ten3+) CA1 axons are repelled by target-derived Lphn2, revealing that Lphn2- and Ten3-mediated heterophilic repulsion and Ten3-mediated homophilic attraction cooperate to control precise target selection of CA1 axons. In the lateral network, Lphn2-expressing (Lphn2+) CA1 axons are confined to Lphn2+ targets via repulsion from Ten3+ targets.

  abstract     = {It is widely hypothesized that removing cellular transfer RNAs (tRNAs)—making their cognate codons unreadable—might create a genetic firewall to viral infection and enable sense codon reassignment. However, it has been impossible to test these hypotheses. In this work, following synonymous codon compression and laboratory evolution in Escherichia coli , we deleted the tRNAs and release factor 1, which normally decode two sense codons and a stop codon; the resulting cells could not read the canonical genetic code and were completely resistant to a cocktail of viruses. We reassigned these codons to enable the efficient synthesis of proteins containing three distinct noncanonical amino acids. Notably, we demonstrate the facile reprogramming of our cells for the encoded translation of diverse noncanonical heteropolymers and macrocycles.},

Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of disease incidence and mortality and their dependence on demographic and socioeconomic strata in Santiago, a highly segregated city and the capital of Chile. Our analyses show a strong association between socioeconomic status and both COVID-19 outcomes and public health capacity. People living in municipalities with low socioeconomic status did not reduce their mobility during lockdowns as much as those in more affluent municipalities. Testing volumes may have been insufficient early in the pandemic in those places, and both test positivity rates and testing delays were much higher. We find a strong association between socioeconomic status and mortality, measured by either COVID-19–attributed deaths or excess deaths. Finally, we show that infection fatality rates in young people are higher in low-income municipalities. Together, these results highlight the critical consequences of socioeconomic inequalities on health outcomes.},

We wirelessly recorded from hippocampal dorsal CA1 neurons of wild-born bats flying in a long tunnel (200 meters). The size of place fields ranged from 0.6 to 32 meters. Individual place cells exhibited multiple fields and a multiscale representation: Place fields of the same neuron differed up to 20-fold in size. This multiscale coding was observed from the first day of exposure to the environment, and also in laboratory-born bats that never experienced large environments. Theoretical decoding analysis showed that the multiscale code allows representation of very large environments with much higher precision than that of other codes. Together, by increasing the spatial scale, we discovered a neural code that is radically different from classical place codes.},

We highlight two methodological ideas for MSPI-AM—“the right materials printed in the right positions” and “unique structures printed for unique functions”—to realize major improvements in performance and function. We establish how cross-scale mechanisms to coordinate nano/microscale material development, mesoscale process monitoring, and macroscale structure and performance control can be used proactively to achieve high performance with multifunctionality.

The epidemic declined between May and July 2020 but then increased gradually from mid-August, accelerating into early September 2020 at the start of the second wave. When compared with cases detected through routine surveillance, we report here a longer period of decline and a younger age distribution.

Each type appears and disappears repeatedly during eukaryotic evolution. The type of genome architecture that an organism exhibits correlates with the absence of condensin II subunits. Moreover, condensin II depletion converts the architecture of the human genome to a state resembling that seen in organisms such as fungi or mosquitoes. In this state, centromeres cluster together at nucleoli, and heterochromatin domains merge. We propose a physical model in which lengthwise compaction of chromosomes by condensin II during mitosis determines chromosome-scale genome architecture, with effects that are retained during the subsequent interphase. This mechanism likely has been conserved since the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes.},

Hemispheric asymmetry suggests the need for ocean management at hemispheric scales. For the north, tactical, climate-based recovery plans for forage fish resources are needed to recover seabird breeding productivity. In the south, lower-magnitude change in seabird productivity presents opportunities for strategic management approaches such as large marine protected areas to sustain food webs and maintain predator productivity. Global monitoring of seabird productivity enables the detection of ecosystem change in remote regions and contributes to our understanding of marine climate impacts on ecosystems.},

Given the global nature of these mass coral mortality events, recent studies argue that mitigating climate change is the only path to conserve coral reefs. Using a global analysis of 223 sites, we show that local stressors act synergistically with climate change to kill corals. Local factors such as high abundance of macroalgae or urchins magnified coral loss in the year after bleaching. Notably, the combined effects of increasing heat stress and macroalgae intensified coral loss. Our results offer an optimistic premise that effective local management, alongside global efforts to mitigate climate change, can help coral reefs survive the Anthropocene.},

An expected characteristic feature of quantum criticality is power-law behavior of thermodynamic quantities as a function of a nonthermal tuning parameter close to the quantum critical point (QCP). Here, we observed power-law behavior of the critical temperature of the coupled nematic/structural phase transition as a function of uniaxial stress in a representative family of iron-based superconductors, providing direct evidence of quantum critical nematic fluctuations in this material. These quantum critical fluctuations are not confined within a narrow regime around the QCP but rather extend over a wide range of temperatures and compositions.},

Mitochondrial NADP(H) production depends on the phosphorylation of NAD(H) by NAD kinase 2 (NADK2). Deletion of NADK2 in human cell lines did not alter mitochondrial folate pathway activity, tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, or mitochondrial oxidative stress, but rather led to impaired cell proliferation in minimal medium. This growth defect was rescued by proline supplementation. NADK2-mediated mitochondrial NADP(H) generation was required for the reduction of glutamate and hence proline biosynthesis. Furthermore, mitochondrial NADP(H) availability determined the production of collagen proteins by cells of mesenchymal lineage. Thus, a primary function of the mitochondrial NADP(H) pool is to support proline biosynthesis for use in cytosolic protein synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Full insight into the dynamics of a coupled quantum system depends on the ability to follow the effect of a local excitation in real-time. Here, we trace the free coherent evolution of a pair of coupled atomic spins by means of scanning tunneling microscopy. Rather than using microwave pulses, we use a direct-current pump-probe scheme to detect the local magnetization after a current-induced excitation performed on one of the spins. By making use of magnetic interaction with the probe tip, we are able to tune the relative precession of the spins. We show that only if their Larmor frequencies match, the two spins can entangle, causing angular momentum to be swapped back and forth. These results provide insight into the locality of electron spin scattering and set the stage for controlled migration of a quantum state through an extended spin lattice.},

  abstract     = {Defects are essential to engineering the properties of functional materials ranging from semiconductors and superconductors to ferroics. Whereas point defects have been widely exploited, dislocations are commonly viewed as problematic for functional materials and not as a microstructural tool. We developed a method for mechanically imprinting dislocation networks that favorably skew the domain structure in bulk ferroelectrics and thereby tame the large switching polarization and make it available for functional harvesting. The resulting microstructure yields a strong mechanical restoring force to revert electric field–induced domain wall displacement on the macroscopic level and high pinning force on the local level. This induces a giant increase of the dielectric and electromechanical response at intermediate electric fields in barium titanate [electric field–dependent permittivity (ε 33 ) ≈ 5800 and large-signal piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 *) ≈ 1890 picometers/volt]. Dislocation-based anisotropy delivers a different suite of tools with which to tailor functional materials.},

Despite the challenge, some exoskeletons have managed to lessen the metabolic expenditure of walking, either by adding or storing and returning energy. We show that the use of an exoskeleton that strategically removes kinetic energy during the swing period of the gait cycle reduces the metabolic cost of walking by 2.5 ± 0.8\% for healthy male users while converting the removed energy into 0.25 ± 0.02 watts of electrical power. By comparing two loading profiles, we demonstrate that the timing and magnitude of energy removal are vital for successful metabolic cost reduction.},

  abstract     = {Tailoring the molecular environment around catalytically active sites allows for the enhancement of catalytic reactivity through a hitherto unexplored pathway. In zeolites, the presence of water creates an ionic environment via the formation of hydrated hydronium ions and the negatively charged framework aluminum tetrahedra. The high density of cation-anion pairs determined by the aluminum concentration of a zeolite induces a high local ionic strength that increases the excess chemical potential of sorbed and uncharged organic reactants. Charged transition states (carbocations for example) are stabilized, which reduces the energy barrier and leads to higher reaction rates. Using the intramolecular dehydration of cyclohexanol on H-MFI zeolites in water, we quantitatively show an enhancement of the reaction rate by the presence of high ionic strength as well as show potential limitations of this strategy.},

In our work, we have designed and fabricated an 8-by-8 two-dimensional square superconducting qubit array composed of 62 functional qubits. We used this device to demonstrate high-fidelity single- and two-particle quantum walks. Furthermore, with the high programmability of the quantum processor, we implemented a Mach-Zehnder interferometer where the quantum walker coherently traverses in two paths before interfering and exiting. By tuning the disorders on the evolution paths, we observed interference fringes with single and double walkers. Our work is a milestone in the field, bringing future larger-scale quantum applications closer to realization for noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors.},

In type II systems, a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) hybridizes to crRNAs to drive their processing and utilization by Cas9. While analyzing Cas9-RNA complexes from Campylobacter jejuni , we discovered tracrRNA hybridizing to cellular RNAs, leading to formation of “noncanonical” crRNAs capable of guiding DNA targeting by Cas9. Our discovery inspired the engineering of reprogrammed tracrRNAs that link the presence of any RNA of interest to DNA targeting with different Cas9 orthologs. This capability became the basis for a multiplexable diagnostic platform termed LEOPARD (leveraging engineered tracrRNAs and on-target DNAs for parallel RNA detection). LEOPARD allowed simultaneous detection of RNAs from different viruses in one test and distinguished severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its D614G (Asp 614 →Gly) variant with single-base resolution in patient samples.},

We found a self-organizing system consisting of a bacterial phosphoinositide kinase and its opposing phosphatase that formed spatiotemporal patterns, including traveling waves, to remodel host cellular membranes. The Legionella effector MavQ, a phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, was targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). MavQ and the Legionella PI 3-phosphatase SidP, even in the absence of other bacterial components, drove rapid PI 3-phosphate turnover on the ER and spontaneously formed traveling waves that spread along ER subdomains inducing vesicle and tubule budding. Thus, bacteria can exploit a self-organizing membrane-targeting mechanism to hijack host cellular structures for survival.},

Well-constructed policy guidance would assist conservationists and governments in making informed decisions.

  abstract     = {To make effective decisions, people need to consider the relationship between actions and outcomes. These are often separated by time and space. The neural mechanisms by which disjoint actions and outcomes are linked remain unknown. One promising hypothesis involves neural replay of nonlocal experience. Using a task that segregates direct from indirect value learning, combined with magnetoencephalography, we examined the role of neural replay in human nonlocal learning. After receipt of a reward, we found significant backward replay of nonlocal experience, with a 160-millisecond state-to-state time lag, which was linked to efficient learning of action values. Backward replay and behavioral evidence of nonlocal learning were more pronounced for experiences of greater benefit for future behavior. These findings support nonlocal replay as a neural mechanism for solving complex credit assignment problems during learning.},

Three of his insights have been reinforced by modern science. The first is that we share many characteristics (genetic, developmental, physiological, morphological, cognitive, and psychological) with our closest relatives, the anthropoid apes. The second is that humans have a talent for high-level cooperation reinforced by morality and social norms. The third is that we have greatly expanded the social learning capacity that we see already in other primates. Darwin’s emphasis on the role of culture deserves special attention because during an increasingly unstable Pleistocene environment, cultural accumulation allowed changes in life history; increased cognition; and the appearance of language, social norms, and institutions.},

But as an international student working in the United States, taking time to explore wasn&#39;t an option for me. After listening to me rant, my adviser calmly looked across his desk. He told me that instead of focusing on finding a dream job, I should think about what I am good at and what makes me happy at least 80\% of the time.

Here, we identify a conserved transcriptomic response to AMF among land plants, including the activation of lipid metabolism. Using gain of function, we show the transfer of lipids from the liverwort Marchantia paleacea to AMF and its direct regulation by the transcription factor WRINKLED (WRI). Arbuscules, the nutrient-exchange structures, were not formed in loss-of-function wri mutants in M. paleacea , leading to aborted mutualism. Our results show the orthology of the symbiotic transfer of lipids across land plants and demonstrate that mutualism with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was present in the most recent ancestor of land plants 450 million years ago.},

  abstract     = {Global vegetation over the past 18,000 years has been transformed first by the climate changes that accompanied the last deglaciation and again by increasing human pressures; however, the magnitude and patterns of rates of vegetation change are poorly understood globally. Using a compilation of 1181 fossil pollen sequences and newly developed statistical methods, we detect a worldwide acceleration in the rates of vegetation compositional change beginning between 4.6 and 2.9 thousand years ago that is globally unprecedented over the past 18,000 years in both magnitude and extent. Late Holocene rates of change equal or exceed the deglacial rates for all continents, which suggests that the scale of human effects on terrestrial ecosystems exceeds even the climate-driven transformations of the last deglaciation. The acceleration of biodiversity change demonstrated in ecological datasets from the past century began millennia ago.},

  abstract     = {There is an urgent need to protect key areas for biodiversity and nature’s contributions to people (NCP). However, different values of nature are rarely considered together in conservation planning. Here, we explore potential priority areas in Europe for biodiversity (all terrestrial vertebrates) and a set of cultural and regulating NCP while considering demand for these NCP. We quantify the spatial overlap between these priorities and their performance in representing different values of nature. We show that different priorities rarely coincide, except in certain irreplaceable ecosystems. Notably, priorities for biodiversity better represent NCP than the reverse. Theoretically, protecting an extra 5\% of land has the potential to double conservation gains for biodiversity while also maintaining some essential NCP, leading to co-benefits for both nature and people.},

However, their syntheses remain challenging given the lack of reliable protocols for generating nonhexagonal rings during the in-plane tiling of carbon atoms. We report the bottom-up growth of an ultraflat biphenylene network with periodically arranged four-, six-, and eight-membered rings of sp 2 -hybridized carbon atoms through an on-surface interpolymer dehydrofluorination (HF-zipping) reaction. The characterization of this biphenylene network by scanning probe methods reveals that it is metallic rather than a dielectric. We expect the interpolymer HF-zipping method to complement the toolbox for the synthesis of other nonbenzenoid carbon allotropes.},

Recently, a photocatalytic system comprising [Ce IV Cl 5 (OR)] 2− [Ce IV , cerium(IV); OR, –OCH 3 or –OCCl 2 CH 3 ] was disclosed. The system was reportedly capable of alkane activation by alkoxy radicals (RO•) formed by Ce IV –OR bond photolysis. In this work, we present evidence that the reported carbon-hydrogen (C–H) activation of alkanes is instead mediated by the photocatalyst [NEt 4 ] 2 [CeCl 6 ] (NEt 4 + , tetraethylammonium), and RO• are not intermediates. Spectroscopic analyses and kinetics were investigated for C–H activation to identify chlorine radical (Cl•) generation as the rate-limiting step. Density functional theory calculations support the formation of [Cl•][alcohol] adducts when alcohols are present, which can manifest a masked RO• character. This result serves as an important cautionary note for interpretation of radical trapping experiments.},

Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been missing. We demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity v c . We measure v c as a function of interaction strength and find a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our measurements enable systematic studies of the influence of reduced dimensionality on fermionic superfluidity.},

By focusing on the translation of the conserved major epithelial-mesenchymal transition–inducing transcription factor Twist, we identify spatial heterogeneity in mRNA translation efficiency and reveal the existence of translation factories, where clustered mRNAs are cotranslated preferentially at basal perinuclear regions. Observing the location and dynamics of mRNA translation in a living multicellular organism opens avenues for understanding gene regulation during development.},

We show how molecular engineering of fluorenone enables the alcohol electro-oxidation needed for reversible ketone hydrogenation and dehydrogenation at room temperature without the use of a catalyst. Flow batteries based on these fluorenone derivative anolytes operate efficiently and exhibit stable long-term cycling at ambient and mildly increased temperatures in a nondemanding environment. These results expand the palette to include reversible ketone to alcohol conversion but also suggest the potential for identifying other atypical organic redox couple candidates.},

However, vision provides limited feedback because information about grasping objects is best relayed through tactile feedback. We supplemented vision with tactile percepts evoked using a bidirectional brain-computer interface that records neural activity from the motor cortex and generates tactile sensations through intracortical microstimulation of the somatosensory cortex. This enabled a person with tetraplegia to substantially improve performance with a robotic limb; trial times on a clinical upper-limb assessment were reduced by half, from a median time of 20.9 to 10.2 seconds. Faster times were primarily due to less time spent attempting to grasp objects, revealing that mimicking known biological control principles results in task performance that is closer to able-bodied human abilities.},

However, owing to lens aberrations and multiple scattering of electrons in the sample, the image resolution is reduced by a factor of 3 to 10. By inversely solving the multiple scattering problem and overcoming the electron-probe aberrations using electron ptychography, we demonstrate an instrumental blurring of less than 20 picometers and a linear phase response in thick samples. The measured widths of atomic columns are limited by thermal fluctuations of the atoms. Our method is also capable of locating embedded atomic dopant atoms in all three dimensions with subnanometer precision from only a single projection measurement.},

Indicators of clustering, trajectories, speed, and intensity of the movement of COVID-19 to interior areas, combined with indices of policy measures, show that although no single narrative explains the diversity in the spread, an overall failure of implementing prompt, coordinated, and equitable responses in a context of stark local inequalities fueled disease spread. This resulted in high and unequal infection and mortality burdens.

Genome sequencing of viruses sampled in Manaus between November 2020 and January 2021 revealed the emergence and circulation of a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern. Lineage P.1 acquired 17 mutations, including a trio in the spike protein (K417T, E484K, and N501Y) associated with increased binding to the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor. Molecular clock analysis shows that P.1 emergence occurred around mid-November 2020 and was preceded by a period of faster molecular evolution. Using a two-category dynamical model that integrates genomic and mortality data, we estimate that P.1 may be 1.7- to 2.4-fold more transmissible and that previous (non-P.1) infection provides 54 to 79\% of the protection against infection with P.1 that it provides against non-P.1 lineages. Enhanced global genomic surveillance of variants of concern, which may exhibit increased transmissibility and/or immune evasion, is critical to accelerate pandemic responsiveness.},

The work reveals the mechanism of MC4R activation, highlighting a molecular switch that initiates satiation signaling. In addition, our findings indicate that calcium (Ca 2+ ) is required for agonist, but not antagonist, efficacy.

  abstract     = {The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident increased papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) incidence in surrounding regions, particularly for radioactive iodine ( 131 I)–exposed children. We analyzed genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic characteristics of 440 PTCs from Ukraine (from 359 individuals with estimated childhood 131 I exposure and 81 unexposed children born after 1986). PTCs displayed radiation dose–dependent enrichment of fusion drivers, nearly all in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and increases in small deletions and simple/balanced structural variants that were clonal and bore hallmarks of nonhomologous end-joining repair. Radiation-related genomic alterations were more pronounced for individuals who were younger at exposure. Transcriptomic and epigenomic features were strongly associated with driver events but not radiation dose. Our results point to DNA double-strand breaks as early carcinogenic events that subsequently enable PTC growth after environmental radiation exposure.},

We do not know how novelty-seeking motivation initiates the complex sequence of actions that make up investigatory behavior. We found in mice that inhibitory neurons in the medial zona incerta (ZIm), a subthalamic brain region, are essential for the decision to investigate an object or a conspecific. These neurons receive excitatory input from the prelimbic cortex to signal the initiation of exploration. This signal is modulated in the ZIm by the level of investigatory motivation. Increased activity in the ZIm instigates deep investigative action by inhibiting the periaqueductal gray region. A subpopulation of inhibitory ZIm neurons expressing tachykinin 1 (TAC1) modulates the investigatory behavior.},

Compared with proximal ortho -C−H activation, distal ( meta - and/or para -) C−H activation remains more challenging due to the inaccessibility of these sites in the formation of energetically favorable organometallic pretransition states. Directing the catalyst toward the distal C−H bonds requires judicious template engineering and catalyst design, as well as prudent choice of ligands. This review aims to summarize the recent elegant discoveries exploiting directing group assistance, transient mediators or traceless directors, noncovalent interactions, and catalyst and/or ligand selection to control distal C−H activation.},

Here, we report a systematic effort to decipher the RNA structural code that shapes pathological splicing during breast cancer metastasis. We discovered a previously unknown structural splicing enhancer that is enriched near cassette exons with increased inclusion in highly metastatic cells. We show that the spliceosomal protein small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide A′ (SNRPA1) interacts with these enhancers to promote cassette exon inclusion. This interaction enhances metastatic lung colonization and cancer cell invasion, in part through SNRPA1-mediated regulation of PLEC alternative splicing, which can be counteracted by splicing modulating morpholinos. Our findings establish a noncanonical regulatory role for SNRPA1 as a prometastatic splicing enhancer in breast cancer.},

We show that these ROS trigger an oxidative stress response that leads to translation repression. This response is countered by Schlafen 2 (SLFN2), which directly binds transfer RNAs (tRNAs) to protect them from cleavage by the ribonuclease angiogenin. T cell–specific SLFN2 deficiency results in the accumulation of tRNA fragments, which inhibit translation and promote stress-granule formation. Interleukin-2 receptor β (IL-2Rβ) and IL-2Rγ fail to be translationally up-regulated after T cell receptor stimulation, rendering SLFN2-deficient T cells insensitive to interleukin-2’s mitogenic effects. SLFN2 confers resistance against the ROS-mediated translation-inhibitory effects of oxidative stress normally induced by T cell activation, permitting the robust protein synthesis necessary for T cell expansion and immunity.},

Seven years after the drought, the runoff (as a fraction of precipitation) had not recovered in 37\% of watersheds, and the number of recovered watersheds was not increasing. When recovery did occur, it was not explained by watershed wetness. For those watersheds not recovered, ~80\% showed no evidence of recovering soon, suggesting persistence within a low-runoff state. The post-drought precipitation not going to runoff was found to be likely going to increased evapotranspiration per unit of precipitation. These findings show that watersheds can have a finite resilience to disturbances and suggest that hydrological droughts can persist indefinitely after meteorological droughts.},

We detect two distinct influxes of 60 Fe to Earth in the last 10 million years and accompanying lower quantities of 244 Pu. The 244 Pu/ 60 Fe influx ratios are similar for both events. The 244 Pu influx is lower than expected if SNe dominate r-process nucleosynthesis, which implies some contribution from other sources.},

This association is stronger in warmer, wetter, less seasonal environments. We infer that the macroevolutionary sorting mechanism acts through the regional pool of species by sorting species on the basis of the available relative differences in diversification rates, rather than absolute rates. Our results illustrate how the interplay between interaction patterns and diversification dynamics may shape the organization and long-term dynamics of ecological networks.},

The electric gating has only a minor effect on carrier density but a strong one on mobility. We interpret the tuning of mobility in terms of change in the spatial profile of the carriers in the interface and hence, effective disorder. As the temperature is decreased, the resistance saturates at the lowest temperature on both superconducting and insulating sides, suggesting the emergence of a quantum metallic state associated with a failed superconductor and/or fragile insulator.},

We discovered, using a chemical suppressor screen, that inhibition of the pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) rescues erythroid differentiation in bloodless zebrafish moonshine (mon) mutant embryos defective for transcriptional intermediary factor 1 gamma ( tif1γ ). This rescue depends on the functional link of DHODH to mitochondrial respiration. The transcription elongation factor TIF1γ directly controls coenzyme Q (CoQ) synthesis gene expression. Upon tif1γ loss, CoQ levels are reduced, and a high succinate/α-ketoglutarate ratio leads to increased histone methylation. A CoQ analog rescues mon ’s bloodless phenotype. These results demonstrate that mitochondrial metabolism is a key output of a lineage transcription factor that drives cell fate decisions in the early blood lineage.},

  abstract     = {Lightning increases the atmosphere’s ability to cleanse itself by producing nitric oxide (NO), leading to atmospheric chemistry that forms ozone (O 3 ) and the atmosphere’s primary oxidant, the hydroxyl radical (OH). Our analysis of a 2012 airborne study of deep convection and chemistry demonstrates that lightning also directly generates the oxidants OH and the hydroperoxyl radical (HO 2 ). Extreme amounts of OH and HO 2 were discovered and linked to visible flashes occurring in front of the aircraft and to subvisible discharges in electrified anvil regions. This enhanced OH and HO 2 is orders of magnitude greater than any previous atmospheric observation. Lightning-generated OH in all storms happening at the same time globally can be responsible for a highly uncertain, but substantial, 2 to 16\% of global atmospheric OH oxidation.},

  abstract     = {Plants have evolved complex nanofibril-based cell walls to meet diverse biological and physical constraints. How strength and extensibility emerge from the nanoscale-to-mesoscale organization of growing cell walls has long been unresolved. We sought to clarify the mechanical roles of cellulose and matrix polysaccharides by developing a coarse-grained model based on polymer physics that recapitulates aspects of assembly and tensile mechanics of epidermal cell walls. Simple noncovalent binding interactions in the model generate bundled cellulose networks resembling that of primary cell walls and possessing stress-dependent elasticity, stiffening, and plasticity beyond a yield threshold. Plasticity originates from fibril-fibril sliding in aligned cellulose networks. This physical model provides quantitative insight into fundamental questions of plant mechanobiology and reveals design principles of biomaterials that combine stiffness with yielding and extensibility.},

  abstract     = {In March, a massive die-off of farmed salmon sent more than 2.2 million kilos of rotting fish biomass into the fjords and channels of the Pacific Patagonian wilderness (1), critical areas for biodiversity conservation. The mass mortality event is part of a pattern in which industrial salmon farming increases eutrophication and boosts harmful micro-algae blooms (2), which enter gills and suffocate fish (3). In turn, decomposition of salmon carcasses leads to increased dissolved organic matter, which, in combination with human-induced ocean warming, facilitates the occurrence of more algal blooms (4). With a new constitutional act under discussion, Chile should seize this opportunity to add regulations that will stop the cycle and protect the valuable Patagonian region.},

Yeast genetic interactions have been mapped on a global scale, but the environmental influence on the plasticity of genetic networks has not been examined systematically. To assess environmental rewiring of genetic networks, we examined 14 diverse conditions and scored 30,000 functionally representative yeast gene pairs for dynamic, differential interactions. Different conditions revealed novel differential interactions, which often uncovered functional connections between distantly related gene pairs. However, the majority of observed genetic interactions remained unchanged in different conditions, suggesting that the global yeast genetic interaction network is robust to environmental perturbation and captures the fundamental functional architecture of a eukaryotic cell.},

We found that D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons (D1- and D2-MSNs) arise from a common progenitor and that lineage commitment is established during the postmitotic transition, across a pre-MSN phase that exhibits a continuous spectrum of fate determinants. We then uncovered cell type–specific gene regulatory networks that we validated through in silico perturbation. Finally, we identified human-specific lincRNAs that contribute to the phylogenetic divergence of this structure in humans. This work delineates the cellular hierarchies governing MSN lineage commitment.},

We therefore developed methods for the enrichment and analysis of nuclear DNA from sediments and applied them to cave deposits in western Europe and southern Siberia dated to between 200,000 and 50,000 years ago. We detected a population replacement in northern Spain about 100,000 years ago, which was accompanied by a turnover of mtDNA. We also identified two radiation events in Neanderthal history during the early part of the Late Pleistocene.

Our analyses root the tree between the major clades Terrabacteria and Gracilicutes and suggest that LBCA was a free-living flagellated, rod-shaped double-membraned organism. Contrary to recent proposals, our analyses reject a basal placement of the Candidate Phyla Radiation, which instead branches sister to Chloroflexota within Terrabacteria. While most gene families (92\%) have evidence of HGT, overall, two-thirds of gene transmissions have been vertical, suggesting that a rooted tree provides a meaningful frame of reference for interpreting bacterial evolution.},

Understanding the origins of the human lineage (hominins) requires reconstructing the morphology, behavior, and environment of the chimpanzee-human last common ancestor. Modern hominoids (that is, humans and apes) share multiple features (for example, an orthograde body plan facilitating upright positional behaviors). However, the fossil record indicates that living hominoids constitute narrow representatives of an ancient radiation of more widely distributed, diverse species, none of which exhibit the entire suite of locomotor adaptations present in the extant relatives. Hence, some modern ape similarities might have evolved in parallel in response to similar selection pressures. Current evidence suggests that hominins originated in Africa from Miocene ape ancestors unlike any living species.},

Using multisensor data loggers, we show that great reed warblers ( Acrocephalus arundinaceus ) regularly prolong their otherwise strictly nocturnal flights into daytime when crossing the Mediterranean Sea and the Sahara Desert. Unexpectedly, when prolonging their flights, they climbed steeply at dawn, from a mean of 2394 meters above sea level to reach extreme cruising altitudes (mean 5367 and maximum 6267 meters above sea level) during daytime flights. This previously unknown behavior of using exceedingly high flight altitudes when migrating during daytime could be caused by diel variation in ambient temperature, winds, predation, vision range, and solar radiation. Our finding of this notable behavior provides new perspectives on constraints in bird flight and might help to explain the evolution of nocturnal migration.},

In contrast to commonly applied x-ray fragment screening experiments with molecules of low complexity, our screen tested already-approved drugs and drugs in clinical trials. From the three-dimensional protein structures, we identified 37 compounds that bind to M pro . In subsequent cell-based viral reduction assays, one peptidomimetic and six nonpeptidic compounds showed antiviral activity at nontoxic concentrations. We identified two allosteric binding sites representing attractive targets for drug development against SARS-CoV-2.},

Adjusting for epidemic growth of 4.4\% (1.1 to 6.9\%) per day preceding the mass testing campaign, the estimated decrease in prevalence compared with a scenario of unmitigated growth was 70\% (67 to 73\%). Modeling indicated that this decrease could not be explained solely by infection control measures but required the addition of the isolation and quarantine of household members of those testing positive.},

  abstract     = {Unconventional ferroelectricity exhibited by hafnia-based thin films—robust at nanoscale sizes—presents tremendous opportunities in nanoelectronics. However, the exact nature of polarization switching remains controversial. We investigated a La 0.67 Sr 0.33 MnO 3 /Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 capacitor interfaced with various top electrodes while performing in situ electrical biasing using atomic-resolution microscopy with direct oxygen imaging as well as with synchrotron nanobeam diffraction. When the top electrode is oxygen reactive, we observe reversible oxygen vacancy migration with electrodes as the source and sink of oxygen and the dielectric layer acting as a fast conduit at millisecond time scales. With nonreactive top electrodes and at longer time scales (seconds), the dielectric layer also acts as an oxygen source and sink. Our results show that ferroelectricity in hafnia-based thin films is unmistakably intertwined with oxygen voltammetry.},

We show how it is possible to measure an oscillator without quantum back-action of the measurement by constructing one effective oscillator from two physical oscillators. We realize such a quantum mechanics–free subsystem using two micromechanical oscillators, and show the measurements of two collective quadratures while evading the quantum back-action by 8 decibels on both of them, obtaining a total noise within a factor of 2 of the full quantum limit. This facilitates the detection of weak forces and the generation and measurement of nonclassical motional states of the oscillators. Moreover, we directly verify the quantum entanglement of the two oscillators by measuring the Duan quantity 1.4 decibels below the separability bound.},

  abstract     = {Quantum entanglement of mechanical systems emerges when distinct objects move with such a high degree of correlation that they can no longer be described separately. Although quantum mechanics presumably applies to objects of all sizes, directly observing entanglement becomes challenging as masses increase, requiring measurement and control with a vanishingly small error. Here, using pulsed electromechanics, we deterministically entangle two mechanical drumheads with masses of 70 picograms. Through nearly quantum-limited measurements of the position and momentum quadratures of both drums, we perform quantum state tomography and thereby directly observe entanglement. Such entangled macroscopic systems are poised to serve in fundamental tests of quantum mechanics, enable sensing beyond the standard quantum limit, and function as long-lived nodes of future quantum networks.},

Treatment with I-SAM also increased the power conversion efficiency from 20.2\% to 21.4\%, reduced hysteresis, and improved operational stability with a projected T80 (time to 80\% initial efficiency retained) increasing from ~700 hours to 4000 hours under 1-sun illumination and with continuous maximum power point tracking. Operational stability–tested PSC without SAMs revealed extensive irreversible morphological degradation at the ETL/perovskite interface, including voids formation and delamination, whereas PSCs with I-SAM exhibited minimal damage accumulation. This difference was attributed to a combination of a decrease in hydroxyl groups at the interface and the higher interfacial toughness.},

However, the design of a system with structure and property persistence during repeated fusion and fission remains challenging. We show reversible fusion and fission of wet-spun graphene oxide (GO) fibers, in which a number of macroscopic fibers can fuse into a thicker one and can also separate into original individual fibers under stimulation of solvents. The dynamic geometrical deformation of GO fiber shells, caused by solvent evaporation and infiltration, is the key to the reversible fusion-fission cycles. This principle is extended to implement flexible transitions between complex fiber assemblies and the inclusion or expulsion of guest compounds.},

Such sensory innovations are unknown in nonavialan theropod dinosaurs and are poorly characterized on the line that leads to birds. We investigate morphofunctional proxies of vision and hearing in living and extinct theropods and demonstrate deep evolutionary divergences of sensory modalities. Nocturnal predation evolved early in the nonavialan lineage Alvarezsauroidea, signaled by extreme low-light vision and increases in hearing sensitivity. The Late Cretaceous alvarezsauroid Shuvuuia deserti had even further specialized hearing acuity, rivaling that of today’s barn owl. This combination of sensory adaptations evolved independently in dinosaurs long before the modern bird radiation and provides a notable example of convergence between dinosaurs and mammals.},

These adaptations include the capacity for flight and sensitivity to high-frequency sound. We used three-dimensional morphometric analyses of a large sample of extant and extinct reptiles to investigate inner ear correlates of locomotor ability and hearing acuity. Statistical analyses revealed three vestibular morphotypes, best explained by three locomotor categories—quadrupeds, bipeds and simple fliers (including bipedal nonavialan dinosaurs), and high-maneuverability fliers. Troodontids fall with Archaeopteryx among the extant low-maneuverability fliers. Analyses of cochlear shape revealed a single instance of elongation, on the stem of Archosauria. We suggest that this transformation coincided with the origin of both high-pitched juvenile location, alarm, and hatching-synchronization calls and adult responses to them.},

  abstract     = {The mammalian sex chromosome system (XX female/XY male) is ancient and highly conserved. The sex chromosome karyotype of the creeping vole ( Microtus oregoni ) represents a long-standing anomaly, with an X chromosome that is unpaired in females (X0) and exclusively maternally transmitted. We produced a highly contiguous male genome assembly, together with short-read genomes and transcriptomes for both sexes. We show that M. oregoni has lost an independently segregating Y chromosome and that the male-specific sex chromosome is a second X chromosome that is largely homologous to the maternally transmitted X. Both maternally inherited and male-specific sex chromosomes carry fragments of the ancestral Y chromosome. Consequences of this recently transformed sex chromosome system include Y-like degeneration and gene amplification on the male-specific X, expression of ancestral Y-linked genes in females, and X inactivation of the male-specific chromosome in male somatic cells. The genome of M. oregoni elucidates the processes that shape the gene content and dosage of mammalian sex chromosomes and exemplifies a rare case of plasticity in an ancient sex chromosome system.},

These immune responses mediate replication arrest of SIV in 50 to 60\% of monkeys. We show that the peptide VMAPRTLLL (VL9) embedded within the RhCMV protein Rh67 promotes intracellular MHC-E transport and recognition of RhCMV-infected fibroblasts by MHC-E–restricted CD8 + T cells. Deletion or mutation of viral VL9 abrogated MHC-E–restricted CD8 + T cell priming, resulting in CD8 + T cell responses exclusively targeting MHC-II–restricted epitopes. These responses were comparable in magnitude and differentiation to responses elicited by 68-1 vectors but did not protect against SIV. Thus, Rh67-enabled direct priming of MHC-E–restricted T cells is crucial for RhCMV/SIV vaccine efficacy.},

  abstract     = {CRISPR-Cas systems provide RNA-guided adaptive immunity in prokaryotes. We report that the multisubunit CRISPR effector Cascade transcriptionally regulates a toxin-antitoxin RNA pair, CreTA. CreT (Cascade-repressed toxin) is a bacteriostatic RNA that sequesters the rare arginine tRNA UCU (transfer RNA with anticodon UCU). CreA is a CRISPR RNA–resembling antitoxin RNA, which requires Cas6 for maturation. The partial complementarity between CreA and the creT promoter directs Cascade to repress toxin transcription. Thus, CreA becomes antitoxic only in the presence of Cascade. In CreTA-deleted cells, cascade genes become susceptible to disruption by transposable elements. We uncover several CreTA analogs associated with diverse archaeal and bacterial CRISPR- cas loci. Thus, toxin-antitoxin RNA pairs can safeguard CRISPR immunity by making cells addicted to CRISPR-Cas, which highlights the multifunctionality of Cas proteins and the intricate mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas regulation.},

Rhythmic supply of light as a result of the day and night cycle led to the evolution of circadian clocks that modulate most plant physiology, photosynthesis, metabolism, and development. To regulate crop traits and adaptation, breeders have indirectly selected for variation at circadian genes. The pervasive impact of the circadian system on crops suggests that future food production might be improved by modifying circadian rhythms, engineering the timing of transgene expression, and applying agricultural treatments at the most effective time of day. We describe the applied research required to take advantage of circadian biology in agriculture to increase production and reduce inputs.},

  abstract     = {Although almost all mycobacterial species are saprophytic environmental organisms, a few, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis , have evolved to cause transmissible human infection. By analyzing the recent emergence and spread of the environmental organism M. abscessus through the global cystic fibrosis population, we have defined key, generalizable steps involved in the pathogenic evolution of mycobacteria. We show that epigenetic modifiers, acquired through horizontal gene transfer, cause saltational increases in the pathogenic potential of specific environmental clones. Allopatric parallel evolution during chronic lung infection then promotes rapid increases in virulence through mutations in a discrete gene network; these mutations enhance growth within macrophages but impair fomite survival. As a consequence, we observe constrained pathogenic evolution while person-to-person transmission remains indirect, but postulate accelerated pathogenic adaptation once direct transmission is possible, as observed for M. tuberculosis . Our findings indicate how key interventions, such as early treatment and cross-infection control, might restrict the spread of existing mycobacterial pathogens and prevent new, emergent ones.},

  abstract     = {Transcription factor IID (TFIID) recognizes core promoters and supports preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly for RNA polymerase II (Pol II)–mediated eukaryotic transcription. We determined the structures of human TFIID–based PIC in three stepwise assembly states and revealed two-track PIC assembly: stepwise promoter deposition to Pol II and extensive modular reorganization on track I (on TATA–TFIID-binding element promoters) versus direct promoter deposition on track II (on TATA-only and TATA-less promoters). The two tracks converge at an ~50-subunit holo PIC in identical conformation, whereby TFIID stabilizes PIC organization and supports loading of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)–activating kinase (CAK) onto Pol II and CAK-mediated phosphorylation of the Pol II carboxyl-terminal domain. Unexpectedly, TBP of TFIID similarly bends TATA box and TATA-less promoters in PIC. Our study provides structural visualization of stepwise PIC assembly on highly diversified promoters.},

Without much deliberation, I said I would use it to help others. The question haunted me. Like many graduate students, I was overwhelmed with research, teaching, coursework, and some attempt at a personal life. Still, I asked myself, “Do I really need a 25th hour to help other people—or do I need to make better use of the 24 hours I have?” A short time later, I started to volunteer for an organization that provides transportation for senior citizens and people with disabilities.

The G614 strain and its recent variants are now the dominant circulating forms. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of a full-length G614 S trimer, which adopts three distinct prefusion conformations that differ primarily by the position of one receptor-binding domain. A loop disordered in the D614 S trimer wedges between domains within a protomer in the G614 spike. This added interaction appears to prevent premature dissociation of the G614 trimer—effectively increasing the number of functional spikes and enhancing infectivity—and to modulate structural rearrangements for membrane fusion. These findings extend our understanding of viral entry and suggest an improved immunogen for vaccine development.},

Certain DNA viruses that infect hosts as diverse as cyanobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria exhibit wholesale substitution of aminoadenine for adenine, thereby forming three hydrogen bonds with thymine and violating Watson-Crick pairing rules. Aminoadenine-encoded DNA polymerases, homologous to the Klenow fragment of bacterial DNA polymerase I that includes 3′-exonuclease but lacks 5′-exonuclease, were found to preferentially select for aminoadenine instead of adenine in deoxynucleoside triphosphate incorporation templated by thymine. Polymerase genes occur in synteny with genes for a biosynthesis enzyme that produces aminoadenine deoxynucleotides in a wide array of Siphoviridae bacteriophages. Congruent phylogenetic clustering of the polymerases and biosynthesis enzymes suggests that aminoadenine has propagated in DNA alongside adenine since archaic stages of evolution.},

A chemical hybrid between adenine and guanine, 2-aminoadenine (Z), replaces adenine in the DNA of the cyanobacterial virus S-2L. We show that S-2L and Vibrio phage PhiVC8 encode a third purine pathway catalyzed by PurZ, a distant paralog of succinoadenylate synthase (PurA), the enzyme condensing aspartate and inosylate in the adenine pathway. PurZ condenses aspartate with deoxyguanylate into dSMP (N6-succino-2-amino-2′-deoxyadenylate), which undergoes defumarylation and phosphorylation to give dZTP (2-amino-2′-deoxyadenosine-5′-triphosphate), a substrate for the phage DNA polymerase. Crystallography and phylogenetics analyses indicate a close relationship between phage PurZ and archaeal PurA enzymes.

Tunnel junctions were prepared by in situ shadowing. Despite the lack of lattice matching between Sn and InSb, a 15-nanometer-thick shell of tin was found to induce a hard superconducting gap, with superconductivity persisting in magnetic field up to 4 teslas. A small island of Sn-InSb exhibits the two-electron charging effect. These findings suggest a less restrictive approach to fabricating superconducting and topological quantum circuits.},

We used a combination of datasets to simulate spatially heterogeneous nuisance and damage impacts. Simulated impacts are greater in the northeast of the play and smaller in the southwest. This heterogeneity is driven by concentrations of population density. Spatially varying red-light thresholds normalized on these impacts [moment magnitude ( M w ) 2.0 to 5.0] are fairer and safer than a single threshold applied over a broad area. Sensitivity tests indicate that the forecast maximum magnitude is the most influential parameter. Our method provides a guideline for traffic light protocols and managing induced seismicity risks.},

The ion diffusion coefficient reaches two orders of magnitude higher than the coefficient in bulk water. Atomic-scale ion transport shows a threshold behavior due to the critical energy barrier for hydrated ion insertion.

Vertebrate richness and activity were higher at equid wells than at adjacent dry sites, and, by mimicking flood disturbance, equid wells became nurseries for riparian trees.

After human arrival, rates of turnover accelerate by a median factor of 11, with faster rates on islands colonized in the past 1500 years than for those colonized earlier. This global anthropogenic acceleration in turnover suggests that islands are on trajectories of continuing change.

This population collapse is postulated to have caused decreases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at around 1610 CE, as a result of a wave of land abandonment in the wake of disease, slavery, and warfare, whereby the attendant reversion to forest substantially increased terrestrial carbon sequestration. On the basis of 39 Amazonian fossil pollen records, we show that there was no synchronous reforestation event associated with such an atmospheric carbon dioxide response after European arrival in Amazonia. Instead, we find that, at most sites, land abandonment and forest regrowth began about 300 to 600 years before European arrival. Pre-European pandemics, social strife, or environmental change may have contributed to these early site abandonments and ecological shifts.},

  abstract     = {Shark sanctuaries, defined as national prohibitions on the commercial fishing and trade of sharks, provide globally important refuges for some shark species (1, 2). The Maldives has earned international acclaim for being a sanctuary and reaps considerable economic benefit from shark dive tourism (3, 4). Despite its success in shark conservation, the country may repeal or weaken its sanctuary legislation based on the desire to benefit economically from shark fishing and perceptions of increased conflict between fishers and sharks due to depredation (when sharks take or damage catches) (5). Although recent pandemic-related disruption of tourism likely fueled this initiative, it may have been inevitable given that revenue generated from shark tourism does not directly benefit communities that once fished sharks and now experience depredation (3, 4).},

  abstract     = {Russia is home to one-fifth of the world&#39;s forest lands, about 90\% of which comprise fragile boreal areas (1, 2). These forests sustain unique human cultures, valuable wilderness, and biodiversity (1, 2). They also play a crucial role in the flows of atmospheric moisture on which millions of people depend and sequester a substantial, though uncertain, quantity of greenhouse gases (1). Despite their importance, Russian forests have suffered from wasteful over-harvesting of accessible timber, inadequate protection, fire, and pests, and new challenges—such as forests on melting permafrost—are emerging (1–3). The previous forest code and a long history of extraction without investment have been widely blamed for exacerbating these problems (1, 4, 5). The Forest Council of the Russian Academy of Sciences has initiated work on a new national forest code (2, 6). The future of Russia&#39;s vast forests depends on the implementation of effective policy.},

To study astrocyte cell interactions in vivo, we developed rabies barcode interaction detection followed by sequencing (RABID-seq), which combines barcoded viral tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Using RABID-seq, we identified axon guidance molecules as candidate mediators of microglia-astrocyte interactions that promote CNS pathology in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and, potentially, multiple sclerosis (MS). In vivo cell-specific genetic perturbation EAE studies, in vitro systems, and the analysis of MS scRNA-seq datasets and CNS tissue established that Sema4D and Ephrin-B3 expressed in microglia control astrocyte responses via PlexinB2 and EphB3, respectively. Furthermore, a CNS-penetrant EphB3 inhibitor suppressed astrocyte and microglia proinflammatory responses and ameliorated EAE. In summary, RABID-seq identified microglia-astrocyte interactions and candidate therapeutic targets.},

We developed a reporter, SPOTlight, for brainwide imaging of ISR state with cellular resolution. Unexpectedly, we found a class of neurons in mouse brain, striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs), in which the ISR was activated at steady state. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations revealed that ISR signaling was necessary in CINs for normal type 2 dopamine receptor (D2R) modulation. Inhibiting the ISR inverted the sign of D2R modulation of CIN firing and evoked dopamine release and altered skill learning. Thus, a noncanonical, steady-state mode of ISR activation is found in CINs, revealing a neuromodulatory role for the ISR in learning.},

  abstract     = {Plants constantly experience fluctuating internal and external mechanical cues, ranging from nanoscale deformation of wall components, cell growth variability, nutating stems, and fluttering leaves to stem flexion under tree weight and wind drag. Developing plants use such fluctuations to monitor and channel their own shape and growth through a form of proprioception. Fluctuations in mechanical cues may also be actively enhanced, producing oscillating behaviors in tissues. For example, proprioception through leaf nastic movements may promote organ flattening. We propose that fluctuation-enhanced proprioception allows plant organs to sense their own shapes and behave like active materials with adaptable outputs to face variable environments, whether internal or external. Because certain shapes are more amenable to fluctuations, proprioception may also help plant shapes to reach self-organized criticality to support such adaptability.},

  abstract     = {Skin scarring, the end result of adult wound healing, is detrimental to tissue form and function. Engrailed-1 lineage–positive fibroblasts (EPFs) are known to function in scarring, but Engrailed-1 lineage–negative fibroblasts (ENFs) remain poorly characterized. Using cell transplantation and transgenic mouse models, we identified a dermal ENF subpopulation that gives rise to postnatally derived EPFs by activating Engrailed-1 expression during adult wound healing. By studying ENF responses to substrate mechanics, we found that mechanical tension drives Engrailed-1 activation via canonical mechanotransduction signaling. Finally, we showed that blocking mechanotransduction signaling with either verteporfin, an inhibitor of Yes-associated protein (YAP), or fibroblast-specific transgenic YAP knockout prevents Engrailed-1 activation and promotes wound regeneration by ENFs, with recovery of skin appendages, ultrastructure, and mechanical strength. This finding suggests that there are two possible outcomes to postnatal wound healing: a fibrotic response (EPF-mediated) and a regenerative response (ENF-mediated).},

We show that 6 to 20\% of wells are no more than 5 meters deeper than the water table, implying that millions of wells are at risk of running dry if groundwater levels decline by only a few meters. Further, newer wells are not being constructed deeper than older wells in some of the places experiencing significant groundwater level declines, suggesting that newer wells are at least as likely to run dry as older wells if groundwater levels continue to decline. Poor water quality in deep aquifers and the high costs of well construction limit the effectiveness of tapping deep groundwater to stave off the loss of access to water as wells run dry.},

We used a coalescent framework to combine retrospective molecular clock inference with forward epidemiological simulations to determine how long SARS-CoV-2 could have circulated before the time of the most recent common ancestor of all sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our results define the period between mid-October and mid-November 2019 as the plausible interval when the first case of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Hubei province, China. By characterizing the likely dynamics of the virus before it was discovered, we show that more than two-thirds of SARS-CoV-2–like zoonotic events would be self-limited, dying out without igniting a pandemic. Our findings highlight the shortcomings of zoonosis surveillance approaches for detecting highly contagious pathogens with moderate mortality rates.},

We demonstrate single near-infrared photon detection by coupling photons to the localized surface plasmons of a graphene-based Josephson junction. Using the photon-induced switching statistics of the current-biased device, we reveal the critical role of quasiparticles generated by the absorbed photon in the detection mechanism.

Visible light–initiated triplet energy transfer promotes homolysis of the O–O bond in di- tert -butyl or dicumyl peroxide under mild conditions. The resulting alkoxyl radicals undergo divergent reactivity, either hydrogen-atom transfer from a substrate C–H bond or generation of a methyl radical via β-methyl scission. The relative rates of these steps may be tuned by varying the reaction conditions or peroxide substituents to optimize the yield of methylated product arising from nickel-mediated cross-coupling of substrate and methyl radicals.},

Photonic strategies enable angular selectivity of thermal emission over narrow bandwidths, but thermal radiation is a broadband phenomenon. The ability to constrain emitted thermal radiation to fixed narrow angular ranges over broad bandwidths is an important, but lacking, capability. We introduce gradient epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials that enable broad-spectrum directional control of thermal emission. We demonstrate two emitters consisting of multiple oxides that exhibit high (&gt;0.7, &gt;0.6) directional emissivity (60° to 75°, 70° to 85°) in the p-polarization for a range of wavelengths (10.0 to 14.3 micrometers, 7.7 to 11.5 micrometers). This broadband directional emission enables meaningful radiative heat transfer primarily in the high emissivity directions. Decoupling the conventional limitations on angular and spectral response improves performance for applications such as thermal camouflaging, solar heating, radiative cooling, and waste heat recovery.},

However, each cardinal class is composed of multiple neuronal types with distinct molecular, anatomical, and physiological features, and there is not a unifying logic that systematically accounts for this diversity. We reasoned that the expansion of new neuronal types occurred in a stepwise manner analogous to animal speciation, and we explored this by defining transcriptomic relationships using a top-down approach. We uncovered orderly genetic tiers that sequentially divide groups of neurons by their motor-sensory, local-long range, and excitatory-inhibitory features. The genetic signatures defining neuronal projections were tied to neuronal birth date and conserved across cardinal classes. Thus, the intersection of cardinal class with projection markers provides a unifying taxonomic solution for systematically identifying distinct functional subsets.},

  abstract     = {Given the increasing interest in keeping global warming below 1.5°C, a key question is what this would mean for China’s emission pathway, energy restructuring, and decarbonization. By conducting a multimodel study, we find that the 1.5°C-consistent goal would require China to reduce its carbon emissions and energy consumption by more than 90 and 39\%, respectively, compared with the “no policy” case. Negative emission technologies play an important role in achieving near-zero emissions, with captured carbon accounting on average for 20\% of the total reductions in 2050. Our multimodel comparisons reveal large differences in necessary emission reductions across sectors, whereas what is consistent is that the power sector is required to achieve full decarbonization by 2050. The cross-model averages indicate that China’s accumulated policy costs may amount to 2.8 to 5.7\% of its gross domestic product by 2050, given the 1.5°C warming limit.},

  abstract     = {The temporal order of DNA replication [replication timing (RT)] is correlated with chromatin modifications and three-dimensional genome architecture; however, causal links have not been established, largely because of an inability to manipulate the global RT program. We show that loss of RIF1 causes near-complete elimination of the RT program by increasing heterogeneity between individual cells. RT changes are coupled with widespread alterations in chromatin modifications and genome compartmentalization. Conditional depletion of RIF1 causes replication-dependent disruption of histone modifications and alterations in genome architecture. These effects were magnified with successive cycles of altered RT. These results support models in which the timing of chromatin replication and thus assembly plays a key role in maintaining the global epigenetic state.},

  abstract     = {Given vaccine dose shortages and logistical challenges, various deployment strategies are being proposed to increase population immunity levels to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Two critical issues arise: How timing of delivery of the second dose will affect infection dynamics and how it will affect prospects for the evolution of viral immune escape via a buildup of partially immune individuals. Both hinge on the robustness of the immune response elicited by a single dose as compared with natural and two-dose immunity. Building on an existing immuno-epidemiological model, we find that in the short term, focusing on one dose generally decreases infections, but that longer-term outcomes depend on this relative immune robustness. We then explore three scenarios of selection and find that a one-dose policy may increase the potential for antigenic evolution under certain conditions of partial population immunity. We highlight the critical need to test viral loads and quantify immune responses after one vaccine dose and to ramp up vaccination efforts globally.},

However, we also argued that uncertainties in immunodynamics, and in particular evolutionary dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), dominate our ability to project key scenarios.

  abstract     = {Extensive global sampling and sequencing of the pandemic virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have enabled researchers to monitor its spread and to identify concerning new variants. Two important determinants of variant spread are how frequently they arise within individuals and how likely they are to be transmitted. To characterize within-host diversity and transmission, we deep-sequenced 1313 clinical samples from the United Kingdom. SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by low levels of within-host diversity when viral loads are high and by a narrow bottleneck at transmission. Most variants are either lost or occasionally fixed at the point of transmission, with minimal persistence of shared diversity, patterns that are readily observable on the phylogenetic tree. Our results suggest that transmission-enhancing and/or immune-escape SARS-CoV-2 variants are likely to arise infrequently but could spread rapidly if successfully transmitted.},

To address this need, we introduce the Neuropixels 2.0 probe together with newly designed analysis algorithms. The probe has more than 5000 sites and is miniaturized to facilitate chronic implants in small mammals and recording during unrestrained behavior. High-quality recordings over long time scales were reliably obtained in mice and rats in six laboratories. Improved site density and arrangement combined with newly created data processing methods enable automatic post hoc correction for brain movements, allowing recording from the same neurons for more than 2 months. These probes and algorithms enable stable recordings from thousands of sites during free behavior, even in small animals such as mice.},

Using de novo metagenome assembly, we constructed and functionally annotated a database of more than 5000 genomes, comprising 1209 bacterial species of which 75\% are unknown. The microbial composition, diversity, and functional content exhibit associations with animal taxonomy, diet, activity, social structure, and life span.

In this study, however, we delineated their specific gene and protein expression profiles and identified several distinct goblet cell populations that form two differentiation trajectories. One distinct subtype, the intercrypt goblet cells (icGCs), located at the colonic luminal surface, produced mucus with properties that differed from the mucus secreted by crypt-residing goblet cells. Mice with defective icGCs had increased sensitivity to chemically induced colitis and manifested spontaneous colitis with age. Furthermore, alterations in mucus and reduced numbers of icGCs were observed in patients with both active and remissive ulcerative colitis, which highlights the importance of icGCs in maintaining functional protection of the epithelium.},

  abstract     = {Protocadherin-19 ( PCDH19 ) mutations cause early-onset seizures and cognitive impairment. The PCDH19 gene is on the X-chromosome. Unlike most X-linked disorders, PCDH19 mutations affect heterozygous females ( PCDH19 HET♀ ) but not hemizygous males ( PCDH19 HEMI♂ ); however, the reason why remains to be elucidated. We demonstrate that PCDH19, a cell-adhesion molecule, is enriched at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. Pcdh19 HET♀ but not Pcdh19 HEMI♂ mice show impaired mossy fiber synaptic structure and physiology. Consistently, Pcdh19 HET♀ but not Pcdh19 HEMI♂ mice exhibit reduced pattern completion and separation abilities, which require mossy fiber synaptic function. Furthermore, PCDH19 appears to interact with N-cadherin at mossy fiber synapses. In Pcdh19 HET♀ conditions, mismatch between PCDH19 and N-cadherin diminishes N-cadherin–dependent signaling and impairs mossy fiber synapse development; N-cadherin overexpression rescues Pcdh19 HET♀ phenotypes. These results reveal previously unknown molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the female-specific PCDH19 disorder phenotype.},

Using network analysis and an exceptional fossil dataset spanning the past 21 million years, we show that mammalian ecological assemblages undergo long periods of functional stasis, notwithstanding high taxonomic volatility due to dispersal, speciation, and extinction. Higher functional richness and diversity promoted the persistence of functional faunas despite species extinction risk being indistinguishable among these different faunas. These findings, and the large mismatch between functional and taxonomic successions, indicate that although safeguarding functional diversity may or may not minimize species losses, it would certainly enhance the persistence of ecosystem functioning in the face of future disturbances.},

We report a series of robust, selective, and tunable adsorptive membranes that feature porous aromatic framework nanoparticles embedded within ion exchange polymers and demonstrate their use in an efficient, one-step separation strategy termed ion-capture electrodialysis. This process uses electrodialysis configurations with adsorptive membranes to simultaneously desalinate complex water sources and capture diverse target solutes with negligible capture of competing ions. Our methods are applicable to the development of efficient and selective multifunctional separations that use adsorptive membranes.},

  abstract     = {Gene-regulatory networks achieve complex mappings of inputs to outputs through mechanisms that are poorly understood. We found that in the galactose-responsive pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the decision to activate the transcription of genes encoding pathway components is controlled independently from the expression level, resulting in behavior resembling that of a mechanical dimmer switch. This was not a direct result of chromatin regulation or combinatorial control at galactose-responsive promoters; rather, this behavior was achieved by hierarchical regulation of the expression and activity of a single transcription factor. Hierarchical regulation is ubiquitous, and thus dimmer switch regulation is likely a key feature of many biological systems. Dimmer switch gene regulation may allow cells to fine-tune their responses to multi-input environments on both physiological and evolutionary time scales.},

We collected metagenomes from all major ocean regions as part of the Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program (Bio-GO-SHIP) and quantified shifts in genes involved in nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron assimilation. We found regional transitions in stress type and severity as well as widespread co-stress. Prochlorococcus stress genes, bottle experiments, and Earth system model predictions were correlated. We propose that the biogeography of multinutrient stress is stoichiometrically linked by controls on nitrogen fixation. Our omics-based description of phytoplankton resource use provides a nuanced and highly resolved description of nutrient stress in the global ocean.},

Here, we use the relationship between population density and body mass among living species combined with our substantial knowledge of Tyrannosaurus rex to calculate population variables and preservation rates for postjuvenile T. rex . We estimate that its abundance at any one time was ~20,000 individuals, that it persisted for ~127,000 generations, and that the total number of T. rex that ever lived was ~2.5 billion individuals, with a fossil recovery rate of 1 per ~80 million individuals or 1 per 16,000 individuals where its fossils are most abundant. The uncertainties in these values span more than two orders of magnitude, largely because of the variance in the density–body mass relationship rather than variance in the paleobiological input variables.},

To understand the destabilization of carbon storage, it is necessary to consider these effects in the context of long-term ecological change. In Alaskan boreal forests, we found that shifts in dominant plant species catalyzed by severe fire compensated for greater combustion of soil carbon over decadal time scales. Severe burning of organic soils shifted tree dominance from slow-growing black spruce to fast-growing deciduous broadleaf trees, resulting in a net increase in carbon storage by a factor of 5 over the disturbance cycle. Reduced fire activity in future deciduous-dominated boreal forests could increase the tenure of this carbon on the landscape, thereby mitigating the feedback to climate warming.},

We present a multifrequency electron spin resonance (ESR) study down to millikelvin temperatures, revealing a rapid drop of the spin susceptibility at 6 kelvin. This opening of a spin gap, accompanied by structural modifications, is consistent with the formation of a valence bond solid ground state. We identify an impurity contribution to the ESR response that becomes dominant when the intrinsic spins form singlets. Probing the electrons directly manifests the pivotal role of defects for the low-energy properties of quantum spin systems without magnetic order.},

We report on the identification of intertwined phases with broken rotational symmetry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Using transverse resistance measurements, we find a strongly anisotropic phase located in a “wedge” above the underdoped region of the superconducting dome. Upon its crossing with the superconducting dome, a reduction of the critical temperature is observed. Furthermore, the superconducting state exhibits an anisotropic response to a direction-dependent in-plane magnetic field, revealing nematic ordering across the entire superconducting dome. These results indicate that nematic fluctuations might play an important role in the low-temperature phases of magic-angle TBG.},

However, the current production process for the food given to farmed fish still threatens coastal ecosystems and the livelihoods of local fishers, especially in the Global South (2–7). Before aquaculture is scaled up further, its global environmental and socioeconomic footprint should be carefully reimagined.},

  abstract     = {A severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant, VOC 202012/01 (lineage B.1.1.7), emerged in southeast England in September 2020 and is rapidly spreading toward fixation. Using a variety of statistical and dynamic modeling approaches, we estimate that this variant has a 43 to 90\% (range of 95\% credible intervals, 38 to 130\%) higher reproduction number than preexisting variants. A fitted two-strain dynamic transmission model shows that VOC 202012/01 will lead to large resurgences of COVID-19 cases. Without stringent control measures, including limited closure of educational institutions and a greatly accelerated vaccine rollout, COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths across England in the first 6 months of 2021 were projected to exceed those in 2020. VOC 202012/01 has spread globally and exhibits a similar transmission increase (59 to 74\%) in Denmark, Switzerland, and the United States.},

  abstract     = {G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key regulators of information transmission between cells and organs. Despite this, we have only a limited understanding of the behavior of GPCRs in the apo state and the conformational changes upon agonist binding that lead to G protein recruitment and activation. We expressed and purified unmodified apo and peptide-bound calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) receptors from insect cells to determine their cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures, and we complemented these with analysis of protein conformational dynamics using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and three-dimensional variance analysis of the cryo-EM data. Together with our previously published structure of the active, Gs-bound CGRP receptor complex, our work provides insight into the mechanisms of class B1 GPCR activation.},

By combining static, time-resolved, and cryotrapping spectroscopy and crystallography as well as computation, we characterized Chlorella variabilis FAP reaction intermediates on time scales from subpicoseconds to milliseconds. High-resolution crystal structures from synchrotron and free electron laser x-ray sources highlighted an unusual bent shape of the oxidized flavin chromophore. We demonstrate that decarboxylation occurs directly upon reduction of the excited flavin by the fatty acid substrate. Along with flavin reoxidation by the alkyl radical intermediate, a major fraction of the cleaved carbon dioxide unexpectedly transformed in 100 nanoseconds, most likely into bicarbonate. This reaction is orders of magnitude faster than in solution. Two strictly conserved residues, R451 and C432, are essential for substrate stabilization and functional charge transfer.},

Key enzymes responsible for deposition and removal of DNA methylation are known, but how they cooperate to regulate the methylation landscape remains a central question. Using a knockin DNA methylation reporter, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in human embryonic stem cells to discover DNA methylation regulators. The top screen hit was an uncharacterized gene, QSER1 , which proved to be a key guardian of bivalent promoters and poised enhancers of developmental genes, especially those residing in DNA methylation valleys (or canyons). We further demonstrate genetic and biochemical interactions of QSER1 and TET1, supporting their cooperation to safeguard transcriptional and developmental programs from DNMT3-mediated de novo methylation.},

The system, termed integrase-editable memory by engineered mutagenesis with optical in situ readout (intMEMOIR), allowed in situ reconstruction of lineage relationships in cultured mouse cells and flies. intMEMOIR uses an array of independent three-state genetic memory elements that can recombine stochastically and irreversibly, allowing up to 59,049 distinct digital states. It reconstructed lineage trees in stem cells and enabled simultaneous analysis of single-cell clonal history, spatial position, and gene expression in Drosophila brain sections.

Besides double-stranded linear fragments, other topological forms of cell-free DNA also exist—namely circular and single-stranded molecules.

Myocardial inhibition of Klf1 function does not affect heart development, but it severely impairs regeneration. Transient Klf1 activation is sufficient to expand mature myocardium in uninjured hearts. Klf1 directs epigenetic reprogramming of the cardiac transcription factor network, permitting coordinated cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and proliferation. Myocardial expansion is supported by Klf1-induced rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism from oxidative respiration to anabolic pathways. Our findings establish Klf1 as a core transcriptional regulator of cardiomyocyte renewal in adult zebrafish hearts.},

The phase diagram, established by simultaneous measurements of resistivity and tunneling spectra under ionic gating, demonstrates a pseudogap phase in the low-doping regime. The ratio of the superconducting transition temperature and Fermi temperature in the low–carrier density limit is consistent with the theoretical upper bound expected in the BCS-BEC crossover regime.

We observed the Crab Pulsar simultaneously at x-ray and radio wavelengths, finding enhancement of the x-ray emission by 3.8 ± 0.7\% (a 5.4σ detection) coinciding with GRPs.

We present a process for glassworks using high-throughput IM of an amorphous silicon dioxide nanocomposite that combines established process technologies and low-energy sintering. We produce highly transparent glass using classical IM and sintering, allowing for a potentially substantial reduction in energy consumption.

  abstract     = {Mild methods to cleave the carbon-oxygen (C−O) bond in alkyl ethers could simplify chemical syntheses through the elaboration of these robust, readily available precursors. Here we report that dibromoboranes react with alkyl ethers in the presence of a nickel catalyst and zinc reductant to insert boron into the C−O bond. Subsequent reactivity can effect oxygen-to-nitrogen substitution or one-carbon homologation of cyclic ethers and more broadly streamline preparation of bioactive compounds. Mechanistic studies reveal a cleavage-then-rebound pathway via zinc/nickel tandem catalysis.},

  abstract     = {Sexual reproduction in angiosperms relies on precise communications between the pollen and pistil. The molecular mechanisms underlying these communications remain elusive. We established that in Arabidopsis , a stigmatic gatekeeper, the ANJEA–FERONIA (ANJ–FER) receptor kinase complex, perceives the RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR peptides RALF23 and RALF33 to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the stigma papillae, whereas pollination reduces stigmatic ROS, allowing pollen hydration. Upon pollination, the POLLEN COAT PROTEIN B-class peptides (PCP-Bs) compete with RALF23/33 for binding to the ANJ–FER complex, leading to a decline of stigmatic ROS that facilitates pollen hydration. Our results elucidate a molecular gating mechanism in which distinct peptide classes from pollen compete with stigma peptides for interaction with a stigmatic receptor kinase complex, allowing the pollen to hydrate and germinate.},

  abstract     = {The brains of modern humans differ from those of great apes in size, shape, and cortical organization, notably in frontal lobe areas involved in complex cognitive tasks, such as social cognition, tool use, and language. When these differences arose during human evolution is a question of ongoing debate. Here, we show that the brains of early Homo from Africa and Western Asia (Dmanisi) retained a primitive, great ape–like organization of the frontal lobe. By contrast, African Homo younger than 1.5 million years ago, as well as all Southeast Asian Homo erectus , exhibited a more derived, humanlike brain organization. Frontal lobe reorganization, once considered a hallmark of earliest Homo in Africa, thus evolved comparatively late, and long after Homo first dispersed from Africa.},

  abstract     = {Mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes predispose individuals to breast and ovarian cancer. In the clinic, these cancers are treated with inhibitors that target poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). We show that inhibition of DNPH1, a protein that eliminates cytotoxic nucleotide 5-hydroxymethyl-deoxyuridine (hmdU) monophosphate, potentiates the sensitivity of BRCA -deficient cells to PARP inhibitors (PARPi). Synthetic lethality was mediated by the action of SMUG1 glycosylase on genomic hmdU, leading to PARP trapping, replication fork collapse, DNA break formation, and apoptosis. BRCA1 -deficient cells that acquired resistance to PARPi were resensitized by treatment with hmdU and DNPH1 inhibition. Because genomic hmdU is a key determinant of PARPi sensitivity, targeting DNPH1 provides a promising strategy for the hypersensitization of BRCA -deficient cancers to PARPi therapy.},

  abstract     = {In most vertebrates, camera-style eyes contain retinal ganglion cell neurons that project to visual centers on both sides of the brain. However, in fish, ganglion cells were thought to innervate only the contralateral side, suggesting that bilateral visual projections appeared in tetrapods. Here we show that bilateral visual projections exist in non-teleost fishes and that the appearance of ipsilateral projections does not correlate with terrestrial transition or predatory behavior. We also report that the developmental program that specifies visual system laterality differs between fishes and mammals, as the Zic2 transcription factor, which specifies ipsilateral retinal ganglion cells in tetrapods, appears to be absent from fish ganglion cells. However, overexpression of human ZIC2 induces ipsilateral visual projections in zebrafish. Therefore, the existence of bilateral visual projections likely preceded the emergence of binocular vision in tetrapods.},

We identified 107,590 structural variants (SVs), of which 68\% were not discovered with short-read sequencing, and 278 SV hotspots (spanning megabases of gene-rich sequence). We characterized 130 of the most active mobile element source elements and found that 63\% of all SVs arise through homology-mediated mechanisms. This resource enables reliable graph-based genotyping from short reads of up to 50,340 SVs, resulting in the identification of 1526 expression quantitative trait loci as well as SV candidates for adaptive selection within the human population.},

  abstract     = {Hallucinations, a central symptom of psychotic disorders, are attributed to excessive dopamine in the brain. However, the neural circuit mechanisms by which dopamine produces hallucinations remain elusive, largely because hallucinations have been challenging to study in model organisms. We developed a task to quantify hallucination-like perception in mice. Hallucination-like percepts, defined as high-confidence false detections, increased after hallucination-related manipulations in mice and correlated with self-reported hallucinations in humans. Hallucination-like percepts were preceded by elevated striatal dopamine levels, could be induced by optogenetic stimulation of mesostriatal dopamine neurons, and could be reversed by the antipsychotic drug haloperidol. These findings reveal a causal role for dopamine-dependent striatal circuits in hallucination-like perception and open new avenues to develop circuit-based treatments for psychotic disorders.},

To test this hypothesis, we optogenetically perturbed gamma spike timing in the rat medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) entorhinal cortices and found impairments in spatial and object learning tasks, respectively. MEC and LEC were synchronized with the hippocampal dentate gyrus through high- and low-gamma-frequency rhythms, respectively, and engaged either granule cells or mossy cells and CA3 pyramidal cells in a task-dependent manner. Gamma perturbation disrupted the learning-induced assembly organization of target neurons. Our findings imply that pathway-specific gamma oscillations route task-relevant information between distinct neuronal subpopulations in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit. We hypothesize that interregional gamma-time-scale spike coordination is a mechanism of neuronal communication.},

This cultural form of inheritance was once thought specific to humans, but research over the past 70 years has instead revealed it to be widespread in nature, permeating the lives of a diversity of animals, including all major classes of vertebrates. Recent studies suggest that culture’s reach may extend also to invertebrates—notably, insects. In the present century, the reach of animal culture has been found to extend across many different behavioral domains and to rest on a suite of social learning processes facilitated by a variety of selective biases that enhance the efficiency and adaptiveness of learning. Far-reaching implications, for disciplines from evolutionary biology to anthropology and conservation policies, are increasingly being explored.},

Structures of eight nanocages determined by electron microscopy spanning dihedral, tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral architectures with 2, 6, 12, and 30 antibodies per nanocage, respectively, closely match the corresponding computational models. Antibody nanocages targeting cell surface receptors enhance signaling compared with free antibodies or Fc-fusions in death receptor 5 (DR5)–mediated apoptosis, angiopoietin-1 receptor (Tie2)–mediated angiogenesis, CD40 activation, and T cell proliferation.

Using murine xenograft models and an in vitro model wherein tonic CAR signaling induces hallmark features of exhaustion, we tested the effect of transient cessation of receptor signaling, or rest, on the development and maintenance of exhaustion. Induction of rest through enforced down-regulation of the CAR protein using a drug-regulatable system or treatment with the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib resulted in the acquisition of a memory-like phenotype, global transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming, and restored antitumor functionality in exhausted CAR-T cells. This work demonstrates that rest can enhance CAR-T cell efficacy by preventing or reversing exhaustion, and it challenges the notion that exhaustion is an epigenetically fixed state.},

These repair mechanisms decline with age, but we have limited knowledge of how genome instability emerges and what strategies neurons and other long-lived cells may have evolved to protect their genomes over the human life span. A targeted sequencing approach in human embryonic stem cell–induced neurons shows that, in neurons, DNA repair is enriched at well-defined hotspots that protect essential genes. These hotspots are enriched with histone H2A isoforms and RNA binding proteins and are associated with evolutionarily conserved elements of the human genome. These findings provide a basis for understanding genome integrity as it relates to aging and disease in the nervous system.},

  abstract     = {Quantum gases of light, such as photon or polariton condensates in optical microcavities, are collective quantum systems enabling a tailoring of dissipation from, for example, cavity loss. This characteristic makes them a tool to study dissipative phases, an emerging subject in quantum many-body physics. We experimentally demonstrate a non-Hermitian phase transition of a photon Bose-Einstein condensate to a dissipative phase characterized by a biexponential decay of the condensate’s second-order coherence. The phase transition occurs because of the emergence of an exceptional point in the quantum gas. Although Bose-Einstein condensation is usually connected to lasing by a smooth crossover, the observed phase transition separates the biexponential phase from both lasing and an intermediate, oscillatory condensate regime. Our approach can be used to study a wide class of dissipative quantum phases in topological or lattice systems.},

  abstract     = {Human activities and climate change threaten marine biodiversity worldwide, though sensitivity to these stressors varies considerably by species and taxonomic group. Mapping the spatial distribution of 14 anthropogenic stressors from 2003 to 2013 onto the ranges of 1271 at-risk marine species sensitive to them, we found that, on average, species faced potential impacts across 57\% of their ranges, that this footprint expanded over time, and that the impacts intensified across 37\% of their ranges. Although fishing activity dominated the footprint of impacts in national waters, climate stressors drove the expansion and intensification of impacts. Mitigating impacts on at-risk biodiversity is critical to supporting resilient marine ecosystems, and identifying the co-occurrence of impacts across multiple taxonomic groups highlights opportunities to amplify the benefits of conservation management.},

Here, we systemically interpret changes in the use of 381 pesticides over 25 years by considering 1591 substance-specific acute toxicity threshold values for eight nontarget species groups. We find that the toxicity of applied insecticides to aquatic invertebrates and pollinators has increased considerably—in sharp contrast to the applied amount—and that this increase has been driven by highly toxic pyrethroids and neonicotinoids, respectively. We also report increasing applied toxicity to aquatic invertebrates and pollinators in genetically modified (GM) corn and to terrestrial plants in herbicide-tolerant soybeans since approximately 2010. Our results challenge the claims of a decrease in the environmental impacts of pesticide use.},

  abstract     = {Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a key technology for producing propene from shale gas, but conventional metal oxide catalysts are prone to overoxidation to form valueless CO x . Boron-based catalysts were recently found to be selective for this reaction, and B–O–B oligomers are generally regarded as active centers. We show here that the isolated boron in a zeolite framework without such oligomers exhibits high activity and selectivity for ODHP, which also hinders full hydrolysis for boron leaching in a humid atmosphere because of the B–O–SiO x linkage, achieving superior durability in a long-period test. Furthermore, we demonstrate an isolated boron with a –B[OH…O(H)–Si] 2 structure in borosilicate zeolite as the active center, which enables the activation of oxygen and a carbon–hydrogen bond to catalyze the ODHP.},

  abstract     = {Topology, parity-time (PT) symmetry, and nonlinearity are at the origin of many fundamental phenomena in complex systems across the natural sciences, but their mutual interplay remains unexplored. We established a nonlinear non-Hermitian topological platform for active tuning of PT symmetry and topological states. We found that the loss in a topological defect potential in a non-Hermitian photonic lattice can be tuned solely by nonlinearity, enabling the transition between PT-symmetric and non–PT-symmetric regimes and the maneuvering of topological zero modes. The interaction between two apparently antagonistic effects is revealed: the sensitivity close to exceptional points and the robustness of non-Hermitian topological states. Our scheme using single-channel control of global PT symmetry and topology via local nonlinearity may provide opportunities for unconventional light manipulation and device applications.},

Spontaneous photocurrent was observed along the polar direction and was absent in the direction perpendicular to it. The observed spontaneous photocurrent was explained by a quantum-mechanical shift current that reflects the geometrical and topological electronic nature of this emergent interface. The present results offer a simple guideline for symmetry engineering that is applicable to a variety of van der Waals interfaces.},

Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) rainforests were characterized by an open canopy and diverse plant–insect interactions. Plant diversity declined by 45\% at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary and did not recover for ~6 million years. Paleocene forests resembled modern Neotropical rainforests, with a closed canopy and multistratal structure dominated by angiosperms. The end-Cretaceous event triggered a long interval of low plant diversity in the Neotropics and the evolutionary assembly of today’s most diverse terrestrial ecosystem.},

We simulated volcanic degassing, atmospheric escape, and crustal hydration on Mars, incorporating observational constraints from spacecraft, rovers, and meteorites. We found that ancient water volumes equivalent to a 100 to 1500 meter global layer are simultaneously compatible with the geological evidence, loss rate estimates, and D/H measurements. In our model, the volume of water participating in the hydrological cycle decreased by 40 to 95\% over the Noachian period (~3.7 billion to 4.1 billion years ago), reaching present-day values by ~3.0 billion years ago. Between 30 and 99\% of martian water was sequestered through crustal hydration, demonstrating that irreversible chemical weathering can increase the aridity of terrestrial planets.},

Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the human Mediator-bound PIC at a resolution below 4 angstroms. Transcription factor binding sites within Mediator are primarily flexibly tethered to the tail module. CDK7 is stabilized by multiple contacts with Mediator. Two binding sites exist for the Pol II CTD, one between the head and middle modules of Mediator and the other in the active site of CDK7, providing structural evidence for Pol II CTD phosphorylation within the Mediator-bound PIC.},

As efforts to control COVID-19 disease are reintensified, understanding the age demographics driving transmission and how these affect the loosening of interventions is crucial. We analyze aggregated, age-specific mobility trends from more than 10 million individuals in the United States and link these mechanistically to age-specific COVID-19 mortality data. We estimate that as of October 2020, individuals aged 20 to 49 are the only age groups sustaining resurgent SARS-CoV-2 transmission with reproduction numbers well above one and that at least 65 of 100 COVID-19 infections originate from individuals aged 20 to 49 in the United States. Targeting interventions—including transmission-blocking vaccines—to adults aged 20 to 49 is an important consideration in halting resurgent epidemics and preventing COVID-19–attributable deaths.},

Recent studies have provocatively claimed that bacteria, viruses, and/or fungi are pervasive among cancers, key actors in cancer immunotherapy, and engineerable to treat metastases. Despite these findings, the number of microbes known to directly cause carcinogenesis remains small. Critically evaluating and building frameworks for such evidence in light of modern cancer biology is an important task. In this Review, we delineate between causal and complicit roles of microbes in cancer and trace common themes of their influence through the host’s immune system, herein defined as the immuno-oncology-microbiome axis. We further review evidence for intratumoral microbes and approaches that manipulate the host’s gut or tumor microbiome while projecting the next phase of experimental discovery.},

We illustrate how this process occurs by examining the genomic and behavioral bases of pre-mating isolation between two bird species ( Sporophila hypoxantha and the recently discovered S. iberaensis ) that belong to the southern capuchino seedeaters, a recent, rapid radiation characterized by variation in male plumage coloration and song. Although these two species co-occur without obvious ecological barriers to reproduction, we document behaviors indicating species recognition by song and plumage traits and strong assortative mating associated with genomic regions underlying male plumage patterning. Plumage differentiation likely originated through the reassembly of standing genetic variation, indicating how novel sexual signals may quickly arise and maintain species boundaries.},

The spatiotemporal receptor organization has a pivotal role in evoking cellular responses. We studied the clustering of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptors (GPCRs) and established a photoinstructive matrix with ultrasmall lock-and-key interaction pairs to control lateral membrane organization of hormone neuropeptide Y 2 receptors in living cells by light. Within seconds, receptor clustering was modulated in size, location, and density. After in situ confinement, changes in cellular morphology, motility, and calcium signaling revealed ligand-independent receptor activation. This approach may enhance the exploration of mechanisms in cell signaling and mechanotransduction.},

We show here that the adult mouse liver contains Lin − Sca-1 + Mac-1 + hematopoietic stem cells derived from the fetal liver. This population includes Lin − CD122 + CD49a + progenitors that can generate liver ILC1s but not conventional natural killer cells. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production by the liver ILC1s themselves promotes the development of these cells in situ, through effects on their IFN-γR + liver progenitors. Thus, an IFN-γ–dependent loop drives liver ILC1 development in situ, highlighting the contribution of extramedullary hematopoiesis to regional immune composition within the liver.},

  abstract     = {Cytoskeletal regulatory protein dysfunction has been etiologically linked to inherited diseases associated with immunodeficiency and autoimmunity, but the mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. Here, we show that conditional Wave2 ablation in T cells causes severe autoimmunity associated with increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation and metabolic reprogramming that engender spontaneous activation and accelerated differentiation of peripheral T cells. These mice also manifest diminished antigen-specific T cell responses associated with increased inhibitory receptor expression, dysregulated mitochondrial function, and reduced cell survival upon activation. Mechanistically, WAVE2 directly bound mTOR and inhibited its activation by impeding mTOR interactions with RAPTOR (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR) and RICTOR (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR). Both the T cell defects and immunodysregulatory disease were ameliorated by pharmacological mTOR inhibitors. Thus, WAVE2 restraint of mTOR activation is an absolute requirement for maintaining the T cell homeostasis supporting adaptive immune responses and preventing autoimmunity.},

The cause of this wildlife disease has eluded scientists for decades while its occurrence has continued to spread throughout freshwater reservoirs in the southeastern United States. Recent studies have demonstrated that vacuolar myelinopathy is induced by consumption of the epiphytic cyanobacterial species Aetokthonos hydrillicola growing on aquatic vegetation, primarily the invasive Hydrilla verticillata . Here, we describe the identification, biosynthetic gene cluster, and biological activity of aetokthonotoxin, a pentabrominated biindole alkaloid that is produced by the cyanobacterium A. hydrillicola . We identify this cyanobacterial neurotoxin as the causal agent of vacuolar myelinopathy and discuss environmental factors—especially bromide availability—that promote toxin production.},

We have designed lipopeptide fusion inhibitors that block this critical first step of infection and, on the basis of in vitro efficacy and in vivo biodistribution, selected a dimeric form for evaluation in an animal model. Daily intranasal administration to ferrets completely prevented SARS-CoV-2 direct-contact transmission during 24-hour cohousing with infected animals, under stringent conditions that resulted in infection of 100\% of untreated animals. These lipopeptides are highly stable and thus may readily translate into safe and effective intranasal prophylaxis to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2.},

A strong, polarization-dependent spectral shift and the reduced scattering of energy states with antiparallel orientation of dipoles activated in assembled helices increased optical asymmetry g -factors by a factor of more than 4600. The liquid crystal–like color variations and the nanorod-accelerated fibrillation enable drug screening in complex biological media. Improvement of long-range order can also provide structural guidance for the design of materials with high optical asymmetry.},

The SPhPs’ response was described in terms of eigenmodes and used to tomographically reconstruct the phononic surface electromagnetic fields of the object.

We investigate nonequilibrium dynamics after rapid quenches in a many-body system composed of 3 to 200 strongly interacting qubits in one and two spatial dimensions. Using a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays, we show that coherent revivals associated with so-called quantum many-body scars can be stabilized by periodic driving, which generates a robust subharmonic response akin to discrete time-crystalline order. We map Hilbert space dynamics, geometry dependence, phase diagrams, and system-size dependence of this emergent phenomenon, demonstrating new ways to steer complex dynamics in many-body systems and enabling potential applications in quantum information science.},

  abstract     = {Mitogens trigger cell division in animals. In plants, cytokinins, a group of phytohormones derived from adenine, stimulate cell proliferation. Cytokinin signaling is initiated by membrane-associated histidine kinase receptors and transduced through a phosphorelay system. We show that in the Arabidopsis shoot apical meristem (SAM), cytokinin regulates cell division by promoting nuclear shuttling of Myb-domain protein 3R4 (MYB3R4), a transcription factor that activates mitotic gene expression. Newly synthesized MYB3R4 protein resides predominantly in the cytoplasm. At the G2-to-M transition, rapid nuclear accumulation of MYB3R4—consistent with an associated transient peak in cytokinin concentration—feeds a positive feedback loop involving importins and initiates a transcriptional cascade that drives mitosis and cytokinesis. An engineered nuclear-restricted MYB3R4 mimics the cytokinin effects of enhanced cell proliferation and meristem growth.},

  abstract     = {Changes in the concentration and isotopic composition of the major constituents in seawater reflect changes in their sources and sinks. Because many of the processes controlling these sources and sinks are tied to the cycling of carbon, such records can provide insights into what drives past changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and climate. Here, we present a stable strontium (Sr) isotope record derived from pelagic marine barite. Our δ 88/86 Sr record exhibits a complex pattern, first declining between 35 and 15 million years ago (Ma), then increasing from 15 to 5 Ma, before declining again from ~5 Ma to the present. Numerical modeling reveals that the associated fluctuations in seawater Sr concentrations are about ±25\% relative to present-day seawater. We interpret the δ 88/86 Sr data as reflecting changes in the mineralogy and burial location of biogenic carbonates.},

  abstract     = {Dearomative cycloaddition reactions represent an ideal means of converting flat arenes into three-dimensional architectures of increasing interest in medicinal chemistry. Quinolines, isoquinolines, and quinazolines, despite containing latent diene and alkene subunits, are scarcely applied in cycloaddition reactions because of the inherent low reactivity of aromatic systems and selectivity challenges. Here, we disclose an energy transfer–mediated, highly regio- and diastereoselective intermolecular [4 + 2] dearomative cycloaddition reaction of these bicyclic azaarenes with a plethora of electronically diverse alkenes. This approach bypasses the general reactivity and selectivity issues, thereby providing various bridged polycycles that previously have been inaccessible or required elaborate synthetic efforts. Computational studies with density functional theory elucidate the mechanism and origins of the observed regio- and diastereoselectivities.},

Through genome-wide association studies, we now understand that thousands of gene variants each contribute a very small amount to behavioral variation between individuals, and the idea that a single gene could cause violent behavior has been rejected. In February, the so-called “warrior gene” theory as a criminal defense was dealt a blow by the New Mexico Supreme Court in the case of State v. Yepez (2), but the ruling did not go far enough. By failing to address the current scientific consensus, the court missed an opportunity to create the much-needed persuasive authority for other courts on this issue. We must improve communication between scientists and the legal system to ensure that courts can access and understand the most current science.},

The 5′ splice site and branch point sequence of the U12-type intron are recognized by the U6atac and U12 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), respectively. Five newly identified proteins stabilize the conformation of the catalytic center: The zinc finger protein SCNM1 functionally mimics the SF3a complex of the major spliceosome, the RBM48-ARMC7 complex binds the γ-monomethyl phosphate cap at the 5′ end of U6atac snRNA, the U-box protein PPIL2 coordinates loop I of U5 snRNA and stabilizes U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), and CRIPT stabilizes U12 snRNP.

Approaches to targeting immutable components are needed to clear HIV-1 infection. Here, we report that the caspase recruitment domain–containing protein 8 (CARD8) inflammasome senses HIV-1 protease activity. HIV-1 can evade CARD8 sensing because its protease remains inactive in infected cells before viral budding. Premature intracellular activation of the viral protease triggered CARD8 inflammasome–mediated pyroptosis of HIV-1–infected cells. This strategy led to the clearance of latent HIV-1 in patient CD4 + T cells after viral reactivation. Thus, our study identifies CARD8 as an inflammasome sensor of HIV-1, which holds promise as a strategy for the clearance of persistent HIV-1 infection.},

We used a structure-based approach to deconvolute IL-10 pleiotropy by determining the structure of the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) complex by cryo–electron microscopy at a resolution of 3.5 angstroms. The hexameric structure shows how IL-10 and IL-10Rα form a composite surface to engage the shared signaling receptor IL-10Rβ, enabling the design of partial agonists. IL-10 variants with a range of IL-10Rβ binding strengths uncovered substantial differences in response thresholds across immune cell populations, providing a means of manipulating IL-10 cell type selectivity. Some variants displayed myeloid-biased activity by suppressing macrophage activation without stimulating inflammatory CD8 + T cells, thereby uncoupling the major opposing functions of IL-10. These results provide a mechanistic blueprint for tuning the pleiotropic actions of IL-10.},

How cGAS is regulated during cell cycle transition is not clear. Here, we found direct biochemical evidence that cGAS activity was selectively suppressed during mitosis in human cell lines and uncovered two parallel mechanisms underlying this suppression. First, cGAS was hyperphosphorylated at the N terminus by mitotic kinases, including Aurora kinase B. The N terminus of cGAS was critical for sensing nuclear chromatin but not mitochondrial DNA. Chromatin sensing was blocked by hyperphosphorylation. Second, oligomerization of chromatin-bound cGAS, which is required for its activation, was prevented. Together, these mechanisms ensure that cGAS is inactive when associated with chromatin during mitosis, which may help to prevent autoimmune reaction.},

To investigate how nutrient uptake is regulated in the small intestine, we tested the effect of diets with different macronutrient compositions on epithelial gene expression. We found that enzymes and transporters required for carbohydrate digestion and absorption were regulated by carbohydrate availability. The “on-demand” induction of this machinery required γδ T cells, which regulated this program through the suppression of interleukin-22 production by type 3 innate lymphoid cells. Nutrient availability altered the tissue localization and transcriptome of γδ T cells. Additionally, transcriptional responses to diet involved cellular remodeling of the epithelial compartment. Thus, this work identifies a role for γδ T cells in nutrient sensing.},

Apart from the tropics, monthly AOD values over most of the SH exceeded the average by more than three standard deviations. This anomalous AOD is attributed to a combination of the intensity and location of the Australian bushfires. The fires took place south enough, where the tropopause altitude is relatively low, within the mid-latitude cyclone belt. This location allowed for deep convection over and downwind of the fires, which transported the smoke to the stratosphere, where its lifetime is an order of magnitude longer than it would have been in the lower atmosphere. The lower bound of the stratospheric smoke mass in January 2020 was ~2.1 ± 1 teragrams, which lead to cooling by more than 1.0 ± 0.6 watts per square meter over cloud-free oceanic areas.},

  abstract     = {Controlling the strength of interactions is essential for studying quantum phenomena emerging in systems of correlated fermions. We introduce a device geometry whereby magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene is placed in close proximity to a Bernal bilayer graphene, separated by a 3-nanometer-thick barrier. By using charge screening from the Bernal bilayer, the strength of electron-electron Coulomb interaction within the twisted bilayer can be continuously tuned. Transport measurements show that tuning Coulomb screening has opposite effects on the insulating and superconducting states: As Coulomb interaction is weakened by screening, the insulating states become less robust, whereas the stability of superconductivity at the optimal doping is enhanced. The results provide important constraints on theoretical models for understanding the mechanism of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene.},

  abstract     = {Tandem catalysis couples multiple reactions and promises to improve chemical processing, but precise spatiotemporal control over reactive intermediates remains elusive. We used atomic layer deposition to grow In 2 O 3 over Pt/Al 2 O 3 , and this nanostructure kinetically couples the domains through surface hydrogen atom transfer, resulting in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene by platinum, then selective hydrogen combustion by In 2 O 3 , without excessive hydrocarbon combustion. Other nanostructures, including platinum on In 2 O 3 or platinum mixed with In 2 O 3 , favor propane combustion because they cannot organize the reactions sequentially. The net effect is rapid and stable oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high per-pass yields exceeding the PDH equilibrium. Tandem catalysis using this nanoscale overcoating geometry is validated as an opportunity for highly selective catalytic performance in a grand challenge reaction.},

Aquilolamna , tentatively assigned to Lamniformes, is characterized by hypertrophied, slender pectoral fins. This previously unknown body plan represents an unexpected evolutionary experimentation with underwater flight among sharks, more than 30 million years before the rise of manta and devil rays (Mobulidae), and shows that winglike pectoral fins have evolved independently in two distantly related clades of filter-feeding elasmobranchs. This newly described group of highly specialized long-winged sharks (Aquilolamnidae) displays an aquilopelagic-like ecomorphotype and may have occupied, in late Mesozoic seas, the ecological niche filled by mobulids and other batoids after the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary.},

We performed high-depth (250×) whole-genome sequencing of multiple tissues from three individuals to identify hundreds of somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNVs). Using these variants as “endogenous barcodes” in single cells, we reconstructed early embryonic cell divisions. Targeted sequencing of clonal sSNVs in different organs (about 25,000×) and in more than 1000 cortical single cells, as well as single-nucleus RNA sequencing and single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing of ~100,000 cortical single cells, demonstrated asymmetric contributions of early progenitors to extraembryonic tissues, distinct germ layers, and organs. Our data suggest onset of gastrulation at an effective progenitor pool of about 170 cells and about 50 to 100 founders for the forebrain. Thus, mosaic mutations provide a permanent record of human embryonic development at very high resolution.},

Of 10 reconstructed postzygotic divisions, none resulted in balanced contributions of daughter lineages to tissues. In both living individuals, one of two lineages from the first cleavage was dominant across tissues, with 90\% frequency in blood. We propose that the efficiency of DNA repair contributes to lineage imbalance. Allocation of lineages in postmortem brain correlated with anterior-posterior axis, associating lineage history with cell fate choices in embryos.

We provide experimental demonstrations of such nontrivial winding by implementing non-Hermitian lattice Hamiltonians along a frequency synthetic dimension formed in a ring resonator undergoing simultaneous phase and amplitude modulations, and by directly characterizing the complex band structures. Moreover, we show that the topological winding can be controlled by changing the modulation waveform. Our results allow for the synthesis and characterization of topologically nontrivial phases in nonconservative systems.},

  abstract     = {Defluorinative functionalization of readily accessible trifluoromethyl groups constitutes an economical route to partially fluorinated molecules. However, the controllable replacement of one or two fluorine atoms while maintaining high chemoselectivity remains a formidable challenge. Here we describe a general strategy for sequential carbon-fluorine (C–F) bond functionalizations of trifluoroacetamides and trifluoroacetates. The reaction begins with the activation of a carbonyl oxygen atom by a 4-dimethylaminopyridine-boryl radical, followed by a spin-center shift to trigger the C–F bond scission. A chemoselectivity-controllable two-stage process enables sequential generation of difluoro- and monofluoroalkyl radicals, which are selectively functionalized with different radical traps to afford diverse fluorinated products. The reaction mechanism and the origin of chemoselectivity were established by experimental and computational approaches.},

However, how such replicases evolved and subsequently enabled gene expression remains largely unexplored. We engineered and selected a holopolymerase ribozyme that uses a sigma factor–like specificity primer to first recognize an RNA promoter sequence and then, in a second step, rearrange to a processive elongation form. Using its own sequence, the polymerase can also program itself to polymerize from certain RNA promoters and not others. This selective promoter–based polymerization could allow an RNA replicase ribozyme to define “self” from “nonself,” an important development for the avoidance of replicative parasites. Moreover, the clamp-like mechanism of this polymerase could eventually enable strand invasion, a critical requirement for replication in the early evolution of life.},

Densely instrumented seismic, geodetic, and tsunami observation networks precisely recorded the event, including seafloor observations. A large coseismic fault slip that unexpectedly extended to a shallow part of megathrust fault was documented. Strong lateral variations of the coseismic slip near the trench were recorded from marine geophysical studies, along with a possible cause of these variations. The seismic activities in east Japan are still higher than those before the earthquake, and crustal deformation is still occurring. Although the recurrence probability of a great earthquake (magnitude = ~9) in the Japan Trench in the near future is very low, a large normal fault earthquake seaward of the Japan Trench is a concerning possibility.},

  abstract     = {Infections with many Gram-negative pathogens, including Escherichia coli , Salmonella , Shigella , and Yersinia , rely on type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors. We hypothesized that while hijacking processes within mammalian cells, the effectors operate as a robust network that can tolerate substantial contractions. This was tested in vivo using the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium (encoding 31 effectors). Sequential gene deletions showed that effector essentiality for infection was context dependent and that the network could tolerate 60\% contraction while maintaining pathogenicity. Despite inducing very different colonic cytokine profiles (e.g., interleukin-22, interleukin-17, interferon-γ, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), different networks induced protective immunity. Using data from &gt;100 distinct mutant combinations, we built and trained a machine learning model able to predict colonization outcomes, which were confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, reproducing the human-restricted enteropathogenic E. coli effector repertoire in C. rodentium was not sufficient for efficient colonization, which implicates effector networks in host adaptation. These results unveil the extreme robustness of both T3SS effector networks and host responses.},

  abstract     = {The lung alveolus is the functional unit of the respiratory system required for gas exchange. During the transition to air breathing at birth, biophysical forces are thought to shape the emerging tissue niche. However, the intercellular signaling that drives these processes remains poorly understood. Applying a multimodal approach, we identified alveolar type 1 (AT1) epithelial cells as a distinct signaling hub. Lineage tracing demonstrates that AT1 progenitors align with receptive, force-exerting myofibroblasts in a spatial and temporal manner. Through single-cell chromatin accessibility and pathway expression (SCAPE) analysis, we demonstrate that AT1-restricted ligands are required for myofibroblasts and alveolar formation. These studies show that the alignment of cell fates, mediated by biophysical and AT1-derived paracrine signals, drives the extensive tissue remodeling required for postnatal respiration.},

Here, we identify endosomal lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) presented by the CD1d-like endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) as a pathogenic cell surface antigen recognized by aPLs for induction of thrombosis and endosomal inflammatory signaling. The engagement of aPLs with EPCR-LBPA expressed on innate immune cells sustains interferon- and toll-like receptor 7–dependent B1a cell expansion and autoantibody production. Specific pharmacological interruption of EPCR-LBPA signaling attenuates major aPL-elicited pathologies and the development of autoimmunity in a mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, aPLs recognize a single cell surface lipid–protein receptor complex to perpetuate a self-amplifying autoimmune signaling loop dependent on the cooperation with the innate immune complement and coagulation pathways.},

  abstract     = {Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are common drug targets and canonically couple to specific G α protein subtypes and β-arrestin adaptor proteins. G protein–mediated signaling and β-arrestin–mediated signaling have been considered separable. We show here that GPCRs promote a direct interaction between G αi protein subtype family members and β-arrestins regardless of their canonical G α protein subtype coupling. G αi :β-arrestin complexes bound extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), and their disruption impaired both ERK activation and cell migration, which is consistent with β-arrestins requiring a functional interaction with G αi for certain signaling events. These results introduce a GPCR signaling mechanism distinct from canonical G protein activation in which GPCRs cause the formation of G αi :β-arrestin signaling complexes.},

Inspired by natural ultrasensitive response circuits, we engineered a two-step positive-feedback circuit that allows human cytotoxic T cells to discriminate targets on the basis of a sigmoidal antigen-density threshold. In this circuit, a low-affinity synthetic Notch receptor for HER2 controls the expression of a high-affinity CAR for HER2. Increasing HER2 density thus has cooperative effects on T cells—it increases both CAR expression and activation—leading to a sigmoidal response. T cells with this circuit show sharp discrimination between target cells expressing normal amounts of HER2 and cancer cells expressing 100 times as much HER2, both in vitro and in vivo.},

Nonclassical rotational effects have also been considered in the context of the elusive supersolid phase of matter, in which superfluidity coexists with a lattice structure. Here, we show that the recently discovered supersolid phase in dipolar quantum gases features a reduced moment of inertia. Using a dipolar gas of dysprosium atoms, we studied a peculiar rotational oscillation mode in a harmonic potential, the scissors mode, previously investigated in ordinary superfluids. From the measured moment of inertia, we deduced a superfluid fraction that is different from zero and of order of unity, providing direct evidence of the superfluid nature of the dipolar supersolid.},

We identify spatially complex trend patterns, where some regions are drying and others are wetting consistently across low, mean, and high flows. Trends computed from state-of-the-art model simulations are consistent with the observations only if radiative forcing that accounts for anthropogenic climate change is considered. Simulated effects of water and land management do not suffice to reproduce the observed trend pattern.

D. hansenii cultures from injured mice and inflamed CD tissues impaired colonic healing when introduced into injured conventionally raised or gnotobiotic mice. We reisolated D. hansenii from injured areas of these mice, fulfilling Koch’s postulates.

This variant has an unusually large number of mutations, with 10 amino acid changes in the spike (S) protein, raising concerns that its recognition by neutralizing antibodies may be affected. In this study, we tested SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses bearing either the Wuhan reference strain or the B.1.1.7 lineage spike protein with sera of 40 participants who were vaccinated in a previously reported trial with the messenger RNA–based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2. The immune sera had slightly reduced but overall largely preserved neutralizing titers against the B.1.1.7 lineage pseudovirus.

We found that the efficiency of the biological carbon pump increased with ocean cooling as the result of a temperature-dependent reduction in the rate of remineralization (degradation) of sinking organic matter. Increased food delivery at depth prompted the development of new deep-water niches, triggering deep plankton evolution and the expansion of the mesopelagic “twilight zone” ecosystem.},

Although borophene heterostructures have been realized, ordered chemical modification of borophene has not yet been reported. Here, we synthesize “borophane” polymorphs by hydrogenating borophene with atomic hydrogen in ultrahigh vacuum. Through atomic-scale imaging, spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations, the most prevalent borophane polymorph is shown to possess a combination of two-center–two-electron boron-hydrogen and three-center–two-electron boron-hydrogen-boron bonds. Borophane polymorphs are metallic with modified local work functions and can be reversibly returned to pristine borophene through thermal desorption of hydrogen. Hydrogenation also provides chemical passivation because borophane reduces oxidation rates by more than two orders of magnitude after ambient exposure.},

In the spike glycoprotein, we found that recurrent deletions overcome this slow substitution rate. Deletion variants arise in diverse genetic and geographic backgrounds, transmit efficiently, and are present in novel lineages, including those of current global concern. They frequently occupy recurrent deletion regions (RDRs), which map to defined antibody epitopes. Deletions in RDRs confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies. By altering stretches of amino acids, deletions appear to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 antigenic evolution and may, more generally, drive adaptive evolution.},

At the average twist angle θ ~ 1.56°, a theoretically predicted “magic angle” for the formation of flat electron bands, we observed displacement field–tunable superconductivity with a maximum critical temperature of 2.1 kelvin. By tuning the doping level and displacement field, we found that superconducting regimes occur in conjunction with flavor polarization of moiré bands and are bounded by a van Hove singularity (vHS) at high displacement fields. Our findings display inconsistencies with a weak coupling description, suggesting that the observed moiré superconductivity has an unconventional nature.},

  abstract     = {The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization of three vaccines, all of which have shown greater than 85\% effectiveness against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1–3), has provided the public with the hope of ending the global COVID-19 pandemic. However, recent outbreaks of more transmissible variant SARS-CoV-2 strains that harbor mutations in the spike protein—the critical viral target of immune responses produced by the vaccines (1–3)—has invited a dour outlook on the vaccines&#39; continued efficacy (4). The trepidation is based on the prompt compilation of in vitro data that demonstrate as much as 10-fold reduction in neutralization antibody (NAb) activity in vaccinated samples against mutant spike protein pseudovirus (5, 6), which is thought to be an important metric of acquired immunity (7). Although reports of NAb reduction are alarming in magnitude, the proof of vaccine effectiveness can only be measured definitively by challenging vaccinated subjects with infection.},

However, before increasing the number of postdocs in China, the country should formulate more effective policies to protect the interests of postdoctoral fellows.},

In mammals, the peritoneal cavity contains large numbers of resident GATA6 + macrophages, which may function similarly. However, it is unclear how cavity macrophages suspended in the fluid phase (peritoneal fluid) identify and migrate toward injuries. In this study, we used intravital microscopy to show that cavity macrophages in fluid rapidly form thrombus-like structures in response to injury by means of primordial scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains. Aggregates of cavity macrophages physically sealed injuries and promoted rapid repair of focal lesions. In iatrogenic surgical situations, these cavity macrophages formed extensive aggregates that promoted the growth of intra-abdominal scar tissue known as peritoneal adhesions.},

We describe the structural basis of this specificity and its conversion into an immunotherapeutic agent: a bispecific single-chain diabody. Despite the extremely low p53 peptide-HLA complex density on the cancer cell surface, the bispecific antibody effectively activated T cells to lyse cancer cells that presented the neoantigen in vitro and in mice.

Besides contributing to cardiomyocytes, these cells also represent the earliest progenitor of the epicardium, a source of trophic factors and cells during cardiac development and injury.

Here, we present cryo–electron microscopy analysis of the human Scap and Insig-2 complex in the presence of 25HC, with the transmembrane (TM) domains determined at an average resolution of 3.7 angstrom. The sterol-sensing domain in Scap and all six TMs in Insig-2 were resolved. A 25HC molecule is sandwiched between the S4 to S6 segments in Scap and TMs 3 and 4 in Insig-2 in the luminal leaflet of the membrane. Unwinding of the middle of the Scap-S4 segment is crucial for 25HC binding and Insig association.},

Accordingly, gene products are shared through spermatid cytoplasmic bridges that erase phenotypic differences between individual haploid sperm. Here, we show that a large class of mammalian genes are not completely shared across these bridges. We call these genes “genoinformative markers” (GIMs) and show that a subset can act as selfish genetic elements that spread alleles unevenly through murine, bovine, and human populations. We identify evolutionary pressure to avoid conflict between sperm and somatic function as GIMs are enriched for testis-specific gene expression, paralogs, and isoforms. Therefore, GIMs and sperm-level natural selection may help to explain why testis gene expression patterns are an outlier relative to all other tissues.},

This residue change occurs in diverse KSI backgrounds, suggesting parallel adaptation to temperature. We identify residues associated with organismal growth temperature across 1005 diverse bacterial enzyme families, suggesting widespread parallel adaptation to temperature.

We report that Caenorhabditis elegans roundworms can discriminate between colors despite the fact that they lack eyes and opsins. Specifically, we found that white light guides C. elegans foraging decisions away from a blue-pigment toxin secreted by harmful bacteria. These foraging decisions are guided by specific blue-to-amber ratios of light. The color specificity of color-dependent foraging varies notably among wild C. elegans strains, which indicates that color discrimination is ecologically important. We identified two evolutionarily conserved cellular stress response genes required for opsin-independent, color-dependent foraging by C. elegans , and we speculate that cellular stress response pathways can mediate spectral discrimination by photosensitive cells and organisms—even by those lacking opsins.},

We measured the full momentum-space distribution of transiently excited electrons, connecting their excited-state dynamics to real-space excitation pathways.

The interplay among the elastic, electric, and gradient energies results in continuous rotation and toroidal assembly of the polarization perpendicular to polymer chains, whereas relaxor behavior is induced along polymer chains. Such toroidal polar topology gives rise to periodic absorption of polarized far-infrared (FIR) waves, enabling the manipulation of the terahertz wave on a mesoscopic scale.

  abstract     = {Uncertainty remains regarding the role of anthropogenic climate change in declining insect populations, partly because our understanding of biotic response to climate is often complicated by habitat loss and degradation among other compounding stressors. We addressed this challenge by integrating expert and community scientist datasets that include decades of monitoring across more than 70 locations spanning the western United States. We found a 1.6\% annual reduction in the number of individual butterflies observed over the past four decades, associated in particular with warming during fall months. The pervasive declines that we report advance our understanding of climate change impacts and suggest that a new approach is needed for butterfly conservation in the region, focused on suites of species with shared habitat or host associations.},

Combining radial velocity (RV) and transit data provides additional information on exoplanet physical properties. We detect a transiting rocky planet with an orbital period of 1.467 days around the nearby red dwarf star Gliese 486. The planet Gliese 486 b is 2.81 Earth masses and 1.31 Earth radii, with uncertainties of 5\%, as determined from RV data and photometric light curves. The host star is at a distance of ~8.1 parsecs, has a J -band magnitude of ~7.2, and is observable from both hemispheres of Earth. On the basis of these properties and the planet’s short orbital period and high equilibrium temperature, we show that this terrestrial planet is suitable for emission and transit spectroscopy.},

  abstract     = {Microbial production of antibiotics is common, but our understanding of their roles in the environment is limited. In this study, we explore long-standing observations that microbes increase the production of redox-active antibiotics under phosphorus limitation. The availability of phosphorus, a nutrient required by all life on Earth and essential for agriculture, can be controlled by adsorption to and release from iron minerals by means of redox cycling. Using phenazine antibiotic production by pseudomonads as a case study, we show that phenazines are regulated by phosphorus, solubilize phosphorus through reductive dissolution of iron oxides in the lab and field, and increase phosphorus-limited microbial growth. Phenazines are just one of many examples of phosphorus-regulated antibiotics. Our work suggests a widespread but previously unappreciated role for redox-active antibiotics in phosphorus acquisition and cycling.},

This is exemplified by the fracture toughness of nacre or enamel in nature and by human-made architected microscale network structures. Nanoscale structuring promises further strengthening, yet macroscopic bodies built this way contain an immense number of struts, calling for scalable preparation schemes. In this work, we demonstrated macroscopic hierarchical network nanomaterials made by the self-organization processes of dealloying. Their hierarchical architecture affords enhanced strength and stiffness at a given solid fraction, and it enables reduced solid fractions by dealloying. Scaling laws for the mechanics and atomistic simulation support the observations. Because they expose the systematic benefits of hierarchical structuring in nanoscale network structures, our materials may serve as prototypes for future lightweight structural materials.},

We deleted the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase ( Fah ) gene in MISTRG mice expressing several human cytokines in place of their murine counterparts. Liver humanization by intrasplenic injection of human hepatocytes (huHep) eliminated murine complement C3 and reduced murine Kupffer cell density. Engraftment of human sickle cell disease (SCD)–derived hematopoietic stem cells in huHepMISTRG Fah −/− mice resulted in vaso-occlusion that replicated acute SCD pathology. Combined liver–cytokine–humanized mice will facilitate the study of diseases afflicting RBCs, including bone marrow failure, hemoglobinopathies, and malaria, and also preclinical testing of therapies.},

  abstract     = {Past research argues for an internal multidecadal (40- to 60-year) oscillation distinct from climate noise. Recent studies have claimed that this so-termed Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is instead a manifestation of competing time-varying effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. That conclusion is bolstered by the absence of robust multidecadal climate oscillations in control simulations of current-generation models. Paleoclimate data, however, do demonstrate multidecadal oscillatory behavior during the preindustrial era. By comparing control and forced “Last Millennium” simulations, we show that these apparent multidecadal oscillations are an artifact of pulses of volcanic activity during the preindustrial era that project markedly onto the multidecadal (50- to 70-year) frequency band. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence for internal multidecadal oscillations in the climate system.},

Studies identifying cells with superior proliferative capacities often rely on the lineage tracing of a subset of cell populations, which introduces a potential selective bias. In this work, we developed a genetic system [proliferation tracer (ProTracer)] by incorporating dual recombinases to seamlessly record the proliferation events of entire cell populations over time in multiple organs. In the mouse liver, ProTracer revealed more hepatocyte proliferation in distinct zones during liver homeostasis, injury repair, and regrowth. Clonal analysis showed that most of the hepatocytes labeled by ProTracer had undergone cell division. By genetically recording proliferation events of entire cell populations, ProTracer enables the unbiased detection of specific cellular compartments with enhanced regenerative capacities.},

We applied a Cas9-based, single-cell lineage tracer to study the rates, routes, and drivers of metastasis in a lung cancer xenograft mouse model. We report deeply resolved phylogenies for tens of thousands of cancer cells traced over months of growth and dissemination. This revealed stark heterogeneity in metastatic capacity, arising from preexisting and heritable differences in gene expression. We demonstrate that these identified genes can drive invasiveness and uncovered an unanticipated suppressive role for KRT17 . We also show that metastases disseminated via multidirectional tissue routes and complex seeding topologies. Overall, we demonstrate the power of tracing cancer progression at subclonal resolution and vast scale.},

Tau is abundant in neurons and interacts with microtubules, but its main functions in the brain remain to be defined. These functions may involve the regulation of signaling pathways relevant to diverse biological processes. Informative disease models have revealed a plethora of abnormal tau species and mechanisms that might contribute to neuronal dysfunction and loss, but the relative importance of their respective contributions is uncertain. This knowledge gap poses major obstacles to the development of truly impactful therapeutic strategies. The current expansion and intensification of efforts to translate mechanistic insights into tau-related therapeutics should address this issue and could deliver better treatments for a host of devastating conditions.},

The cells most responsible for liver repopulation and regeneration remain undefined, because fate mapping has only been performed on a few hepatocyte subsets. Here, 14 murine fate-mapping strains were used to systematically compare distinct subsets of hepatocytes. During homeostasis, cells from both periportal zone 1 and pericentral zone 3 contracted in number, whereas cells from midlobular zone 2 expanded in number. Cells within zone 2, which are sheltered from common injuries, also contributed to regeneration after pericentral and periportal injuries. Repopulation from zone 2 was driven by the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2–mechanistic target of rapamycin–cyclin D1 (IGFBP2-mTOR-CCND1) axis. Therefore, different regions of the lobule exhibit differences in their contribution to hepatocyte turnover, and zone 2 is an important source of new hepatocytes during homeostasis and regeneration.},

Key technical challenges for physical random number generation are speed and scalability. We demonstrate a method for ultrafast generation of hundreds of random bit streams in parallel with a single laser diode. Spatiotemporal interference of many lasing modes in a specially designed cavity is introduced as a scheme for greatly accelerated random bit generation. Spontaneous emission, caused by quantum fluctuations, produces stochastic noise that makes the bit streams unpredictable. We achieve a total bit rate of 250 terabits per second with off-line postprocessing, which is more than two orders of magnitude higher than the current postprocessing record. Our approach is robust, compact, and energy-efficient, with potential applications in secure communication and high-performance computation.},

  abstract     = {The composition of the early Solar System can be inferred from meteorites. Many elements heavier than iron were formed by the rapid neutron capture process (r-process), but the astrophysical sources where this occurred remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that the near-identical half-lives ( ≃ 15.6 million years ) of the radioactive r-process nuclei iodine-129 and curium-247 preserve their ratio, irrespective of the time between production and incorporation into the Solar System. We constrain the last r-process source by comparing the measured meteoritic ratio 129 I/ 247 Cm = 438 ± 184 with nucleosynthesis calculations based on neutron star merger and magneto-rotational supernova simulations. Moderately neutron-rich conditions, often found in merger disk ejecta simulations, are most consistent with the meteoritic value. Uncertain nuclear physics data limit our confidence in this conclusion.},

  abstract     = {Despite dominating biodiversity in the Mesozoic, dinosaurs were not speciose. Oviparity constrained even gigantic dinosaurs to less than 15 kg at birth; growth through multiple morphologies led to the consumption of different resources at each stage. Such disparity between neonates and adults could have influenced the structure and diversity of dinosaur communities. Here, we quantified this effect for 43 communities across 136 million years and seven continents. We found that megatheropods (more than 1000 kg) such as tyrannosaurs had specific effects on dinosaur community structure. Although herbivores spanned the body size range, communities with megatheropods lacked carnivores weighing 100 to 1000 kg. We demonstrate that juvenile megatheropods likely filled the mesocarnivore niche, resulting in reduced overall taxonomic diversity. The consistency of this pattern suggests that ontogenetic niche shift was an important factor in generating dinosaur community structure and diversity.},

Here we report a combined experimental and theoretical study on the effect of electron spin and orbital angular momentum in the F + HD → HF + D reaction. Using a high-resolution imaging technique, we observed a peculiar horseshoe-shaped pattern in the product rotational-state–resolved differential cross sections around the forward-scattering direction. The unusual dynamics pattern could only be explained properly by highly accurate quantum dynamics theory when full spin-orbit characteristics were considered. Theoretical analysis revealed that the horseshoe pattern was largely the result of quantum interference between spin-orbit split–partial-wave resonances with positive and negative parities, providing a distinctive example of how spin-orbit interaction can effectively influence reaction dynamics.},

Emerging fiber-optic sensing technologies that can leverage submarine telecommunication cables present an opportunity to fill the data gap. We successfully sensed seismic and water waves over a 10,000-kilometer-long submarine cable connecting Los Angeles, California, and Valparaiso, Chile, by monitoring the polarization of regular optical telecommunication channels. We detected multiple moderate-to-large earthquakes along the cable in the 10-millihertz to 5-hertz band. We also recorded pressure signals from ocean swells in the primary microseism band, implying the potential for tsunami sensing. Our method, because it does not require specialized equipment, laser sources, or dedicated fibers, is highly scalable for converting global submarine cables into continuous real-time earthquake and tsunami observatories.},

We found that the drug plitidepsin (aplidin), which has limited clinical approval, possesses antiviral activity (90\% inhibitory concentration = 0.88 nM) that is more potent than remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by a factor of 27.5, with limited toxicity in cell culture. Through the use of a drug-resistant mutant, we show that the antiviral activity of plitidepsin against SARS-CoV-2 is mediated through inhibition of the known target eEF1A (eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A). We demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of plitidepsin treatment in two mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a reduction of viral replication in the lungs by two orders of magnitude using prophylactic treatment. Our results indicate that plitidepsin is a promising therapeutic candidate for COVID-19.},

This process is thought to occur within the bulk of an aerosol, through solvation and subsequent hydrolysis. However, this perspective is difficult to reconcile with field measurements and cannot be verified directly because of the fast reaction kinetics of N 2 O 5 . Here, we use molecular simulations, including reactive potentials and importance sampling, to study the uptake of N 2 O 5 into an aqueous aerosol. Rather than being mediated by the bulk, uptake is dominated by interfacial processes due to facile hydrolysis at the liquid-vapor interface and competitive reevaporation. With this molecular information, we propose an alternative interfacial reactive uptake model consistent with existing experimental observations.},

We used a mathematical model to compare five age-stratified prioritization strategies. A highly effective transmission-blocking vaccine prioritized to adults ages 20 to 49 years minimized cumulative incidence, but mortality and years of life lost were minimized in most scenarios when the vaccine was prioritized to adults greater than 60 years old. Use of individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to seronegative individuals improved the marginal impact of each dose while potentially reducing existing inequities in COVID-19 impact. Although maximum impact prioritization strategies were broadly consistent across countries, transmission rates, vaccination rollout speeds, and estimates of naturally acquired immunity, this framework can be used to compare impacts of prioritization strategies across contexts.},

During ciliogenesis, these ~1.8-megadalton complexes are assembled in the cytoplasm and targeted to cilia by an unknown mechanism. Here, we used the ciliate Tetrahymena to identify two factors (Q22YU3 and Q22MS1) that bind ODAs in the cytoplasm and are required for ODA delivery to cilia. Q22YU3, which we named Shulin, locked the ODA motor domains into a closed conformation and inhibited motor activity. Cryo–electron microscopy revealed how Shulin stabilized this compact form of ODAs by binding to the dynein tails. Our findings provide a molecular explanation for how newly assembled dyneins are packaged for delivery to the cilia.},

Integration of such nanoscale devices with microfabricated connectors and circuits is challenging: Large numbers of freely diffusing devices must be fixed at desired locations with desired alignment. We present a DNA origami molecule whose energy landscape on lithographic binding sites has a unique maximum. This property enabled device alignment within 3.2° on silica surfaces. Orientation was absolute (all degrees of freedom were specified) and arbitrary (the orientation of every molecule was independently specified). The use of orientation to optimize device performance was shown by aligning fluorescent emission dipoles within microfabricated optical cavities. Large-scale integration was demonstrated with an array of 3456 DNA origami with 12 distinct orientations that indicated the polarization of excitation light.},

We leverage the power of de novo computational design coupled with a “hypothesis, design, and test” approach to determine TMB design principles, notably, the importance of negative design to slow β-sheet assembly. We design new eight-stranded TMBs, with no homology to known TMBs, that insert and fold reversibly into synthetic lipid membranes and have nuclear magnetic resonance and x-ray crystal structures very similar to the computational models. These advances should enable the custom design of pores for a wide range of applications.},

  abstract     = {Genes with novel cellular functions may evolve through exon shuffling, which can assemble novel protein architectures. Here, we show that DNA transposons provide a recurrent supply of materials to assemble protein-coding genes through exon shuffling. We find that transposase domains have been captured—primarily via alternative splicing—to form fusion proteins at least 94 times independently over the course of ~350 million years of tetrapod evolution. We find an excess of transposase DNA binding domains fused to host regulatory domains, especially the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, and identify four independently evolved KRAB-transposase fusion proteins repressing gene expression in a sequence-specific fashion. The bat-specific KRABINER fusion protein binds its cognate transposons genome-wide and controls a network of genes and cis-regulatory elements. These results illustrate how a transcription factor and its binding sites can emerge.},

Protection against pathogens and support of beneficial, symbiotic, microorganisms are sustained by a blend of conserved and clade-specific plant mechanisms evolving at different speeds. We propose that symbiosis consistently emerges from the co-option of protection mechanisms and general cell biology principles. Exploring and harnessing the diversity of molecular mechanisms used in nonflowering plant-microbe interactions may extend the possibilities for engineering symbiosis-competent and pathogen-resilient crops.},

  abstract     = {Although metabolism plays an active role in antibiotic lethality, antibiotic resistance is generally associated with drug target modification, enzymatic inactivation, and/or transport rather than metabolic processes. Evolution experiments of Escherichia coli rely on growth-dependent selection, which may provide a limited view of the antibiotic resistance landscape. We sequenced and analyzed E. coli adapted to representative antibiotics at increasingly heightened metabolic states. This revealed various underappreciated noncanonical genes, such as those related to central carbon and energy metabolism, which are implicated in antibiotic resistance. These metabolic alterations lead to lower basal respiration, which prevents antibiotic-mediated induction of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, thus avoiding metabolic toxicity and minimizing drug lethality. Several of the identified metabolism-specific mutations are overrepresented in the genomes of &gt;3500 clinical E. coli pathogens, indicating clinical relevance.},

Here we map how all mutations to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 affect binding by the antibodies in the REGN-COV2 cocktail and the antibody LY-CoV016. These complete maps uncover a single amino acid mutation that fully escapes the REGN-COV2 cocktail, which consists of two antibodies, REGN10933 and REGN10987, targeting distinct structural epitopes. The maps also identify viral mutations that are selected in a persistently infected patient treated with REGN-COV2 and during in vitro viral escape selections. Finally, the maps reveal that mutations escaping the individual antibodies are already present in circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. These complete escape maps enable interpretation of the consequences of mutations observed during viral surveillance.},

We report cryo–electron microscopy structures of human mitoribosomes with nascent polypeptide, bound to the insertase oxidase assembly 1–like (OXA1L) through three distinct contact sites. OXA1L binding is correlated with a series of conformational changes in the mitoribosomal large subunit that catalyze the delivery of newly synthesized polypeptides. The mechanism relies on the folding of mL45 inside the exit tunnel, forming two specific constriction sites that would limit helix formation of the nascent chain. A gap is formed between the exit and the membrane, making the newly synthesized proteins accessible. Our data elucidate the basis by which mitoribosomes interact with the OXA1L insertase to couple protein synthesis and membrane delivery.},

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that primary human cholangiocytes display transcriptional diversity that is lost in organoid culture. However, cholangiocyte organoids remain plastic and resume their in vivo signatures when transplanted back in the biliary tree. We then utilize a model of cell engraftment in human livers undergoing ex vivo normothermic perfusion to demonstrate that this property allows extrahepatic organoids to repair human intrahepatic ducts after transplantation. Our results provide proof of principle that cholangiocyte organoids can be used to repair human biliary epithelium.},

We enhanced the figure of merit ( zT ) value to 1.8 at 900 kelvin in an n-type PbSe-based high-entropy material formed by entropy-driven structural stabilization. The largely distorted lattices in this high-entropy system caused unusual shear strains, which provided strong phonon scattering to largely lower lattice thermal conductivity. The thermoelectric conversion efficiency was 12.3\% at temperature difference Δ T = 507 kelvin, for the fabricated segmented module based on this n-type high-entropy material. Our demonstration provides a paradigm to improve thermoelectric performance for high-entropy thermoelectric materials through entropy engineering.},

We precisely characterize the geomagnetic reversal and perform global chemistry-climate modeling and detailed radiocarbon dating of paleoenvironmental records to investigate impacts.

  abstract     = {In their Letter “Stay true to integrated pest management” (8 January 2021, p. 133 ), K. Wyckhuys et al. point to the essential role of checks and balances in the context of CropLife International&#39;s recently agreed partnership with the UN&#39;s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). However, we disagree with their assertion that the FAO and CropLife International have contrasting visions of integrated pest management (IPM). CropLife International fully supports the FAO definition of IPM, which is a fundamental element of the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management (1). The IPM objective is “careful consideration of all available pest control techniques and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that discourage the development of pest populations and keep pesticides and other interventions to levels that are economically justified and reduce or minimize risks to human and animal health and/or the environment.” [(1), p. 4] Supporting FAO&#39;s Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management is a condition of membership for CropLife International, and IPM is a core stewardship activity promoted by CropLife International to farmers globally.},

  abstract     = {The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread, with devastating consequences. For passive immunization efforts, nanobodies have size and cost advantages over conventional antibodies. In this study, we generated four neutralizing nanobodies that target the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We used x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy to define two distinct binding epitopes. On the basis of these structures, we engineered multivalent nanobodies with more than 100 times the neutralizing activity of monovalent nanobodies. Biparatopic nanobody fusions suppressed the emergence of escape mutants. Several nanobody constructs neutralized through receptor binding competition, whereas other monovalent and biparatopic nanobodies triggered aberrant activation of the spike fusion machinery. These premature conformational changes in the spike protein forestalled productive fusion and rendered the virions noninfectious.},

To dissect the molecular motion of kinesin-1, we developed germanium nanospheres as ultraresolution optical trapping probes. We found that single motors took 4-nanometer center-of-mass steps. Furthermore, kinesin-1 never detached from microtubules under hindering load conditions. Instead, it slipped on microtubules in microsecond-long, 8-nanometer steps and remained in this slip state before detaching or reengaging in directed motion. Unexpectedly, reengagement and thus rescue of directed motion was more frequent. Our observations broaden our knowledge on the mechanochemical cycle and slip state of kinesin. This state and rescue need to be accounted for to understand long-range transport by teams of motors.},

To determine whether these behavioral similarities result from shared or distinct neural circuits, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the neuronal repertoire of the songbird song motor pathway. Glutamatergic vocal neurons had considerable transcriptional similarity to neocortical projection neurons; however, they displayed regulatory gene expression patterns more closely related to neurons in the ventral pallium. Moreover, while γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing neurons in this pathway appeared homologous to those in mammals and other amniotes, the most abundant avian class is largely absent in the neocortex. These data suggest that songbird vocal circuits and the mammalian neocortex have distinct developmental origins yet contain transcriptionally similar neurons.},

NOVA1 also includes a protein-coding difference between the modern human genome and Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes. To investigate the functional importance of an amino acid change in humans, we reintroduced the archaic allele into human induced pluripotent cells using genome editing and then followed their neural development through cortical organoids. This modification promoted slower development and higher surface complexity in cortical organoids with the archaic version of NOVA1 . Moreover, levels of synaptic markers and synaptic protein coassociations correlated with altered electrophysiological properties in organoids expressing the archaic variant. Our results suggest that the human-specific substitution in NOVA1 , which is exclusive to modern humans since divergence from Neanderthals, may have had functional consequences for our species’ evolution.},

Our analysis of immunological and epidemiological data on endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) shows that infection-blocking immunity wanes rapidly but that disease-reducing immunity is long-lived. Our model, incorporating these components of immunity, recapitulates both the current severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the benign nature of HCoVs, suggesting that once the endemic phase is reached and primary exposure is in childhood, SARS-CoV-2 may be no more virulent than the common cold. We predict a different outcome for an emergent coronavirus that causes severe disease in children. These results reinforce the importance of behavioral containment during pandemic vaccine rollout, while prompting us to evaluate scenarios for continuing vaccination in the endemic phase.},

Mice immunized with RBD nanoparticles, but not soluble antigen, elicited cross-reactive binding and neutralization responses. Mosaic RBD nanoparticles elicited antibodies with superior cross-reactive recognition of heterologous RBDs relative to sera from immunizations with homotypic SARS-CoV-2–RBD nanoparticles or COVID-19 convalescent human plasmas. Moreover, after priming, sera from mosaic RBD–immunized mice neutralized heterologous pseudotyped coronaviruses as well as or better than sera from homotypic SARS-CoV-2–RBD nanoparticle immunizations, demonstrating no loss of immunogenicity against particular RBDs resulting from co-display.

By contrast, the Proterozoic witnessed continuously decreasing crustal thickness, leaving the continents devoid of high mountains until the end of the eon. We link this gradually diminished orogenesis to the long-lived Nuna-Rodinia supercontinent, which altered the mantle thermal structure and weakened the continental lithosphere.

Cadmium doping in AgSbTe 2 enhances cationic ordering, which simultaneously improves electronic properties by tuning disorder-induced localization of electronic states and reduces lattice thermal conductivity through spontaneous formation of nanoscale (~2 to 4 nanometers) superstructures and coupling of soft vibrations localized within ~1 nanometer around cadmium sites with local strain modulation. The strategy is applicable to most other thermoelectric materials that exhibit inherent atomic disorder.},

  abstract     = {The United Kingdom’s COVID-19 epidemic during early 2020 was one of world’s largest and was unusually well represented by virus genomic sampling. We determined the fine-scale genetic lineage structure of this epidemic through analysis of 50,887 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes, including 26,181 from the UK sampled throughout the country’s first wave of infection. Using large-scale phylogenetic analyses combined with epidemiological and travel data, we quantified the size, spatiotemporal origins, and persistence of genetically distinct UK transmission lineages. Rapid fluctuations in virus importation rates resulted in &gt;1000 lineages; those introduced prior to national lockdown tended to be larger and more dispersed. Lineage importation and regional lineage diversity declined after lockdown, whereas lineage elimination was size-dependent. We discuss the implications of our genetic perspective on transmission dynamics for COVID-19 epidemiology and control.},

  abstract     = {We report the catalytic stereocontrolled synthesis of dinucleotides. We have demonstrated, for the first time to our knowledge, that chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysts control the formation of stereogenic phosphorous centers during phosphoramidite transfer. Unprecedented levels of diastereodivergence have also been demonstrated, enabling access to either phosphite diastereomer. Two different CPA scaffolds have proven to be essential for achieving stereodivergence: peptide-embedded phosphothreonine-derived CPAs, which reinforce and amplify the inherent substrate preference, and C2-symmetric BINOL-derived CPAs, which completely overturn this stereochemical preference. The presently reported catalytic method does not require stoichiometric activators or chiral auxiliaries and enables asymmetric catalysis with readily available phosphoramidites. The method was applied to the stereocontrolled synthesis of diastereomeric dinucleotides as well as cyclic dinucleotides, which are of broad interest in immuno-oncology as agonists of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway.},

  abstract     = {Diversification is a widely proposed policing reform, but its impact is difficult to assess. We used records of millions of daily patrol assignments, determined through fixed rules and preassigned rotations that mitigate self-selection, to compare the average behavior of officers of different demographic profiles working in comparable conditions. Relative to white officers, Black and Hispanic officers make far fewer stops and arrests, and they use force less often, especially against Black civilians. These effects are largest in majority-Black areas of Chicago and stem from reduced focus on enforcing low-level offenses, with greatest impact on Black civilians. Female officers also use less force than males, a result that holds within all racial groups. These results suggest that diversity reforms can improve police treatment of minority communities.},

  abstract     = {Although China has taken important steps to protect biodiversity, including a 10-year fishing ban in inland waters (1) and a summer fishing moratorium in oceans (2), the country&#39;s marine biodiversity protection needs a plan to better ameliorate the threats to marine life, including the deterioration of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity (3). By 2019, China had established 271 protected areas that include oceans (4, 5). They cover 12.4 million hectares of ocean but represent only 4.1\% of China&#39;s maritime area (4, 5), far below the 10\% goal set by Aichi Target 11 (6). In contrast, China has established protected areas covering 18\% of its total terrestrial habitats and inland waters, more than the 17\% goal of Aichi Target 11 (6, 7). Nearly all of China&#39;s marine protected areas (MPAs) are in coastal and continental-shelf regions (5), and their ability to protect migratory fishes and mammals is likely hindered by their fragmentation (4). The current MPA system cannot keep up with the demand for effective marine biodiversity protection. China needs to accelerate the optimization and integration of existing MPAs and establish new MPAs that use the national parks model (8) to strengthen the protection of marine biodiversity.},

  abstract     = {In the Research Article “Recent global decline of CO2 fertilization effects on vegetation photosynthesis,” there was a small error in the histogram in Fig. 1B in the main text and in fig. S9B in the supplementary materials caused by a data-processing bug (the x axis started from 0.2, not from zero as labeled), and the calculation of standard deviation (SD) was not fully explained in the figure caption (the caption did not state that the SD was calculated from the data within the range of the y axis). Figure 1B, fig. S9B, and their captions have been corrected accordingly. In the original figure, the authors chose the β range of −10 to 50 because this range is reasonable for CO2 fertilization effect (CFE) based on the meta-analysis results from free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments and on the results from Earth-system models (1). The authors have also prepared another figure in which they have changed the y axis range from [−10, 50] that covers more than 85\% of all pixels to a wider range of −20 to 80 that covers more than 94\% of all pixels (see fig. S1). The change of range only affects the SDs in Fig. 1 but not the global median that was used throughout the paper.},

We analyzed multiple compartments of circulating immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 in 254 samples from 188 COVID-19 cases, including 43 samples at ≥6 months after infection. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the spike protein was relatively stable over 6+ months. Spike-specific memory B cells were more abundant at 6 months than at 1 month after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells declined with a half-life of 3 to 5 months. By studying antibody, memory B cell, CD4 + T cell, and CD8 + T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2 in an integrated manner, we observed that each component of SARS-CoV-2 immune memory exhibited distinct kinetics.},

Elements for nuclear expression (ENEs) are cis-acting RNA elements that stabilize poly(A) tails by sequestering them in RNA triplex structures. A crystal structure of a double ENE from a rice hAT transposon messenger RNA complexed with poly(A) 28 at a resolution of 2.89 angstroms reveals multiple modes of interaction with poly(A), including major-groove triple helices, extended minor-groove interactions with RNA double helices, a quintuple-base motif that transitions poly(A) from minor-groove associations to major-groove triple helices, and a poly(A) 3′-end binding pocket. Our findings both expand the repertoire of motifs involved in long-range RNA interactions and provide insights into how polyadenylation can protect an RNA’s extreme 3′ end.},

  abstract     = {During development, cells progress from a pluripotent state to a more restricted fate within a particular germ layer. However, cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs), a transient cell population that generates most of the craniofacial skeleton, have much broader differentiation potential than their ectodermal lineage of origin. Here, we identify a neuroepithelial precursor population characterized by expression of canonical pluripotency transcription factors that gives rise to CNCCs and is essential for craniofacial development. Pluripotency factor Oct4 is transiently reactivated in CNCCs and is required for the subsequent formation of ectomesenchyme. Furthermore, open chromatin landscapes of Oct4 + CNCC precursors resemble those of epiblast stem cells, with additional features suggestive of priming for mesenchymal programs. We propose that CNCCs expand their developmental potential through a transient reacquisition of molecular signatures of pluripotency.},

Existing evidence shows that anthrophony affects marine animals at multiple levels, including their behavior, physiology, and, in extreme cases, survival. This should prompt management actions to deploy existing solutions to reduce noise levels in the ocean, thereby allowing marine animals to reestablish their use of ocean sound as a central ecological trait in a healthy ocean.},

Hence, the structural and compositional varieties of the inorganic B–X framework are primarily responsible for regulating their electronic properties, whereas A-site cations are thought to only help stabilize the lattice and not to directly contribute to near-edge states. We report a π-conjugation–induced extension of electronic states of A-site cations that affects perovskite frontier orbitals. The π-conjugated pyrene-containing A-site cations electronically contribute to the surface band edges and influence the carrier dynamics, with a properly tailored intercalation distance between layers of the inorganic framework. The ethylammonium pyrene increased hole mobilities, improved power conversion efficiencies relative to that of a reference perovskite, and enhanced device stability.},

Such exposure is often assessed for all taxa at a location from climate projections, yet species have diverse strategies for buffering against temperature extremes. We compared changes in species occupancy and site-level richness of small mammal and bird communities in protected areas of the Mojave Desert using surveys spanning a century. Small mammal communities remained remarkably stable, whereas birds declined markedly in response to warming and drying. Simulations of heat flux identified different exposure to warming for birds and mammals, which we attribute to microhabitat use. Estimates from climate projections are unlikely to accurately reflect species’ exposure without accounting for the effects of microhabitat buffering on heat flux.},

  abstract     = {Solvent molecules influence the reactions of molecular hydrogen and oxygen on palladium nanoparticles. Organic solvents activate to form reactive surface intermediates that mediate oxygen reduction through pathways distinct from reactions in pure water. Kinetic measurements and ab initio quantum chemical calculations indicate that methanol and water cocatalyze oxygen reduction by facilitating proton-electron transfer reactions. Methanol generates hydroxymethyl intermediates on palladium surfaces that efficiently transfer protons and electrons to oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide and formaldehyde. Formaldehyde subsequently oxidizes hydrogen to regenerate hydroxymethyl. Water, on the other hand, heterolytically oxidizes hydrogen to produce hydronium ions and electrons that reduce oxygen. These findings suggest that reactions of solvent molecules at solid-liquid interfaces can generate redox mediators in situ and provide opportunities to substantially increase rates and selectivities for catalytic reactions.},

  abstract     = {The conversion of unactivated carbon-hydrogen (C–H) bonds to carbon–nitrogen (C–N) bonds is a highly valued transformation. Existing strategies typically accomplish such reactions at only a single C–H site because the first derivatization diminishes the reactivity of surrounding C–H bonds. Here, we show that alkylated arenes can undergo vicinal C–H diamination reactions to form 1,2-diamine derivatives through an electrophotocatalytic strategy, using acetonitrile as both solvent and nitrogen source. The reaction is catalyzed by a trisaminocyclopropenium (TAC) ion, which undergoes anodic oxidation to furnish a stable radical dication while the cathodic reaction reduces protons to molecular hydrogen. Irradiation of the TAC radical dication (wavelength of maximum absorption of 450 to 550 nanometers) with a white-light compact fluorescent light generates a strongly oxidizing photoexcited intermediate. Depending on the electrolyte used, either 3,4-dihydroimidazole or 2-oxazoline products are obtained.},

  abstract     = {Collective electronic modes or lattice vibrations usually prohibit propagation of electromagnetic radiation through the bulk of common materials over a frequency range associated with these oscillations. However, this textbook tenet does not necessarily apply to layered crystals. Highly anisotropic materials often display nonintuitive optical properties and can permit propagation of subdiffractional waveguide modes, with hyperbolic dispersion, throughout their bulk. Here, we report on the observation of optically induced electronic hyperbolicity in the layered transition metal dichalcogenide tungsten diselenide (WSe 2 ). We used photoexcitation to inject electron-hole pairs in WSe 2 and then visualized, by transient nanoimaging, the hyperbolic rays that traveled along conical trajectories inside of the crystal. We establish here the signatures of programmable hyperbolic electrodynamics and assess the role of quantum transitions of excitons within the Rydberg series in the observed polaritonic response.},

Quantum networks promise a solution by integrating smaller qubit modules to a larger computing cluster. Such a distributed architecture, however, requires the capability to execute quantum-logic gates between distant qubits. Here we experimentally realize such a gate over a distance of 60 meters. We employ an ancillary photon that we successively reflect from two remote qubit modules, followed by a heralding photon detection, which triggers a final qubit rotation. We use the gate for remote entanglement creation of all four Bell states. Our nonlocal quantum-logic gate could be extended both to multiple qubits and many modules for a tailor-made multi-qubit computing register.},

In this study, a core-shell FeMn@Si catalyst with excellent hydrophobicity was designed to hinder the formation of CO 2 and CH 4 . The hydrophobic shell protected the iron carbide core from oxidation by water generated during FTS and shortened the retention of water on the catalyst surface, restraining the side reactions related to water. Furthermore, the electron transfer from manganese to iron atoms boosted olefin production and inhibited CH 4 formation. The multifunctional catalyst could suppress the total selectivity of CO 2 and CH 4 to less than 22.5\% with an olefin yield of up to 36.6\% at a CO conversion of 56.1\%.},

The composition of the gut microbiota correlates with anti–PD-1 efficacy in preclinical models and cancer patients. To investigate whether resistance to anti–PD-1 can be overcome by changing the gut microbiota, this clinical trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of responder-derived fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) together with anti–PD-1 in patients with PD-1–refractory melanoma. This combination was well tolerated, provided clinical benefit in 6 of 15 patients, and induced rapid and durable microbiota perturbation. Responders exhibited increased abundance of taxa that were previously shown to be associated with response to anti–PD-1, increased CD8 + T cell activation, and decreased frequency of interleukin-8–expressing myeloid cells. Responders had distinct proteomic and metabolomic signatures, and transkingdom network analyses confirmed that the gut microbiome regulated these changes. Collectively, our findings show that FMT and anti–PD-1 changed the gut microbiome and reprogrammed the tumor microenvironment to overcome resistance to anti–PD-1 in a subset of PD-1 advanced melanoma.},

Using the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber, we find that the nucleation rates of HIO 3 particles are rapid, even exceeding sulfuric acid–ammonia rates under similar conditions. We also find that ion-induced nucleation involves IO 3 − and the sequential addition of HIO 3 and that it proceeds at the kinetic limit below +10°C. In contrast, neutral nucleation involves the repeated sequential addition of iodous acid (HIO 2 ) followed by HIO 3 , showing that HIO 2 plays a key stabilizing role. Freshly formed particles are composed almost entirely of HIO 3 , which drives rapid particle growth at the kinetic limit. Our measurements indicate that iodine oxoacid particle formation can compete with sulfuric acid in pristine regions of the atmosphere.},

We summarize the technologies that have emerged toward achieving these aims—including miniaturized dispersive optics, narrowband filter systems, Fourier transform interferometers, and reconstructive microspectrometers—and discuss the challenges associated with improving spectral resolution while device dimensions shrink ever further.},

We applied untargeted expansion sequencing (ExSeq) to the mouse brain, which yielded the readout of thousands of genes, including splice variants. Targeted ExSeq yielded nanoscale-resolution maps of RNAs throughout dendrites and spines in the neurons of the mouse hippocampus, revealing patterns across multiple cell types, layer-specific cell types across the mouse visual cortex, and the organization and position-dependent states of tumor and immune cells in a human metastatic breast cancer biopsy.

We tested the idea that increased primary production and plant organics promoted aggregation of clay into flocs in rivers and facilitated mud deposition on floodplains. In experiments, we observed that clay readily flocculated for organic and clay concentrations common to modern rivers, yielding settling velocities three orders of magnitude larger than those without organics. Using a transport model, we found that flocculation substantially increased mud deposition, resulting in muddier floodplains. Thus, organic-induced flocculation may have been more critical than deep-rooted plants in the proliferation of muddy floodplains.},

  abstract     = {Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are innate sensors of viruses and can augment early immune responses and contribute to protection. We hypothesized that MAIT cells may have inherent adjuvant activity in vaccine platforms that use replication-incompetent adenovirus vectors. In mice and humans, ChAdOx1 (chimpanzee adenovirus Ox1) immunization robustly activated MAIT cells. Activation required plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)–derived interferon (IFN)–α and monocyte-derived interleukin-18. IFN-α–induced, monocyte-derived tumor necrosis factor was also identified as a key secondary signal. All three cytokines were required in vitro and in vivo. Activation of MAIT cells positively correlated with vaccine-induced T cell responses in human volunteers and MAIT cell–deficient mice displayed impaired CD8 + T cell responses to multiple vaccine-encoded antigens. Thus, MAIT cells contribute to the immunogenicity of adenovirus vectors, with implications for vaccine design.},

  abstract     = {The interface between metal catalyst and support plays a critical role in heterogeneous catalysis. An epitaxial interface is generally considered to be rigid, and tuning its intrinsic microstructure with atomic precision during catalytic reactions is challenging. Using aberration-corrected environmental transmission electron microscopy, we studied the interface between gold (Au) and a titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) support. Direct atomic-scale observations showed an unexpected dependence of the atomic structure of the Au-TiO 2 interface with the epitaxial rotation of gold nanoparticles on a TiO 2 surface during carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation. Taking advantage of the reversible and controllable rotation, we achieved in situ manipulation of the active Au-TiO 2 interface by changing gas and temperature. This result suggests that real-time design of the catalytic interface in operating conditions may be possible.},

  abstract     = {Poleward migrations of tropical cyclones have been observed globally, but their impact on coastal areas remains unclear. We investigated the change in global tropical cyclone activity in coastal regions over the period 1982–2018. We found that the distance of tropical cyclone maximum intensity to land has decreased by about 30 kilometers per decade, and that the annual frequency of global tropical cyclones increases with proximity to land by about two additional cyclones per decade. Trend analysis reveals a robust migration of tropical cyclone activity toward coasts, concurrent with poleward migration of cyclone locations as well as a statistically significant westward shift. This zonal shift of tropical cyclone tracks may be mainly driven by global zonal changes in environmental steering flow.},

Meanwhile, the environmental persistence of halogenated pollutants necessitates improved approaches to accelerate their remediation. Here, we introduce an electrochemically assisted shuttle ( e- shuttle) paradigm for the facile and scalable interconversion of alkenes and vicinal dihalides, a class of reactions that can be used both to synthesize useful dihalogenated molecules from simple alkenes and to recycle waste material through retro -dihalogenation. The reaction is demonstrated using 1,2-dibromoethane, as well as 1,1,1,2-tetrachloroethane or 1,2-dichloroethane, to dibrominate or dichlorinate, respectively, a wide range of alkenes in a simple setup with inexpensive graphite electrodes. Conversely, the hexachlorinated persistent pollutant lindane could be fully dechlorinated to benzene in soil samples using simple alkene acceptors.},

  abstract     = {Naked mole-rats ( Heterocephalus glaber ) form some of the most cooperative groups in the animal kingdom, living in multigenerational colonies under the control of a single breeding queen. Yet how they maintain this highly organized social structure is unknown. Here we show that the most common naked mole-rat vocalization, the soft chirp, is used to transmit information about group membership, creating distinctive colony dialects. Audio playback experiments demonstrate that individuals make preferential vocal responses to home colony dialects. Pups fostered in foreign colonies in early postnatal life learn the vocal dialect of their adoptive colonies, which suggests vertical transmission and flexibility of vocal signatures. Dialect integrity is partly controlled by the queen: Dialect cohesiveness decreases with queen loss and remerges only with the ascendance of a new queen.},

  abstract     = {Nucleation in atomic crystallization remains poorly understood, despite advances in classical nucleation theory. The nucleation process has been described to involve a nonclassical mechanism that includes a spontaneous transition from disordered to crystalline states, but a detailed understanding of dynamics requires further investigation. In situ electron microscopy of heterogeneous nucleation of individual gold nanocrystals with millisecond temporal resolution shows that the early stage of atomic crystallization proceeds through dynamic structural fluctuations between disordered and crystalline states, rather than through a single irreversible transition. Our experimental and theoretical analyses support the idea that structural fluctuations originate from size-dependent thermodynamic stability of the two states in atomic clusters. These findings, based on dynamics in a real atomic system, reshape and improve our understanding of nucleation mechanisms in atomic crystallization.},

Electrochemical carbon nanotube yarn muscles are of special interest because of their relatively high energy conversion efficiencies. However, they are bipolar, meaning that they do not monotonically expand or contract over the available potential range. This limits muscle stroke and work capacity. Here, we describe unipolar stroke carbon nanotube yarn muscles in which muscle stroke changes between extreme potentials are additive and muscle stroke substantially increases with increasing potential scan rate. The normal decrease in stroke with increasing scan rate is overwhelmed by a notable increase in effective ion size. Enhanced muscle strokes, contractile work-per-cycle, contractile power densities, and energy conversion efficiencies are obtained for unipolar muscles.},

We selectively launch wave packets in the two lowest electronic states (D 0 and D 1 ) of C 2 H 4 + . The electronic D 1 → D 0 relaxation takes place with a short time constant of 6.8 ± 0.2 femtoseconds. The electronic-state switching is directly visualized in ATAS owing to a spectral separation of the D 1 and D 0 bands caused by electron correlation. Multidimensional structural dynamics of the molecule are simultaneously observed. Our results demonstrate the capability to resolve the fastest electronic and structural dynamics in the broad class of organic molecules. They show that electronic relaxation in the prototypical organic chromophore can take place within less than a single vibrational period.},

  abstract     = {The effect of anthropogenic aerosol on the reflectivity of stratocumulus cloud decks through changes in cloud amount is a major uncertainty in climate projections. In frequently occurring nonprecipitating stratocumulus, cloud amount can decrease through aerosol-enhanced cloud-top mixing. The climatological relevance of this effect is debated because ship exhaust only marginally reduces stratocumulus amount. By comparing detailed numerical simulations with satellite analyses, we show that ship-track studies cannot be generalized to estimate the climatological forcing of anthropogenic aerosol. The ship track–derived sensitivity of the radiative effect of nonprecipitating stratocumulus to aerosol overestimates their cooling effect by up to 200\%. The offsetting warming effect of decreasing stratocumulus amount needs to be taken into account if we are to constrain the cloud-mediated radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosol.},

  abstract     = {Dot1 (disruptor of telomeric silencing-1), the histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase, is conserved throughout evolution, and its deregulation is found in human leukemias. Here, we provide evidence that acetylation of histone H4 allosterically stimulates yeast Dot1 in a manner distinct from but coordinating with histone H2B ubiquitination (H2BUb). We further demonstrate that this stimulatory effect is specific to acetylation of lysine 16 (H4K16ac), a modification central to chromatin structure. We provide a mechanism of this histone cross-talk and show that H4K16ac and H2BUb play crucial roles in H3K79 di- and trimethylation in vitro and in vivo. These data reveal mechanisms that control H3K79 methylation and demonstrate how H4K16ac, H3K79me, and H2BUb function together to regulate gene transcription and gene silencing to ensure optimal maintenance and propagation of an epigenetic state.},

However, the mechanism of PRC2 recruitment by means of recognition of PRC1-mediated H2AK119ub1 remains poorly understood. Our PRC2 cryo–electron microscopy structure with cofactors JARID2 and AEBP2 bound to a H2AK119ub1-containing nucleosome reveals a bridge helix in EZH2 that connects the SET domain, H3 tail, and nucleosomal DNA. JARID2 and AEBP2 each interact with one ubiquitin and the H2A-H2B surface. JARID2 stimulates PRC2 through interactions with both the polycomb protein EED and the H2AK119-ubiquitin, whereas AEBP2 has an additional scaffolding role. The presence of these cofactors partially overcomes the inhibitory effect that H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 exert on core PRC2 (in the absence of cofactors). Our results support a key role for JARID2 and AEBP2 in the cross-talk between histone modifications and PRC2 activity.},

We profiled the transcriptomes of more than 500,000 single cells from developing human fetal skin, healthy adult skin, and adult skin with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. We leveraged these datasets to compare cell states across development, homeostasis, and disease. Our analysis revealed an enrichment of innate immune cells in skin during the first trimester and clonal expansion of disease-associated lymphocytes in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. We uncovered and validated in situ a reemergence of prenatal vascular endothelial cell and macrophage cellular programs in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis lesional skin. These data illustrate the dynamism of cutaneous immunity and provide opportunities for targeting pathological developmental programs in inflammatory skin diseases.},

  abstract     = {The cerebral cortex is an intricate structure that controls human features such as language and cognition. Cortical functions rely on specialized neurons that emerge during development from complex molecular and cellular interactions. Neurodevelopmental disorders occur when one or several of these steps is incorrectly executed. Although a number of causal genes and disease phenotypes have been identified, the sequence of events linking molecular disruption to clinical expression mostly remains obscure. Here, focusing on human malformations of cortical development, we illustrate how complex interactions at the genetic, cellular, and circuit levels together contribute to diversity and variability in disease phenotypes. Using specific examples and an online resource, we propose that a multilevel assessment of disease processes is key to identifying points of vulnerability and developing new therapeutic strategies.},

We identified a three-locus genetic interaction for growth in galactose, and used precisely engineered alleles to show that it arises from variation in the galactose utilization genes GAL2 , GAL1/10/7 , and phosphoglucomutase ( PGM1 ), and that the reference allele of PGM1 is incompatible with the alternative alleles of the other genes. Multiloci balancing selection has maintained the two incompatible versions of the pathway for millions of years. Strains with alternative alleles are found primarily in galactose-rich dairy environments, and they grow faster in galactose but slower in glucose, revealing a trade-off on which balancing selection may have acted.},

Light and temperature affect mosquito mating, possibly by modulating per and/or tim expression.

We found that the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is induced in CD8 + T effector cells through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. In turn, ablation of LDHA inhibits PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt and its transcription factor target Foxo1, causing defective antimicrobial immunity. LDHA deficiency cripples cellular redox control and diminishes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in effector T cells, resulting in attenuated PI3K signaling. Thus, nutrient metabolism and growth factor signaling are highly integrated processes, with glycolytic ATP serving as a rheostat to gauge PI3K-Akt-Foxo1 signaling in the control of T cell immunity. Such a bioenergetic mechanism for the regulation of signaling may explain the Warburg effect.},

Here, using metabolic profiling and dual RNA sequencing, we show that succinate accumulation in macrophages is sensed by intracellular Salmonella Typhimurium ( S. Tm) to promote antimicrobial resistance and type III secretion. S . Tm lacking the succinate uptake transporter DcuB displays impaired survival in macrophages and in mice. Thus, S .

These patterns are controlled by genetic sex determination hierarchies that establish the sex of an individual. Here we show that the male-biased wing expression pattern of the Drosophila biarmipes gene yellow , located on the X chromosome, is independent of the fly sex determination hierarchy. Instead, we find that a regulatory interaction between yellow alleles on homologous chromosomes (a process known as transvection) silences the activity of a yellow enhancer functioning in the wing. Therefore, this enhancer can be active in males (XY) but not in females (XX). This transvection-dependent enhancer silencing requires the yellow intron and the chromatin architecture protein Mod(mdg4). Our results suggest that transvection can contribute more generally to the sex-biased expression of X-linked genes.},

Here, we introduce a nanopatterned electron transport layer that overcomes this trade-off by modifying the spatial distribution of the passivation layer to form nanoscale localized charge transport pathways through an otherwise passivated interface, thereby providing both effective passivation and excellent charge extraction. By combining the nanopatterned electron transport layer with a dopant-free hole transport layer, we achieved a certified power conversion efficiency of 21.6\% for a 1-square-centimeter cell with FF of 0.839, and demonstrate an encapsulated cell that retains ~91.7\% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours of damp heat exposure.},

Snake venoms, with a direct genetic basis and clearly defined functional phenotype, provide a model system for exploring the repeated evolution of adaptations. While snakes use venom primarily for predation, and venom composition often reflects diet specificity, three lineages of cobras have independently evolved the ability to spit venom at adversaries. Using gene, protein, and functional analyses, we show that the three spitting lineages possess venoms characterized by an up-regulation of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ) toxins, which potentiate the action of preexisting venom cytotoxins to activate mammalian sensory neurons and cause enhanced pain. These repeated independent changes provide a fascinating example of convergent evolution across multiple phenotypic levels driven by selection for defense.},

Surface science techniques revealed that CO adsorption strength at single metal sites differs from the respective metal surfaces and supported clusters. Charge transfer into the support modifies the d-states of the metal atom and the strength of the metal–CO bond. These effects could strengthen the bond (as for Ag 1 –CO) or weaken it (as for Ni 1 –CO), but CO-induced structural distortions reduce adsorption energies from those expected on the basis of electronic structure alone. The extent of the relaxations depends on the local geometry and could be predicted by analogy to coordination chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Once again, the Brazilian government is threatening native biodiversity by facilitating invasive alien species farming (1). The Brazilian Aquaculture and Fisheries Secretary recently announced a Federal Decree (10576/2020) to boost aquaculture by implementing farming of Nile tilapia in 60 of Brazil&#39;s 73 reservoirs (2). The Decree also transfers responsibilities, such as permits, licensing, and enforcement—which until now have rightly been the domain of the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA)—to the Brazilian Aquaculture and Fisheries Secretary. The Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), a cichlid fish native to Africa, is an invasive species that has spread worldwide (3). The ecological impacts associated with its farming are extensive (3, 4), and these policy changes should be halted before they cause further environmental damage to Brazil&#39;s fragile aquatic ecosystems.},

In response, the Tunisian government circulated a note to fishery officials at ports to enforce the ban on catching, landing, and marketing of 21 out of 24 species of sharks and rays listed on Annex II of the Barcelona Convention (2), pending the inclusion of these species in the national legislation. This is a positive step in the protection of these species, given that Tunisia has the largest North African fishing fleet (3), second only to Libya for shark fishing in the Mediterranean, and that North African countries landed 70\% of Mediterranean elasmobranch catches in 2018 (4).},

We unexpectedly found that in certain settings, enhanced type 1 immunity rather than defective type 17 responses can promote mucosal fungal infection susceptibility. Notably, in mice and humans with AIRE deficiency, an autoimmune disease characterized by selective susceptibility to mucosal but not systemic fungal infection, mucosal type 17 responses are intact while type 1 responses are exacerbated. These responses promote aberrant interferon-γ (IFN-γ)– and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)–dependent epithelial barrier defects as well as mucosal fungal infection susceptibility. Concordantly, genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of IFN-γ or Janus kinase (JAK)–STAT signaling ameliorates mucosal fungal disease. Thus, we identify aberrant T cell–dependent, type 1 mucosal inflammation as a critical tissue-specific pathogenic mechanism that promotes mucosal fungal infection susceptibility in mice and humans.},

The dynamics of cell birth, death, and inheritance within an organism give rise to the fundamental processes of development, differentiation, and cancer. Technical advances in molecular biology now allow us to study cellular composition, ancestry, and evolution at the resolution of individual cells within an organism or tissue. Here, we take a phylogenetic and phylodynamic approach to single-cell biology. We explain how “tree thinking” is important to the interpretation of the growing body of cell-level data and how ecological null models can benefit statistical hypothesis testing. Experimental progress in cell biology should be accompanied by theoretical developments if we are to exploit fully the dynamical information in single-cell data.},

Here, we report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of a mammalian transcribing Pol II–U1 snRNP complex. The structure reveals that Pol II and U1 snRNP interact directly. This interaction positions the pre-mRNA 5′ splice site near the RNA exit site of Pol II. Extension of pre-mRNA retains the 5′ splice site, leading to the formation of a “growing intron loop.” Loop formation may facilitate scanning of nascent pre-mRNA for the 3′ splice site, functional pairing of distant intron ends, and prespliceosome assembly. Our results provide a starting point for a mechanistic analysis of cotranscriptional spliceosome assembly and the biogenesis of mRNA isoforms by alternative splicing.},

The structure includes both the extracellular domains and the transmembrane helices of the complex, revealing a contact interface between the ectodomains that drives complex formation. Upon binding to CD19, CD81 opens its ectodomain to expose a hydrophobic CD19-binding surface and reorganizes its transmembrane helices to occlude a cholesterol binding pocket present in the apoprotein. Our data reveal the structural basis for CD19-CD81 complex assembly, providing a foundation for rational design of therapies for B cell dysfunction.},

We create nonthermal states in a bosonic one-dimensional (1D) quantum gas of dysprosium by stabilizing a super-Tonks-Girardeau gas against collapse and thermalization with repulsive long-range dipolar interactions. Stiffness and energy-per-particle measurements show that the system is dynamically stable regardless of contact interaction strength. This enables us to cycle contact interactions from weakly to strongly repulsive, then strongly attractive, and finally weakly attractive. We show that this cycle is an energy-space topological pump (caused by a quantum holonomy). Iterating this cycle offers an unexplored topological pumping method to create a hierarchy of increasingly excited prethermal states.},

We identified escape mutations as those that preserve viral infectivity but cause a virus to look different to the immune system, akin to word changes that preserve a sentence’s grammaticality but change its meaning. With this approach, language models of influenza hemagglutinin, HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (HIV Env), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike viral proteins can accurately predict structural escape patterns using sequence data alone.

Using optically coupled in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy, we track the dehydrogenation of individual antenna-reactor pairs with varying optical illumination intensity, wavelength, and hydrogen pressure. Our in situ experiments show that plasmons enable new catalytic sites, including dehydrogenation at the nanorod faces. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm that these new nucleation sites are energetically unfavorable in equilibrium and only accessible through tailored plasmonic excitation.},

Compaction is intuitively thought to reduce root growth by limiting the ability of roots to penetrate harder soils. We report that root growth in compacted soil is instead actively suppressed by the volatile hormone ethylene. We found that mutant Arabidopsis and rice roots that were insensitive to ethylene penetrated compacted soil more effectively than did wild-type roots. Our results indicate that soil compaction lowers gas diffusion through a reduction in air-filled pores, thereby causing ethylene to accumulate in root tissues and trigger hormone responses that restrict growth. We propose that ethylene acts as an early warning signal for roots to avoid compacted soils, which would be relevant to research into the breeding of crops resilient to soil compaction.},

Although pathogens that infect fetal tissues can induce birth defects through the local production of type I IFN, it remains unknown why systemic IFN generated during maternal infections only rarely causes fetal developmental defects. Here, we report that activation of the guanine nucleotide–binding protein–coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) during pregnancy is both necessary and sufficient to suppress IFN signaling and does so disproportionately in reproductive and fetal tissues. Inactivation of GPER1 in mice halted fetal development and promoted fetal demise, but only in the context of maternal inflammation. Thus, GPER1 is a central regulator of IFN signaling during pregnancy that allows dynamic antiviral responses in maternal tissues while also preserving fetal health.},

  abstract     = {Removal of senescent cells (senolysis) has been proposed to be beneficial for improving age-associated pathologies, but the molecular pathways for such senolytic activity have not yet emerged. Here, we identified glutaminase 1 ( GLS1 ) as an essential gene for the survival of human senescent cells. The intracellular pH in senescent cells was lowered by lysosomal membrane damage, and this lowered pH induced kidney-type glutaminase (KGA) expression. The resulting enhanced glutaminolysis induced ammonia production, which neutralized the lower pH and improved survival of the senescent cells. Inhibition of KGA-dependent glutaminolysis in aged mice eliminated senescent cells specifically and ameliorated age-associated organ dysfunction. Our results suggest that senescent cells rely on glutaminolysis, and its inhibition offers a promising strategy for inducing senolysis in vivo.},

  abstract     = {The surface of neutron-rich heavy nuclei, with a neutron skin created by excess neutrons, provides an important terrestrial model system to study dilute neutron-rich matter. By using quasi-free α cluster–knockout reactions, we obtained direct experimental evidence for the formation of α clusters at the surface of neutron-rich tin isotopes. The observed monotonous decrease of the reaction cross sections with increasing mass number, in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction, implies a tight interplay between α-cluster formation and the neutron skin. This result, in turn, calls for a revision of the correlation between the neutron-skin thickness and the density dependence of the symmetry energy, which is essential for understanding neutron stars. Our result also provides a natural explanation for the origin of α particles in α decay.},

  abstract     = {Many plant specialized metabolites function in herbivore defense, and abrogating particular steps in their biosynthetic pathways frequently causes autotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their defense and autotoxicity remain unclear. Here, we show that silencing two cytochrome P450s involved in diterpene biosynthesis in the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata causes severe autotoxicity symptoms that result from the inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis by noncontrolled hydroxylated diterpene derivatives. Moreover, the diterpenes’ defensive function is achieved by inhibiting herbivore sphingolipid biosynthesis through postingestive backbone hydroxylation products. Thus, by regulating metabolic modifications, tobacco plants avoid autotoxicity and gain herbivore defense. The postdigestive duet that occurs between plants and their insect herbivores can reflect the plant’s solutions to the “toxic waste dump” problem of using potent chemical defenses.},

Tubulin glycylation modifies microtubules specifically in cilia and flagella, but its functional and mechanistic roles remain unclear. In this study, we generated a mouse model entirely lacking tubulin glycylation. Male mice were subfertile owing to aberrant beat patterns of their sperm flagella, which impeded the straight swimming of sperm cells. Using cryo–electron tomography, we showed that lack of glycylation caused abnormal conformations of the dynein arms within sperm axonemes, providing the structural basis for the observed dysfunction. Our findings reveal the importance of microtubule glycylation for controlled flagellar beating, directional sperm swimming, and male fertility.},

A contributing factor to pathogenesis is secreted flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). Despite demonstrated protection by NS1-specific antibodies against lethal flavivirus challenge, the structural and mechanistic basis remains unknown. Here, we present three crystal structures of full-length dengue virus NS1 complexed with a flavivirus–cross-reactive, NS1-specific monoclonal antibody, 2B7, at resolutions between 2.89 and 3.96 angstroms. These structures reveal a protective mechanism by which two domains of NS1 are antagonized simultaneously. The NS1 wing domain mediates cell binding, whereas the β-ladder triggers downstream events, both of which are required for dengue, Zika, and West Nile virus NS1–mediated endothelial dysfunction. These observations provide a mechanistic explanation for 2B7 protection against NS1-induced pathology and demonstrate the potential of one antibody to treat infections by multiple flaviviruses.},

The flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a promising vaccine antigen with low ADE risk but has yet to be explored as a broad-spectrum therapeutic antibody target. Here, we provide the structural basis of NS1 antibody cross-reactivity through cocrystallization of the antibody 1G5.3 with NS1 proteins from dengue and Zika viruses. The 1G5.3 antibody blocks multi-flavivirus NS1-mediated cell permeability in disease-relevant cell lines, and therapeutic application of 1G5.3 reduces viremia and improves survival in dengue, Zika, and West Nile virus murine models. Finally, we demonstrate that 1G5.3 protection is independent of effector function, identifying the 1G5.3 epitope as a key site for broad-spectrum antiviral development.},

Using x-ray crystallography, we show how a preTCR applies the concave β-sheet surface of its single variable domain (Vβ) to “horizontally” grab the protruding MHC α2-helix. By contrast, αβTCRs purpose all six complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops of their paired VαVβ module to recognize peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex molecules (pMHCs) in “vertical” head-to-head binding. The preTCR topological fit ensures that CDR3β reaches the peptide’s featured C-terminal segment for pMHC sampling, establishing the subsequent αβTCR canonical docking mode. “Horizontal” docking precludes germline CDR1β- and CDR2β-MHC binding to broaden β-chain repertoire diversification before αβTCR-mediated selection refinement. Thus, one subunit successively attunes the recognition logic of related multicomponent receptors.},

Fluid flow on the parent bodies of these meteorites is known to have occurred very early in Solar System history (first &lt;4 million years). We analyze short-lived uranium isotopes in carbonaceous chondrites, finding excesses of 234-uranium over 238-uranium and 238-uranium over 230-thorium. These indicate that the fluid-mobile uranium ion U 6+ moved within the past few 100,000 years. In some meteorites, this time scale is less than the cosmic-ray exposure age, which measures when they were ejected from their parent body into space. Fluid flow occurred after melting of ice, potentially by impact heating, solar heating, or atmospheric ablation. We favor the impact heating hypothesis, which implies that the parent bodies still contain ice.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) can be interpreted as a classical electrostatic interaction or as a covalent chemical bond if the interaction is strong enough. As a result, short strong H-bonds exist at an intersection between qualitatively different bonding descriptions, with few experimental methods to understand this dichotomy. The [F-H-F] − ion represents a bare short H-bond, whose distinctive vibrational potential in water is revealed with femtosecond two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy. It shows the superharmonic behavior of the proton motion, which is strongly coupled to the donor-acceptor stretching and disappears on H-bond bending. In combination with high-level quantum-chemical calculations, we demonstrate a distinct crossover in spectroscopic properties from conventional to short strong H-bonds, which identify where hydrogen bonding ends and chemical bonding begins.},

  abstract     = {Empathy is an essential component of social communication that involves experiencing others’ sensory and emotional states. We observed that a brief social interaction with a mouse experiencing pain or morphine analgesia resulted in the transfer of these experiences to its social partner. Optogenetic manipulations demonstrated that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and its projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) were selectively involved in the social transfer of both pain and analgesia. By contrast, the ACC→NAc circuit was not necessary for the social transfer of fear, which instead depended on ACC projections to the basolateral amygdala. These findings reveal that the ACC, a brain area strongly implicated in human empathic responses, mediates distinct forms of empathy in mice by influencing different downstream targets.},

  abstract     = {The ability to control autoreactive T cells without inducing systemic immune suppression is the major goal for treatment of autoimmune diseases. The key challenge is the safe and efficient delivery of pharmaceutically well-defined antigens in a noninflammatory context. Here, we show that systemic delivery of nanoparticle-formulated 1 methylpseudouridine-modified messenger RNA (m1Ψ mRNA) coding for disease-related autoantigens results in antigen presentation on splenic CD11c + antigen-presenting cells in the absence of costimulatory signals. In several mouse models of multiple sclerosis, the disease is suppressed by treatment with such m1Ψ mRNA. The treatment effect is associated with a reduction of effector T cells and the development of regulatory T cell (T reg cell) populations. Notably, these T reg cells execute strong bystander immunosuppression and thus improve disease induced by cognate and noncognate autoantigens.},

Here, we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing to define dynamic transcriptional states associated with the adaptive versus terminal UPR in the mouse intestinal epithelium. We integrated these transcriptional programs with genome-scale CRISPR screening to dissect the UPR pathway functionally. We identified QRICH1 as a key effector of the PERK-eIF2α axis of the UPR. QRICH1 controlled a transcriptional program associated with translation and secretory networks that were specifically up-regulated in inflammatory pathologies. Thus, QRICH1 dictates cell fate in response to pathological ER stress.},

General principles describing self-organization away from equilibrium have been challenging to identify. We offer a unifying framework that models the behavior of complex systems as largely random while capturing their configuration-dependent response to external forcing. This allows derivation of a Boltzmann-like principle for understanding and manipulating driven self-organization. We validate our predictions experimentally, with the use of shape-changing robotic active matter, and outline a methodology for controlling collective behavior. Our findings highlight how emergent order depends sensitively on the matching between external patterns of forcing and internal dynamical response properties, pointing toward future approaches for the design and control of active particle mixtures and metamaterials.},

With ancestral reconstruction and nuclear magnetic resonance, we studied the evolution of the metamorphic human protein XCL1, which has two distinct folds with different functions, making it an unusual member of the chemokine family, whose members generally adopt one conserved fold. XCL1 evolved from an ancestor with the chemokine fold. Evolution of a dimer interface, changes in structural constraints and molecular strain, and alteration of intramolecular protein contacts drove the evolution of metamorphosis. Then, XCL1 likely evolved to preferentially populate the noncanonical fold before reaching its modern-day near-equal population of folds. These discoveries illuminate how one sequence has evolved to encode multiple structures, revealing principles for protein design and engineering.},

Observations suggest that aerosols enhance tropical thunderstorm activity; past research, motivated by the importance of understanding aerosol impacts on clouds, has proposed several mechanisms that could explain that observed link. We find that high-resolution atmospheric simulations can reproduce the observed link between aerosols and convection. However, we also show that previously proposed mechanisms are unable to explain the invigoration. Examining underlying processes reveals that, in our simulations, high aerosol concentrations increase environmental humidity by producing clouds that mix more condensed water into the surrounding air. In turn, higher humidity favors large-scale ascent and stronger convection. Our results provide a physical reason to expect invigorated thunderstorms in high-aerosol regions of the tropics.},

Here, we apply such design strategies to desalination membranes. A series of polyamide desalination membranes—which were synthesized in an industrial-scale manufacturing line and varied in processing conditions but retained similar chemical compositions—show increasing water permeability and active layer thickness with constant sodium chloride selectivity. Transmission electron microscopy measurements enabled us to determine nanoscale three-dimensional polyamide density maps and predict water permeability with zero adjustable parameters. Density fluctuations are detrimental to water transport, which makes systematic control over nanoscale polyamide inhomogeneity a key route to maximizing water permeability without sacrificing salt selectivity in desalination membranes.},

The HORMA protein O-MAD2 converts to C-MAD2 upon binding CDC20. This is rate limiting for assembly of the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), the effector of a checkpoint required for mitotic fidelity. A catalyst assembled at kinetochores accelerates MAD2:CDC20 association through a poorly understood mechanism. Using a reconstituted SAC system, we discovered that CDC20 is an impervious substrate for which access to MAD2 requires simultaneous docking on several sites of the catalytic complex. Our analysis indicates that the checkpoint catalyst is substrate assisted and promotes MCC assembly through spatially and temporally coordinated conformational changes in both MAD2 and CDC20. This may define a paradigm for other HORMA-controlled systems.},

To protect against chromosome gain or loss, kinetochores lacking microtubule attachment locally catalyze association of the checkpoint proteins Cdc20 and Mad2, which is the key event in the formation of a diffusible checkpoint complex that prevents mitotic exit. We elucidated the mechanism of kinetochore-catalyzed Mad2-Cdc20 assembly with a probe that specifically monitors this assembly reaction at kinetochores in living cells. We found that catalysis occurs through a tripartite mechanism that includes localized delivery of Mad2 and Cdc20 substrates and two phosphorylation-dependent interactions that geometrically constrain their positions and prime Cdc20 for interaction with Mad2. These results reveal how unattached kinetochores create a signal that ensures genome integrity during cell division.},

In this study, we investigated whether direct interaction of two nascent proteins, emerging from nearby ribosomes (co-co assembly), constitutes a general mechanism for oligomer formation. We used proteome-wide screening to detect nascent chain–connected ribosome pairs and identified hundreds of homomer subunits that co-co assemble in human cells. Interactions are mediated by five major domain classes, among which N-terminal coiled coils are the most prevalent. We were able to reconstitute co-co assembly of nuclear lamin in Escherichia coli , demonstrating that dimer formation is independent of dedicated assembly machineries. Co-co assembly may thus represent an efficient way to limit protein aggregation risks posed by diffusion-driven assembly routes and ensure isoform-specific homomer formation.},

  abstract     = {Neuroendocrine (NE) cells are epithelial cells that possess many of the characteristics of neurons, including the presence of secretory vesicles and the ability to sense environmental stimuli. The normal physiologic functions of solitary airway NE cells remain a mystery. We show that mouse and human airway basal stem cells sense hypoxia. Hypoxia triggers the direct differentiation of these stem cells into solitary NE cells. Ablation of these solitary NE cells during hypoxia results in increased epithelial injury, whereas the administration of the NE cell peptide CGRP rescues this excess damage. Thus, we identify stem cells that directly sense hypoxia and respond by differentiating into solitary NE cells that secrete a protective peptide that mitigates hypoxic injury.},

  abstract     = {Rechargeable alkaline zinc-air batteries promise high energy density and safety but suffer from the sluggish 4 electron (e − )/oxygen (O 2 ) chemistry that requires participation of water and from the electrochemical irreversibility originating from parasitic reactions caused by caustic electrolytes and atmospheric carbon dioxide. Here, we report a zinc-O 2 /zinc peroxide (ZnO 2 ) chemistry that proceeds through a 2e − /O 2 process in nonalkaline aqueous electrolytes, which enables highly reversible redox reactions in zinc-air batteries. This ZnO 2 chemistry was made possible by a water-poor and zinc ion (Zn 2+ )–rich inner Helmholtz layer on the air cathode caused by the hydrophobic trifluoromethanesulfonate anions. The nonalkaline zinc-air battery thus constructed not only tolerates stable operations in ambient air but also exhibits substantially better reversibility than its alkaline counterpart.},
