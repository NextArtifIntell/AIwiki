  abstract     = {The control of T cell survival is crucial for defense against infectious pathogens or emerging cancers. Although the survival of peripheral naïve T cells has been proposed to be controlled by interleukin-7 (IL-7) signaling and T cell receptor (TCR) activation by peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complexes (pMHC), the essential roles for these pathways in thymic output and T cell proliferation have complicated the analysis of their contributions to T cell survival. Here, we showed that the WD repeat–containing protein coronin 1, which is dispensable for thymic selection and output, promoted naïve T cell survival in the periphery in a manner that was independent of TCR and IL-7 signaling. Coronin 1 was required for the maintenance of the basal activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ (PI3Kδ), thereby suppressing caspase 8–mediated apoptosis. These results therefore reveal a coronin 1–dependent PI3Kδ pathway that is independent of pMHC:TCR and IL-7 signaling and essential for peripheral T cell survival.},

  abstract     = {Ligand binding to G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the α 2a -adrenergic receptor (α 2a AR), results in the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins, which consist of functionally distinct Gα subunits and Gβγ dimers. α 2a AR-dependent inhibition of synaptic transmission regulates functions such as spontaneous locomotor activity, anesthetic sparing, and working memory enhancement and requires the soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, a Gβγ effector. To understand how the Gβγ-SNARE complex underlies the α 2a AR-dependent inhibition of synaptic transmission, we examined the specificity of Gβγ subunits for the SNARE complex in adrenergic neurons, in which auto-α 2a ARs respond to epinephrine released from these neurons, and nonadrenergic neurons, in which hetero-α 2a ARs respond to epinephrine released from other neurons. We performed a quantitative, targeted multiple reaction monitoring proteomic analysis of Gβ and Gγ subunits bound to the SNARE complex in synaptosomes from mouse brains. In the absence of stimulation of auto-α 2a ARs, Gβ 1 and Gγ 3 interacted with the SNARE complex. However, Gβ 1 , Gβ 2 , and Gγ 3 were found in the complex when auto-α 2a ARs were activated by epinephrine. Further understanding of the specific usage of distinct Gβγ subunits in vivo may provide insights into the homeostatic regulation of synaptic transmission and the mechanisms of dysfunction that occur in neurological diseases.},

  abstract     = {Cytokine production is a critical component of cell-extrinsic responses to DNA damage and cellular senescence. Here, we demonstrated that expression of the gene encoding interleukin-19 (IL-19) was enhanced by DNA damage through pathways mediated by c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and cGAS-STING and that IL19 expression was required for the subsequent production of the cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8. IL19 expression was stimulated by diverse cellular stresses, including inhibition of the DNA replication checkpoint kinase ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein), oncogene expression, replicative exhaustion, oxidative stress, and DNA double-strand breaks. Unlike the production of IL-6 and IL-8, IL19 expression was not affected by abrogation of signaling by the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) or the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38. Instead, the DNA damage–induced production of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 was substantially reduced by suppression of IL19 expression. The signaling pathways required to stimulate IL19 expression selectively depended on the type of DNA-damaging agent. Reactive oxygen species and the ASK1-JNK pathway were critical for responses to ionizing radiation (IR), whereas the cGAS-STING pathway stimulated IL19 expression in response to either IR or ATR inhibition. Whereas induction of IL1 , IL6 , and IL8 by IR depended on IL19 expression, the cGAS-STING–dependent induction of the immune checkpoint gene PDL1 after IR and ATR inhibition was independent of IL19 . Together, these results suggest that IL-19 production by diverse pathways forms a distinct cytokine regulatory arm of the response to DNA damage.},

Here, we found that the D630Y mutation in PLCβ4 results in a high level of constitutive PLCβ4 activity. Mutations at the corresponding position in other PLC isoforms also resulted in constitutive activity, revealing an unrecognized mechanism underlying PLC activation. In cultured human uveal melanoma cell lines, inhibition of PLC suppressed proliferation in Gα q/11 -dependent cells. Furthermore, we found that PLCβ4(D630Y) mediated proliferation in cutaneous melanocytes and the growth of melanomas in mice.

  abstract     = {Chronic metabolic inflammation is a key feature of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. Here, we showed that altered regulation of the Ca 2+ channel inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP 3 R) was an adipocyte-intrinsic event involved in the emergence and propagation of inflammatory signaling and the resulting insulin resistance. Inflammation induced by cytokine exposure in vitro or by obesity in vivo led to increases in the abundance and activity of IP 3 Rs and in the phosphorylation of the Ca 2+ -dependent kinase CaMKII in adipocytes in a manner dependent on the kinase JNK. In mice, adipocyte-specific loss of IP 3 R1/2 protected against adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance, despite the mice exhibiting substantial diet-induced weight gain. Thus, this work suggests that increased IP 3 R activity is a key link between obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance. These data also suggest that approaches to target IP 3 R-mediated Ca 2+ homeostasis in adipocytes may offer new therapeutic opportunities against metabolic diseases, especially because GWAS studies also implicate this locus in human obesity.},

  abstract     = {Salivary glands are damaged by radiotherapy for head and neck cancers, which often culminates in radiation-induced hyposalivation and xerostomia that may be permanent. Here, we identified a central role for YAP in the regenerative response of the salivary gland. Activation of the Hippo signaling pathway inhibits the phosphorylation of YAP, leading to its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Using mice with salivary gland injury induced by surgical ligation and salivary gland–derived organoids, we found that YAP nuclear localization in the salivary gland epithelium changed dynamically between homeostasis and regeneration. Whereas local injury had no effect on nuclear YAP localization in saliva-producing acinar cells, it triggered nuclear accumulation of YAP in saliva-transporting ductal cells. Injury also stimulated the proliferation of ductal cells, which were mainly quiescent under homeostatic conditions and in nonregenerating areas distal to the injury site, thus enabling salivary gland regeneration. Overexpressing YAP or driving YAP nuclear translocation by inhibiting upstream Hippo pathway kinases increased the capacity of mouse and human salivary gland cells, including human cells that had been irradiated, to form lobed organoids in vitro. Our results identify a YAP-driven regeneration program in salivary gland ductal cells that could be used to promote salivary gland regeneration after irradiation-induced damage.},

Conditional deletion of YAP/TAZ in ECs reduced tumor angiogenesis and growth in a mouse B16-F10 melanoma model. Using cultured ECs and mice with EC-specific ablation, we showed that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was required for the activation of YAP/TAZ in tumor-associated ECs. Moreover, we showed that STAT3-mediated signaling promoted YAP/TAZ activity and that the nuclear shuttling machinery for STAT3 was also required for YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation.

To explore the biological pathways regulated by RIT1 and how they relate to the oncogenic KRAS network, we performed quantitative proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and transcriptomic profiling of isogenic lung epithelial cells in which we ectopically expressed wild-type or cancer-associated variants of RIT1 and KRAS. We found that both mutant KRAS and mutant RIT1 promoted canonical RAS signaling and that overexpression of wild-type RIT1 partially phenocopied oncogenic RIT1 and KRAS, including induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Our findings suggest that RIT1 protein abundance is a factor in its pathogenic function. Therefore, chromosomal amplification of wild-type RIT1 in lung and other cancers may be tumorigenic.},

  abstract     = {Obesity and metabolic diseases, such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D), are associated with metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Here, we investigated the critical cellular and molecular factors behind this link. We found that primary human adipocytes shed extracellular vesicles, specifically exosomes, that induced the expression of genes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem–like cell (CSC) traits in cocultured breast cancer cell lines. Transcription of these genes was further increased in cells exposed to exosomes shed from T2D patient–derived adipocytes or insulin-resistant adipocytes and required the epigenetic reader proteins BRD2 and BRD4 in recipient cells. The thrombospondin family protein TSP5, which is associated with cancer, was more abundant in exosomes from T2D or insulin-resistant adipocytes and partially contributed to EMT in recipient cells. Bioinformatic analysis of breast cancer patient tissue showed that greater coexpression of COMP (which encodes TSP5) and BRD2 or BRD3 correlated with poorer prognosis, specifically decreased distant metastasis–free survival. Our findings reveal a mechanism of exosome-mediated cross-talk between metabolically abnormal adipocytes and breast cancer cells that may promote tumor aggressiveness in patients with T2D.},

  abstract     = {Type I interferons bind to cell surface receptors composed of the subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, the intracellular domains (ICDs) of which are associated with the kinases TYK2 and JAK1, respectively. Ligand binding results in the cross-phosphorylation of TYK2 and JAK1, which then phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the ICDs of the receptor subunits and members of the STAT family of transcription factors. The phosphorylated STATs migrate to the nucleus and drive transcription. We analyzed receptor mutants in knockout cells to study the functional importance of various regions of the receptor ICDs. For IFNAR1, only the TYK2 binding site in the ICD was required for signaling. In contrast, successive truncations of the ICD of IFNAR2 proportionally decreased constitutive STAT binding, STAT phosphorylation, and target gene activation. These findings fit a model in which nonsuccessive stretches along the ICD interact with STATs. Tyrosine residues in the IFNAR1 ICD were not required for signaling, and single tyrosine mutations in the IFNAR2 ICD did not affect signal activation. However, simultaneous mutation of all the tyrosine residues in IFNAR2-ICD reduced STAT phosphorylation, STAT-mediated transcriptional activation, and antiviral activity but not constitutive STAT2 binding. We suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation on IFNAR2-ICD drives the dissociation of phosphorylated STATs, thus maintaining high signaling flux.},

  abstract     = {Thyroid hormone (TH) action is essential for hepatic lipid synthesis and oxidation. Analysis of hepatocyte-specific thyroid receptor β1 (TRβ1) knockout mice confirmed a role for TH in stimulating de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation through its nuclear receptor. Specifically, TRβ1 and its principal corepressor NCoR1 in hepatocytes repressed de novo lipogenesis, whereas the TH-mediated induction of lipogenic genes depended on the transcription factor ChREBP. Mice with a hepatocyte-specific deficiency in ChREBP lost TH-mediated stimulation of the lipogenic program, which, in turn, impaired the regulation of fatty acid oxidation. TH regulated ChREBP activation and recruitment to DNA, revealing a mechanism by which TH regulates specific signaling pathways. Regulation of the lipogenic pathway by TH through ChREBP was conserved in hepatocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. These results demonstrate that TH signaling in the liver acts simultaneously to enhance both lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation.},

The reverse reaction—NAADP to NAADPH—is catalyzed by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Here, we identified NADPH oxidases NOX and DUOX as NAADP-forming enzymes that convert NAADPH to NAADP under physiological conditions in vitro. T cells express NOX1, NOX2, and, to a minor extent, DUOX1 and DUOX2. Local and global Ca 2+ signaling were decreased in mouse T cells with double knockout of Duoxa1 and Duoxa2 but not with knockout of Nox1 or Nox2. Ca 2+ microdomains in the first 15 s upon T cell activation were significantly decreased in Duox2 −/− but not in Duox1 −/− T cells, whereas both DUOX1 and DUOX2 were required for global Ca 2+ signaling between 4 and 12 min after stimulation. Our findings suggest that a DUOX2- and G6PD-catalyzed redox cycle rapidly produces and degrades NAADP through NAADPH as an inactive intermediate.},

  abstract     = {Neonatal seizures pose a clinical challenge in their early detection, acute management, and long-term comorbidities. They are often caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and are frequently refractory to the first-line antiseizure medication phenobarbital. One proposed mechanism for phenobarbital inefficacy during neonatal seizures is the reduced abundance and function of the neuron-specific K + /Cl − cotransporter 2 (KCC2), which maintains chloride homeostasis and promotes GABAergic inhibition upon its phosphorylation during postnatal development. Here, we investigated whether this mechanism is causal and whether it can be rescued by KCC2 functional enhancement. In a CD-1 mouse model of refractory ischemic neonatal seizures, treatment with the KCC2 functional enhancer CLP290 rescued phenobarbital efficacy, increased KCC2 abundance, and prevented the development of epileptogenesis, as quantified by video electroencephalogram monitoring. These effects were prevented by knock-in expression of nonphosphorylatable mutants of KCC2 (S940A or T906A and T1007A), indicating that KCC2 phosphorylation regulates both neonatal seizure susceptibility and CLP290-mediated KCC2 functional enhancement. Our findings therefore validate KCC2 as a clinically relevant target for refractory neonatal seizures and provide insights for future drug development.},

A functionally orthologous system exists in mice, consisting of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on target cells and the inhibitory Ly49 and CD94-NKG2A receptors on NK cells. Here, we found that the abundance of Src homology 2 domain–containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) in NK cells was established by interactions between MHCs and NK cell inhibitory receptors, although phenotypically identical NK cell populations still showed substantial variability in endogenous SHP-1 abundance and NK cell response potential. Human and mouse NK cell populations with high responsiveness had low SHP-1 abundance, and a reduction in SHP-1 abundance in NK cells enhanced their responsiveness. Computational modeling of NK cell activation by membrane-proximal signaling events identified SHP-1 as a negative amplitude regulator, which was validated by single-cell analysis of human NK cell responsiveness. The amount of mRNA and protein varied among responsive NK cells despite their similar chromatin accessibility to that of unresponsive cells, suggesting dynamic regulation of SHP-1 abundance. Low intracellular SHP-1 abundance was a biomarker of responsive NK cells. Together, these data suggest that enhancing NK cell function through the acute loss of SHP-1 abundance or activity may enhance the tumoricidal capacity of NK cells.},

  abstract     = {Damaged skeletal muscle can regenerate because of the coordinated action of immune cells with muscle stem cells, called satellite cells. Proinflammatory macrophages infiltrate skeletal muscle soon after injury to sustain the proliferation of satellite cells. These macrophages later acquire the anti-inflammatory phenotype and promote the differentiation and fusion of satellite cells. Here, we showed that MCUb, the dominant-negative subunit of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex, promotes muscle regeneration by controlling macrophage responses. Macrophages lacking MCUb lost the ability to efficiently acquire the anti-inflammatory profile, and mice with MCUb-deficient macrophages showed delayed regeneration through exhaustion of the satellite cell pool. MCUb ablation altered macrophage metabolism by promoting glycolysis and the accumulation of TCA cycle intermediates, which was accompanied by the stabilization of HIF-1α, the master transcriptional regulator of the macrophage proinflammatory program. Together, these data demonstrate that MCUb abundance is tightly controlled in macrophages to enable satellite cell functional differentiation and recovery of tissue homeostasis after damage.},

  abstract     = {Implantation of biomaterials or devices into soft tissue often leads to the development of the foreign body response (FBR), an inflammatory condition that can cause implant failure, tissue injury, and death of the patient. Macrophages accumulate and fuse to generate destructive foreign body giant cells (FBGCs) at the tissue-implant interface, leading to the development of fibrous scar tissue around the implant that is generated by myofibroblasts. We previously showed that the FBR in vivo and FBGC formation in vitro require transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), a mechanosensitive ion channel. Here, we report that TRPV4 was required specifically for the FBR induced by implant stiffness independently of biochemical cues and for intracellular stiffening that promotes FBGC formation in vitro. TRPV4 deficiency reduced collagen deposition and the accumulation of macrophages, FBGCs, and myofibroblasts at stiff, but not soft, implants in vivo and inhibited macrophage-induced differentiation of wild-type fibroblasts into myofibroblasts in vitro. Atomic force microscopy demonstrated that TRPV4 was required for implant-adjacent tissue stiffening in vivo and for cytoskeletal remodeling and intracellular stiffening induced by fusogenic cytokines in vitro. Together, these data suggest a mechanism whereby a reciprocal functional interaction between TRPV4 and substrate stiffness leads to cytoskeletal remodeling and cellular force generation to promote FBGC formation during the FBR.},

  abstract     = {Astrocytes are a type of glial cell that are activated in the brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer’s disease to induce the accumulation of amyloid (Aβ). We previously found that a combination of low-dose gemfibrozil (GFB; a drug approved to treat high cholesterol) and retinoic acid (RA; a vitamin A derivative) induces lysosomal bio-genesis through peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα)–mediated transcription of the gene encoding transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. Here, we found that the same combination (GFB-RA) enhanced the uptake of Aβ from the extracellular space and its subsequent degradation in astrocytes through a PPARα-dependent pathway. GFB-RA stimulated the abundance of both low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and TFEB in astrocytes through PPARα. LDLR was critical for Aβ uptake, whereas TFEB was critical for its degradation. GFB-RA treatment also increased autophagic flux and lysosomal activity in astrocytes. Consistent with these effects and in a manner dependent on astroglial PPARα, oral administration of GFB-RA switched astroglial activation to a neuroprotective state, lowered Aβ burden in the brain, and improved spatial learning and memory in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. These findings uncover a new function of PPARα in stimulating astroglial uptake and degradation of Aβ and suggest possible repurposing of GFB-RA combination therapy for AD.},

Here, we investigated how the NLRP3 inflammasome is regulated. We found that its activation in primary mouse macrophages induced the Src family kinase Lyn to phosphorylate NLRP3 at Tyr 918 , which correlated with a subsequent increase in its ubiquitination that facilitated its proteasome-mediated degradation. NLRP3 tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitination was abrogated in Lyn-deficient macrophages, which produced increased amounts of IL-1β. Furthermore, mice lacking Lyn were more susceptible to LPS-induced septic shock in an NLRP3-dependent manner. Our data demonstrate that Lyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation is a prerequisite for the ubiquitination that dampens NLRP3 inflammasome activity.},

  abstract     = {Although immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has strong clinical benefit for treating some tumor types, it fails in others, indicating a need for additional modalities to enhance the ICB effect. Here, we identified one such modality by using DNA damage to create a live, injured tumor cell adjuvant. Using an optimized ex vivo coculture system, we found that treating tumor cells with specific concentrations of etoposide, mitoxantrone, or doxorubicin markedly enhanced dendritic cell–mediated T cell activation. These immune-enhancing effects of DNA damage did not correlate with immunogenic cell death markers or with the extent of apoptosis or necroptosis; instead, these effects were mediated by live injured cells with activation of the DNA-PK, ATR, NF-κB, p38 MAPK, and RIPK1 signaling pathways. In mice, intratumoral injection of ex vivo etoposide–treated tumor cells in combination with systemic ICB (by anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies) increased the number of intratumoral CD103 + dendritic cells and circulating tumor-antigen–specific CD8 + T cells, decreased tumor growth, and improved survival. These effects were absent in Batf3 −/− mice and in mice in which the DNA-damaging drug was injected directly into the tumor, due to DNA damage in the immune cells. The combination treatment induced complete tumor regression in a subset of mice that were then able to reject tumor rechallenge, indicating that the injured cell adjuvant treatment induced durable antitumor immunological memory. These results provide a strategy for enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition in tumor types that do not respond to this treatment modality by itself.},

When coupled to the G protein G i/o , GABA B R phosphorylates the kinases ERK1 and ERK2. Here, we uncovered a distinct β-arrestin–independent mechanism of MAPK pathway activation by GABA B R. We found that GABA B R also phosphorylated the kinase JNK downstream of activation of the small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) RhoA and Rac1 in primary mouse neurons. However, instead of G i/o proteins, activation of this RhoA/Rac1-JNK pathway was mediated by G 13 . This pathway promoted the phosphorylation and accumulation of the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD95 and GABA B R-mediated neuroprotection in granule neurons. In addition, this pathway synergized with a previously reported GABA B R-mediated neuroprotection mediated by a G i/o -dependent mechanism. GABA B R agonists activated G 13 with slower kinetics and lower potency than with which they activated G i/o . Our findings reveal distinct, β-arrestin–independent, context-specific synergistic mechanisms of MAPK activation by G protein–mediated GPCR signaling.},

Here, we found that activation of the G protein subunit Gα q promoted the formation of particles that contained stress granule proteins through a mechanism linked to a cytosolic fraction of phospholipase Cβ1 (PLCβ1). In experiments with PC12 and A10 cells, we showed that under basal conditions, cytosolic PLCβ1 bound to stress granule–associated proteins, including PABPC1, eIF5A, and Ago2. Knockdown of cytosolic PLCβ1 with siRNA or promoting its relocalization to the plasma membrane by activating Gα q resulted in the formation of particles containing these stress granule–associated proteins. Our studies showed that the composition of these particles resembled those formed under osmotic stress and were distinct from those formed in response to other types of stress. Our results fit a simple thermodynamic model in which cytosolic PLCβ1 solubilizes stress granule proteins such that its movement to activated Gα q releases these proteins to enable the formation of stress granules. Together, our data suggest a link between Gα q -coupled signals and protein translation through stress granule formation.},

Inflammatory Ly6C hi monocytes accumulate in mouse hearts after pressure overload and are detrimental to the heart; however, the types of cells that drive inflammatory cell recruitment remain uncertain. Here, we showed that a distinct subset of mouse cardiac fibroblasts became activated by pressure overload and recruited Ly6C hi monocytes to the heart. Single-cell sequencing analysis revealed that a subset of cardiac fibroblasts highly expressed genes transcriptionally activated by the transcription factor NF-κB, as well as C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 ( Ccl2 ) mRNA, which encodes a major factor in Ly6C hi monocyte recruitment. The deletion of the NF-κB activator IKKβ in activated cardiac fibroblasts attenuated Ly6C hi monocyte recruitment and preserved cardiac function in mice subjected to pressure overload. Pseudotime analysis indicated two single-branch trajectories from quiescent fibroblasts into inflammatory fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying cardiac inflammation and fibroblast-mediated inflammatory responses that could be therapeutically targeted to treat heart failure.},

We found that in the presence of cleaved p120-RasGAP, CD200R lost its capacity to inhibit phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein (rpS6), suggesting the reduced activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Furthermore, treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with interferon-α (IFN-α) resulted in increased amounts of cleaved p120-RasGAP. Upon pretreatment of cells with increasing concentrations of IFN-α, CD200R switched from inhibiting to potentiating the TLR7- and TLR8-induced expression of the gene encoding IFN-γ, a cytokine that is important for innate and adaptive immunity and is implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. PBMC from patients with SLE, a prototypic type I IFN disease, had an increased abundance of cleaved p120-RasGAP compared to that in cells from healthy controls. In a subset of SLE patients, CD200R stopped functioning as an inhibitory receptor or potentiated TLR-induced IFNG mRNA expression. Thus, our data suggest that type I IFN rewires CD200R signaling to be proinflammatory, which could contribute to the perpetuation of inflammation in patients with SLE.},

We identified ~1500 PGE 2 -regulated phosphosites and several important EP 1–4 signaling nodes, including PKC, CK2, PKA, PI3K, and Src. T cell subtypes exhibited distinct signaling pathways, with the strongest signaling in EP 2 -stimulated CD8 + cells. EP 2 and EP 4 , both of which signal through G αs , induced similar signaling outputs, but with distinct kinetics and intensity. Functional predictions from the observed phosphosite changes revealed PGE 2 regulation of key cellular and immunological processes. Last, network modeling suggested signal integration between the receptors and a substantial contribution from G protein–independent signaling. This study offers a comprehensive view of the different PGE 2 -regulated phosphoproteomes in T cell subsets, providing a valuable resource for further research on this physiologically and pathophysiologically important signaling system.},

Activation of the PTHR by PTH induces both transient cell surface and sustained endosomal cAMP production. To address whether the spatial (location) or temporal (duration) dimension of PTHR-induced cAMP encodes distinct biological outcomes, we engineered a biased PTHR ligand (PTH 7d ) that elicits cAMP production at the plasma membrane but not at endosomes. PTH 7d stabilized a unique active PTHR conformation that mediated sustained cAMP signaling at the plasma membrane due to impaired β-arrestin coupling to the receptor. Experiments in cells and mice revealed that sustained cAMP production by cell surface PTHR failed to mimic the pharmacological effects of sustained endosomal cAMP production on the abundance of the rate-limiting hydroxylase catalyzing the formation of active vitamin D, as well as increases in circulating active vitamin D and Ca 2+ and in bone formation in mice. Thus, similar amounts of cAMP generated by PTHR for similar lengths of time in different cellular locations, plasma membrane and endosomes, mediate distinct physiological responses. These results unveil subcellular signaling location as a means to achieve specificity in PTHR-mediated biological outcomes and raise the prospect of rational drug design based upon spatiotemporal manipulation of GPCR signaling.},

We applied untargeted metabolomics to detect metabolite signatures in cecal, colonic, and fecal samples from healthy and colitic mice and to uncover differences that would aid in the identification of colitis-associated metabolic processes. We provided an unbiased spatial survey of the GI tract for small molecules, and we identified the likely source of metabolites and biotransformations. Several prioritized metabolites that we detected as being altered in colitis were evaluated for their ability to induce inflammatory signaling in cultured macrophages, such as NF-κB signaling and the expression of cytokines and chemokines upon LPS stimulation. Multiple previously uncharacterized anti-inflammatory and inflammation-augmenting metabolites were thus identified, with phytosphingosine showing the most effective anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. We further demonstrated that oral administration of phytosphingosine decreased inflammation in a mouse model of colitis induced by the compound TNBS. The collection of distinct metabolites we identified and characterized, many of which have not been previously associated with colitis, may offer new biological insight into IBD-associated inflammation and disease pathogenesis.},

WFS1 and CISD2 belong to different protein families with distinct properties. Despite differences between WFS1 and CISD2, loss-of-function mutations in these proteins result in similar disease phenotypes, suggesting that they have convergent roles. WFS1 and CISD2 both localize at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the main intracellular calcium (Ca 2+ ) store, which is implicated in several diseases, including WS. Here, we not only review the roles of WFS1 and CISD2 in Ca 2+ signaling modulation but also point out knowledge gaps. Because WFS1 and CISD2 form complexes with Ca 2+ transporters and Ca 2+ channels, it is thought that they influence the activity of these transport systems in cells. Together, the studies reviewed here provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis and the severe disease burden of WS and may contribute to the development of therapeutics.},

  abstract     = {The cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 bind to their shared receptor subunit IL-4Rα to direct the alternative activation of macrophages to promote immunosuppression and wound healing. Activated IL-4 and IL-13 receptors recruit the tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, which dephosphorylate and inhibit the IL-4Rα subunit. Here, we report that the immunoreceptor SIRPα spatially restricted SHP-2 to promote IL-4 and IL-13 signaling and the alternative activation of macrophages. This effect required the cytoplasmic ITIMs or ITSMs of SIRPα, which underwent tyrosine phosphorylation by Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk) that was activated in response to IL-4 and IL-13. This phosphorylation event resulted in the recruitment of SHP-2 to SIRPα and prevented it from binding to and inhibiting IL-4R and IL-13R. Binding of the ligand CD47 to the SIRPα extracellular domain promoted the Btk-mediated phosphorylation of the SIRPα cytoplasmic domain and hence SHP-2 sequestration. Conversely, loss of SIRPα enabled SHP-2 to bind to the γC and IL-13Rα1 subunits of IL-4R and IL-13R, respectively, and dephosphorylate IL-4Rα, dampening its signaling. Impaired wound healing in Sirpα −/− mice with experimental colitis correlated with a deficit of immunosuppressive macrophages in the colon, a condition that was corrected by transfusion of ex vivo–produced, alternatively activated SIRPα high macrophages. These studies reveal a previously unappreciated role for SIRPα in promoting IL-4 and IL-13 signaling and reveal the mechanistic basis by which SIRPα enhances the alternative activation of macrophages.},

Here, we established that NF-κB signaling in articular chondrocytes increased with age, concomitant with the onset of spontaneous OA in wild-type mice. Chondrocyte-specific expression of a constitutively active form of inhibitor of κB kinase β (IKKβ) in young adult mice accelerated the onset of the OA-like phenotype observed in aging wild-type mice, including degenerative changes in the articular cartilage, synovium, and menisci. Both in vitro and in vivo, chondrocytes expressing activated IKKβ had a proinflammatory secretory phenotype characterized by markers typically associated with the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Expression of these factors was differentially regulated by p65, which contains a transactivation domain, and p50, which does not. Whereas the loss of p65 blocked the induction of genes encoding SASP factors in chondrogenic cells treated with interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in vitro, the loss of p50 enhanced the IL-1β–induced expression of some SASP factors. The loss of p50 further exacerbated cartilage degeneration in mice with chondrocyte-specific IKKβ activation. Overall, our data reveal that IKKβ-mediated activation of p65 can promote OA onset and that p50 may limit cartilage degeneration in settings of joint inflammation including advanced age.},

  abstract     = {Rapamycin extends maximal life span and increases resistance to starvation in many organisms. The beneficial effects of rapamycin are thought to be mediated by its inhibitory effects on the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), although it only partially inhibits the kinase activity of mTORC1. Other mTOR kinase inhibitors have been developed, such as Torin-1, but these readily cross-react with mTORC2. Here, we report the distinct characteristics of a third-generation mTOR inhibitor called RapaLink1. We found that low doses of RapaLink1 inhibited the phosphorylation of all mTORC1 substrates tested, including those whose phosphorylation is sensitive or resistant to inhibition by rapamycin, without affecting mTORC2 activity even after prolonged treatment. Compared with rapamycin, RapaLink1 showed better efficacy for inhibiting mTORC1 and potently blocked cell proliferation and induced autophagy. Moreover, using RapaLink1, we demonstrated that mTORC1 and mTORC2 exerted differential effects on cell glycolysis and glucose uptake. Last, we found that RapaLink1 and rapamycin had opposing effects on starvation resistance in Drosophila . Consistent with the effects of RapaLink1, genetic blockade of mTORC1 activity made flies more sensitive to starvation, reflecting the complexity of the mTORC1 network that extends beyond effects that can be inhibited by rapamycin. These findings extend our understanding of mTOR biology and provide insights into some of the beneficial effects of rapamycin.},

  abstract     = {Bacterial type IV pili (T4P) contribute to virulence and can be rapidly extended and retracted to mediate twitching motility. T4P biogenesis, which is normally limited to the cell poles, is regulated by extracellular stimuli and internal signals such as cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP). The c-di-GMP–binding protein FimX interacts with the T4P assembly complex and, when intracellular c-di-GMP concentrations are low, assumes a unipolar localization and promotes T4P biogenesis. Here, we demonstrated that FimX formed a complex with the two-component system consisting of the histidine kinase PdeK and its downstream response regulator PdeR. This complex promoted T4P assembly in the phytopathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola and virulence in rice. PdeK and the c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase activity of PdeR were required for the unipolar localization of FimX, leading to T4P extension. High amounts of c-di-GMP reduced the affinity of FimX for PdeR in vitro, consistent with FimX promoting T4P extension only under conditions of low c-di-GMP. We propose that low intracellular amounts of c-di-GMP created by PdeR facilitate the recruitment of FimX to the leading pole of motile cells. Our findings indicate that the PdeK-PdeR two-component system connects environmental cues to second messenger turnover, resulting in a change in the intracellular concentration of c-di-GMP that promotes T4P biogenesis and virulence.},

  abstract     = {The SERINC (serine incorporator) proteins are host restriction factors that inhibit infection by HIV through their incorporation into virions. Here, we found that SERINC3 and SERINC5 exhibited additional antiviral activities by enhancing the expression of genes encoding type I interferons (IFNs) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. SERINC5 interacted with the outer mitochondrial membrane protein MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor protein TRAF6, resulting in MAVS aggregation and polyubiquitylation of TRAF6. Knockdown of SERINC5 in target cells increased single-round HIV-1 infectivity, as well as infection by recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) bearing VSV-G or Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoproteins. Infection by an endemic Asian strain of Zika virus (ZIKV), FSS13025, was also enhanced by SERINC5 knockdown, suggesting that SERINC5 has direct antiviral activities in host cells in addition to the indirect inhibition mediated by its incorporation into virions. Further experiments suggested that the antiviral activity of SERINC5 was type I IFN–dependent. Together, these results highlight a previously uncharacterized function of SERINC proteins in promoting NF-κB inflammatory signaling and type I IFN production, thus contributing to its antiviral activities.},

Optical biosensors have been developed and optimized to monitor GPCR ligand–induced activation of G proteins, but these biosensors cannot be used to detect constitutively active GPCRs. Here, we designed and validated eight bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)–based G protein sensors that can measure the activity of all four major families of G proteins. We also established a protocol to identify constitutive GPCR or G protein signaling in live cells. These G protein–based, tricistronic activity sensors (G-CASE) rely on the encoding of all three G protein subunits by a single plasmid, enabling their expression at the desired relative amounts and resulting in reduced signal variability in mammalian cells. We also present an experimental protocol to use the G-CASE sensor toolbox to quantify constitutive signaling of native and mutated GPCRs through these heterotrimeric transducers. This approach will help to characterize constitutively active GPCRs and their role in health and disease.},

We found that repeated subcutaneous injections of morphine in mice increased the abundance of the cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) primarily in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes and that of its receptor ST2 mainly in astrocytes. Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of IL-33 or ST2 in the spinal cord attenuated morphine-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance in mice, as did global knockout of either Il33 or St2 , which also reduced morphine-enhanced astroglial activation and excitatory synaptic transmission. Furthermore, a pathway mediated by tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and the kinase JNK in astrocytes was required for IL-33–mediated hyperalgesia and tolerance through promoting the production of the chemokine CXCL12 in the spinal cord. The findings suggest that targeting IL-33–ST2 signaling could enable opioids to produce sustained analgesic effects in chronic pain management.},

Here, we showed that CISH, a suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family member that is acutely induced by diverse cytokine stimuli in many tissues, was expressed constitutively in AMs in response to steady-state GM-CSF signaling. Cish deficiency led to the generation of foamy AMs and the accumulation of pulmonary surfactant. These phenotypic changes were associated with enhanced activation of STAT5, AKT, and ERK and increased expression of the gene encoding the transcription factor GATA2. RNA-seq analysis of Cish −/− AMs revealed a set of dysregulated immune and lipid-process modules, including the increased expression of genes enriched for GATA2-binding motifs. Last, Cish -deficient, bone marrow–derived macrophages showed increased Gata2 expression and accumulated more lipid upon incubation with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with Cish -sufficient cells. Thus, CISH is part of a feedback loop that constrains homeostatic cytokine signaling and Gata2 expression to maintain AM identity and function.},

  abstract     = {Vascular inflammation causes endothelial barrier disruption and tissue edema. Several inflammatory mediators act through G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), including protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), to elicit inflammatory responses. The activation of PAR1 by its ligand thrombin stimulates proinflammatory, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling that promotes endothelial barrier disruption. Through mass spectrometry phosphoproteomics, we identified heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), which exists as a large oligomer that binds to actin, as a promising candidate for the p38-mediated regulation of barrier integrity. Depletion of HSP27 by siRNA enhanced endothelial cell barrier permeability and slowed recovery after thrombin stimulation. We further showed that two effector kinases of p38 MAPK, MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and MAPKAPK3 (MK3), differentially phosphorylated HSP27 at Ser 15 , Ser 78 , and Ser 82 . Whereas inhibition of thrombin-stimulated p38 activation blocked HSP27 phosphorylation at all three sites, inhibition of MK2 reduced the phosphorylation of only Ser 15 and Ser 78 . Inhibition of both MK2 and MK3 was necessary to attenuate Ser 82 phosphorylation. Thrombin-stimulated p38-MK2-MK3 signaling induced HSP27 oligomer disassembly. However, a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of HSP27 exhibited defective oligomer disassembly and altered the dynamics of barrier recovery after thrombin stimulation. Moreover, blocking HSP27 oligomer reassembly with the small-molecule inhibitor J2 enhanced endothelial barrier permeability in vitro and vascular leakage in vivo in response to PAR1 activation. These studies reveal the distinct regulation of HSP27 phosphorylation and function induced by the GPCR-stimulated p38-MK2-MK3 signaling axis that controls the dynamics of endothelial barrier recovery in vitro and vascular leakage in vivo.},

  abstract     = {Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)–modified T cell therapy is effective in treating lymphomas, leukemias, and multiple myeloma in which the tumor cells express high amounts of target antigen. However, achieving durable remission for these hematological malignancies and extending CAR T cell therapy to patients with solid tumors will require receptors that can recognize and eliminate tumor cells with a low density of target antigen. Although CARs were designed to mimic T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, TCRs are at least 100-fold more sensitive to antigen. To design a CAR with improved antigen sensitivity, we directly compared TCR and CAR signaling in primary human T cells. Global phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that key T cell signaling proteins—such as CD3δ, CD3ε, and CD3γ, which comprise a portion of the T cell co-receptor, as well as the TCR adaptor protein LAT—were either not phosphorylated or were only weakly phosphorylated by CAR stimulation. Modifying a commonplace 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR sequence to better engage CD3ε and LAT using embedded CD3ε or GRB2 domains resulted in enhanced T cell activation in vitro in settings of a low density of antigen, and improved efficacy in in vivo models of lymphoma, leukemia, and breast cancer. These CARs represent examples of alterations in receptor design that were guided by in-depth interrogation of T cell signaling.},

  abstract     = {Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a live, attenuated human smallpox vaccine and a vector for the development of new vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer. Efficient activation of the immune system by MVA partially relies on its encounter with dendritic cells (DCs). MVA infection of DCs leads to multiple outcomes, including cytokine production, activation of costimulatory molecules for T cell stimulation, and cell death. Here, we examined how these diverse responses are orchestrated in human DCs. Single-cell analyses revealed that the response to MVA infection in DCs was limited to early viral gene expression. In response to the early events in the viral cycle, we found that DCs grouped into three distinct clusters. A cluster of infected cells sensed the MVA genome by the intracellular innate immunity pathway mediated by cGAS, STING, TBK1, and IRF3 and subsequently produced inflammatory cytokines. In response to these cytokines, a cluster of noninfected bystander cells increased costimulatory molecule expression. A separate cluster of infected cells underwent caspase-dependent apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis persisted after inhibition of innate immunity pathway mediators independently of previously described IRF-dependent or replication-dependent pathways and was a response to early MVA gene expression. Together, our study identified multiple mechanisms that underlie the interactions of MVA with human DCs.},

Despite the growing incidence of fibrotic diseases and extensive research efforts, there remains a lack of effective therapies that improve survival. The application of omics technologies has revolutionized our approach to identifying previously unknown therapeutic targets and potential disease biomarkers. The application of metabolomics, in particular, has improved our understanding of disease pathomechanisms and garnered a wave of scientific interest in the role of metabolism in the biology of myofibroblasts, the key effector cells of the fibrogenic response. Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in metabolism not only are a feature of but also may play an influential role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis, most notably in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most rapidly progressive and fatal of all fibrotic conditions. This review will detail the role of key metabolic pathways, their alterations in myofibroblasts, and the potential this new knowledge offers for the development of antifibrotic therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract     = {The pleiotropic chemokine CXCL12 is involved in diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes, including embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, leukocyte migration, and tumor metastasis. It is known to engage the classical receptor CXCR4 and the atypical receptor ACKR3. Differential receptor engagement can transduce distinct cellular signals and effects as well as alter the amount of free, extracellular chemokine. CXCR4 binds both monomeric and the more commonly found dimeric forms of CXCL12, whereas ACKR3 binds monomeric forms. Here, we found that CXCL12 also bound to the atypical receptor ACKR1 (previously known as Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines or DARC). In vitro nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that dimeric CXCL12 bound to the extracellular N terminus of ACKR1 with low nanomolar affinity, whereas the binding affinity of monomeric CXCL12 was orders of magnitude lower. In transfected MDCK cells and primary human Duffy-positive erythrocytes, a dimeric, but not a monomeric, construct of CXCL12 efficiently bound to and internalized with ACKR1. This interaction between CXCL12 and ACKR1 provides another layer of regulation of the multiple biological functions of CXCL12. The findings also raise the possibility that ACKR1 can bind other dimeric chemokines, thus potentially further expanding the role of ACKR1 in chemokine retention and presentation.},

  abstract     = {The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) signals through three mechanisms called classic signaling, trans-signaling, and trans-presentation. IL-6 trans-signaling is distinctly mediated through a soluble form of its transmembrane receptor IL-6R (sIL-6R) and the coreceptor gp130 and is implicated in multiple autoimmune diseases. Although a soluble form of gp130 (sgp130) inhibits only IL-6 trans-signaling, it also blocks an analogous trans-signaling mechanism of IL-11 and its soluble receptor sIL-11R. Here, we report miniaturized chimeric soluble gp130 variants that efficiently trap IL-6:sIL-6R but not IL-11:sIL-11R complexes. We designed a novel IL-6 trans-signaling trap by fusing a miniaturized sgp130 variant to an IL-6:sIL-6R complex–binding nanobody and the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG). This trap, called cs-130Fc, exhibited improved inhibition of as well as increased selectivity for IL-6 trans-signaling compared to the conventional fusion protein sgp130Fc. We introduced affinity-enhancing mutations in cs-130Fc and sgp130Fc that further improved selectivity toward IL-6 trans-signaling. Moreover, cs-130Fc efficiently inhibited the expansion of T helper 17 (T H 17) cells in cultures of mouse CD4 + T cells treated with IL-6:sIL-6R. Thus, these variants may provide or lead to the development of more precisely targeted therapeutics for inflammatory disorders associated with IL-6 trans-signaling.},

In Arabidopsis thaliana , GPCRs are not required for G protein–coupled signaling because the heterotrimeric G protein complex spontaneously exchanges nucleotide. Instead, the seven-transmembrane protein AtRGS1 modulates G protein signaling through ligand-dependent endocytosis, which initiates derepression of signaling without the involvement of canonical arrestins. Here, we found that endocytosis of AtRGS1 initiated from two separate pools of plasma membrane: sterol-dependent domains and a clathrin-accessible neighborhood, each with a select set of discriminators, activators, and candidate arrestin-like adaptors. Ligand identity (either the pathogen-associated molecular pattern flg22 or the sugar glucose) determined the origin of AtRGS1 endocytosis. Different trafficking origins and trajectories led to different cellular outcomes. Thus, in this system, compartmentation with its associated signalosome architecture drives biased signaling.},

PTEN is an intracellular brake that inhibits the downstream effects of the activation of VEGFR3 by VEGF-C. Activation of Cre-lox recombination in adult mice resulted in an expanded functional lymphatic network due to LEC proliferation that was independent of lymphangiogenic growth factor production. Furthermore, compared with lymphangiogenesis induced by VEGF-C injection, LEC PTEN animals had mature, nonleaky lymphatics with intact cell-cell junctions and reduced local tissue inflammation. Last, compared with wild-type or VEGF-C–injected mice, LEC PTEN animals had an improved capacity to resolve inflammatory responses. Our findings indicate that intracellular modulation of lymphangiogenesis is effective in inducing functional lymphatic networks and has no off-target inflammatory effects.},

Cytosolic LPS recognition in macrophages is preceded by a Toll-like receptor (TLR) priming signal required to induce transcription of inflammasome components and facilitate the metabolic reprograming that fuels the inflammatory response. Using a genome-scale arrayed siRNA screen to find inflammasome regulators in mouse macrophages, we identified the mitochondrial enzyme nucleoside diphosphate kinase D (NDPK-D) as a regulator of both noncanonical and canonical inflammasomes. NDPK-D was required for both mitochondrial DNA synthesis and cardiolipin exposure on the mitochondrial surface in response to inflammasome priming signals mediated by TLRs, and macrophages deficient in NDPK-D had multiple defects in LPS-induced inflammasome activation. In addition, NDPK-D was required for the recruitment of TNF receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6) to mitochondria, which was critical for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the metabolic reprogramming that supported the TLR-induced gene program. NDPK-D knockout mice were protected from LPS-induced shock, consistent with decreased ROS production and attenuated glycolytic commitment during priming. Our findings suggest that, in response to microbial challenge, NDPK-D–dependent TRAF6 mitochondrial recruitment triggers an energetic fitness checkpoint required to engage and maintain the transcriptional program necessary for inflammasome activation.},

  abstract     = {G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are implicated in the regulation of fear and anxiety. GPCR signaling involves canonical G protein pathways but can also engage downstream kinases and effectors through scaffolding interactions mediated by β-arrestin. Here, we investigated whether β-arrestin signaling regulates anxiety-like and fear-related behavior in mice in response to activation of the GPCR δ-opioid receptor (δOR or DOR). Administration of β-arrestin–biased δOR agonists to male C57BL/6 mice revealed β-arrestin 2–dependent activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in the dorsal hippocampus and amygdala and β-arrestin 1–dependent activation of ERK1/2 in the nucleus accumbens. In mice, β-arrestin–biased agonist treatment was associated with reduced anxiety-like and fear-related behaviors, with some overlapping and isoform-specific input. In contrast, applying a G protein–biased δOR agonist decreased ERK1/2 activity in all three regions as well as the dorsal striatum and was associated with increased fear-related behavior without effects on baseline anxiety. Our results indicate a complex picture of δOR neuromodulation in which β-arrestin 1– and 2–dependent ERK signaling in specific brain subregions suppresses behaviors associated with anxiety and fear and opposes the effects of G protein–biased signaling. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of noncanonical β-arrestin–dependent GPCR signaling in the regulation of these interrelated emotions.},

  abstract     = {Mutations in the kinase LRRK2 and impaired endocytic trafficking are both implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Expression of the PD-associated LRRK2 mutant in mouse dopaminergic neurons was shown to disrupt clathrin-mediated endocytic trafficking. Here, we explored the molecular mechanism linking LRRK2 to endocytosis and found that LRRK2 bound to and phosphorylated the μ2 subunit of the adaptor protein AP2 (AP2M1), a core component of the clathrin-mediated endocytic machinery. Analysis of human SH-SY5Y cells and mouse neurons and tissues revealed that loss of LRRK2 abundance or kinase function resulted in decreased phosphorylation of AP2M1, which is required for the initial formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). In contrast, overexpression of LRRK2 or expression of a Parkinson’s disease–associated gain-of-function mutant LRRK2 (G2019S) inhibited the uncoating of AP2M1 from CCVs at later stages and prevented new cycles of CCV formation. Thus, the abundance and activity of LRRK2 must be calibrated to ensure proper endocytosis. Dysregulated phosphorylation of AP2M1 from the brain but not thyroid tissues of LRRK2 knockout and G2019S-knockin mice suggests a tissue-specific regulatory mechanism of endocytosis. Furthermore, we found that LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of AP2M1 mediated dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of PD. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic link between LRRK2, AP2, and endocytosis in the pathogenesis of PD.},

This gene encodes regulator of G protein signaling 10 (RGS10), a member of a large family of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that targets heterotrimeric G proteins to constrain the activity of G protein–coupled receptors, including receptors for chemoattractants. The affected individuals exhibited systemic abnormalities directly related to the RGS10 mutations, including recurrent infections, hypergammaglobulinemia, profoundly reduced lymphocyte chemotaxis, abnormal lymph node architecture, and short stature due to growth hormone deficiency. Although the GAP activity of each RGS10 variant was intact, each protein exhibited aberrant patterns of PKA-mediated phosphorylation and increased cytosolic and cell membrane localization and activity compared to the wild-type protein. We propose that the RGS10 p.E163del and p.A171S mutations lead to mislocalization of the RGS10 protein in the cytosol, thereby resulting in attenuated chemokine signaling. This study suggests that RGS10 is critical for both immune competence and normal hormonal metabolism in humans and that rare RGS10 variants may contribute to distinct systemic genetic disorders.},

  abstract     = {Cellular adaptation to low-oxygen environments is mediated in part by the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Like other transcription factors, the stability and transcriptional activity of HIFs—and consequently, the hypoxic response—are regulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) and changes in protein-protein interactions. Our current understanding of PTM-mediated regulation of HIFs is primarily based on in vitro protein fragment–based studies typically validated in fragment-expressing cells treated with hypoxia-mimicking compounds. Here, we used immunoprecipitation-based mass spectrometry to characterize the PTMs and binding partners for full-length HIF-1α and HIF-2α under normoxic (21\% oxygen) and hypoxic (1\% oxygen) conditions. Hypoxia substantially altered the complexity and composition of the HIFα protein interaction networks, particularly for HIF-2α, with the hypoxic networks of both isoforms being enriched for mitochondrial proteins. Moreover, both HIFα isoforms were heavily covalently modified. We identified ~40 PTM sites composed of 13 different types of modification on both HIFα isoforms, including multiple cysteine modifications and an unusual phosphocysteine. More than 80\% of the PTMs identified were not previously known and about half exhibited oxygen dependency. We further characterized an evolutionarily conserved phosphorylation of Ser 31 in HIF-1α as a regulator of its transcriptional function, and we propose functional roles for Thr 406 , Thr 528 , and Ser 581 in HIF-2α. These data will help to delineate the different physiological roles of these closely related isoforms in fine-tuning the hypoxic response.},

  abstract     = {Murine γδ 17 cells, which are T cells that bear the γδ T cell receptor (TCRγδ) and secrete interleukin-17A (IL-17A), are generated in the thymus and are critical for various immune responses. Although strong TCRγδ signals are required for the development of interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–secreting γδ cells (γδ IFN cells), the generation of γδ 17 cells requires weaker TCRγδ signaling. Here, we demonstrated that constrained activation of the kinase Syk downstream of TCRγδ was required for the thymic development of γδ 17 cells. Increasing or decreasing Syk activity by stimulating TCRγδ or inhibiting Syk, respectively, substantially reduced γδ 17 cell numbers. This delimited Syk activity optimally engaged the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt signaling pathway, which maintained the expression of master regulators of the IL-17 program, RORγt and c-Maf. Inhibition of PI3K not only abrogated γδ 17 cell development but also augmented the development of a distinct, previously undescribed subset of γδ T cells. These CD8 + Ly6a + γδ T cells had a type-I IFN gene expression signature and expanded in response to stimulation with IFN-β. Collectively, these studies elucidate how weaker TCRγδ signaling engages distinct signaling pathways to specify the γδ 17 cell fate and identifies a role for type-I IFNs in γδ T cell development.},

We found that the phosphorylation of isoform-specific sites in eEF1A2—an essential translation elongation factor in neurons—is a key modulator of structural plasticity in dendritic spines. Expression of a nonphosphorylatable eEF1A2 mutant stimulated mRNA translation but reduced actin dynamics and spine density. By contrast, a phosphomimetic eEF1A2 mutant exhibited decreased association with F-actin and was inactive as a translation elongation factor. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling triggered transient dissociation of eEF1A2 from its regulatory guanine exchange factor (GEF) protein in dendritic spines in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.

Precise control of IFN responses is critical because insufficient expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) can lead to a failure to restrict viral spread, whereas excessive ISG activation can result in IFN-related pathologies. Although both positive and negative regulatory factors control the magnitude and duration of IFN signaling, it is also appreciated that several ISGs regulate aspects of the IFN response themselves. In this study, we performed a CRISPR activation screen to identify previously unknown regulators of the type I IFN response. We identified the strongly induced ISG encoding ETS variant transcription factor 7 (ETV7) as a negative regulator of the type I IFN response. However, ETV7 did not uniformly suppress ISG transcription. Instead, ETV7 preferentially targeted a subset of antiviral ISGs that were particularly important for IFN-mediated control of influenza viruses. Together, our data assign a function for ETV7 as an IFN response regulator and also identify ETV7 as a potential therapeutic target to increase innate antiviral responses and enhance IFN-based antiviral therapies.},

Because immune responses are, in part, regulated by metabolites, we examined the serum metabolomes of COVID-19 patients. In male patients, kynurenic acid (KA) and a high KA–to–kynurenine (K) ratio (KA:K) positively correlated with age and with inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and negatively correlated with T cell responses. Males that clinically deteriorated had a higher KA:K than those that stabilized. KA inhibits glutamate release, and glutamate abundance was lower in patients that clinically deteriorated and correlated with immune responses. Analysis of data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project revealed that the expression of the gene encoding the enzyme that produces KA, kynurenine aminotransferase, correlated with cytokine abundance and activation of immune responses in older males. This study reveals that KA has a sex-specific link to immune responses and clinical outcomes in COVID-19, suggesting a positive feedback between metabolites and immune responses in males.},

In addition to being a source of energy, polyPs have cytoprotective and antiviral activities. Here, we investigated the antiviral activities of long-chain polyPs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In molecular docking analyses, polyPs interacted with several conserved amino acid residues in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host receptor that facilitates virus entry, and in viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). ELISA and limited proteolysis assays using nano– LC-MS/MS mapped polyP120 binding to ACE2, and site-directed mutagenesis confirmed interactions between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and identified the specific amino acid residues involved. PolyP120 enhanced the proteasomal degradation of both ACE2 and RdRp, thus impairing replication of the British B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. We thus tested polyPs for functional interactions with the virus in SARS-CoV-2–infected Vero E6 and Caco2 cells and in primary human nasal epithelial cells. Delivery of a nebulized form of polyP120 reduced the amounts of viral positive-sense genomic and subgenomic RNAs, of RNA transcripts encoding proinflammatory cytokines, and of viral structural proteins, thereby presenting SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells in vitro.},

  abstract     = {Capping of viral messenger RNAs is essential for efficient translation, for virus replication, and for preventing detection by the host cell innate response system. The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes the 2′- O -methyltransferase nsp16, which, when bound to the coactivator nsp10, uses S -adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a donor to transfer a methyl group to the first ribonucleotide of the mRNA in the final step of viral mRNA capping. Here, we provide biochemical and structural evidence that this reaction requires divalent cations, preferably Mn 2+ , and a coronavirus-specific four-residue insert. We determined the x-ray structures of the SARS-CoV-2 2′- O -methyltransferase (the nsp16-nsp10 heterodimer) in complex with its reaction substrates, products, and divalent metal cations. These structural snapshots revealed that metal ions and the insert stabilize interactions between the capped RNA and nsp16, resulting in the precise alignment of the ribonucleotides in the active site. Comparison of available structures of 2′- O -methyltransferases with capped RNAs from different organisms revealed that the four-residue insert unique to coronavirus nsp16 alters the backbone conformation of the capped RNA in the binding groove, thereby promoting catalysis. This insert is highly conserved across coronaviruses, and its absence in mammalian methyltransferases makes this region a promising site for structure-guided drug design of selective coronavirus inhibitors.},

Telomeres are extended by either the enzyme telomerase or the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we found that the telomere-associated protein SLX4IP dictates telomere proteome composition by recruiting and activating the E3 SUMO ligase PIAS1 to the SLX4 complex. PIAS1 SUMOylated the telomere-binding protein RAP1, which disrupted its interaction with the telomere-binding protein TRF2 and facilitated its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In the cytosol, RAP1 bound to IκB kinase (IKK), resulting in activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and its induction of Jagged-1 expression, which promoted Notch signaling and the institution of ALT. This axis could be targeted therapeutically in ALT-driven cancers and in tumor cells that develop resistance to antitelomerase therapies. Our results illuminate the mechanisms underlying SLX4IP-dependent telomere plasticity and demonstrate the role of telomere proteins in directly coordinating intracellular signaling and telomere maintenance dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Unlike early transcriptional responses to mitogens, later events are less well-characterized. Here, we identified delayed down-regulated genes (DDGs) in mammary cells after prolonged treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF). The expression of these DDGs was low in mammary tumors and correlated with prognosis. The proteins encoded by several DDGs directly bind to and inactivate oncoproteins and might therefore act as tumor suppressors. The transcription factor teashirt zinc finger homeobox 2 (TSHZ2) is encoded by a DDG, and we found that overexpression of TSHZ2 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis and accelerated mammary gland development in mice. Although the gene TSHZ2 localizes to a locus (20q13.2) that is frequently amplified in breast cancer, we found that hypermethylation of its promoter correlated with down-regulation of TSHZ2 expression in patients. Yeast two-hybrid screens and protein-fragment complementation assays in mammalian cells indicated that TSHZ2 nucleated a multiprotein complex containing PRC1/Ase1, cyclin B1, and additional proteins that regulate cytokinesis. TSHZ2 increased the inhibitory phosphorylation of PRC1, a key driver of mitosis, mediated by cyclin-dependent kinases. Furthermore, similar to the tumor suppressive transcription factor p53, TSHZ2 inhibited transcription from the PRC1 promoter. By recognizing DDGs as a distinct group in the transcriptional response to EGF, our findings uncover a group of tumor suppressors and reveal a role for TSHZ2 in cell cycle regulation.},

Emerging evidence suggests that the N-terminal tails of G protein γ subunits, which are essential components of heterotrimeric G proteins, are intrinsically disordered, phosphorylation-dependent determinants of G protein signaling. Here, we found that the yeast Gγ subunit Ste18 underwent combinatorial, multisite phosphorylation events within its N-terminal IDR. G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) activation and osmotic stress induced phosphorylation at Ser 7 , whereas glucose and acid stress induced phosphorylation at Ser 3 , which was a quantitative indicator of intracellular pH. Each site was phosphorylated by a distinct set of kinases, and phosphorylation of one site affected phosphorylation of the other, as determined through exposure to serial stimuli and through phosphosite mutagenesis. Last, we showed that phosphorylation resulted in changes in IDR structure and that different combinations of phosphorylation events modulated the activation rate and amplitude of the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase Fus3. These data place Gγ subunits among intrinsically disordered proteins that undergo combinatorial posttranslational modifications that govern signaling pathway output.},

  abstract     = {In the adult liver, a population of facultative progenitor cells called biliary epithelial cells (BECs) proliferate and differentiate into cholangiocytes and hepatocytes after injury, thereby restoring liver function. In mammalian models of chronic liver injury, Notch signaling is essential for bile duct formation from these cells. However, the continual proliferation of BECs and differentiation of hepatocytes in these models have limited their use for determining whether Notch signaling is required for BECs to replenish hepatocytes after injury in the mammalian liver. Here, we used a temporally restricted model of hepatic repair in which large-scale hepatocyte injury and regeneration are initiated through the acute loss of Mdm2 in hepatocytes, resulting in the rapid, coordinated proliferation of BECs. We found that transient, early activation of Notch1- and Notch3-mediated signaling and entrance into the cell cycle preceded the phenotypic expansion of BECs into hepatocytes. Notch inhibition reduced BEC proliferation, which resulted in failure of BECs to differentiate into hepatocytes, indicating that Notch-dependent expansion of BECs is essential for hepatocyte regeneration. Notch signaling increased the abundance of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) in BECs, and activating IGFR signaling increased BEC numbers but suppressed BEC differentiation into hepatocytes. These results suggest that different signaling mechanisms control BEC expansion and hepatocyte differentiation.},

  abstract     = {Many viral proteases mediate the evasion of antiviral innate immunity by cleaving adapter proteins in the interferon (IFN) induction pathway. Host proteases are also involved in innate immunity and inflammation. Here, we report that the transmembrane protease hepsin (also known as TMPRSS1), which is predominantly present in hepatocytes, inhibited the induction of type I IFN during viral infections. Knocking out hepsin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) increased the viral infection–induced expression of Ifnb1 , an Ifnb1 promoter reporter, and an IFN-sensitive response element promoter reporter. Ectopic expression of hepsin in cultured human hepatocytes and HEK293T cells suppressed the induction of IFNβ during viral infections by reducing the abundance of STING. These effects depended on the protease activity of hepsin. We identified a putative hepsin target site in STING and showed that mutating this site protected STING from hepsin-mediated cleavage. In addition to hepatocytes, several hepsin-producing prostate cancer cell lines showed reduced STING-mediated type I IFN induction and responses. These results reveal a role for hepsin in suppressing STING-mediated type I IFN induction, which may contribute to the vulnerability of hepatocytes to chronic viral infections.},

Here, we examined the upstream signaling pathways that control Tim-3–mediated increases in phosphorylated S6 in T cells. We also defined the localization of Tim-3 relative to the T cell immune synapse and its effects on downstream signaling. Recruitment of Tim-3 to the immune synapse was mediated exclusively by the transmembrane domain, replacement of which impaired the ability of Tim-3 to costimulate T cell receptor (TCR)–dependent S6 phosphorylation. Furthermore, enforced localization of the Tim-3 cytoplasmic domain to the immune synapse in a chimeric antigen receptor still enabled T cell activation. Together, our findings are consistent with a model whereby Tim-3 enhances TCR-proximal signaling under acute conditions.},

  abstract     = {Integrin activation by the intracellular adaptor proteins talin1 and kindlin-3 is essential for lymphocyte adhesion. These adaptors cooperatively control integrin activation through bidirectional (inside-out and outside-in) activation signals. Using single-molecule measurements, we revealed the distinct dynamics of talin1 and kindlin-3 interactions with the integrin LFA1 (αLβ2) and their functions in LFA1 activation and LFA1-mediated adhesion. The kinetics of talin1 binding to the tail of the β2 subunit corresponded to those of LFA1 binding to its ligand ICAM1. ICAM1 binding induced transient interactions between the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic region of the β2 subunit with an N-terminal domain of kindlin-3, leading to disruption of the association between the integrin subunits (the α/β clasp) and unbending of the ectodomains of the α/β heterodimer. These conformational changes promoted high-affinity talin1 binding to the β2 tail that required the talin rod domain and the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Inside-out signaling induced by the GTPase Rap1 did not markedly stabilize the binding of talin1 and kindlin-3 to LFA1. In contrast, ligand-induced outside-in signaling, the stabilization of open LFA1 conformers, or shear force substantially altered the dynamics of talin1 and kindlin-3 association with LFA1 and enhanced both Rap1 and LFA1 activation. In migrating lymphocytes, asymmetrical distribution of talin1 and kindlin-3 correlated with the maturation of LFA1 from a low-affinity conformation at the leading edge to a high-affinity conformation in the adherent mid-body. Our results suggest that kindlin-3 spatiotemporally mediates a positive feedback circuit of LFA1 activation to control dynamic adhesion and migration of lymphocytes.},

  abstract     = {Cancer cells have differential metabolic dependencies compared to their nonmalignant counterparts. However, few metabolism-targeting compounds have been successful in clinical trials. Here, we investigated the metabolic vulnerabilities of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), particularly those metabolic perturbations that increased mitochondrial apoptotic priming and sensitivity to BH3 mimetics (drugs that antagonize antiapoptotic proteins). We used high-throughput dynamic BH3 profiling (HT-DBP) to screen a library of metabolism-perturbing small molecules, which revealed inhibitors of the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) as top candidates. In some TNBC cells but not in nonmalignant cells, NAMPT inhibitors increased overall apoptotic priming and induced dependencies on specific antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members. Treatment of TNBC cells with NAMPT inhibitors sensitized them to subsequent treatment with BH3 mimetics. The combination of a NAMPT inhibitor (FK866) and an MCL-1 antagonist (S63845) reduced tumor growth in a TNBC patient–derived xenograft model in vivo. We found that NAMPT inhibition reduced NAD + concentrations below a critical threshold that resulted in depletion of adenine, which was the metabolic trigger that primed TNBC cells for apoptosis. These findings demonstrate a close interaction between metabolic and mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathways and reveal that exploitation of a tumor-specific metabolic vulnerability can sensitize some TNBC to BH3 mimetics.},

  abstract     = {Pharmacologic agonism of the β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) induces bronchodilation by activating the enzyme adenylyl cyclase to generate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). β 2 AR agonists are generally the most effective strategy to relieve acute airway obstruction in asthmatic patients, but they are much less effective when airway obstruction in young patients is triggered by infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Here, we investigated the effects of RSV infection on the abundance and function of β 2 AR in primary human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) derived from pediatric lung tissue. We showed that RSV infection of HASMCs resulted in proteolytic cleavage of β 2 AR mediated by the proteasome. RSV infection also resulted in β 2 AR ligand–independent activation of adenylyl cyclase, leading to reduced cAMP synthesis compared to that in uninfected control cells. Last, RSV infection caused stronger airway smooth muscle cell contraction in vitro due to increased cytosolic Ca 2+ concentrations. Thus, our results suggest that RSV infection simultaneously induces loss of functional β 2 ARs and activation of multiple pathways favoring airway obstruction in young patients, with the net effect of counteracting β 2 AR agonist–induced bronchodilation. These findings not only provide a potential mechanism for the reported lack of clinical efficacy of β 2 AR agonists for treating virus-induced wheezing but also open the path to developing more precise therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract     = {The activation of Ras signaling is a major early event of oncogenesis in many contexts, yet paradoxically, Ras signaling induces cellular senescence, which prevents tumorigenesis. Thus, Ras-activated cells must overcome senescence to develop into cancer. Through a genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster , we found that the ETS family transcriptional activator Pointed (Pnt) was necessary and sufficient to trigger cellular senescence upon Ras activation and blocked Ras-induced tumor growth in eye-antennal discs. Through analyses of mosaic discs using various genetic tools, we identified a mechanism of tumor progression in which loss of cell polarity, a common driver of epithelial oncogenesis, abrogated Ras-induced cellular senescence through microRNA-mediated inhibition of Pnt. Mechanistically, polarity defects in Ras-activated cells caused activation of the Hippo effector Yorkie (Yki), which induced the expression of the microRNA bantam . bantam -mediated repression of the E3 ligase–associated protein Tribbles (Trbl) relieved Ras- and Akt-dependent inhibition of the transcription factor FoxO. The restoration of FoxO activity in Ras-activated cells induced the expression of the microRNAs miR-9c and miR-79 , which led to reduced pnt expression, thereby abrogating cellular senescence and promoting tumor progression. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how Ras-activated tumors progress toward malignancy by overcoming cellular senescence.},

  abstract     = {Immune synapses are large-scale, transient molecular assemblies that serve as platforms for antigen presentation to B and T cells and for target recognition by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The formation of an immune synapse is a tightly regulated, stepwise process in which the cytoskeleton, cell surface receptors, and intracellular signaling proteins rearrange into supramolecular activation clusters (SMACs). We generated artificial immune synapses (AIS) consisting of synthetic and natural ligands for the NK cell–activating receptors LFA-1 and CD16 by microcontact printing the ligands into circular-shaped SMAC structures. Live-cell imaging and analysis of fixed human NK cells in this reductionist system showed that the spatial distribution of activating ligands influenced the formation, stability, and outcome of NK cell synapses. Whereas engagement of LFA-1 alone promoted synapse initiation, combined engagement of LFA-1 and CD16 was required for the formation of mature synapses and degranulation. Organizing LFA-1 and CD16 ligands into donut-shaped AIS resulted in fewer long-lasting, symmetrical synapses compared to dot-shaped AIS. NK cells spreading evenly over either AIS shape exhibited similar arrangements of the lytic machinery. However, degranulation only occurred in regions containing ligands that therefore induced local signaling, suggesting the existence of a late checkpoint for degranulation. Our results demonstrate that the spatial organization of ligands in the synapse can affect its outcome, which could be exploited by target cells as an escape mechanism.},

Hac1 protein then activates an adaptive cellular stress response called the unfolded protein response (UPR) that maintains ER homeostasis. The polarity-inducing protein kinases Kin1 and Kin2 contribute to HAC1 mRNA processing. Here, we showed that an RNA-protein complex that included the endocytic proteins Pal1 and Pal2 mediated HAC1 mRNA splicing downstream of Kin1 and Kin2. We found that Pal1 and Pal2 bound to the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of HAC1 mRNA, and a yeast strain lacking both Pal1 and Pal2 was deficient in HAC1 mRNA processing. We also showed that Kin1 and Kin2 directly phosphorylated Pal2, and that a nonphosphorylatable Pal2 mutant could not rescue the UPR defect in a pal1 Δ pal2 Δ strain. Thus, our work uncovers a Kin1/2-Pal2 signaling pathway that coordinates HAC1 mRNA processing and ER homeostasis.},

The adipokine leptin is a satiety factor with neurotrophic actions, which potentiates both glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptogenesis in the hippocampus during neonatal development. Brief exposure to leptin enhances GABA A receptor–dependent synaptic currents in hippocampal neurons. Here, using molecular and electrophysiological techniques, we found that leptin increased the surface localization of GABA A receptors and the number of functional GABAergic synapses in hippocampal cultures from male and female rat pups. Leptin increased the interaction between GABA A receptors and the Rho guanine exchange factor β-PIX (a scaffolding protein at GABAergic postsynaptic sites) in a manner dependent on the kinase CaMKK. We also found that the leptin receptor and β-PIX formed a complex, the amount of which transiently increased upon leptin receptor activation. Furthermore, Tyr 985 in the leptin receptor and the SH3 domain of β-PIX are crucial for this interaction, which was required for the developmental increase in GABAergic synaptogenesis. Our results suggest a mechanism by which leptin promotes GABAergic synaptogenesis in hippocampal neurons and reveal further complexity in leptin receptor signaling and its interactome.},

  abstract     = {Growth factor–dependent vesicular dynamics allow cells to regulate the spatial distribution of growth factor receptors and thereby their coupling to downstream signaling effectors that guide cellular responses. We found that the ErbB ligands epidermal growth factor (EGF) and heregulin (HRG) generated distinct spatiotemporal patterns of cognate receptor activities to activate distinct subcellular pools of the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk). Sustained plasma membrane activity of the receptor tyrosine kinases ErbB2/ErbB3 signaled to Erk complexed with the scaffold protein KSR to promote promigratory EphA2 phosphorylation and cellular motility upon HRG stimulation. In contrast, receptor-saturating EGF stimuli caused proliferation-inducing transient activation of cytoplasmic Erk due to the rapid internalization of EGF receptors (EGFR or ErbB1) toward endosomes. Paradoxically, promigratory signaling mediated by Erk complexed to KSR was sustained at low EGF concentrations by vesicular recycling that maintained steady-state amounts of active, phosphorylated EGFR at the plasma membrane. Thus, the effect of ligand identity and concentration on determining ErbB vesicular dynamics constitutes a mechanism by which cells can transduce growth factor composition through spatially distinct Erk pools to enable functionally diverse cellular responses.},

We previously proposed a deterministic, gradient-sensing model that explains how yeast cells switch from the intrinsically positioned default polarity site (DS) to the gradient-aligned chemotropic site (CS) at the plasma membrane. Because phosphorylation of the mating-specific Gβ subunit is thought to be important for this process, we developed a biosensor that bound to phosphorylated but not unphosphorylated Gβ and monitored its spatiotemporal dynamics to test key predictions of our gradient-sensing model. In mating cells, the biosensor colocalized with both Gβ and receptor reporters at the DS and then tracked with them to the CS. The biosensor concentrated on the leading side of the tracking Gβ and receptor peaks and was the first to arrive and stop tracking at the CS. Our data showed that the concentrated localization of phosphorylated Gβ correlated with the tracking direction and final position of the G protein and receptor, consistent with the idea that gradient-regulated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Gβ contributes to gradient sensing. Cells expressing a nonphosphorylatable mutant form of Gβ exhibited defects in gradient tracking, orientation toward mating partners, and mating efficiency.},

By analyzing mice with B cell–specific deletion of Raf1 , Braf , or both, we showed that Raf-1 and B-Raf acted together in mediating the positive selection of pre-B and transitional B cells as well as in initiating plasma cell differentiation. However, genetic or chemical inactivation of RAFs led to increased ERK phosphorylation in mature B cells. ERK activation in the absence of Raf-1 and B-Raf was mediated by multiple RAF-independent pathways, with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) playing an important role. Furthermore, we found that ERK phosphorylation strongly increased during the transition from activated B cells to pre-plasmablasts. This increase in ERK phosphorylation did not occur in B cells lacking both Raf-1 and B-Raf, which most likely explains the partial block of plasma cell differentiation in mice lacking both RAFs. Collectively, our data indicate that B-Raf and Raf-1 are not necessary to mediate ERK phosphorylation in naïve or activated B cells but are essential for mediating the marked increase in ERK phosphorylation during the transition from activated B cells to pre-plasmablasts.},

  abstract     = {Neurons maintain stable levels of excitability using homeostatic synaptic scaling, which adjusts the strength of a neuron’s postsynaptic inputs to compensate for extended changes in overall activity. Here, we investigated whether prolonged changes in activity affect network-level protein interactions at the synapse. We assessed a glutamatergic synapse protein interaction network (PIN) composed of 380 binary associations among 21 protein members in mouse neurons. Manipulating the activation of cultured mouse cortical neurons induced widespread bidirectional PIN alterations that reflected rapid rearrangements of glutamate receptor associations involving synaptic scaffold remodeling. Sensory deprivation of the barrel cortex in live mice (by whisker trimming) caused specific PIN rearrangements, including changes in the association between the glutamate receptor mGluR5 and the kinase Fyn. These observations are consistent with emerging models of experience-dependent plasticity involving multiple types of homeostatic responses. However, mice lacking Homer1 or Shank3B did not undergo normal PIN rearrangements, suggesting that the proteins encoded by these autism spectrum disorder–linked genes serve as structural hubs for synaptic homeostasis. Our approach demonstrates how changes in the protein content of synapses during homeostatic plasticity translate into functional PIN alterations that mediate changes in neuron excitability.},

  abstract     = {The dual-specificity phosphatase PTEN functions as a tumor suppressor by hydrolyzing PI(3, 4, 5)P 3 to PI(4, 5)P 2 to inhibit PI3K-AKT signaling and cellular proliferation. P-Rex2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPases and can be activated by Gβγ subunits downstream of G protein–coupled receptor signaling and by PI(3, 4, 5)P 3 downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases. The PTEN:P-Rex2 complex is a commonly mutated signaling node in metastatic cancer. Assembly of the PTEN:P-Rex2 complex inhibits the activity of both proteins, and its dysregulation can drive PI3K-AKT signaling and cellular proliferation. Here, using cross-linking mass spectrometry and functional studies, we gained mechanistic insights into PTEN:P-Rex2 complex assembly and coinhibition. We found that PTEN was anchored to P-Rex2 by interactions between the PDZ-interacting motif in the PTEN C-terminal tail and the second PDZ domain of P-Rex2. This interaction bridged PTEN across the P-Rex2 surface, preventing PI(3, 4, 5)P 3 hydrolysis. Conversely, PTEN both allosterically promoted an autoinhibited conformation of P-Rex2 and blocked its binding to Gβγ. In addition, we observed that the PTEN-deactivating mutations and P-Rex2 truncations combined to drive Rac1 activation to a greater extent than did either single variant alone. These insights enabled us to propose a class of gain-of-function, cancer-associated mutations within the PTEN:P-Rex2 interface that uncouple PTEN from the inhibition of Rac1 signaling.},

Although the activation of inflammasomes leading to secretion of the cytokine IL-1β is typically accompanied by pyroptosis (an inflammatory form of lytic programmed cell death), some cells can survive and exist in a state of hyperactivation. Here, we found that the conventional type 2 DC (cDC2) subset is the major human DC subset that is transcriptionally and functionally poised for inflammasome formation and response without pyroptosis. When cDC2 were stimulated with ligands that relatively weakly activated the inflammasome, the cells did not enter pyroptosis but instead secreted IL-12 family cytokines and IL-1β. These cytokines induced prominent T helper type 1 (T H 1) and T H 17 responses that were superior to those seen in response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation alone or to stronger, classical inflammasome ligands. These findings not only define the human cDC2 subpopulation as a prime target for the treatment of inflammasome-dependent inflammatory diseases but may also inform new approaches for adjuvant and vaccine development.},

Given the redox regulation of virus-host interactions, the identification of oxidized cysteine sites in cells is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms involved. Here, we present a proteome-wide identification of reversibly oxidized cysteine sites in oxidant-treated cells using a maleimide-based bioswitch method coupled to mass spectrometry analysis. We identified 2720 unique oxidized cysteine sites within 1473 proteins with distinct abundances, locations, and functions. Oxidized cysteine sites were found in numerous signaling pathways, many relevant to virus-host interactions. We focused on the oxidation of STING, the central adaptor of the innate immune type I interferon pathway, which is stimulated in response to the detection of cytosolic DNA by cGAS. We demonstrated the reversible oxidation of Cys 148 and Cys 206 of STING in cells. Molecular analyses led us to establish a model in which Cys 148 oxidation is constitutive, whereas Cys 206 oxidation is inducible by oxidative stress or by the natural ligand of STING, 2′3′-cGAMP. Our data suggest that the oxidation of Cys 206 prevented hyperactivation of STING by causing a conformational change associated with the formation of inactive polymers containing intermolecular disulfide bonds. This finding should aid the design of therapies targeting STING that are relevant to autoinflammatory disorders, immunotherapies, and vaccines.},

Here, we found that CLIC1 and CLIC4 in endothelial cells regulate critical G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways associated with vascular development and disease. In cultured endothelial cells, we found that CLIC1 and CLIC4 transiently translocated to the plasma membrane in response to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Both CLIC1 and CLIC4 were essential for mediating S1P-induced activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rac1 downstream of S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1). In contrast, only CLIC1 was essential for S1P-induced activation of the small GTPase RhoA downstream of S1PR2 and S1PR3. Neither were required for other S1P-S1PR signaling outputs. Rescue experiments revealed that CLIC1 and CLIC4 were not functionally interchangeable, suggesting distinct and specific functions for CLICs in transducing GPCR signaling. These CLIC-mediated mechanisms were critical for S1P-induced stimulation of the barrier function in endothelial cell monolayers. Our results define CLICs as previously unknown players in the pathways linking GPCRs to small GTPases and vascular endothelial function.},

  abstract     = {Production of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) must be precisely regulated for effective host immunity without the induction of collateral tissue damage. Here, we showed that TNF production was driven by a spleen-liver axis in a rat model of systemic inflammation induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Analysis of cytokine expression and secretion in combination with splenectomy and hepatectomy revealed that the spleen generated not only TNF but also factors that enhanced TNF production by the liver, the latter of which accounted for nearly half of the TNF secreted into the circulation. Using mass spectrometry–based lipidomics, we identified leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4 ) as a candidate blood-borne messenger in this spleen-liver axis. LTB 4 was essential for spleen-liver communication in vivo, as well as for humoral signaling between splenic macrophages and Kupffer cells in vitro. LPS stimulated the splenic macrophages to secrete LTB 4 , which primed Kupffer cells to secrete more TNF in response to LPS in a manner dependent on LTB 4 receptors. These findings provide a framework to understand how systemic inflammation can be regulated at the level of interorgan communication.},

  abstract     = {The complex mTORC2 is accepted to be the kinase that controls the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif, a key regulatory switch for AGC kinases, although whether mTOR directly phosphorylates this motif remains controversial. Here, we identified an mTOR-mediated phosphorylation site that we termed the TOR interaction motif (TIM; F-x 3 -F-pT), which controls the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif of PKC and Akt and the activity of these kinases. The TIM is invariant in mTORC2-dependent AGC kinases, is evolutionarily conserved, and coevolved with mTORC2 components. Mutation of this motif in Akt1 and PKCβII abolished cellular kinase activity by impairing activation loop and hydrophobic motif phosphorylation. mTORC2 directly phosphorylated the PKC TIM in vitro, and this phosphorylation event was detected in mouse brain. Overexpression of PDK1 in mTORC2-deficient cells rescued hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of PKC and Akt by a mechanism dependent on their intrinsic catalytic activity, revealing that mTORC2 facilitates the PDK1 phosphorylation step, which, in turn, enables autophosphorylation. Structural analysis revealed that PKC homodimerization is driven by a TIM-containing helix, and biophysical proximity assays showed that newly synthesized, unphosphorylated PKC dimerizes in cells. Furthermore, disruption of the dimer interface by stapled peptides promoted hydrophobic motif phosphorylation. Our data support a model in which mTORC2 relieves nascent PKC dimerization through TIM phosphorylation, recruiting PDK1 to phosphorylate the activation loop and triggering intramolecular hydrophobic motif autophosphorylation. Identification of TIM phosphorylation and its role in the regulation of PKC provides the basis for AGC kinase regulation by mTORC2.},

Overexpression of DDAH2 attenuated RLR signaling, whereas loss of DDAH2 function enhanced RLR signaling and suppressed viral replication ex vivo and in mice. Upon viral infection, DDAH2 relocated to mitochondria, where it induced the production of nitric oxide (NO) and the activation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which promoted mitochondrial fission and blocked the activation of innate immune responses mediated by mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS). TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a kinase downstream of MAVS, inhibited DDAH2 by phosphorylating DDAH2 at multiple sites. Our study thus identifies a reciprocal inhibitory loop between the DDAH2-NO cascade and the RLR signaling pathway that fine-tunes the antiviral immune response.},

Using selective allosteric ligands, ex vivo brain slice electrophysiology, and optogenetic approaches, we found that two mGluR subtypes—mGluR2 and mGluR4 (or mGlu 2 and mGlu 4 )—exist as functional heterodimers that regulate excitatory transmission in a synapse-specific manner within the rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Activation of mGlu 2 /mGlu 4 heterodimers inhibited glutamatergic signaling at thalamo-mPFC synapses but not at hippocampus-mPFC or amygdala-mPFC synapses.

  abstract     = {The myeloperoxidase (MPO) system of myeloid-derived cells (MDCs) is central to cellular innate immunity. Upon MDC activation, MPO is secreted into phagosomes where it catalyzes the production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a potent chlorinating oxidant. Here, we demonstrated that the myeloid lineage–restricted MPO-HOCl system had antitumor effects in early melanoma growth in aged mice. Orthotopic melanomas grew more slowly in immunocompetent MPO +/+ host mice compared to age-matched syngeneic MPO −/− mice. Real-time intravital tumor imaging in vivo and in cell cocultures revealed a cell-cell proximity-dependent association between MDC-derived MPO enzyme activity and blockade of ligand-induced IκBα degradation in tumor cells. HOCl directly trans-inhibited IκB kinase (IKK) activity in tumor cells, thereby decreasing nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activation and inducing changes in the expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways, cell cycle progression, and DNA replication. By contrast, HOCl induced transcriptional changes in CD8 + T cells related to ion transport and the MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways that are associated with T cell activation. MPO increased the circulating concentrations of the myeloid cell–attracting cytokines CXCL1 and CXCL5, enhanced local infiltration by CD8 + cytotoxic T cells, and decreased tumor growth. Overall, these data reveal a role for MDC-derived HOCl as a small-molecule paracrine signaling factor that trans-inhibits IKK in melanoma tumor cells, mediating antitumor responses during early tumor progression.},

  abstract     = {The opioid crisis represents a major worldwide public health crisis that has accelerated the search for safer and more effective opioids. Over the past few years, the identification of biased opioid ligands capable of eliciting selective functional responses has provided an alternative avenue to develop novel therapeutics without the side effects of current opioid medications. However, whether biased agonism or other pharmacological properties, such as partial agonism (or low efficacy), account for the therapeutic benefits remains questionable. Here, we provide a summary of the current status of biased opioid ligands that target the μ- and κ-opioid receptors and highlight advances in preclinical and clinical trials of some of these ligands. We also discuss an example of structure-based biased ligand discovery at the μ-opioid receptor, an approach that could revolutionize drug discovery at opioid and other receptors. Last, we briefly discuss caveats and future directions for this important area of research.},

  abstract     = {Aberrant changes in gene expression underlie the pathogenesis and progression of pressure-overload heart failure, leading to maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy, ventricular remodeling, and contractile dysfunction. Signaling through the G protein G q triggers maladaptation and heart failure, in part through the activation of G protein–coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5). Hypertrophic stimuli induce the accumulation of GRK5 in the nuclei of cardiomyocytes, where it regulates pathological gene expression through multiple transcription factors including NFAT. The nuclear targeting of GRK5 is mediated by an amino-terminal (NT) domain that binds to calmodulin (CaM). Here, we sought to prevent GRK5-mediated pathology in pressure-overload maladaptation and heart failure by expressing in cardiomyocytes a peptide encoding the GRK5 NT (GRK5nt) that encompasses the CaM binding domain. In cultured cardiomyocytes, GRK5nt expression abrogated G q -coupled receptor–mediated hypertrophy, including attenuation of pathological gene expression and the transcriptional activity of NFAT and NF-κB. We confirmed that GRK5nt bound to and blocked Ca 2+ -CaM from associating with endogenous GRK5, thereby preventing GRK5 nuclear accumulation after pressure overload. We generated mice that expressed GRKnt in a cardiac-specific fashion (TgGRK5nt mice), which exhibited reduced cardiac hypertrophy, ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary congestion, and cardiac fibrosis after chronic transverse aortic constriction. Together, our data support a role for GRK5nt as an inhibitor of pathological GRK5 signaling that prevents heart failure.},

  abstract     = {Innate immune responses to Gram-negative bacteria depend on the recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by a receptor complex that includes CD14 and TLR4. In dendritic cells (DCs), CD14 enhances the activation not only of TLR4 but also that of the NFAT family of transcription factors, which suppresses cell survival and promotes the production of inflammatory mediators. NFAT activation requires Ca 2+ mobilization. In DCs, Ca 2+ mobilization in response to LPS depends on phospholipase C γ2 (PLCγ2), which produces inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP 3 ). Here, we showed that the IP 3 receptor 3 (IP 3 R3) and ITPKB, a kinase that converts IP 3 to inositol 1, 3, 4, 5-tetrakisphosphate (IP 4 ), were both necessary for Ca 2+ mobilization and NFAT activation in mouse and human DCs. A pool of IP 3 R3 was located on the plasma membrane of DCs, where it colocalized with CD14 and ITPKB. Upon LPS binding to CD14, ITPKB was required for Ca 2+ mobilization through plasma membrane–localized IP 3 R3 and for NFAT nuclear translocation. Pharmacological inhibition of ITPKB in mice reduced both LPS-induced tissue swelling and the severity of inflammatory arthritis to a similar extent as that induced by the inhibition of NFAT using nanoparticles that delivered an NFAT-inhibiting peptide specifically to phagocytic cells. Our results suggest that ITPKB may represent a promising target for anti-inflammatory therapies that aim to inhibit specific DC functions.},

  abstract     = {NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ release through type 1 ryanodine receptors (RYR1) is a major mechanism underlying the earliest signals in T cell activation, which are the formation of Ca 2+ microdomains. In our characterization of the molecular machinery underlying NAADP action, we identified an NAADP-binding protein, called hematological and neurological expressed 1–like protein (HN1L) [also known as Jupiter microtubule-associated homolog 2 (JPT2)]. Gene deletion of Hn1l/Jpt2 in human Jurkat and primary rat T cells resulted in decreased numbers of initial Ca 2+ microdomains and delayed the onset and decreased the amplitude of global Ca 2+ signaling. Photoaffinity labeling demonstrated direct binding of NAADP to recombinant HN1L/JPT2. T cell receptor/CD3–dependent coprecipitation of HN1L/JPT2 with RYRs and colocalization of these proteins suggest that HN1L/JPT2 connects NAADP formation with the activation of RYR channels within the first seconds of T cell activation. Thus, HN1L/JPT2 enables NAADP to activate Ca 2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum through RYR.},

Here, we used a “clickable” NAADP-based photoprobe to isolate human NAADP-binding proteins and identified Jupiter microtubule-associated homolog 2 (JPT2) as a TPC accessory protein required for endogenous NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ signaling. JPT2 was also required for the translocation of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pseudovirus through the endolysosomal system.

Substantial changes in the electrostatic potential of the plasma membrane occur at the immunological synapse, the interface between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell. Here, we investigated how the electrostatic interactions that promote dynamic membrane binding of the TCR-CD3 cytoplasmic domains are modulated during signaling and affect T cell activation. We found that Ca 2+ -dependent activation of the phosphatidylserine scramblase TMEM16F, which was previously implicated in T cell activation, reduced the electrostatic potential of the plasma membrane during immunological synapse formation by locally redistributing phosphatidylserine. This, in turn, increased the dissociation of bystander TCR-CD3 cytoplasmic domains from the plasma membrane and enhanced TCR-dependent signaling and consequently T cell activation. This study establishes the molecular basis for the role of TMEM16F in bystander TCR–induced signal amplification and identifies enhancement of TMEM16F function as a potential therapeutic strategy for promoting T cell activation.},

Using mouse and human RNA sequencing datasets and computational analysis, we created interactome maps between dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons and an array of normal cell types, as well as colitis-associated glial cells, rheumatoid arthritis–associated synovial macrophages, and pancreatic tumor tissue. These maps revealed a common correlation between the abundance of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF) in peripheral cells with that of its receptor EGFR (a member of the ErbB family of receptors) in DRG neurons. Subsequently, we confirmed that increased abundance of HBEGF enhanced nociception in mice, likely acting on DRG neurons through ErbB family receptors. Collectively, these interactomes highlight ligand-receptor interactions that may lead to treatments for disease-associated pain and, furthermore, reflect the complexity of cell-to-neuron signaling in chronic pain states.},

Using mass cytometry of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we identified effector memory CD4 + T cells and CD4 − CD8 low/− CD161 + T cells, specifically those positive for the chemokine receptor CCR6, as the circulating immune subtypes with the greatest response to IL-1β. This response manifested as increased phosphorylation and, thus, activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB and was also seen in other subsets, including CD11c + myeloid dendritic cells, classical monocytes, two subsets of natural killer cells (CD16 − CD56 bright CD161 − and CD16 − CD56 dim CD161 + ), and lineage − (Lin − ) cells expressing CD161 and CD25. IL-1β also induced a rapid but less robust increase in the phosphorylation of the kinase p38 as compared to that of NF-κB in most of these immune cell subsets. Prolonged IL-1β stimulation increased the phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3 and to a lesser extent that of STAT1 and STAT5 across various immune cell types. IL-1β–induced production of IL-6 likely led to the activation of STAT1 and STAT3 at later time points. Interindividual heterogeneity and inhibition of STAT activation by anakinra raise the possibility that assays measuring NF-κB phosphorylation in response to IL-1β in CCR6 + T cell subtypes could identify those patients at higher risk of cytokine storm and most likely to benefit from IL-1β–neutralizing therapies.},

NETs trap invading pathogens, promote coagulation, and activate myeloid cells to produce type I interferons (IFNs), proinflammatory cytokines that regulate the immune system. Here, we showed that macrophages and other myeloid cells phagocytosed NETs. Once in phagosomes, NETs translocated to the cytosol, where the DNA backbones of these structures activated the innate immune sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and induced type I IFN production. The NET-associated serine protease neutrophil elastase (NE) mediated the activation of this pathway. We showed that NET induction in mice treated with the lectin concanavalin A, a model of autoimmune hepatitis, resulted in cGAS-dependent stimulation of an IFN response, suggesting that NETs activated cGAS in vivo.

  abstract     = {The inflammatory human chemokine CXCL5 interacts with the G protein–coupled receptor CXCR2 to induce chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils. CXCL5 also has weak agonist activity toward CXCR1. The N-terminus of CXCL5 can be modified by proteolytic cleavage or deimination of Arg 9 to citrulline (Cit), and these modifications can occur separately or together. Here, we chemically synthesized native CXCL5(1–78), truncated CXCL5 [CXCL5(9–78)], and the citrullinated (Cit 9 ) versions and characterized their functions in vitro and in vivo. Compared with full-length CXCL5, N-terminal truncation resulted in enhanced potency to induce G protein signaling and β-arrestin recruitment through CXCR2, increased CXCL5-initiated internalization of CXCR2, and greater Ca 2+ signaling downstream of not only CXCR2 but also CXCR1. Citrullination did not affect the capacity of CXCL5 to activate classical or alternative signaling pathways. Administering the various CXCL5 forms to mice revealed that in addition to neutrophils, CXCL5 exerted chemotactic activity toward monocytes and that this activity was increased by N-terminal truncation. These findings were confirmed by in vitro chemotaxis and Ca 2+ signaling assays with primary human CD14 + monocytes and human THP-1 monocytes. In vitro and in vivo analyses suggested that CXCL5 targeted monocytes through CXCR1 and CXCR2. Thus, truncation of the N-terminus makes CXCL5 a more potent chemoattractant for both neutrophils and monocytes that acts through CXCR1 and CXCR2.},

  abstract     = {Renal fibrosis is a common end point for kidney injury and many chronic kidney diseases. Fibrogenesis depends on the sustained activation of myofibroblasts, which deposit the extracellular matrix that causes progressive scarring and organ failure. Here, we showed that the transcription factor SOX9 was associated with kidney fibrosis in humans and required for experimentally induced kidney fibrosis in mice. From genome-wide analysis, we identified Neuron navigator 3 (NAV3) as acting downstream of SOX9 in kidney fibrosis. NAV3 increased in abundance and colocalized with SOX9 after renal injury in mice, and both SOX9 and NAV3 were present in diseased human kidneys. In an in vitro model of renal pericyte transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts, we demonstrated that NAV3 was required for multiple aspects of fibrogenesis, including actin polymerization linked to cell migration and sustained activation of the mechanosensitive transcription factor YAP1. In summary, our work identifies a SOX9-NAV3-YAP1 axis involved in the progression of kidney fibrosis and points to NAV3 as a potential target for pharmacological intervention.},

  abstract     = {The endothelial cell barrier regulates the passage of fluid between the bloodstream and underlying tissues, and barrier function impairment exacerbates the severity of inflammatory insults. To understand how inflammation alters vessel permeability, we studied the effects of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα on transendothelial permeability and electrophysiology in ex vivo murine veins and arteries. We found that TNFα specifically decreased the barrier function of venous endothelium without affecting that of arterial endothelium. On the basis of RNA expression profiling and protein analysis, we found that claudin-11 (CLDN11) was the predominant claudin in venous endothelial cells and that there was little, if any, CLDN11 in arterial endothelial cells. Consistent with a difference in claudin composition, TNFα increased the permselectivity of Cl − over Na + in venous but not arterial endothelium. The vein-specific effects of TNFα also required the activation of Pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels and the CD39-mediated hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine, which subsequently stimulated A 2A adenosine receptors. Moreover, the increase in vein permeability required the activation of the Ca 2+ channel TRPV4 downstream of Panx1 activation. Panx1-deficient mice resisted the pathologic effects of sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture on life span and lung vascular permeability. These data provide a targetable pathway with the potential to promote vein barrier function and prevent the deleterious effects of vascular leak in response to inflammation.},

  abstract     = {Systemic signaling and systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) are key to the survival of plants during episodes of abiotic stress. These processes depend on a continuous chain of cell-to-cell signaling events that extends from the initial tissue that senses the stress (the local tissue) to the entire plant (systemic tissues). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca 2+ are key signaling molecules thought to be involved in this cell-to-cell mechanism. Here, we report that the systemic response of Arabidopsis thaliana to a local treatment of high light stress, which resulted in local ROS accumulation, required ROS generated by respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (RBOHD). ROS increased cell-to-cell transport and plasmodesmata (PD) pore size in a manner dependent on PD-localized protein 1 (PDLP1) and PDLP5, and this process was required for the propagation of the systemic ROS signals and SAA. Furthermore, aquaporins and several Ca 2+ -permeable channels in the glutamate receptor–like (GLR), mechanosensitive small conductance–like (MSL), and cyclic nucleotide–gated (CNGC) families were involved in this systemic signaling process. However, we determined that these channels were required primarily to amplify the systemic signal in each cell along the path of the systemic ROS wave, as well as to establish local and systemic acclimation. Thus, PD and RBOHD-generated ROS orchestrate light stress–induced rapid cell-to-cell spread of systemic signals in Arabidopsis .},

Here, we showed that the Microprocessor complex, which mediates the first step of microRNA processing, potentiated the transcription of ribosomal protein genes by eliminating DNA/RNA hybrids known as R-loops. Nutrient deprivation triggered the nuclear export of Drosha, a key component of the Microprocessor complex, and its subsequent degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4, thereby reducing ribosomal protein production and protein synthesis. In mouse erythroid progenitors, conditional deletion of Drosha led to the reduced production of ribosomal proteins, translational inhibition of the mRNA encoding the erythroid transcription factor Gata1, and impaired erythropoiesis. This phenotype mirrored the clinical presentation of human “ribosomopathies.” Thus, the Microprocessor complex plays a pivotal role in synchronizing protein synthesis capacity with cellular growth rate and is a potential drug target for anemias caused by ribosomal insufficiency.},

These nonlinear systems rely on feedback and feedforward regulation to respond appropriately to changing environmental conditions. Mathematical models describing signaling pathways often lack predictive power because they are not trained on data that encompass the diverse time scales on which these regulatory mechanisms operate. We addressed this limitation by measuring transcriptional changes induced by the mating response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae exposed to different dynamic patterns of pheromone. We found that pheromone-induced transcription persisted after pheromone removal and showed long-term adaptation upon sustained pheromone exposure. We developed a model of the regulatory network that captured both characteristics of the mating response. We fit this model to experimental data with an evolutionary algorithm and used the parameterized model to predict scenarios for which it was not trained, including different temporal stimulus profiles and genetic perturbations to pathway components. Our model allowed us to establish the role of four architectural elements of the network in regulating gene expression. These network motifs are incoherent feedforward, positive feedback, negative feedback, and repressor binding. Experimental and computational perturbations to these network motifs established a specific role for each in coordinating the mating response to persistent and dynamic stimulation.},

Blocking this activity produced a decrease in the synaptic content of AMPA receptors in hippocampal neurons and a reduction in GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser 845 . Reducing the ligand-independent activity of GHS-R1a increased the surface diffusion of AMPA receptors and impaired AMPA receptor–dependent synaptic delivery induced by chemical long-term potentiation. Accordingly, we found that blocking this GHS-R1a activity impaired spatial and recognition memory in mice.

Current remedies are not very effective and have side effects, including the risk of triggering additional HO. The TGF-β family member activin A is produced by activated macrophages and other inflammatory cells and stimulates the intracellular effectors SMAD2 and SMAD3 (SMAD2/3). Because HO starts with inflammation and because SMAD2/3 activation is chondrogenic, we tested whether activin A stimulated HO development. Using mouse models of acquired intramuscular and subdermal HO, we found that blockage of endogenous activin A by a systemically administered neutralizing antibody reduced HO development and bone accumulation. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis and developmental trajectories showed that the antibody treatment reduced the recruitment of Sox9 + skeletal progenitors, many of which also expressed the gene encoding activin A ( Inhba ), to HO sites. Gain-of-function assays showed that activin A enhanced the chondrogenic differentiation of progenitor cells through SMAD2/3 signaling, and inclusion of activin A in HO-inducing implants enhanced HO development in vivo. Together, our data reveal that activin A is a critical upstream signaling stimulator of acquired HO in mice and could represent an effective therapeutic target against forms of this pathology in patients.},

This dephosphorylation event required the recognition of phosphorylated Thr 198 in the activation loop of TbPLK by the N-terminal Plus3 domain of KPP1 and the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Thr 125 in TbPLK by the C-terminal catalytic domain of KPP1. Dephosphorylation of TbPLK by KPP1 prevented hyperphosphorylation of the hook complex protein TbCentrin2, thereby allowing timely dephosphorylation of phosphorylated TbCentrin2 for hook complex duplication and flagellum positioning and attachment. Thus, KPP1 attenuates TbPLK activity by dephosphorylating TbPLK to facilitate flagellum inheritance.},

  abstract     = {Necroptosis is a lytic, proinflammatory cell death pathway, which has been implicated in host defense and, when dysregulated, the pathology of many human diseases. The central mediators of this pathway are the receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3 and the terminal executioner, the pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain–like (MLKL). Here, we review the chronology of signaling along the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL axis and highlight how the subcellular compartmentalization of signaling events controls the initiation and execution of necroptosis. We propose that a network of modulators surrounds the necroptotic signaling core and that this network, rather than acting universally, tunes necroptosis in a context-, cell type–, and species-dependent manner. Such a high degree of mechanistic flexibility is likely an important property that helps necroptosis operate as a robust, emergency form of cell death.},

Cellular stress triggers the activation of protein kinases that converge on the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which attenuates mRNA translation. This translational inhibition is one aspect of the integrated stress response (ISR). We found that postmortem brain tissue from AD patients showed increased phosphorylation of eIF2α and reduced abundance of eIF2B, another key component of the translation initiation complex. Systemic administration of the small-molecule compound ISRIB (which blocks the ISR downstream of phosphorylated eIF2α) rescued protein synthesis in the hippocampus, measures of synaptic plasticity, and performance on memory-associated behavior tests in wild-type mice cotreated with salubrinal (which inhibits translation by inducing eIF2α phosphorylation) and in both β-amyloid-treated and transgenic AD model mice. Thus, attenuating the ISR downstream of phosphorylated eIF2α may restore hippocampal protein synthesis and delay cognitive decline in AD patients.},

  abstract     = {The cytoplasmic kinase ZAP70 is critical for T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling. The R360P mutation in ZAP70 is responsible for an early-onset familial autoimmune syndrome. The structural location and biochemical signaling effects of the R360P mutation are consistent with weakening of the autoinhibitory conformation of ZAP70. Mice with a ZAP70 R360P mutation and polyclonal TCR repertoires exhibited relatively normal T cell development but showed evidence of increased signaling. In addition, the R360P mutation resulted in enhanced follicular helper T cell expansion after LCMV infection. To eliminate the possibility of a TCR repertoire shift, the OTI transgenic TCR was introduced into R360P mice, which resulted in enhanced T cell responses to weaker stimuli, including weak agonists and a self-peptide. These observations suggest that disruption of ZAP70 autoinhibition by the R360P mutation enables increased mature T cell sensitivity to self-antigens that would normally be ignored by wild-type T cells, a mechanism that may contribute to the break of tolerance in human patients with R360P mutation.},

Here, we report that microorganisms, such as the bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, speed up the return to a rapid growth state by preventing the proteolysis of functional proteins by ATP-dependent proteases while in the slow-growth state or stationary phase. This reduction in functional protein degradation resulted from a decrease in the intracellular concentration of ATP that was nonetheless sufficient to allow the continued degradation of nonfunctional proteins by the same proteases. Protein preservation occurred under limiting magnesium, carbon, or nitrogen conditions, indicating that this response was not specific to low availability of a particular nutrient. Nevertheless, the return to rapid growth required proteins that mediate responses to the specific nutrient limitation conditions, because the transcriptional regulator PhoP was necessary for rapid recovery only after magnesium starvation. Reductions in intracellular ATP and in ATP-dependent proteolysis also enabled the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to recover faster from stationary phase. Our findings suggest that protein preservation during a slow-growth state is a conserved microbial strategy that facilitates the return to a growth state once nutrients become available.},

However, despite advances in therapeutic strategies, patients with PAH bearing mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 ( BMPR2 )–encoding gene present severe phenotypes and outcomes. We sought to investigate the effect of PER-like kinase (PERK), which participates in one of three major pathways associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR), on PAH pathophysiology in BMPR2 heterozygous mice. BMPR2 heterozygosity in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) decreased the abundance of the antiapoptotic microRNA miR124-3p through the arm of the UPR mediated by PERK. Hypoxia promoted the accumulation of unfolded proteins in BMPR2 heterozygous PASMCs, resulting in increased PERK signaling, cell viability, cellular proliferation, and glycolysis. Proteomic analyses revealed that PERK ablation suppressed PDGFRβ-STAT1 signaling and glycolysis in hypoxic BMPR2 heterozygous PASMCs. Furthermore, PERK ablation or PERK inhibition ameliorated pulmonary vascular remodeling in the Sugen/chronic hypoxia model of PAH, irrespective of BMPR2 status. Hence, these findings suggest that PERK inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with PAH with or without BMPR2 mutation.},

Endothelial cells lacking TLR2 exhibited reduced proinflammatory potential at the protein, cell, and tissue levels. Loss of endothelial TLR2 blunted the inflammatory response to both exogenous and endogenous danger signals in endothelial cells in culture and in vivo. Endothelial TLR2 promoted tumor growth, angiogenesis, and protumorigenic immune cell recruitment in a mouse model of prostate cancer. Furthermore, the cell surface localization of P-selectin and the subsequent production of other critical cell adhesion molecules (such as E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1) that recruit immune cells required endothelial TLR2.

We found that NF-κB activity responded to the absolute difference in cytokine concentration and not to the concentration itself. Our analyses revealed that negative feedback by the regulatory proteins A20 and IκBα enabled differential responses to changes in cytokine dose by providing a short-term memory of previous cytokine concentrations and by continuously resetting kinase cycling and receptor abundance. Investigation of NF-κB target gene expression showed that cells exhibited distinct transcriptional responses under different dynamic cytokine profiles.

  abstract     = {Maintaining and limiting T cell responses to constant stimulation with antigen are critical to control pathogens and maintain self-tolerance, respectively. Antigen recognition by T cell receptors (TCRs) activates signaling that stimulates T cells to produce cytokines and also leads to the down-regulation of cell surface TCRs. In other systems, receptor down-regulation can induce perfect adaptation to constant stimulation by a mechanism known as state-dependent inactivation, which requires complete down-regulation of the receptor or the ligand; however, this is not the case for the TCR. Here, we observed that in vitro–expanded primary human T cells exhibited perfect adaptation with respect to cytokine production to constant antigen stimulation across a 100, 000-fold variation in affinity with partial TCR down-regulation. By directly fitting a mechanistic model to these data, we showed that TCR down-regulation produced imperfect adaptation, but, when coupled to a switch, produced perfect adaptation in terms of cytokine production. A prediction of this model was that TCR signaling induced by peptide-bound major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) continues after adaptation, which we confirmed by showing that, whereas costimulation could not prevent adaptation, signaling by the costimulatory receptors CD28 and 4-1BB reactivated adapted T cells to produce cytokines in a pMHC-dependent manner. We showed that adaptation also applied to first-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells but was partially avoided with second-generation CARs. These findings highlight that perfect adaptation limits the responses of T cells, rendering them dependent on costimulation for sustained responses.},

We validated that a class I PDZ-binding motif mediated binding of ACE2 to the scaffolding proteins SNX27, NHERF3, and SHANK, and that a binding site for the clathrin adaptor AP2 μ2 in ACE2 overlaps with a phospho-dependent binding site for the SH2 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases.

  abstract     = {The first reported receptor for SARS-CoV-2 on host cells was the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). However, the viral spike protein also has an RGD motif, suggesting that cell surface integrins may be co-receptors. We examined the sequences of ACE2 and integrins with the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource and identified candidate short linear motifs (SLiMs) in their short, unstructured, cytosolic tails with potential roles in endocytosis, membrane dynamics, autophagy, cytoskeleton, and cell signaling. These SLiM candidates are highly conserved in vertebrates and may interact with the μ2 subunit of the endocytosis-associated AP2 adaptor complex, as well as with various protein domains (namely, I-BAR, LC3, PDZ, PTB, and SH2) found in human signaling and regulatory proteins. Several motifs overlap in the tail sequences, suggesting that they may act as molecular switches, such as in response to tyrosine phosphorylation status. Candidate LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs are present in the tails of integrin β 3 and ACE2, suggesting that these proteins could directly recruit autophagy components. Our findings identify several molecular links and testable hypotheses that could uncover mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry, and replication against which it may be possible to develop host-directed therapies that dampen viral infection and disease progression. Several of these SLiMs have now been validated to mediate the predicted peptide interactions.},

  abstract     = {Cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) are a population of multipotent stem cells that give rise to craniofacial bone and cartilage during development. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and autophagy have been individually implicated in stem cell homeostasis. Mutations that cause constitutive activation of the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 cause the congenital disorder fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), which is characterized by ectopic cartilage and bone in connective tissues in the trunk and sometimes includes ectopic craniofacial bones. Here, we showed that enhanced BMP signaling through the constitutively activated ACVR1 (ca-ACVR1) in CNCCs in mice induced ectopic cartilage formation in the craniofacial region through an autophagy-dependent mechanism. Enhanced BMP signaling suppressed autophagy by activating mTORC1, thus blocking the autophagic degradation of β-catenin, which, in turn, caused CNCCs to adopt a chondrogenic identity. Transient blockade of mTORC1, reactivation of autophagy, or suppression of Wnt–β-catenin signaling reduced ectopic cartilages in ca -Acvr1 mutants. Our results suggest that BMP signaling and autophagy coordinately regulate β-catenin activity to direct the fate of CNCCs during craniofacial development. These findings may also explain why some patients with FOP develop ectopic bones through endochondral ossification in craniofacial regions.},

  abstract     = {Campylobacter jejuni is a bacterial pathogen that is a common cause of enteritis in humans. We identified a previously uncharacterized type of sensory domain in the periplasmic region of the C. jejuni chemoreceptor Tlp10, termed the DAHL domain, that is predicted to have a bimodular helical architecture. Through two independent ligand-binding sites in this domain, Tlp10 responded to molecular aspartate, isoleucine, fumarate, malate, fucose, and mannose as attractants and to arginine, galactose, and thiamine as repellents. Tlp10 also recognized glycan ligands when present as terminal and intermediate residues of complex structures, such as the fucosylated human ganglioside GM1 and Lewis a antigen. A tlp10 mutant strain lacking the ligand-binding sites was attenuated in its ability to colonize avian caeca and to adhere to cultured human intestinal cells, indicating the potential involvement of the DAHL domain in host colonization and disease. The Tlp10 intracellular signaling domain interacted with the scaffolding proteins CheV and CheW, which couple chemoreceptors to intracellular signaling machinery, and with the signaling domains of other chemoreceptors, suggesting a key role for Tlp10 in signal transduction and incorporation into sensory arrays. We identified the DAHL domain in other bacterial signal transduction proteins, including the essential virulence induction protein VirA from the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens . Together, these results suggest a potential link between Tlp10 and C. jejuni virulence.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the mechanisms of the Warburg shift to aerobic glycolysis is critical to defining the metabolic basis of cancer. Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is an aggressive cancer characterized by biallelic inactivation of the gene encoding the Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase, an early shift to aerobic glycolysis, and rapid metastasis. We observed impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in tumors from patients with HLRCC. Biochemical and transcriptomic analyses revealed that respiratory chain dysfunction in the tumors was due to loss of expression of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)–encoded subunits of respiratory chain complexes, caused by a marked decrease in mtDNA content and increased mtDNA mutations. We demonstrated that accumulation of fumarate in HLRCC tumors inactivated the core factors responsible for replication and proofreading of mtDNA, leading to loss of respiratory chain components, thereby promoting the shift to aerobic glycolysis and disease progression in this prototypic model of glucose-dependent human cancer.},
