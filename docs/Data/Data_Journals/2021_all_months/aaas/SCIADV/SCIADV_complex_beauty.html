We consider a process to be characterized by the set of end products it produces, which is generated according to a given probability distribution. We formulate the problem in the context of hypothesis testing and consider the specific case in which the objects can be modeled as pure loss channels. We demonstrate theoretically that a simple quantum strategy, using readily available resources and measurement schemes in the form of two-mode squeezed vacuum and photon counting, can outperform any classical strategy. We experimentally implement this protocol, exploiting optical twin beams, validating our theoretical results, and demonstrating that, in this task, there is a quantum advantage in a realistic setting.},

The sensing pixel features serpentine metal traces and spatially distributed microprotrusions. Experimental and numerical studies reveal the fundamental aspects of the multifunctional tactile sensing mechanism of the e-skin, which exhibits excellent flexibility and wearable conformability.

These interconnections should have metal-like conductivity and sufficiently low stiffness that does not compromise the flexibility of the device; moreover, they must be achieved using low-temperature processes to prevent device damage. However, conventional interconnection bonding methods require additional adhesive layers, making it challenging to achieve these characteristics simultaneously. Here, we develop and characterize water vapor plasma–assisted bonding (WVPAB) that enables direct bonding of gold electrodes deposited on ultrathin polymer films. WVPAB bonds rough gold electrodes at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in ambient air. Hydroxyl groups generated by the plasma assist bonding between two gold surfaces, allowing the formation of a strong and stable interface. The applicability of WVPAB-mediated connections to ultrathin electronic systems was also demonstrated, and ultraflexible organic photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes fabricated on separate films were successfully interconnected via ultrathin wiring films.},

Here, we describe an approach integrating synthesis of 3-O-sulfated standards, comprehensive HS disaccharide profiling, and cell engineering to address this deficiency. Its application revealed previously unseen differences in 3-O-sulfated profiles of clinical heparins and 3- O -sulfotransferase (HS3ST)–specific variations in cell surface HS profiles. The latter correlated with functional differences in anticoagulant activity and binding to platelet factor 4 (PF4), which underlies heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, a known side effect of heparin. Unexpectedly, cells expressing the HS3ST4 isoenzyme generated HS with potent anticoagulant activity but weak PF4 binding. The data provide new insights into 3- O -sulfate structure-function and demonstrate proof of concept for tailored cell-based synthesis of next-generation heparins.},

Here, we demonstrate the successful synthesis of nanoribbons having four-membered ring (cyclobutadienoid) linkages by using an on-surface synthesis approach involving direct contact transfer of coronene-type precursors followed by thermally assisted [2 + 2] cycloaddition. The resulting coronene-cyclobutadienoid nanoribbons feature a narrow 600-meV bandgap and novel electronic frontier states that can be interpreted as linear chains of effective p x and p y pseudo-atomic orbitals. We show that these states give rise to exceptional physical properties, such as a rigid indirect energy gap. This provides a previously unexplored strategy for constructing narrow gap GNRs via modification of precursor molecules whose function is to modulate the coupling between adjacent four-membered ring states.},

Lately, however, a theory of extrinsic mechanism has predicted that magnetic scattering by spin cluster can induce large AHE even above magnetic ordering temperature, particularly in magnetic semiconductors with low carrier density, strong exchange coupling, and finite spin chirality. Here, we find out a new magnetic semiconductor EuAs, where Eu 2+ ions with large magnetic moments form distorted triangular lattice. In addition to colossal magnetoresistance, EuAs exhibits large AHE with an anomalous Hall angle of 0.13 at temperatures far above antiferromagnetic ordering. As also demonstrated by model calculations, observed AHE can be explained by the spin cluster scattering in a hopping regime. Our findings shed light on magnetic semiconductors hosting topological spin textures, developing a field targeting diluted carriers strongly coupled to noncoplanar spin structures.},

  abstract     = {Marked epigenetic reprogramming is essential to convert terminally differentiated gametes to totipotent embryos. It remains puzzling why postfertilization global DNA reprogramming occurs in mammals but not in nonmammalian vertebrates. In zebrafish, global methylome inheritance is however accompanied by extensive enhancer “dememorization” as they become fully methylated. By depleting maternal dnmt1 using oocyte microinjection, we eliminated DNA methylation in early embryos, which died around gastrulation with severe differentiation defects. Notably, methylation deficiency leads to derepression of adult tissue–specific genes and CG-rich enhancers, which acquire ectopic transcription factor binding and, unexpectedly, histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). By contrast, embryonic enhancers are generally CG-poor and evade DNA methylation repression. Hence, global DNA hypermethylation inheritance coupled with enhancer dememorization installs an epigenetic gate that safeguards embryonic programs and ensures temporally ordered gene expression. We propose that “enhancer dememorization” underlies and unifies distinct epigenetic reprogramming modes in early development between mammals and nonmammals.},

Contrary to linearly π-conjugated molecules, their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap shrinks as the molecular size reduces, and this feature can, in principle, be leveraged to achieve unexpected size-dependent transport properties. Here, we examine charge transport characteristics of [ n ]CPPs ( n = 5 to 12) at the single molecule level using the scanning tunneling microscope–break junction technique. We find that the [ n ]CPPs have a much higher conductance than their linear oligoparaphenylene counterparts at small ring size and at the same time show a large tunneling attenuation coefficient comparable to saturated alkane series. These results show that the radially π-conjugated molecular systems can offer much larger conductance modulation range than standard linear molecules and can be a new platform for building molecular devices with highly tunable transport behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Delta receptors are members of the ionotropic glutamate receptor superfamily and form trans-synaptic connections by interacting with the extracellular scaffolding protein cerebellin-1 and presynaptic transmembrane protein neurexin-1β. Unlike other family members, however, direct agonist-gated ion channel activity has not been recorded in delta receptors. Here, we show that the GluD2 subtype of delta receptor forms cation-selective channels when bound to cerebellin-1 and neurexin-1β. Using fluorescence lifetime measurements and chemical cross-linking, we reveal that tight packing of the amino-terminal domains of GluD2 permits glycine- and d -serine–induced channel openings. Thus, cerebellin-1 and neurexin-1β act as biological cross-linkers to stabilize the extracellular domains of GluD2 receptors, allowing them to function as ionotropic excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in synapses.},

  abstract     = {The 2020 U.S. election saw a record turnout, saw a huge increase in absentee voting, and brought unified national Democratic control—yet these facts alone do not imply that vote-by-mail increased turnout or benefited Democrats. Using new microdata on millions of individual voters and aggregated turnout data across all 50 states, this paper offers a causal analysis of the impact of absentee vote-by-mail during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. Focusing on natural experiments in Texas and Indiana, we find that 65-year-olds voted at nearly the same rate as 64-year-olds, despite the fact that only 65-year-olds could vote absentee without an excuse. Being just old enough to vote no-excuse absentee did not substantially increase Democratic turnout relative to Republican turnout. Voter interest appeared to be more important in driving turnout across vote modes, neutralizing the electoral impact of Democrats voting by mail at higher rates during the historic pandemic.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BICs) have proven to be an important design principle for creating and enhancing devices reliant upon states with high-quality ( Q ) factors, such as sensors, lasers, and those for harmonic generation. However, as we show, current implementations of symmetry-protected BICs in photonic crystal slabs can only be found at the center of the Brillouin zone and below the Bragg diffraction limit, which fundamentally restricts their use to single-frequency applications. By microprinting a three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystal structure using two-photon polymerization, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by altering the radiative environment surrounding the slab to be a 3D photonic crystal. This allows for the protection of a line of BICs by embedding it in a symmetry bandgap of the crystal. This concept substantially expands the design freedom available for developing next-generation devices with high- Q states.},

Meanwhile, recent breakthroughs in quantum computation with superconducting circuits trigger a demand for quantum communication channels between spatially separated superconducting processors operating at microwave frequencies. In pursuit of this goal, we demonstrate the unconditional quantum teleportation of propagating coherent microwave states by exploiting two-mode squeezing and analog feedforward over a macroscopic distance of d = 0.42 m. We achieve a teleportation fidelity of F = 0.689 ± 0.004, exceeding the asymptotic no-cloning threshold. Thus, the quantum nature of the teleported states is preserved, opening the avenue toward unconditional security in microwave quantum communication.},

  abstract     = {Heterochromatin is most often associated with eukaryotic organisms. Yet, bacteria also contain areas with densely protein-occupied chromatin that appear to silence gene expression. One nucleoid-associated silencing factor is the conserved protein Hfq. Although seemingly nonspecific in its DNA binding properties, Hfq is strongly enriched at AT-rich DNA regions, characteristic of prophages and mobile genetic elements. Here, we demonstrate that polyphosphate (polyP), an ancient and highly conserved polyanion, is essential for the site-specific DNA binding properties of Hfq in bacteria. Absence of polyP markedly alters the DNA binding profile of Hfq, causes unsolicited prophage and transposon mobilization, and increases mutagenesis rates and DNA damage–induced cell death. In vitro reconstitution of the system revealed that Hfq and polyP interact with AT-rich DNA sequences and form phase-separated condensates, a process that is mediated by the intrinsically disordered C-terminal extensions of Hfq. We propose that polyP serves as a newly identified driver of heterochromatin formation in bacteria.},

Although architecturally simple, a complex pattern of airflow is thought to be achieved in the lizard lung due to its cavernous central lumen and honeycomb-shaped wall. We find that the wall of the lizard lung is generated from an initially smooth epithelial sheet, which is pushed through holes in a hexagonal smooth muscle meshwork by forces from fluid pressure, similar to a stress ball. Combining transcriptomics with time-lapse imaging reveals that the hexagonal meshwork self-assembles in response to circumferential and axial stresses downstream of pressure. A computational model predicts the pressure-driven changes in epithelial topology, which we probe using optogenetically driven contraction of 3D-printed engineered muscle. These results reveal the physical principles used to sculpt the unusual architecture of the lizard lung, which could be exploited as a novel strategy to engineer tissues.},

Two well-known quantum speed limits are the Mandelstam-Tamm and the Margolus-Levitin bounds, which relate the maximum speed of evolution to the system’s energy uncertainty and mean energy, respectively. Here, we test concurrently both limits in a multilevel system by following the motion of a single atom in an optical trap using fast matter wave interferometry. We find two different regimes: one where the Mandelstam-Tamm limit constrains the evolution at all times, and a second where a crossover to the Margolus-Levitin limit occurs at longer times. We take a geometric approach to quantify the deviation from the speed limit, measuring how much the quantum evolution deviates from the geodesic path in the Hilbert space of the multilevel system. Our results are important to understand the ultimate performance of quantum computing devices and related advanced quantum technologies.},

Following photoexcitation, hot carriers generated with excess energy exhibit boosted mobility, reaching an up to fourfold enhancement compared to cold carriers and a long-range hot carrier transport length beyond 200 nm. By optical pump–infrared push-terahertz probe spectroscopy and frequency-resolved photoconductivity measurements, we provide evidence that the conductivity enhancement originates primarily from hot holes with reduced momentum scattering. We rationalize our observation by considering (quasi-)ballistic transport of thermalized hot holes with energies above an energetic threshold in Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 . Our findings render Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 as a fascinating platform for studying the fundamentals of hot carrier transport and its exploitation toward hot carrier–based optoelectronic devices.},

This entropy-lowering reaction was further investigated by molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that observed kinetics were thermodynamically buried in equilibrium, which emphasized the critical role of electron-mediated ultrafast free-energy modification in inducing exotic material phases.

We show that the isotopic compositions of Earth and Mars are governed by two-component mixing among inner solar system materials, including material from the innermost disk unsampled by meteorites, whereas the contribution of outer solar system material is limited to a few percent by mass. This refutes a pebble accretion origin of the terrestrial planets but is consistent with collisional growth from inner solar system embryos.

ATF4 deletion caused expansion of phenotypical HSCs with functional attrition, characterized by defective repopulating and self-renewal capacities and myeloid bias. Moreover, the ATF4 −/− HSC defects were associated with elevated mitochondrial ROS production by targeting HIF1α. In addition, loss of ATF4 significantly delayed leukemogenesis in the MLL-AF9–induced leukemia model. Mechanistically, ATF4 deficiency impaired HSC function with aging-like phenotype and alleviated leukemogenesis by regulating HIF1α and p16 Ink4a . Together, our findings suggest a possibility of developing new strategies for the prevention and management of HSC aging and related pathological conditions.},

Gas-phase iodine photochemistry, commensurate with observed IO, is needed to explain the low O 3 inside these dust layers (below 15 ppbv; up to 75\% depleted). The added dust iodine can explain decreases in O 3 of 8\% regionally and affects surface air quality. Our data suggest that iodate reduction to form volatile iodine species is a missing process in the geochemical iodine cycle and presents an unrecognized aeolian source of iodine.

Results revealed that spring migratory movements of cervid hosts increased parasite spillover risk from deer to moose, an effect tempered by changes in elevation, land cover, and wolf presence.

To bridge this gap, machine learning methods are necessary to reduce the search space for identifying desired materials. Here, we present a machine learning–driven, closed-loop experimental process to guide the synthesis of polyelemental nanomaterials with targeted structural properties. By leveraging data from an eight-dimensional chemical space (Au-Ag-Cu-Co-Ni-Pd-Sn-Pt) as inputs, a Bayesian optimization algorithm is used to suggest previously unidentified nanoparticle compositions that target specific interfacial motifs for synthesis, results of which are iteratively shared back with the algorithm. This feedback loop resulted in successful syntheses of 18 heterojunction nanomaterials that are too complex to discover by chemical intuition alone, including extremely chemically complex biphasic nanoparticles reported to date. Platforms like the one developed here are poised to transform materials discovery across a wide swath of applications and industries.},

Using 21, 917 surveys collected over 30 years, we quantified the impacts of climate change on the past and future distributions of five interacting native and invasive trout species throughout the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. We found that the occupancy of native bull trout and cutthroat trout declined by 18 and 6\%, respectively (1993–2018), and was predicted to decrease by an additional 39 and 16\% by 2080. However, reasons for these occupancy reductions markedly differed among species: Climate-driven increases in water temperature and decreases in summer flow likely caused declines of bull trout, while climate-induced expansion of invasive species largely drove declines of cutthroat trout. Our results demonstrate that climate change can affect ecologically similar, co-occurring native species through distinct pathways, necessitating species-specific management actions.},

However, such imaging is possible only for systems either extracted from cells or reconstructed on solid substrates. Thus, nanodynamics inside living cells largely remain inaccessible with the current nanoimaging techniques. Here, we overcome this limitation by nanoendoscopy-AFM, where a needle-like nanoprobe is inserted into a living cell, presenting actin fiber three-dimensional (3D) maps, and 2D nanodynamics of the membrane inner scaffold, resulting in undetectable changes in cell viability. Unlike previous AFM methods, the nanoprobe directly accesses the target intracellular components, exploiting all the AFM capabilities, such as high-resolution imaging, nanomechanical mapping, and molecular recognition. These features should greatly expand the range of intracellular structures observable in living cells.},

Using scale samples of over 6900 wild adult salmon from 105 rivers, we document that increased farmed genetic ancestry is associated with increased growth throughout life and a younger age at both seaward migration and sexual maturity. There was large among-population variation in the effects of introgression. Most saliently, the increased growth at sea following introgression declined with the population’s average growth potential. Variation at two major-effect loci associated with age at maturity was little affected by farmed genetic ancestry and could not explain the observed phenotypic effects of introgression.

The classical limit of 1/2 n 2 ( n , refractive index) for electroluminescence quantum efficiency (ELQE) has recently been approached by perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Photon recycling (PR) and light scattering can provide an opportunity to surpass this limit. We investigate the role of PR and scattering in practical device operation using a radiative PSC with an ELQE (13.7\% at 1 sun) that significantly surpasses the classical limit (7.4\%). We experimentally analyze the contributions of PR and scattering to this strong radiation. A novel optical model reveals an increase of 39 mV in the voltage of our PSC. This analysis can provide design principles for future PSCs to approach the Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit.},

Using high-resolution fast synchrotron x-ray computed tomography, we characterized the solute transport in a fully saturated sand packing for both contamination and cleanup processes at similar hydrodynamic conditions. The discrepancy in the time scales has been demonstrated by the nonuniqueness of hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient versus injection rate (Péclet number). Observations show that in the mixed advection-diffusion regime, the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient of cleanup is significantly larger than that of the contamination process. This nonuniqueness has been attributed to the concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient during the cocurrent and countercurrent advection and diffusion, present in contamination and cleanup processes. The new findings enhance our fundamental understanding of transport processes and improve our capability to estimate the transport time scales of chemicals or pollution in geological and engineering systems.},

However, light has a simultaneous detrimental effect on the enzyme triggering photosynthesis and producing oxygen, photosystem II (PSII). Photoinhibition, the light-dependent decrease of PSII activity, results in a major limitation to aquatic and land photosynthesis and occurs upon all environmental stress conditions. In this work, we investigated the molecular origins of photoinhibition focusing on the paradoxical energy dissipation process of unknown nature coinciding with PSII damage. Integrating spectroscopic, biochemical, and computational approaches, we demonstrate that the site of this quenching process is the PSII reaction center. We propose that the formation of quenching and the closure of PSII stem from the same event. We lastly reveal the heterogeneity of PSII upon photoinhibition using structure-function modeling of excitation energy transfer. This work unravels the functional details of the damage-induced energy dissipation at the heart of photosynthesis.},

Here, we show that uniform colloidal dispersions can be driven into dissipative nonuniform states with emerging behaviors. We experimentally demonstrate this with electrically driven weakly charged superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in a nonpolar solvent. The driving leads to formation of nonequilibrium concentration gradients that further translate to nonequilibrium magnetism, including voltage-controlled magnetization and susceptibility. The concentration gradients also serve as diffuse interfaces that respond to external magnetic fields, leading to novel dissipative patterns. We identify the closest nondissipative analogs, discuss the differences, and highlight the ability to directly quantify the dissipation and link it to the pattern formation. Beyond voltage-controlled magnetism, we foresee that the concept can be generalized to other functional colloids to create, e.g., optical, electrical, catalytic, and mechanical responses that are not possible in thermodynamic equilibrium.},

We dub this collective and nonperturbative effect a “Lyapunov force, ” which steers the system toward the global minimum of the potential function, even if the full system has a constellation of equilibrium points growing exponentially with the system size.

  abstract     = {Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that interacts with a specific set of client proteins and assists their folding. The underlying molecular mechanisms, involving dynamic transitions between open and closed conformations, are still enigmatic. Combining nuclear magnetic resonance, small-angle x-ray scattering, and biochemical experiments, we have identified a key intermediate state of Hsp90 induced by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding, in which rotation of the Hsp90 N-terminal domain (NTD) yields a domain arrangement poised for closing. This ATP-stabilized NTD rotation is allosterically communicated across the full Hsp90 dimer, affecting distant client sites. By analyzing the interactions of four distinct clients, i.e., steroid hormone receptors (glucocorticoid receptor and mineralocorticoid receptor), p53, and Tau, we show that client-specific interactions with Hsp90 select and enhance the NTD-rotated state and promote closing of the full-length Hsp90 dimer. The p23 co-chaperone shifts the population of Hsp90 toward the closed state, thereby enhancing client interaction and processing.},

  abstract     = {Antiviral defense and virus exclusion from the cell nucleus restrict foreign nucleic acid influx and infection. How the genomes of DNA viruses evade cytosolic pattern recognition and cross the nuclear envelope is incompletely understood. Here, we show that the virion protein V of adenovirus functions as a linchpin between the genome and the capsid, thereby securing particle integrity. Absence of protein V destabilizes cytoplasmic particles and promotes premature genome release, raising cytokine levels through the DNA sensor cGAS. Non-ubiquitinable V yields stable virions, genome misdelivery to the cytoplasm, and increased cytokine levels. In contrast, normal protein V is ubiquitinated at the nuclear pore complex, dissociates from the virion depending on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mib1 and the proteasome, and allows genome delivery into the nucleus for infection. Our data uncover previously unknown cellular and viral mechanisms of viral DNA nuclear import in pathogenesis, vaccination, gene therapy, and synthetic biology.},

Here, we developed an indocyanine green (ICG)–based imaging platform to reveal Fe 3+ in vitro and in vivo. The high sensitivity and specificity of ICG-Fe interaction facilitated MR images with a marked correlation between T 1 signal intensity ratio ( T 1 SIR) changes and Fe 3+ concentration in rodent models and humans. On the basis of these findings, a rational design for coordination-driven self-assembly ICG-Lecithin (ICG/Leci) was proposed to determine Fe 3+ . The enhancement of photoacoustic signal at 890 nm with increasing Fe 3+ concentration showed an over 600\% higher linear slope than that of T 1 SIR changes in animal models. ICG/Leci also promoted a 100\% increase in iron depletion in the liver compared with deferoxamine. The high MR sensitivity and superior photoacoustic contrast, combined with enhanced iron depletion, demonstrate that ICG/Leci is a promising theranostic agent for simultaneous detection and treatment of iron-overload disorders.},

However, the precise mechanisms by which exercise and ROS promote metabolic health remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that skeletal muscle NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), which is induced after exercise, facilitates ROS-mediated adaptive responses that promote muscle function, maintain redox balance, and prevent the development of insulin resistance. Conversely, reductions in skeletal muscle NOX4 in aging and obesity contribute to the development of insulin resistance. NOX4 deletion in skeletal muscle compromised exercise capacity and antioxidant defense and promoted oxidative stress and insulin resistance in aging and obesity. The abrogated adaptive mechanisms, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance could be corrected by deleting the H 2 O 2 -detoxifying enzyme GPX-1 or by treating mice with an agonist of NFE2L2, the master regulator of antioxidant defense. These findings causally link NOX4-derived ROS in skeletal muscle with adaptive responses that promote muscle function and insulin sensitivity.},

Here, we present a ~4-thousand year (ka) resolution rubidium-to-strontium ratio and magnetic susceptibility records between 28.1 and 24.1 million years ago from a distal alluvial sedimentary sequence in the Lanzhou Basin (China) on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau margin. These Asian monsoon precipitation records exhibit prominent short (~110-ka) and long (405-ka) eccentricity cycles throughout the Late Oligocene, with a weak expression of obliquity (41-ka) and precession (19-ka and 23-ka) cycles. We conclude that a combination of eccentricity-modulated low-latitude summer insolation and glacial-interglacial Antarctic Ice Sheet fluctuations drove the eccentricity-paced precipitation variability on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau in the Late Oligocene high CO 2 world by governing regional temperatures, water vapor loading in the western Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the Asian monsoon intensity and displacement.},

Here, we reveal an organizational principle for preventing synaptic cis interactions (“self-avoidance”). Using dendrodendritic synapses between mitral and granule cells in the olfactory bulb as a paradigm, we show that, owing to its higher binding affinity, cerebellin-1 blocks the cis interaction of neurexins with neuroligins, thereby enabling trans neurexin/neuroligin interaction. In mitral cells, ablating either cerebellin-1 or neuroligins severely impaired granule cell➔mitral cell synapses, as did overexpression of wild-type neurexins but not of mutant neurexins unable to bind to neuroligins.

Here, we use structural equation models to explain how tree species richness, asynchronous species dynamics, species-level population stability, and drought-tolerance traits relate to the stability of forest productivity along an experimentally manipulated species richness gradient ranging from 1 to 24 tree species. Tree species richness improved community stability by increasing asynchrony. That is, at higher species richness, interannual variation in productivity among tree species buffered the community against stress-related productivity declines. This effect was positively related to variation in stomatal control and resistance-acquisition strategies among species, but not to the community-weighted means of these trait syndromes. The identified mechanisms by which tree species richness stabilizes forest productivity emphasize the importance of diverse, mixed-species forests to adapt to climate change.},

This organization might suggest proportional brain-wide norepinephrine release during states of heightened vigilance. Here, however, we have found that low-intensity, nonarousing visual stimuli enhanced vigilance-dependent noradrenergic signaling locally in visual cortex, revealed using dual-site fiber photometry to monitor noradrenergic Ca 2+ responses of astroglia simultaneously in cerebellum and visual cortex and two-photon microscopy to monitor noradrenergic axonal terminal Ca 2+ dynamics.

Since histone H3 enzymatically produces Cu 1+ for copper-dependent functions, we asked whether this activity could become detrimental to Fe-S clusters. Here, we report that histone H3–mediated Cu 1+ toxicity is a major determinant of cellular functional pool of Fe-S clusters. Inadequate Fe-S cluster supply, due to diminished assembly as occurs in Friedreich’s ataxia or defective distribution, causes severe metabolic and growth defects in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Decreasing Cu 1+ abundance, through attenuation of histone cupric reductase activity or depletion of total cellular copper, restored Fe-S cluster–dependent metabolism and growth. Our findings reveal an interplay between chromatin and mitochondria in Fe-S cluster homeostasis and a potential pathogenic role for histone enzyme activity and Cu 1+ in diseases with Fe-S cluster dysfunction.},

  abstract     = {Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases. One variant form of late-infantile NCL (vLINCL) is caused by mutations of a lysosomal membrane protein CLN7, the function of which has remained unknown. Here, we identified CLN7 as a novel endolysosomal chloride channel. Overexpression of CLN7 increases endolysosomal chloride currents and enlarges endolysosomes through a Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent way. Human CLN7 and its yeast homolog exhibit characteristics of chloride channels and are sensitive to chloride channel blockers. Moreover, CLN7 regulates lysosomal chloride conductance, luminal pH, and lysosomal membrane potential and promotes the release of lysosomal Ca 2+ through transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1). Knocking out CLN7 causes pathological features that are similar to those of patients with vLINCL, including retinal degeneration and autofluorescent lipofuscin. The pathogenic mutations in CLN7 lead to a decrease in chloride permeability, suggesting that reconstitution of lysosomal Cl − homeostasis may be an effective strategy for the treatment of vLINCL.},

Sulcal depth is a robust yet understudied measure of localized folding, previously associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we report the first genome-wide association study of sulcal depth. Through the multivariate omnibus statistical test (MOSTest) applied to vertex-wise measures from 33, 748 U.K. Biobank participants (mean age, 64.3 years; 52.0\% female), we identified 856 genome-wide significant loci ( P &lt; 5 × 10 −8 ). Comparisons with cortical thickness and surface area indicated that sulcal depth has higher locus yield, heritability, and effective sample size. There was a large amount of genetic overlap between these traits, with gene-based analyses indicating strong associations with neurodevelopmental processes. Our findings demonstrate sulcal depth is a promising neuroimaging phenotype that may enhance our understanding of cortical morphology.},

No statistically significant difference exists in P O 2 between samples at 1.5 Ma and 810 thousand years (ka), suggesting that the Late-Pleistocene imbalance in O 2 sources and sinks began around the time of the transition from 40- to 100-ka glacial cycles in the Mid-Pleistocene between ~1.2 Ma and 700 ka. The absence of a coeval secular increase in atmospheric CO 2 over the past ~1 Ma requires negative feedback mechanisms such as P co 2 -dependent silicate weathering. Fast processes must also act to suppress the immediate P co 2 increase because of the imbalance in O 2 sinks over sources beginning in the Mid-Pleistocene.},

The chemical environment dictates the dominant reactions. Radiolysis-induced reactions in salt solutions have substantially different results in pure water versus water-ammonia, which extends the lifetime of solvated electrons. We investigate the interplay between transport and solution chemistry via the example of solid silver formation from e-beam irradiation of silver nitrate solutions in water and water-ammonia. The addition of ammonia results in the formation of a secondary ring-shaped deposit tens of micrometers in diameter (formed over tens of seconds) around the primary point of deposition (formed over milliseconds). Simulations uncover the relative importance of oxidizing and reducing reactions and transport effects. Our explanation of this behavior involves mechanisms beyond ammonia’s role in extending solvated electron lifetimes.},

Here, we exploit the large array of dental phenotypes in acrodontan lizards, including EDA mutants showing the first vertebrate example of positional transformation in tooth identity, to assess the developmental origins and evolutionary patterning of tooth types and heterodonty. We reveal that pleurodont versus acrodont dentition can be determined by a simple mechanism, where modulation of tooth size through EDA signaling has major consequences on dental formula, thereby providing a new flexible tooth patterning model. Furthermore, such implication of morphoregulation in tooth evolution allows predicting the dental patterns characterizing extant and fossil lepidosaurian taxa at large scale. Together, the origins and diversification of tooth types, long a focus of multiple research fields, can now be approached through evo-devo approaches, highlighting the importance of underexplored dental features for illuminating major evolutionary patterns.},

Here, we demonstrate a multimodal adaptive wearable with moisture-responsive flaps composed of a nylon/metal heterostructure, which can simultaneously regulate convection, sweat evaporation, and mid-infrared emission to accomplish large and rapid heat transfer tuning in response to human perspiration vapor. We show that the metal layer not only plays a crucial role in low-emissivity radiative heating but also enhances the bimorph actuation performance. The multimodal adaptive mechanism expands the thermal comfort zone by 30.7 and 20.7\% more than traditional static textiles and single-modal adaptive wearables without any electricity and energy input, making it a promising design paradigm for personal heat management.},

We present high-resolution paleoenvironmental and archaeological data from the Last Interglacial locality of Neumark-Nord (Germany). Among the factors that shaped vegetation structure and succession in this lake landscape, we identify a distinct ecological footprint of hominin activities, including fire use. We compare these data with evidence from archaeological and baseline sites from the same region. At Neumark-Nord, notably open vegetation coincides with a virtually continuous c. 2000-year-long hominin presence, and the comparative data strongly suggest that hominins were a contributing factor.

These unicellular microorganisms, playing a key biogeochemical role in the ocean, use photoreceptor proteins and red–far-red fluorescent radiation to communicate. A characteristic beaconing signal is generated by rhythmic organelle displacement within the cell cytoplasm, triggering coordinated population behavior.

Through computational linguistic analysis of 237, 126 email exchanges between dyads of 1094 physicians and 4331 English-speaking patients, we assessed matching (concordance/discordance) between physicians’ linguistic complexity and patients’ HL, and classified physicians’ communication strategies. Among low HL patients, discordance was associated with poor understanding ( P = 0.046). Physicians’ “universal tailoring” strategy was associated with better understanding for all patients ( P = 0.01), while “universal precautions” was not. There was an interaction between concordance and communication strategy ( P = 0.021): The combination of dyadic concordance and “universal tailoring” eliminated HL-related disparities.

However, these capabilities are hindered by the structural complexity arising from the integration of multiple heterojunctions and selective absorbers. In this paper, we demonstrate a Ge/MoS 2 van der Waals heterojunction photodetector for VIS- and IR-selective detection capability under near-photovoltaic and photoconductive modes. The simplified single-polarity bias operation using single pixel could considerably reduce structural complexity and minimize peripheral circuitry for multispectral selective detection.

  abstract     = {Embryo morphogenesis involves a complex combination of self-organization mechanisms that generate a great diversity of patterns. However, classical in vitro patterning experiments explore only one self-organization mechanism at a time, thus missing coupling effects. Here, we conjugate two major out-of-equilibrium patterning mechanisms—reaction-diffusion and active matter—by integrating dissipative DNA/enzyme reaction networks within an active gel composed of cytoskeletal motors and filaments. We show that the strength of the flow generated by the active gel controls the mechano-chemical coupling between the two subsystems. This property was used to engineer a synthetic material where contractions trigger chemical reaction networks both in time and space, thus mimicking key aspects of the polarization mechanism observed in C. elegans oocytes. We anticipate that reaction-diffusion active matter will promote the investigation of mechano-chemical transduction and the design of new materials with life-like properties.},

Four Calvin-Benson cycle enzymes and several other plastid proteins are activated in the light by reduction of specific cysteines via thioredoxins, a family of electron transporters operating in redox regulation networks. How does this network link the photosynthetic chain with cellular metabolism? Using a time-resolved redox proteomic method, we have investigated the redox network in vivo during the dark–to–low light transition. We show that redox states of some thioredoxins follow the photosynthetic linear electron transport rate. While some redox targets have kinetics compatible with an equilibrium with one thioredoxin (TRXf), reduction of other proteins shows specific kinetic limitations, allowing fine-tuning of each redox-regulated step of chloroplast metabolism. We identified five new redox-regulated proteins, including proteins involved in Mg 2+ transport and 1 O 2 signaling. Our results provide a system-level functional view of the photosynthetic redox regulation network.},

Although there is increasing evidence that this time interval was associated with weakening of the subpolar gyre (SPG), the sequence of events that led to its weakened state has yet to be explained. Here, we show that the LIA was preceded by an exceptional intrusion of warm Atlantic water into the Nordic Seas in the late 1300s. The intrusion was a consequence of persistent atmospheric blocking over the North Atlantic, linked to unusually high solar activity. The warmer water led to the breakup of sea ice and calving of tidewater glaciers; weakening of the blocking anomaly in the late 1300s allowed the large volume of ice that had accumulated to be exported into the North Atlantic. This led to a weakening of the SPG, setting the stage for the subsequent LIA.},

To develop gene therapy strategies for patients with STRC hearing loss, we generated a mouse model with a targeted deletion in the Strc gene. We devised a novel dual-vector approach to circumvent the size limitation of AAV vectors and drive expression of full-length STRC protein. To target outer hair cells, which are difficult to transduce, we used synthetic AAV9-PHP.B vectors for efficient dual-vector transduction. We report robust recovery of exogenous STRC expression in outer hair cells of Strc -deficient mice, recovery of hair bundle morphology, substantially improved cochlear amplification, and enhanced auditory sensitivity.

Activating mutations in the Ras oncogene are common drivers of many human cancers.

Ablation of cfim-1 increased penetrance of the multivulva phenotype in let-60/Ras gain-of-function (gf) mutants. Depletion of the human cfim-1 ortholog CFIm25 / NUDT21 in cancer cells with KRAS mutations increased their migration and stimulated an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. CFIm25 -depleted cells and cfim-1 mutants displayed biased placement of poly(A) tails to more proximal sites in many conserved transcripts. Functional analysis of these transcripts identified the multidrug resistance protein mrp-5/ABCC1 as a previously unidentified regulator of C. elegans vulva development and cell migration in human cells through alternative 3′UTR usage.

To represent the complex, decade-long, multiparty negotiation process that led to the accord, we use a two time scale dynamical model. The short time scale corresponds to the discussion process occurring at each meeting and is represented as a Friedkin-Johnsen model, a dynamical multiparty model in which the parties show stubbornness, i.e., tend to defend their positions during the discussion. The long time scale behavior is determined by concatenating multiple Friedkin-Johnsen models (one for each meeting). The proposed model, tuned on real data extracted from the Paris Agreement meetings, achieves consensus on a time horizon similar to that of the real negotiations. Remarkably, the model is also able to identify a series of parties that exerted a key leadership role in the Paris Agreement negotiation process.},

Combined transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging in macaques demonstrate credit assignment–related activity in prefrontal area 47/12o, and when this signal was disrupted with TUS, choice value representations across the brain were impaired. As a consequence, behavior was no longer guided by choice value, and decision-making was poorer. By contrast, global reward state–related activity in the adjacent anterior insula remained intact and determined decision-making after prefrontal disruption.},

We also document how these patterns vary by the propensity of graduating from college. We find modest wage returns for mid-propensity college graduates, but large returns for low-propensity and, for men, high-propensity college graduates.

Here, we used an approach encompassing analysis of behavioral, physiological, transcriptomic, and epigenomic effects of CD and consequences of restoring fasting/feeding cycles through time-restricted feeding (tRF) in mice. Results show that CD perturbs glucose homeostasis through disruption of pancreatic β cell function and loss of circadian transcriptional and epigenetic identity. In contrast, restoration of fasting/feeding cycle prevented CD-mediated dysfunction by reestablishing circadian regulation of glucose tolerance, β cell function, transcriptional profile, and reestablishment of proline and acidic amino acid–rich basic leucine zipper (PAR bZIP) transcription factor DBP expression/activity. This study provides mechanistic insights into circadian regulation of β cell function and corresponding beneficial effects of tRF in prevention of T2DM.},

Unexpectedly, these splicing defects were restricted to only Purkinje cells, disrupting the expression of critical homeostatic regulators including ITPR1 , GRID2 , and CA8 . Abundant genotoxic R loops were also found at these Purkinje cell gene loci, further exacerbating DNA damage and transcriptional disruption. Using ATAC-seq to profile global chromatin accessibility in the cerebellum, we found a notably unique chromatin conformation specifically in Purkinje chromatin at the affected gene loci, thereby promoting susceptibility to DNA damage.

Locally, we found that the bidirectional ligand-receptor interactions at the 100-μm-wide cluster-cluster boundary contribute to maintaining intratumor architecture and the PROM1 + and CD47 + cancer stem cell niches are related to TME remodeling and tumor metastasis.

Here, we find that Fanconi anemia suppressor genes are acting in the mitochondria to protect mtDNA replication forks from instability. Specifically, Fanconi anemia patient cells show a loss of nascent mtDNA through MRE11 nuclease degradation. In contrast to DNA replication fork stability, which requires pathway activation by FANCD2-FANCI monoubiquitination and upstream FANC core complex genes, mitochondrial replication fork protection does not, revealing a mechanistic and genetic separation between mitochondrial and nuclear genome stability pathways. The degraded mtDNA causes hyperactivation of cGAS-dependent immune signaling resembling the unphosphorylated ISG3 response. Chemical inhibition of MRE11 suppresses this innate immune signaling, identifying MRE11 as a nuclease responsible for activating the mtDNA-dependent cGAS/STING response. Collective results establish a previously unknown molecular pathway for mtDNA replication stability and reveal a molecular handle to control mtDNA-dependent cGAS activation by inhibiting MRE11 nuclease.},

The normal mode of the cavity-mediated strongly coupled nanoresonators is used as the working medium, and an Otto cycle is realized by extracting work between two phononic thermal reservoirs. The heat engine performance is characterized in both normal mode and bare mode pictures, which reveals that the correlation of two membranes plays a substantial role during the thermodynamic cycle. Moreover, a straight-twin nanomechanical engine is implemented by engineering the normal modes and operating two cylinders out of phase. Our results demonstrate an essential class of heat engine in cavity optomechanical systems and provide an ideal platform platform for investigating heat engines of interacting subsystems in small scales with controllability and scalability.},

Sexually transmitted infections and homicides showed higher rates in larger cities (superlinear scaling). Tuberculosis mortality behaved sublinearly in U.S. and Mexican cities and superlinearly in other Latin American cities. Other communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional deaths, and deaths due to noncommunicable diseases were generally sublinear in the United States and linear or superlinear in Latin America.

To understand how the rhythmic activity in motor circuits is acquired during development of protochordate Ciona , we investigated the coordination of the motor response by identifying a single pair of oscillatory motor neurons (MN2/A10.64). The MN2 neurons had Ca 2+ oscillation with an ~80-s interval that was cell autonomous even in a dissociated single cell. The Ca 2+ oscillation of MN2 coincided with the early tail flick (ETF). The spikes of the membrane potential in MN2 gradually correlated with the rhythm of ipsilateral muscle contractions in ETFs. The optogenetic experiments indicated that MN2 is a necessary and sufficient component of ETFs. These results indicate that MN2 is indispensable for the early spontaneous rhythmic motor behavior of Ciona .

Cytochrome c oxidase (C c O), which mediates the rate-limiting step in mitochondrial respiration, is remodeled during development and in response to changes of oxygen availability, but there has been little study of C c O remodeling during inflammation. Here, we describe an elegant molecular switch mediated by the bifunctional transcript C15orf48 , which orchestrates the substitution of the C c O subunit NDUFA4 by its paralog C15ORF48 in primary macrophages. Expression of C15orf48 is a conserved response to inflammatory signals and occurs in many immune-related pathologies. In rheumatoid arthritis, C15orf48 mRNA is elevated in peripheral monocytes and proinflammatory synovial tissue macrophages, and its expression positively correlates with disease severity and declines in remission. C15orf48 is also expressed by pathogenic macrophages in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Study of a rare metabolic disease syndrome provides evidence that loss of the NDUFA4 subunit supports proinflammatory macrophage functions.},

UCP1 deficiency exacerbates dietary obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, and atherogenesis in mice, which was not rectified by reconstitution of UCP1 in interscapular brown adipose tissue. Mechanistically, lack of UCP1 augments mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial superoxide, leading to hyperactivation of the NLRP3-inflammasome and caspase-1–mediated maturation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). UCP1 deficiency–evoked deterioration of vascular dysfunction and atherogenesis is reversed by IL-1β neutralization or a chemical mitochondrial uncoupler. Furthermore, UCP1 knockin pigs (which lack endogenous UCP1) are refractory to vascular inflammation and coronary atherosclerosis. Thus, UCP1 acts as a gatekeeper to prevent NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β production in the vasculature, thereby conferring a protective effect against cardiovascular diseases.},

The harmonics dispersion relation (HDR), derived by the theory, provides direct and exact prediction of the collective harmonics spectrum in the frequency–wave number domain and does so without prior knowledge of the u = u ( x , t ) solution. It is valid throughout the evolution of a distorting unbalanced wave or the steady-steady propagation of a balanced wave with waveform invariance. The new relation is shown to be a special case of the general nonlinear dispersion relation (NDR), which is also derived. The theory is examined on a diverse range of cases of one-dimensional elastic waves and shown to hold irrespective of the spatial form of the initial wave profile, type and strength of the nonlinearity, and the level of dispersion in the linear limit. Another direct outcome of the general NDR is an analytical condition for soliton synthesis.},

The O 3 chemistry exhibits rapid transition in chemical regimes. Within a few daylight hours, the O 3 formation substantially slows and is largely limited by the abundance of nitrogen oxides (NO x ). This finding supports previous observations that O 3 formation is enhanced when VOC-rich wildfire smoke mixes into NO x -rich urban plumes, thereby deteriorating urban air quality.

CoqF evolved early in eukaryotes and became widely distributed in photosynthetic and related organisms ranging from plants, algae, apicomplexans, and euglenids. Independent alternative gene losses in different groups and lateral gene transfer have ramified CoqF across the eukaryotic tree with predominance in green lineages. The exclusive presence of CoqF in Streptophyta hints at an association of the flavoenzyme with photoautotrophy in terrestrial environments. CoqF provides a phylogenetic marker distinguishing eukaryotes and represents a previously unknown target for drug design against parasitic protists.},

The conserved murine enhancer promotes hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) genesis, and a single-nucleotide human variant in an Ets motif attenuates chemotherapy-induced hematopoietic regeneration. We describe “conditionally pathogenic” (CP) enhancer motif variants that differentially affect hematopoietic development and regeneration. The Ets motif variant functioned autonomously in hematopoietic cells to disrupt hematopoiesis. Because an epigenetically silenced normal allele can exacerbate phenotypes of a pathogenic heterozygous variant, we engineered a bone marrow failure model harboring the Ets motif variant and a severe enhancer mutation on the second allele. Despite normal developmental hematopoiesis, regeneration in response to chemotherapy, inflammation, and a therapeutic HSC mobilizer was compromised. The CP paradigm informs mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity and clinical genetics.},

Unfortunately, their preparation has yet to be achieved because the wafer-scale etching needs ultralong time and damages amphoteric VO 2 whether in acid or alkaline etchants. Here, we achieved wafer-scale f-VO 2 films by a nano-pinhole permeation-etching strategy in 6 min, far less than that by side etching (thousands of minutes). The f-VO 2 films retain their pristine metal-to-insulator transition and intrinsic mechanical properties and can be conformably transferred to arbitrary substrates. Integration of f-VO 2 films into diverse large-scale smart devices, including terahertz modulators, camouflageable photoactuators, and temperature-indicating strips, shows advantages in low insertion loss, fast response, and low triggering power. These f-VO 2 films find more intriguing applications by heterogeneous integration with other functional materials.},

  abstract     = {The neurokinin 1 receptor (NK 1 R) is involved in inflammation and pain transmission. This pathophysiologically important G protein–coupled receptor is predominantly activated by its cognate agonist substance P (SP) but also by the closely related neurokinins A and B. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of SP-bound NK 1 R in complex with its primary downstream signal mediators, G q and G s . Our structures reveal how a polar network at the extracellular, solvent-exposed receptor surface shapes the orthosteric pocket and that NK 1 R adopts a noncanonical active-state conformation with an interface for G protein binding, which is distinct from previously reported structures. Detailed comparisons with antagonist-bound NK 1 R crystal structures reveal that insurmountable antagonists induce a distinct and long-lasting receptor conformation that sterically blocks SP binding. Together, our structures provide important structural insights into ligand and G protein promiscuity, the lack of basal signaling, and agonist- and antagonist-induced conformations in the neurokinin receptor family.},

The droplets were believed to provide a homogeneous environment in which dopant atoms and molecules could move and react almost as in free space but at temperatures close to absolute zero. Here, we report ultrafast x-ray diffraction experiments on xenon-doped 3 He and 4 He nanodroplets, demonstrating that the unavoidable rotational excitation of isolated droplets leads to highly anisotropic and inhomogeneous interactions between the host matrix and enclosed dopants. Superfluid 4 He droplets are laced with quantum vortices that trap the embedded particles, leading to the formation of filament-shaped clusters. In comparison, dopants in 3 He droplets gather in diffuse, ring-shaped structures along the equator. The shapes of droplets carrying filaments or rings are direct evidence that rotational excitation is the root cause for the inhomogeneous dopant distributions.},

We found that nickel nanoparticles promote both heterogeneous nucleation of the first layer of molybdenum disulfide and simultaneously catalyzes homoepitaxial tip growth of a second layer via a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism, resulting in bilayer nanoribbons with width controlled by the nanoparticle diameter. Simulations further confirm the VLS growth mechanism toward nanoribbons and its orders of magnitude higher growth speed compared to the conventional noncatalytic growth of flakes. Width-dependent Coulomb blockade oscillation observed in the transfer characteristics of the nanoribbons at temperatures up to 60 K evidences the value of this proposed synthesis strategy for future nanoelectronics.},

The occurrence and order of leaching of Sr (A-site) and Sc/Co (B-site) were controlled by tailoring the thermodynamic stability of B-site. Sr leaching from A-site mainly generates more electrochemical surface area for the reaction, and additional leaching of Sc/Co from B-site triggers the formation of a honeycomb-like IrO x H y phase with a notable increase in intrinsic activity. A thorough surface reconstruction with dual-site metal leaching induces an activity improvement by approximately two orders of magnitude, which makes the reconstructed SrCo 0.5 Ir 0.5 O 3 among the best for water oxidation in acid.},

However, interactions between microglia and myelin under normal physiological conditions have been largely overlooked. This review summarizes recent research indicating that the unique properties of microglia evident in disease states also enable microglia to regulate myelination during development and throughout life. This includes phagocytosis of cells and myelin membrane as well as the release of trophic factors, cytokines, and chemokines. The ability of microglia to sense neuronal activity and molecular features of the microenvironment enables them to optimize myelination by influencing early oligodendrogenesis, myelin formation, and removal of aberrantly targeted myelin. Understanding how microglia participate in myelination under normal conditions provides a new perspective that will increase understanding of developmental abnormalities.},

At physiological temperatures, photochemical reactivity does not only limit imaging at multiple scales but is also toxic to biochemical reactions that maintain cellular organization. Here, we present cryoprotectant-free ultrarapid cryo-arrest directly on a multimodal fluorescence microscope that preserves the out-of-equilibrium molecular organization of living cells. This allows the imaging of dynamic processes before cryo-arrest in combination with precise molecular pattern determination at multiple scales within the same cells under cryo-arrest.

  abstract     = {Because of their photosynthesis-dependent lifestyle, cyanobacteria evolved sophisticated regulatory mechanisms to adapt to oscillating day-night metabolic changes. How they coordinate the metabolic switch between autotrophic and glycogen-catabolic metabolism in light and darkness is poorly understood. Recently, c-di-AMP has been implicated in diurnal regulation, but its mode of action remains elusive. To unravel the signaling functions of c-di-AMP in cyanobacteria, we isolated c-di-AMP receptor proteins. Thereby, the carbon-sensor protein SbtB was identified as a major c-di-AMP receptor, which we confirmed biochemically and by x-ray crystallography. In search for the c-di-AMP signaling function of SbtB, we found that both SbtB and c-di-AMP cyclase–deficient mutants showed reduced diurnal growth and that c-di-AMP–bound SbtB interacts specifically with the glycogen-branching enzyme GlgB. Accordingly, both mutants displayed impaired glycogen synthesis during the day and impaired nighttime survival. Thus, the pivotal role of c-di-AMP in day-night acclimation can be attributed to SbtB-mediated regulation of glycogen metabolism.},

Mice lacking epidermal Mll4 , but not the related enzyme Mll3 ( Kmt2c ), display features of impaired differentiation and human precancerous neoplasms, all of which progress with age. Mll4 deficiency profoundly alters epidermal gene expression and uniquely rewires the expression of key genes and markers of ferroptosis ( Alox12 , Alox12b , and Aloxe3 ).

BAG composed of AG and unmodified BG (10 to 100 μm in size) was prepared as a control. Compared with BAG, CAG had a more uniform porous structure with a pore size of 200 μm and optimal compressive strength of 66 kPa. Furthermore, CAG promoted the M2 phenotype transition of macrophages and up-regulated the osteogenic gene expression of stem cells. The new bone formation in vivo was also accelerated due to the enhanced biomineralization of CAG. Overall, this work suggests CAG with improved interfacial compatibility is an ideal material for bone regeneration application.},

Exploiting time series RNA expression profiles, we identify the up-regulation of Wnt signaling as a key readout of the mechanical input. In this system, the levels of Wnt3 expression correspond to the levels of stretching, and Wnt3 overexpression alone enables successful regeneration in the absence of mechanical stimulation.

When the structure is subsequently modeled as a lattice material with elastic elements, the auxetic behavior is again confirmed through finite element modeling. The cubic symmetry of the original structure means that the auxetic behavior is observed in both perpendicular directions and is close to isotropic in magnitude.

We hypothesized that phosphate-mediated coanchoring of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 together with molecular adjuvants on alum particles could potentiate humoral immunity by promoting extended vaccine kinetics and codelivery of vaccine components to lymph nodes. Modification of RBD immunogens with phosphoserine (pSer) peptides enabled efficient alum binding and slowed antigen clearance, leading to notable increases in germinal center responses and neutralizing antibody titers in mice. Adding phosphate-containing CpG or saponin adjuvants to pSer-RBD:alum immunizations synergistically enhanced vaccine immunogenicity in mice and rhesus macaques, inducing neutralizing responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

We revealed in three murine syngeneic tumor models (B16, MC38, and 3LL) that either genetic knockout ( Grm4 −/− ) or pharmacological inhibition led to significant delay in tumor growth. Mechanistically, perturbation of GRM4 resulted in a strong antitumor immunity by promoting natural killer (NK), CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells toward an activated, proliferative, and functional phenotype. Single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor profiling further defined the clonal expansion and immune landscape changes in CD8 + T cells. We further showed that Grm4 −/− intrinsically activated interferon-γ production in CD8 + T cells through cyclic adenosine 3′, 5′-monophosphate (cAMP)/cAMP response element binding protein–mediated pathway. Our study appears to be of clinical significance as a signature of NK high -GRM4 low and CD8 high -GRM4 low correlated with improved survival in patients with melanoma.

We observed that increased availability of FA in astrocytes induced by cell- and time-selective knockdown of Angptl4 protected against diet-induced obesity, while cell- and time-selective knockdown of Angptl4 -regulated Ppar γ lead to elevated susceptibility to obesity. Overall, our results unravel a previously unidentified role for astrocytic FA metabolism in central control of body weight and glucose homeostasis.},

  abstract     = {Negative refraction is a counterintuitive wave phenomenon that has inspired the development of metamaterials and metasurfaces with negative refractive indices and surface phase discontinuities, respectively. Recent theories have proposed an alternative mechanism for negative refraction: Synthetic gauge fields, induced by either dynamical modulation or motion, can shift a material’s dispersion in momentum space, forcing a positive refractive index medium to exhibit negative refraction above a certain threshold. However, this phenomenon has not previously been observed. Here, we report on the experimental demonstration of gauge field–induced negative refraction in a twisted bilayer acoustic metamaterial. The synthetic gauge fields arise in a projected two-dimensional geometry and can be continuously tuned by varying the wave number along the third dimension. Gauge field–induced waveguiding with backward-propagating modes is also demonstrated in a trilayer configuration. These results introduce a mechanism for performing wave manipulation in artificially engineered materials.},

DegP contains two regulatory PDZ domains, which play key roles in substrate recognition and in the transformation of DegP between inactive hexameric and proteolytic active cage-like structures. Here, we analyze the interaction and dynamics of the DegP PDZ domains underlying this transformation by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy complemented with biochemical cleavage assays. We identify an interdomain molecular lock, which controls the interactions between the two PDZ domains, regulated by fine-tuned temperature-dependent protein dynamics, and which is potentially conserved in proteins harboring tandem PDZ domains.},

Upon injury to the neonatal cerebellum, a normally gliogenic nestin -expressing progenitor (NEP) in the Bergmann glia layer (BgL) undergoes adaptive reprograming to restore granule cell production. However, the cellular states and genes regulating the NEP fate switch are unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and fate mapping, we defined molecular subtypes of NEPs and their lineages under homeostasis and repair. NEPs contain two major subtypes: Hopx + astrogliogenic and Ascl1 + neurogenic NEPs that are further subdivided based on their location, lineage, and differentiation status. Upon injury, an Ascl1 + transitory cellular state arises from Hopx + BgL-NEPs. Furthermore, mutational analysis revealed that induction of Ascl1 is required for adaptive reprogramming by orchestrating a glial-to-neural switch in vivo following injury. Thus, we provide molecular and cellular insights into context-dependent progenitor plasticity and repair mechanisms in the brain.},

Centuries of deforestation, flow regulation, and channel engineering have substantially reduced riverine large wood fluxes to the oceans. Here, we use contemporary records of wood flux to reservoirs and coastal regions to estimate the magnitude of potential contemporary global wood fluxes. We estimate that 4.7 million m 3 of large wood could enter the oceans each year (the 95\% prediction interval range is ~300, 000 to 70 million m 3 ). This represents an upper bound for contemporary wood fluxes to the oceans because of wood removal from rivers and reservoirs and a lower bound for historical wood fluxes because of deforestation and river engineering. Substantial reduction of this wood flux likely negatively affects coastal and marine environments.},

Photophysical analysis reveals bright (&gt;10 5 counts/s), stable, linearly polarized, and pure quantum emitters in SiN films with a second-order autocorrelation function value at zero time delay g (2) (0) below 0.2 at room temperature. We suggest that the emission originates from a specific defect center in SiN because of the narrow wavelength distribution of the observed luminescence peak.

After binding to SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) protein through its immunoglobulin domain, TREM-2 then activated the CD3ζ/ZAP70 complex, leading to STAT1 phosphorylation and T-bet transcription. In vitro stimulation with M protein-reconstituted pseudovirus or recombinant M protein, and TREM-2 promoted the T helper cell 1 (T H 1) cytokines interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor. In vivo infection of CD4–TREM-2 conditional knockout mice with murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A-59 showed that intrinsic TREM-2 in T cells enhanced T H 1 response and viral clearance, thus aggravating lung destruction.

Mechanistically, TAF7 binds RNAs in the nucleus and delivers them to cytoplasmic polysomes. A broad spectrum of target RNA species, including the HIV-1 transactivation response element, binds TAF7 through consensus CUG motifs within the 3′ untranslated region. Export to the cytoplasm depends on a TAF7 nuclear export signal and occurs by an exportin 1–dependent pathway. Notably, disrupting either TAF7’s RNA binding or its export from the nucleus results in retention of target messenger RNAs in the nucleus and reduced levels of the protein products of TAF7-target RNAs. Thus, TAF7, an essential transcription factor, plays a key role in the regulation of RNA translation, thereby potentially connecting these processes.},

Analyzing 1167 mother-pup pairs, we show that m.5024C&gt;T is preferentially transmitted from low to higher levels but does not reach homoplasmy. Single-cell analysis of the developing mouse oocytes showed the preferential increase in mutant over wild-type mtDNA in the absence of cell division. A similar inheritance pattern is seen in human pedigrees transmitting several pathogenic mtDNA mutations. In m.5024C&gt;T mice, this can be explained by the preferential propagation of mtDNA during oocyte maturation, counterbalanced by purifying selection against high heteroplasmy levels. This could explain how a disadvantageous mutation in a carrier increases to levels that cause disease but fails to fixate, causing multigenerational heteroplasmic mtDNA disorders.},

Subsequent functional validation resulted in a markedly diminished in vitro proliferation, self-renewal, and longevity of MB cells, translating into extended survival and reduced tumor burden in vivo.

  abstract     = {Frenkel excitons are unequivocally responsible for the optical properties of organic semiconductors and are predicted to form bound exciton pairs (biexcitons). These are key intermediates, ubiquitous in many photophysical processes such as the exciton bimolecular annihilation dynamics in such systems. Because of their spectral ambiguity, there has been, to date, only scant direct evidence of bound biexcitons. By using nonlinear coherent spectroscopy, we identify here bound biexcitons in a model polymeric semiconductor. We find, unexpectedly, that excitons with interchain vibronic dispersion reveal intrachain biexciton correlations and vice versa. Moreover, using a Frenkel exciton model, we relate the biexciton binding energy to molecular parameters quantified by quantum chemistry, including the magnitude and sign of the exciton-exciton interaction the intersite hopping energies. Therefore, our work promises general insights into the many-body electronic structure in polymeric semiconductors and beyond, e.g., other excitonic systems such as organic semiconductor crystals, molecular aggregates, photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes, or DNA.},

  abstract     = {The CRISPR-Cas12a has been harnessed as a powerful tool for manipulating targeted gene expression. The possibility to manipulate the activity of CRISPR-Cas12a with a more precise spatiotemporal resolution and deep tissue permeability will enable targeted genome engineering and deepen our understanding of the gene functions underlying complex cellular behaviors. However, currently available inducible CRISPR-Cas12a systems are limited by diffusion, cytotoxicity, and poor tissue permeability. Here, we developed a far-red light (FRL)–inducible CRISPR-Cas12a (FICA) system that can robustly induce gene editing in mammalian cells, and an FRL-inducible CRISPR-dCas12a (FIdCA) system based on the protein-tagging system SUperNova (SunTag) that can be used for gene activation under light-emitting diode–based FRL. Moreover, we show that the FIdCA system can be deployed to activate target genes in mouse livers. These results demonstrate that these systems developed here provide robust and efficient platforms for programmable genome manipulation in a noninvasive and spatiotemporal fashion.},

Utilizing ecological paradigms and dual- electroencephalography recording, we examined the effects of maternal chemosignals on brain-to-brain synchrony during infant-mother and infant-stranger interactions with and without the presence of maternal body odors. Neural connectivity of right-to-right brain theta synchrony emerged across conditions, sensitizing key nodes of the infant’s social brain during its maturational period. Infant-mother interaction elicited greater brain-to-brain synchrony; however, maternal chemosignals attenuated this difference. Infants exhibited more social attention, positive arousal, and safety/approach behaviors in the maternal chemosignals condition, which augmented infant-stranger neural synchrony. Human mothers use interbrain mechanisms to tune the infant’s social brain, and chemosignals may sustain the transfer of infant sociality from the mother-infant bond to life within social groups.},

While the advent of robot-assisted microscopy has helped scale such efforts to high-throughput regimes with the statistical power to detect transient events, time-intensive human annotation is required. We addressed this fundamental limitation with biomarker-optimized convolutional neural networks (BO-CNNs): interpretable computer vision models trained directly on biosensor activity. We demonstrate the ability of BO-CNNs to detect cell death, which is typically measured by trained annotators. BO-CNNs detected cell death with superhuman accuracy and speed by learning to identify subcellular morphology associated with cell vitality, despite receiving no explicit supervision to rely on these features. These models also revealed an intranuclear morphology signal that is difficult to spot by eye and had not previously been linked to cell death, but that reliably indicates death. BO-CNNs are broadly useful for analyzing live microscopy and essential for interpreting high-throughput experiments.},

To test whether this effect was constrained to Aβ, we used a range of in vitro assays to demonstrate that neuroserpin inhibits amyloid formation by several different proteins and protects against the associated cytotoxicity but, unlike other known chaperones, has a poor ability to inhibit amorphous protein aggregation. Collectively, these results suggest that neuroserpin has an unusual chaperone selectivity for intermediates on the amyloid-forming pathway. Bioinformatics analyses identified a highly conserved 14-residue region containing an α helix shared between neuroserpin and the thyroxine-transport protein transthyretin, and we subsequently demonstrated that transthyretin also preferentially inhibits amyloid formation. Last, we used rationally designed neuroserpin mutants to demonstrate a direct involvement of the conserved 14-mer region in its chaperone activity. Identification of this conserved region may prove useful in the future design of anti-amyloid reagents.},

Formal re-identification risk assessment frameworks can inform decisions about whether and how to share data; current techniques, however, focus on scenarios where the data recipients use only one resource for re-identification purposes. This is a concern because recent attacks show that adversaries can access multiple resources, combining them in a stage-wise manner, to enhance the chance of an attack’s success. In this work, we represent a re-identification game using a two-player Stackelberg game of perfect information, which can be applied to assess risk, and suggest an optimal data sharing strategy based on a privacy-utility tradeoff. We report on experiments with large-scale genomic datasets to show that, using game theoretic models accounting for adversarial capabilities to launch multistage attacks, most data can be effectively shared with low re-identification risk.},

Here, following a recent theoretical proposal, we report the direct experimental observation of roton-like dispersion relations in two different three-dimensional metamaterials under ambient conditions. One experiment uses transverse elastic waves in microscale metamaterials at ultrasound frequencies. The other experiment uses longitudinal air-pressure waves in macroscopic channel–based metamaterials at audible frequencies. In both experiments, we identify the roton-like minimum in the dispersion relation that is associated to a triplet of waves at a given frequency. Our work shows that designed interactions in metamaterials beyond the nearest neighbors open unprecedented experimental opportunities to tailor the lowest dispersion branch—while most previous metamaterial studies have concentrated on shaping higher dispersion branches.},

The increase in E2A and E2-2 mRNA abundance correlated with increased cell growth. Elevated E2A and E2-2 mRNA abundance was instructed by increased transcriptional bursting frequencies and elevated E2A and E2-2 mRNA half-lives. The increase in E2A and E2-2 bursting frequencies often occurred at shared interchromosomal transcriptional hubs. We suggest that in naïve B cells low E2A and E2-2 bursting frequencies and high E2A and E2-2 mRNA decay rates instruct noisy gene expression that allows a clonal and swift response to invading pathogens whereas in activated B cells increased transcriptional bursting and low mRNA decay rates dictate an activated B lineage gene program.},

Here, we report the topotactic reduction of La 1− x Ca x NiO 3 single crystals to La 1− x Ca x NiO 2+δ using CaH 2 as the reducing agent. The transformation from the three-dimensional perovskite to the quasi–two-dimensional infinite-layer phase was thoroughly characterized by x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, magnetometry, and electrical transport measurements. Our work demonstrates that the infinite-layer structure can be realized as a bulk phase in crystals with micrometer-sized single domains.

Local delivery is an alternative approach that can still suffer from toxicity in the absence of target selectivity. Here, we show that nanotubes formed from self-assembly of ssDNA-amphiphiles are stable in serum and nucleases. After bilateral brain injections, nanotubes show preferential retention by tumors compared to normal brain and are taken up by glioblastoma cells through scavenger receptor binding and macropinocytosis. After intravenous injection, they cross the BBTB and internalize in glioblastoma cells. In a minimal residual disease model, local delivery of doxorubicin showed signs of toxicity in the spleen and liver. In contrast, delivery of doxorubicin by the nanotubes resulted in no systemic toxicity and enhanced mouse survival. Our results demonstrate that ssDNA nanotubes are a promising drug delivery vehicle to glioblastoma.},

We determine the structure of this transcription initiation complex, revealing a unique mode of promoter recognition, which we term “sigma adaptation.” PafBC inserts between DNA and sigma factor to mediate recognition of hybrid promoters lacking the −35 but featuring the canonical −10 and a PafBC-specific −26 element.

  abstract     = {Chondrites display isotopic variations for moderately volatile elements, the origin of which is uncertain and could have involved evaporation/condensation processes in the protoplanetary disk, incomplete mixing of the products of stellar nucleosynthesis, or aqueous alteration on parent bodies. Here, we report high-precision K and Rb isotopic data of carbonaceous chondrites, providing new insights into the cause of these isotopic variations. We find that the K and Rb isotopic compositions of carbonaceous chondrites correlate with their abundance depletions, the fractions of matrix material, and previously measured Te and Zn isotopic compositions. These correlations are best explained by the variable contribution of chondrules that experienced incomplete condensation from a supersaturated medium. From the data, we calculate an average chondrule cooling rate of ~560 ± 180 K/hour, which agrees with values constrained from chondrule textures and could be produced in shocks induced by nebular gravitational instability or motion of large planetesimals through the nebula.},

Recently, it was shown that TPhCs based on weak topology with a dislocation inherit this robustness and further host topologically protected lower-dimensional localized modes. However, TPhCs with weak topology at optical frequencies have not been demonstrated so far. Here, we use scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy to verify mid-bandgap zero-dimensional light localization close to 100 THz in a TPhC with nontrivial Zak phase and an edge dislocation. We show that because of the weak topology, differently extended dislocation centers induce similarly strong light localization. The experimental results are supported by full-field simulations. Along with the underlying fundamental physics, our results lay a foundation for the application of TPhCs based on weak topology in active topological nanophotonics, and nonlinear and quantum optic integrated devices because of their strong and robust light localization.},

Despite decades of study, the molecular mechanism of serotonin transport, the coupling to ion gradients, and the role of the allosteric site have remained elusive. Here, we present cryo–electron microscopy structures of SERT in serotonin-bound and serotonin-free states, in the presence of sodium or potassium, resolving all fundamental states of the transport cycle. From the SERT-serotonin complex, we localize the substrate-bound allosteric site, formed by an aromatic pocket positioned in the scaffold domain in the extracellular vestibule, connected to the central site via a short tunnel. Together with elucidation of multiple apo state conformations, we provide previously unseen structural understanding of allosteric modulation, demonstrating how SERT binds serotonin from synaptic volumes and promotes unbinding into the presynaptic neurons.},

We report that dynamic interphases formed by anisotropic nanostructures dispersed in a battery electrolyte provide a general method for achieving ordered assembly of metal electrodeposits and high anode reversibility. Interphases formed by anisotropic graphitic carbon nitride nanostructures in colloidal electrolytes are shown to promote formation of vertically aligned and spatially compact (~100\% compactness) zinc electrodeposits with unprecedented, high levels of reversibility (&gt;99.8\%), even at quite high areal capacity (6 to 20 milliampere hour per square centimeter). It is also reported that the same concept enables uniform growth of compact magnesium and aluminum electrodeposits, defining a general pathway toward energy-dense metal batteries based on earth-abundant anode chemistries.},

However, whether and how the augmentation of OXPHOS regulates differentiation of effector CD8 + T cell remains unclear. Here, we found that C1qbp was intrinsically required for such differentiation in antiviral and antitumor immune responses. Activated C1qbp -deficient CD8 + T cells failed to increase mitochondrial respiratory capacities, resulting in diminished acetyl–coenzyme A as well as elevated fumarate and 2-hydroxyglutarate. Consequently, hypoacetylation of H3K27 and hypermethylation of H3K27 and CpG sites were associated with transcriptional down-regulation of effector signature genes. The effector differentiation of C1qbp -sufficient or C1qbp -deficient CD8 + T cells was reversed by fumarate or a combination of histone deacetylase inhibitor and acetate. Therefore, these findings identify C1qbp as a pivotal positive regulator in the differentiation of effector CD8 + T cells and highlight a metabolic-epigenetic axis in this process.},

The tensile strengths of various UniSteel grades are ranging from 600 to 1680 MPa, encompassing the strengths of typical commercial counterparts while exhibiting competent ductility. The prototype parts made of UniSteel press-hardened steel (PHS) grade demonstrate superior side-intrusion resistance over the commercial PHS, and the satisfactory weldability is verified. The UniSteel reduces the resistivity difference within the sheet stack-ups, allowing the simplification of welding processes.

FOXN1’s C-terminal sequence regulates the diffusion velocity within these aggregates and modulates the binding to proximal gene regulatory regions. These dynamics are altered in a patient with a mutant FOXN1 that is modified in its C-terminal sequence. This mutant is transcriptionally inactive and acts as a dominant negative factor displacing wild-type FOXN1 from condensates and causing athymia and severe lymphopenia in heterozygotes. Expression of the mutated mouse ortholog selectively impairs mouse TEC differentiation, revealing a gene dose dependency for individual TEC subtypes.

Defects in the Golgi apparatus lead to various diseases, but its role in organismal longevity is largely unknown. Using a quantitative proteomic approach, we found that a Golgi protein, MON-2, was up-regulated in long-lived Caenorhabditis elegans mutants with mitochondrial respiration defects and was required for their longevity. Similarly, we showed that DOP1/PAD-1, which acts with MON-2 to traffic macromolecules between the Golgi and endosome, contributed to the longevity of respiration mutants. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MON-2 was required for up-regulation of autophagy, a longevity-associated recycling process, by activating the Atg8 ortholog GABARAP/LGG-1 in C. elegans . Consistently, we showed that mammalian MON2 activated GABARAPL2 through physical interaction, which increased autophagic flux in mammalian cells. Thus, the evolutionarily conserved role of MON2 in trafficking between the Golgi and endosome is an integral part of autophagy-mediated longevity.},

  abstract     = {Shape resonances play a central role in many areas of science, but the real-time measurement of the associated many-body dynamics remains challenging. Here, we present measurements of recoil frame angle-resolved photoionization delays in the vicinity of shape resonances of CF 4 . This technique provides insights into the spatiotemporal photoionization dynamics of molecular shape resonances. We find delays of up to ∼600 as in the ionization out of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) with a strong dependence on the emission direction and a pronounced asymmetry along the dissociation axis. Comparison with quantum-scattering calculations traces the asymmetries to the interference of a small subset of partial waves at low kinetic energies and, additionally, to the interference of two overlapping shape resonances in the HOMO-1 channel. Our experimental and theoretical results establish a broadly applicable approach to space- and time-resolved photoionization dynamics in the molecular frame.},

Together, this leads to a simultaneous improvement in both the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the devices, reaching maximum values of 1.184 V and 85\%, respectively, resulting in a champion device efficiency of 23.7\%. This dual interfacial modification is fully compatible with a bulk modification of the perovskite active layer by ionic liquids, leading to both efficient and stable inverted architecture devices.},

Here, we show photonic analogs of SOCs in exciton-polaritons and their condensates in microcavities composed of birefringent lead halide perovskite single crystals. The presence of crystalline anisotropy coupled with splitting in the optical cavity of the transverse electric and transverse magnetic modes gives rise to a non-Abelian gauge field, which can be described by the Rashba-Dresselhaus Hamiltonian near the degenerate points of the two polarization modes. With increasing density, the exciton-polaritons with pseudospin textures undergo phase transitions to competing condensates with orthogonal polarizations. Unlike their pure photonic counterparts, these exciton-polaritons and condensates inherit nonlinearity from their excitonic components and may serve as quantum simulators of many-body SOC processes.},

An individually activated surface Si dangling bond (DB) acts as the single H + receptor. Discrete current signals, generated by the single H + -DB interactions via local Coulomb scattering, are directly detected by the SiNWFETs.

The adaptive radiation of honey bees involved selection on a few genomic “hotspots.” We found 145 genes with independent signatures of selection across all bee lineages, and these genes were highly associated with worker traits.

  abstract     = {Homeostatic modulation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release is a fundamental form of plasticity that stabilizes neural activity, where presynaptic homeostatic depression (PHD) can adaptively diminish synaptic strength. PHD has been proposed to operate through an autocrine mechanism to homeostatically depress release probability in response to excess glutamate release at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. This model implies the existence of a presynaptic glutamate autoreceptor. We systematically screened all neuronal glutamate receptors in the fly genome and identified the glutamate-gated chloride channel ( GluCl α) to be required for the expression of PHD. Pharmacological, genetic, and Ca 2+ imaging experiments demonstrate that GluClα acts locally at axonal terminals to drive PHD. Unexpectedly, GluClα localizes and traffics with synaptic vesicles to drive presynaptic inhibition through an activity-dependent anionic conductance. Thus, GluClα operates as both a sensor and effector of PHD to adaptively depress neurotransmitter release through an elegant autocrine inhibitory signaling mechanism at presynaptic terminals.},

Here, we describe a three-part neural circuit that imparts satiety-dependent modulation of fructose sensing. We show that dorsal fan-shaped body neurons display oscillatory calcium activity when hemolymph glucose is high and that these oscillations require glutamatergic input from SLP-AB or “Janus” neurons projecting from the protocerebrum to the asymmetric body. Suppression of activity in this circuit, either by starvation or by genetic silencing, promotes specific drive for fructose ingestion. This is achieved through neuropeptidergic signaling by tachykinin, which is released from the fan-shaped body when glycemia is high. Tachykinin, in turn, signals to Gr43a-positive fructose sensors to modulate their response to fructose. Together, our results demonstrate how a three-layer neural circuit links the detection of two sugars to produce precise satiety-dependent control of feeding behavior.},

Nerve terminals are likely loci of this vulnerability as they do not store sufficient ATP molecules, needing to synthesize them during activity or suffer acute degradation in performance. The ability of on-demand ATP synthesis to satisfy activity-driven ATP hydrolysis will depend additionally on the magnitude of local resting metabolic processes. We show here that synaptic vesicle (SV) pools are a major source of presynaptic basal energy consumption. This basal metabolic processes arises from SV-resident V-ATPases compensating for a hidden resting H + efflux from the SV lumen. We show that this steady-state H + efflux (i) is mediated by vesicular neurotransmitter transporters, (ii) is independent of the SV cycle, (iii) accounts for up to 44\% of the resting synaptic energy consumption, and (iv) contributes substantially to nerve terminal intolerance of fuel deprivation.},

The nanoparticles in a GLC exhibit non-Gaussian, diffusive motion, signifying dynamic fluctuation of the diffusion coefficient due to the dynamically heterogeneous environment surrounding nanoparticles, including organic ligands on the nanoparticle surface. Our study shows that the dynamics of nanoparticle coalescence is controlled by two elementary processes: diffusion-limited encounter complex formation and the subsequent coalescence of the encounter complex through rotational motion, where surface-passivating ligands play a critical role.},

  abstract     = {Skin allo- and xenotransplantation are the standard treatment for major burns when donor sites for autografts are not available. The relationship between the immune response to foreign grafts and their impact on wound healing has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated changes in collagen architecture after xenogeneic implantation of human biologic scaffolds. We show that collagen deposition in response to the implantation of human split-thickness skin grafts (hSTSGs) containing live cells recapitulates normal skin architecture, whereas human acellular dermal matrix (ADM) grafts led to a fibrotic collagen deposition. We show that macrophage differentiation in response to hSTSG implantation is driven toward regenerative Trem2 + subpopulations and found that hydrogel delivery of these cells significantly accelerated wound closure. Our study identifies the preclinical therapeutic potential of Trem2 + macrophages to mitigate fibrosis and promote wound healing, providing a novel effective strategy to develop advanced cell therapies for complex wounds.},

We genetically inhibited sympathetic innervation in vivo, which resulted in heart enlargement with an increase in cardiomyocyte number. Transcriptomic and protein analysis showed down-regulation of the two clock gene homologs Period1/Period2 (Per1/Per2) accompanied by up-regulation of cell cycle genes. Per1/Per2 deletion increased heart size and cardiomyocyte proliferation, recapitulating sympathetic neuron–deficient hearts. Conversely, increasing sympathetic activity by norepinephrine treatment induced Per1/Per2 and suppressed cardiomyocyte proliferation. We further found that the two clock genes negatively regulate myocyte mitosis entry through the Wee1 kinase pathway. Our findings demonstrate a previously unknown link between cardiac neurons and clock genes in regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart size and provide mechanistic insights for developing neuromodulation strategies for cardiac regen5eration.},

  abstract     = {Replication stress and DNA damage stall replication forks and impede genome synthesis. During S phase, damage tolerance pathways allow lesion bypass to ensure efficient genome duplication. One such pathway is repriming, mediated by Primase-Polymerase (PrimPol) in human cells. However, the mechanisms by which PrimPol is regulated are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that PrimPol is phosphorylated by Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) at a conserved residue between PrimPol’s RPA binding motifs. This phosphorylation is differentially modified throughout the cell cycle, which prevents aberrant recruitment of PrimPol to chromatin. Phosphorylation can also be delayed and reversed in response to replication stress. The absence of PLK1-dependent regulation of PrimPol induces phenotypes including chromosome breaks, micronuclei, and decreased survival after treatment with camptothecin, olaparib, and UV-C. Together, these findings establish that deregulated repriming leads to genomic instability, highlighting the importance of regulating this damage tolerance pathway following fork stalling and throughout the cell cycle.},

In a 14-day circadian paradigm, we assessed glycemic control during simulated night work with either nighttime or daytime eating. Assessment of central (body temperature) and peripheral (glucose and insulin) endogenous circadian rhythms happened during constant routine protocols before and after simulated night work. Nighttime eating led to misalignment between central and peripheral (glucose) endogenous circadian rhythms and impaired glucose tolerance, whereas restricting meals to daytime prevented it.

We successfully trained mice to perform a waiting-for-water-reward delayed gratification task and used these animals in physiological recording and optical manipulation of neuronal activity during the task to explore its neural basis. Our results showed that the activity of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the ventral tegmental area increases steadily during the waiting period. Optical activation or silencing of these neurons, respectively, extends or reduces the duration of waiting. To interpret these data, we developed a reinforcement learning model that reproduces our experimental observations. Steady increases in DAergic activity signal the value of waiting and support the hypothesis that delayed gratification involves real-time deliberation.},

To modulate and probe its function, we have created a novel series of macrocyclic peptides that bind retromer with high affinity and specificity. Crystal structures show that most of the cyclic peptides bind to Vps29 via a Pro-Leu–containing sequence, structurally mimicking known interactors such as TBC1D5 and blocking their interaction with retromer in vitro and in cells. By contrast, macrocyclic peptide RT-L4 binds retromer at the Vps35-Vps26 interface and is a more effective molecular chaperone than reported small molecules, suggesting a new therapeutic avenue for targeting retromer. Last, tagged peptides can be used to probe the cellular localization of retromer and its functional interactions in cells, providing novel tools for studying retromer function.},

The nanodecoys effectively escaped from macrophage capture and enabled prolonged blood circulation after systemic administration.

Cu NPs with high surface coverage of ~85\%, various single NPs and polyelemental alloy NPs were densely fabricated with high uniformity and dispersity. The synthesized Cu NPs on cellulose/carbon paper substrate were used in electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction showing selectivity to ethylene of ~49\% and high stability for over 30 hours of reaction.

Here, by combining the Cambridge Structural Database with a machine learning model of chemical shifts, we construct a statistical basis for probabilistic chemical shift assignment of organic crystals by calculating shifts for more than 200, 000 compounds, enabling the probabilistic assignment of organic crystals directly from their two-dimensional chemical structure. The approach is demonstrated with the 13 C and 1 H assignment of 11 molecular solids with experimental shifts and benchmarked on 100 crystals using predicted shifts.

These low contrast–preferring neurons were rare during passive viewing without training or anesthesia after training. They fired more frequently in correct-choice than incorrect-choice trials. At single-neuron and population levels, they efficiently represented low-contrast orientations. Following training, in addition to generally enhanced excitation, the phase synchronization of spikes to beta oscillations at high contrast was stronger in putative inhibitory than excitatory neurons. The change in excitation-inhibition balance might contribute to low-contrast preference. Thus, low-contrast preference in V1 activity is strengthened in an experience-dependent manner, which may contribute to low-contrast visual discrimination.},

Here, using transgenic mice in which the thermosensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is conditionally knocked out in Nestin-expressing neural stem cells (NSCs), we found that social defeat stress (SDS)–induced hyperthermia activates TRPV4 in NSCs in the dentate gyrus and thereby impairs hippocampal neurogenesis. Specifically, SDS activated TRPV4 in NSCs and induced the externalization of phosphatidylserine in NSCs, which was recognized by the brain-resident macrophage, microglia, and promoted the microglial engulfment of NSCs. SDS-induced impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis was ameliorated by NSC-specific knockout of TRPV4 or pharmacological removal of microglia.

  abstract     = {Structures in living systems cross-regulate via exchange of molecular information to assemble or disassemble on demand and in a coordinated, signal-triggered fashion. DNA strand displacement (DSD) reaction networks allow rational design of signaling and feedback loops, but combining DSD with structural nanotechnology to achieve self-reconfiguring hierarchical system states is still in its infancy. We introduce modular DSD networks with increasing amounts of regulatory functions, such as negative feedback, signal amplification, and signal thresholding, to cross-regulate the transient polymerization/depolymerization of two self-sorting DNA origami nanofibrils and nanotubes. This is achieved by concatenation of the DSD network with molecular information relays embedded on the origami tips. The two origamis exchange information and display programmable transient states observable by TEM and fluorescence spectroscopy. The programmability on the DSD and the origami level is a viable starting point toward more complex lifelike behavior of colloidal multicomponent systems featuring advanced signal processing functions.},

To identify early predictors of mortality within 60 days of symptom onset (DSO), we performed immunovirological assessments on plasma from 279 individuals. On samples collected at DSO11 in a discovery cohort, high severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA (vRNA), low receptor binding domain–specific immunoglobulin G and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and elevated cytokines and tissue injury markers were strongly associated with mortality, including in patients on mechanical ventilation. A three-variable model of vRNA, with predefined adjustment by age and sex, robustly identified patients with fatal outcome (adjusted hazard ratio for log-transformed vRNA = 3.5). This model remained robust in independent validation and confirmation cohorts. Since plasma vRNA’s predictive accuracy was maintained at earlier time points, its quantitation can help us understand disease heterogeneity and identify patients who may benefit from new therapies.},

Here, we demonstrate that expression of the full SEC23A protein (the SEC23B paralog) from the endogenous regulatory elements of Sec23b completely rescues the SEC23B-deficient mouse phenotype. Consistent with these data, while mice with erythroid-specific deletion of either Sec23a or Sec23b do not exhibit CDAII, we now show that mice with erythroid-specific deletion of all four Sec23 alleles die in mid-embryogenesis with features of CDAII and that mice with deletion of three Sec23 alleles exhibit a milder erythroid defect. To test whether the functional overlap between the SEC23 paralogs is conserved in human erythroid cells, we generated SEC23B-deficient HUDEP-2 cells. Upon differentiation, these cells exhibited features of CDAII, which were rescued by increased expression of SEC23A, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for CDAII.},

Here, we show that, by implementing the activation function of a neural network in analog hardware, analog signals can be transmitted to the next layer without unnecessary digital conversion, communication, and processing. We have designed and built compact rectified linear units, with which we constructed a two-layer perceptron using memristive crossbar arrays, and demonstrated a recognition accuracy of 93.63\% for the Modified National Institute of Standard and Technology (MNIST) handwritten digits dataset. The fully hardware-based neural network reduces both the data shuttling and conversion, capable of delivering much higher computing throughput and power efficiency.},

Cardiac optogenetics is promising for its superiority of cell selectivity and high time-space accuracy, but the efficacy of optogenetics relative to the input of light stimulus is detected and controlled separately by discrete instruments in vitro, which suffers from time retardation, energy consumption, and poor portability. Thus, a highly integrated system based on implantable sensors combining closed-loop self-monitoring with simultaneous treatment is highly desired. Here, we report a self-adaptive cardiac optogenetics system based on an original negative stretching-resistive strain sensor array for closed-loop heart rate recording and self-adaptive light intensity control. The strain sensor exhibits a dual and synchronous capability of precise monitor and physiological-electrical-optical regulation. In an in vivo ventricular tachycardia model, our system demonstrates the potential of a negative stretching-resistive device in controlling-in-sensor electronics for wearable/implantable autodiagnosis and telehealth applications.},

Here, we reconstruct the history of Atlantification along the eastern Fram Strait during the past 800 years using precisely dated paleoceanographic records based on organic biomarkers and benthic foraminiferal data. Our results show rapid changes in water mass properties that commenced in the early 20th century—several decades before the documented Atlantification by instrumental records. Comparison with regional records suggests a poleward expansion of subtropical waters since the end of the Little Ice Age in response to a rapid hydrographic reorganization in the North Atlantic. Understanding of this mechanism will require further investigations using climate model simulations.},

We use flow routing to reconstruct drainage networks and river longitudinal profiles, revealing the pattern and extent of their glacially forced reorganization. The overall mean Quaternary (2.6 Ma ago to present) erosion rate is 27 m/Ma, rising within ice-streaming corridors to 35 m/Ma (and locally reaching 400 m/Ma) and falling to 22 m/Ma in non–ice-streaming regions.

Our results suggest that arc magmas derived from source regions influenced by a greater serpentinite (±AOC) fluid component record higher oxygen fugacity. The incorporation of this component into the subarc mantle is controlled by the subduction system’s thermodynamic conditions and geometry.

Reflecting large racial disparities, the population prevalence is only 3.4\% for Latinos and 1.4\% for white men. About 9\% of black men in the state cohort were held in solitary for more than 15 consecutive days, violating the United Nations standards for minimum treatment of incarcerated people. Nearly 1 in 100 black men experienced solitary for a year or longer by age 32. Racial disparities are similar for women, but rates are lower. A decomposition shows that black men’s high risk of solitary confinement stems primarily from their high imprisonment rate.

In contrast to disease-promoting cell surface PrP C , extracellular fragments act neuroprotective by blocking neurotoxic disease-associated protein conformers. Fittingly, PrP C release by the metalloprotease ADAM10 represents a protective mechanism. We used biochemical, cell biological, morphological, and structural methods to investigate mechanisms stimulating this proteolytic shedding. Shed PrP negatively correlates with prion conversion and is markedly redistributed in murine brain in the presence of prion deposits or amyloid plaques, indicating a sequestrating activity. PrP-directed ligands cause structural changes in PrP C and increased shedding in cells and organotypic brain slice cultures. As an exception, some PrP-directed antibodies targeting repetitive epitopes do not cause shedding but surface clustering, endocytosis, and degradation of PrP C . Both mechanisms may contribute to beneficial actions described for PrP-directed ligands and pave the way for new therapeutic strategies against currently incurable neurodegenerative diseases.},

Here, we present speleothem records from southeastern China in conjunction with other paleoclimatic and archeological data to show that the Liangzhu culture collapsed within a short and anomalously wet period between 4345 ± 32 and 4324 ± 30 years ago, supporting the hypothesis that the city was abandoned after large-scale flooding and inundation. We further show that the demise of Neolithic cultures in the YRD occurred within an extended period of aridity that started at ~4000 ± 45 years ago. We suggest that the major hydroclimatic changes between 4300 and 3000 years ago may have resulted from an increasing frequency of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation in the context of weakened Northern Hemisphere summer insolation.},

  abstract     = {Design of innovative strategies for oral drug delivery is particularly promising for intestinal disease treatment. However, many obstacles such as poor therapeutic efficacy and low bioavailability and biocompatibility remain to be addressed. Here, we report a versatile formulation based on a helical-shaped cyanobacterium, Spirulina platensis (SP), loaded with curcumin (SP@Curcumin) for the treatment of colon cancer and colitis, two types of intestinal diseases. In radiotherapy for colon cancer, SP@Curcumin could mediate combined chemo- and radiotherapy to inhibit tumor progression while acting as a radioprotector to scavenge reactive oxygen species induced by the high dose of x-ray radiation in healthy tissues. SP@Curcumin could also reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines and thereby exerted anti-inflammatory effects against colitis. The oral drug delivery system not only leveraged the biological properties of microalgal carriers to improve the bioavailability of loaded drugs but also performed excellent antitumor and anti-inflammation efficacy for intestinal disease treatment.},

Here, we demonstrate an ionic hydrogel thermoelectric material with giant negative thermopower obtained by synergistic coordination and hydration interactions. The ionic hydrogel, made of polyvinyl alcohol and sodium hydroxide, is prepared by simple dry-annealed process and exhibits a thermopower of up to −37.61 millivolts per kelvin, an extremely high absolute thermopower for electronic and ionic conductors. This ionic hydrogel is promising for the design of high-thermopower ionic thermoelectric materials and the low-grade heat energy harvesting.},

SERCA is regulated by sarcolipin (SLN), a single-pass membrane protein that uncouples Ca 2+ transport from ATP hydrolysis, promoting futile enzymatic cycles and heat generation. The molecular determinants for regulating heat release by the SERCA/SLN complex are unclear. Using thermocalorimetry, chemical cross-linking, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy in oriented phospholipid bicelles, we show that SERCA’s functional uncoupling and heat release rate are dictated by specific SERCA/SLN intramembrane interactions, with the carboxyl-terminal residues anchoring SLN to the SR membrane in an inhibitory topology. Systematic deletion of the carboxyl terminus does not prevent the SERCA/SLN complex formation but reduces uncoupling in a graded manner. These studies emphasize the critical role of lipids in defining the active topology of SLN and modulating the heat release rate by the SERCA/SLN complex, with implications in fat metabolism and basal metabolic rate.},

Recent advances have focused on the development of new encoding algorithms, automation, preservation, and sequencing technologies. Despite progress in these areas, the most challenging hurdle in deployment of DNA data storage remains the write throughput, which limits data storage capacity. We have developed the first nanoscale DNA storage writer, which we expect to scale DNA write density to 25 × 10 6 sequences per square centimeter, three orders of magnitude improvement over existing DNA synthesis arrays. We show confinement of DNA synthesis to an area under 1 square micrometer, parallelized over millions of nanoelectrode wells and then successfully write and decode a message in DNA. DNA synthesis on this scale will enable write throughputs to reach megabytes per second and is a key enabler to a practical DNA data storage system.},

In this work, we developed a microneedle sensor on a hybrid substrate based on high Young’s modulus epoxy siloxane for the microneedles and low Young’s modulus polydimethylsiloxane for the conformable substrate. Polyaniline was deposited on the microneedle for pH sensing. The mechanical durability of the device was assessed by insertion into pig skin 1000 times.

Through analysis of oocytes and early embryos in human, bovine, porcine, rat, and mouse, we revealed remarkable species-specific innovations as no single animal model fully recapitulates the human epigenetic transition. In rodent oocytes, transcription-dependent DNA methylation allows methylation of maternal imprints but not intergenic paternal imprints. Unexpectedly, prevalent DNA hypermethylation, paralleled by H3K36me2/3, also occurs in nontranscribed regions in porcine and bovine oocytes, except for megabase-long “CpG continents (CGCs)” where imprinting control regions preferentially reside. Broad H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 domains exist in nonhuman oocytes, yet only rodent H3K27me3 survives beyond genome activation. Coincidently, regulatory elements preferentially evade H3K27me3 in rodent oocytes, and failure to do so causes aberrant embryonic gene repression. Hence, the diverse mammalian innovations of parental-to-embryonic transition center on a delicate “to-methylate-or-not” balance in establishing imprints while protecting other regulatory regions.},

The enthesis connects tendon and bone, two vastly different architectured materials, and exhibits toughness across a wide range of loadings. Understanding the mechanisms by which this is achieved could inform the development of engineered attachments. Integrating experiments, simulations, and previously unexplored imaging that enabled simultaneous observation of mineralized and unmineralized tissues, we identified putative mechanisms of enthesis toughening in a mouse model and then manipulated these mechanisms via in vivo control of mineralization and architecture. Imaging uncovered a fibrous architecture within the enthesis that controls trade-offs between strength and toughness. In vivo models of pathology revealed architectural adaptations that optimize these trade-offs through cross-scale mechanisms including nanoscale protein denaturation, milliscale load-sharing, and macroscale energy absorption. Results suggest strategies for optimizing architecture for tough bimaterial attachments in medicine and engineering.},

Via this optimized structure, our sensor exhibits 98\% strain insensitivity up to 50\% strain and a low pressure detection limit of 0.2 Pa.

By direct observations of the 5–unit cell–thick BaTiO 3 barrier with high-angle annular dark-field imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy, oxygen vacancies are found to aggregate at the Pt/BaTiO 3 interface during repetitive switching, leading to a ferroelectric dead layer preventing domain nucleation and growth. Severe oxygen deficiency also makes BaTiO 3 lattices energetically unfavorable and lastly induces a destruction of local perovskite structure of the barrier. Ferroelectric properties are thus degraded, which reduces barrier contrast between ON and OFF states and smears electroresistance characteristics of Pt/BaTiO 3 /Nb:SrTiO 3 FTJs.

Using glutamate uncaging, we found in the neurons that synapses were clustered at distal dendritic branches. Modeling revealed that this strengthened sublinear integration within a dendritic tree but enabled the integration of signals from different trees when inputs grow stronger, preventing monoaural output and maintaining the dynamic range of binaural computation. The extent of this clustering differed according to dendritic length and frequency tuning of neurons, being most prominent for long dendrites and low-frequency tuning. This ensures binaural spatial hearing for wide intensity and frequency ranges, highlighting the importance of coupling of synapse geometry with dendritic morphology and input frequency in sensory signal processing.},

We discovered that, contrary to the prevailing view, angiogenesis following ischemic muscle injury in mice was not driven by endothelial sprouting. Instead, real-time imaging revealed the emergence of wide-caliber, primordial conduits with ultralow flow that rapidly transformed into a hierarchical neocirculation by transluminal bridging and intussusception. This process was accelerated by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2). We probed this response by developing the first live-cell model of transluminal endothelial bridging using microfluidics. Endothelial cells subjected to ultralow shear stress could reposition inside the flowing lumen as pillars. Moreover, the low-flow lumen proved to be a privileged location for endothelial cells with reduced VEGFR2 signaling capacity, as VEGFR2 mechanosignals were boosted. These findings redefine regenerative angiogenesis in muscle as an intussusceptive process and uncover a basis for its launch.},

  abstract     = {Ribosomes execute the transcriptional program in every cell. Critical to sustain nearly all cellular activities, ribosome biogenesis requires the translation of ~200 factors of which 80 are ribosomal proteins (RPs). As ribosome synthesis depends on RP mRNA translation, a priority within the translatome architecture should exist to ensure the preservation of ribosome biogenesis capacity, particularly under adverse growth conditions. Here, we show that under critical metabolic constraints characterized by mTOR inhibition, LARP1 complexed with the 40 S subunit protects from ribophagy the mRNAs regulon for ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis, acutely preparing the translatome to promptly resume ribosomes production after growth conditions return permissive. Characterizing the LARP1-protected translatome revealed a set of 5′TOP transcript isoforms other than RPs involved in energy production and in mitochondrial function, among other processes, indicating that the mTOR-LARP1-5′TOP axis acts at the translational level as a primary guardian of the cellular anabolic capacity.},

The receptors can detect the electric field generated by the biomechanical activity of the prey. By comparing the intensity of the electric fields sensed by each receptor in the network, the animals can perceive the relative positions of the prey without making physical contact. Inspired by this capacity for prey localization, we developed a soft artificial electroreceptor that can detect the relative positions of nearby objects in a noncontact manner by sensing the electric fields that originate from the objects. By wearing the artificial receptor, one can immediately receive spatial information of a nearby object via auditory signals. The soft artificial electroreceptor is expected to expand the ways we can perceive space by providing a sensory modality that did not evolve naturally in human beings.},

Here, in the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens , a hemipteran rice pest, we identified a feminizing switch or a female determiner ( Nlfmd ) that encodes a serine/arginine-rich protein. Knockdown of Nlfmd in female nymphs resulted in masculinization of both the somatic morphology and doublesex splicing. The female-specific isoform of Nlfmd , Nlfmd-F , is maternally deposited and zygotically transcribed. Depletion of Nlfmd by maternal RNAi or CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in female-specific embryonic lethality. Knockdown of an hnRNP40 family gene named female determiner 2 ( Nlfmd2 ) also conferred masculinization. In vitro experiments showed that an Nlfmd2 isoform, NlFMD2 340 , bound the RAAGAA repeat motif in the Nldsx pre-mRNA and formed a protein complex with NlFMD-F to modulate Nldsx splicing, suggesting that NlFMD2 may function as an RNA binding partner of the feminizing switch NlFMD.

Here, we present a model of disease pathogenesis that builds on our observation that the synaptic immediate early gene NPTX2 is reduced in cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with recent onset schizophrenia. NPTX2 plays an essential role in maintaining excitatory homeostasis by adaptively enhancing circuit inhibition. NPTX2 function requires activity-dependent exocytosis and dynamic shedding at synapses and is coupled to circadian behavior. Behavior-linked NPTX2 trafficking is abolished by mutations that disrupt select activity-dependent plasticity mechanisms of excitatory neurons. Modeling NPTX2 loss of function results in failure of parvalbumin interneurons in their adaptive contribution to behavioral stress, and animals exhibit multiple neuropsychiatric domains. Because the genetics of schizophrenia encompasses diverse proteins that contribute to excitatory synapse plasticity, the identified vulnerability of NPTX2 function can provide a framework for assessing the impact of genetics and the intersection with stress.},

CaCTS identified candidate MTFs across 34 tumor types and 140 subtypes including predictions for cancer types/subtypes for which MTFs are unknown, including e.g. PAX8, SOX17, and MECOM as candidates in ovarian cancer (OvCa). In OvCa cells, consistent with known MTF properties, these factors are required for viability, lie proximal to superenhancers, co-occupy regulatory elements globally, co-bind loci encoding OvCa biomarkers, and are sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of transcription. Our predictions of MTFs, especially for tumor types with limited understanding of transcriptional drivers, pave the way to therapeutic targeting of MTFs in a broad spectrum of cancers.},

In this work, we have synthesized a series of single and dual atomic catalysts on the carbon nitride nanosheets. Adjusting the ratio of La and Zn atomic sites produces syngas with a wide range of CO/H 2 ratios. Moreover, the ZnLa-1/CN electrocatalyst generates the syngas with a ratio of CO/H 2 = 0.5 at a wide potential range, and the total FE of CO2RR reaches 80\% with good stability. Density functional theory calculations have confirmed that the Zn and La affect electronic structures and determine the formation of CO and H 2 , respectively. This work indicates a promising strategy in the development of atomic catalysts for more controllable CO 2 RR.},

Taxa-specific patch length and organism size exhibited negative size scaling relationships. Organism size explained 21 to 30\% of the variance in patch length.

While this is often attributed to van der Waals (vdW) bonding of 2D materials, nanoscale and quantum confinement effects can also act to modify the atomic interactions of a 2D material, producing unique interfacial properties. Here, we demonstrate the low-friction behavior of magnetene, a non-vdW 2D material obtained via the exfoliation of magnetite, showing statistically similar friction to benchmark vdW 2D materials. We find that this low friction is due to 2D confinement effects of minimized potential energy surface corrugation, lowered valence states reducing surface adsorbates, and forbidden low-damping phonon modes, all of which contribute to producing a low-friction 2D material.},

This coating contained less interfacial defects compared to classic nanolayered coatings with continuous nanolayers and presented record-breaking wear rates at the macroscale. Finite Element analysis was performed and micropatterning strategy was used to reduce the wear rate further.

In the hybrid zygotes and embryos, CENH3 and essential centromere proteins load preferentially on the CENH3-rich centromeres of the wild-type parent, while CENH3-depleted centromeres fail to reconstitute new CENH3-chromatin and the kinetochore and are frequently lost. Genome elimination is opposed by E3 ubiquitin ligase VIM1. We propose a model based on cooperative binding of CENH3 to chromatin to explain the differential CENH3 loading rates.

To identify metabolic dependencies in cancers with NRF2 activation, we performed a metabolism-focused CRISPR screen. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which was recently shown to be dispensable in Ras-driven tumors, was a top dependency. G6PD catalyzes the committed step of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway that produces NADPH and nucleotide precursors, but neither antioxidants nor nucleosides rescued. Instead, G6PD loss triggered tricarboxylic acid (TCA) intermediate depletion because of up-regulation of the alternative NADPH-producing enzymes malic enzyme and isocitrate dehydrogenase. In vivo, G6PD impairment markedly suppressed KEAP1 mutant tumor growth, and this suppression was further augmented by TCA depletion by glutaminase inhibition. Thus, G6PD inhibition–induced TCA depletion is a therapeutic vulnerability of NRF2-activated cancer.},

Nevertheless, the synthesized graphene is typically a polycrystalline film with high density of uncontrolled defects, resulting in a low carrier mobility and high sheet resistance. Here, we report the direct growth of highly oriented monolayer graphene films on sapphire wafers. Our growth strategy is achieved by designing an electromagnetic induction heating CVD operated at elevated temperature, where the high pyrolysis and migration barriers of carbon species are easily overcome. Meanwhile, the embryonic graphene domains are guided into good alignment by minimizing its configuration energy. The thus obtained graphene film accordingly manifests a markedly improved carrier mobility (~14, 700 square centimeters per volt per second at 4 kelvin) and reduced sheet resistance (~587 ohms per square), which compare favorably with those from catalytic growth on polycrystalline metal foils and epitaxial growth on silicon carbide.},

  abstract     = {Spin-spin interactions in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are pivotal because radiative recombination is largely determined by triplet-to-singlet conversion, also called reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). To explore the underlying process, we apply a spin-resonance spectral hole-burning technique to probe electroluminescence. We find that the triplet exciplex states in OLEDs are highly spin-polarized and show that these states can be decoupled from the heterogeneous nuclear environment as a source of spin dephasing and can even be coherently manipulated on a spin-spin relaxation time scale T 2 * of 30 ns. Crucially, we obtain the characteristic triplet exciplex spin-lattice relaxation time T 1 in the range of 50 μs, which far exceeds the RISC time. We conclude that slow spin relaxation rather than RISC is an efficiency-limiting step for intermolecular donor:acceptor systems. Finding TADF emitters with faster spin relaxation will benefit this type of TADF OLEDs.},

Kinesin-binding protein (KIFBP), which is mutated in Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome, binds to and inhibits the catalytic motor heads of 8 of 45 kinesin superfamily members, but the mechanism remains poorly defined. Here, we used cryo–electron microscopy and cross-linking mass spectrometry to determine high-resolution structures of KIFBP alone and in complex with two mitotic kinesins, revealing structural remodeling of kinesin by KIFBP. We find that KIFBP remodels kinesin motors and blocks microtubule binding (i) via allosteric changes to kinesin and (ii) by sterically blocking access to the microtubule. We identified two regions of KIFBP necessary for kinesin binding and cellular regulation during mitosis. Together, this work further elucidates the molecular mechanism of KIFBP-mediated kinesin inhibition and supports a model in which structural rearrangement of kinesin motor domains by KIFBP abrogates motor protein activity.},

JIPs were inserted into the plasma membrane of epithelial cells, which promoted TJ formation by directly activating the heterotrimeric G protein G13. In a mouse intestinal epithelial injury model established by dextran sodium sulfate, mouse or human JIP administration restored TJ integrity and strongly prevented colitis.

We find that DNA damage-driven R-loops causally contribute to the active release and buildup of single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) in the cytoplasm of cells triggering a viral-like immune response in progeroid and naturally aged pancreata. To reduce the proinflammatory load, we developed an extracellular vesicle (EV)-based strategy to deliver recombinant S1 or ribonuclease H nucleases in inflamed Ercc1 −/− pancreatic cells. Treatment of Ercc1 −/− animals with the EV-delivered nuclease cargo eliminates DNA damage-induced R-loops and cytoplasmic ssDNAs alleviating chronic inflammation. Thus, DNA damage-driven ssDNAs causally contribute to tissue degeneration, Ercc1 −/− paving the way for novel rationalized intervention strategies against age-related chronic inflammation.},

Using cryo–electron tomography and subtomogram averaging, we determined the structures of native capsomers in the presence and absence of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) and cyclophilin A and constructed an all-atom model of a complete HIV-1 capsid. Our structures reveal two IP6 binding sites and modes of cyclophilin A interactions.

Here, we show that neuroblastoma, a MYC-driven cancer characterized by splicing dysregulation and spliceosomal dependency, requires the splicing factor RBM39 for survival. Indisulam, a “molecular glue” that selectively recruits RBM39 to the CRL4-DCAF15 E3 ubiquitin ligase for proteasomal degradation, is highly efficacious against neuroblastoma, leading to significant responses in multiple high-risk disease models, without overt toxicity. Genetic depletion or indisulam-mediated degradation of RBM39 induces significant genome-wide splicing anomalies and cell death. Mechanistically, the dependency on RBM39 and high-level expression of DCAF15 determine the exquisite sensitivity of neuroblastoma to indisulam. Our data indicate that targeting the dysregulated spliceosome by precisely inhibiting RBM39, a vulnerability in neuroblastoma, is a valid therapeutic strategy.},

Here, we provide a series of counterintuitive demonstrations that show that paying more attention to a piece of information impedes, rather than enhances, the selection of this information into working memory. Experiments 1 to 5 provide converging evidence for an even weaker working memory trace of fully attended but outdated features, compared with baseline irrelevant features that were completely ignored. This indicates that the brain actively inhibits attended but outdated information to prevent it from entering working memory. Experiment 6 demonstrates that this inhibition processing is subject to executive control. These findings lead to a substantial reinterpretation of the relationship between attention and working memory.},

To analyze Lef1 function in tumor development, we conditionally deleted Lef1 in intestinal stem cells of Apc fl/fl mice or broadly from the entire intestinal epithelium of Apc fl/fl or Apc Min/+ mice. Loss of Lef1 markedly increased tumor initiation and tumor cell proliferation, reduced the expression of several Wnt antagonists, and increased Myc proto-oncogene expression and formation of ectopic crypts in Apc -mutant adenomas. Our results uncover a previously unknown negative feedback mechanism in CRC, in which ectopic Lef1 expression suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis by restricting adenoma cell dedifferentiation to a crypt-progenitor phenotype and by reducing the formation of cancer stem cell niches.},

  abstract     = {FeSi is a nonmagnetic narrow-gap insulator, exhibiting peculiar charge and spin dynamics beyond a simple band structure picture. Those unusual features have been attracting renewed attention from topological aspects. Although the surface conduction was demonstrated according to size-dependent resistivity in bulk crystals, its topological characteristics and consequent electromagnetic responses remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate an inherent surface ferromagnetic-metal state of FeSi thin films and its strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) properties through multiple characterizations of two-dimensional conductance, magnetization, and spintronic functionality. Terminated covalent bonding orbitals constitute the polar surface state with momentum-dependent spin textures due to Rashba-type spin splitting, as corroborated by unidirectional magnetoresistance measurements and first-principles calculations. As a consequence of the spin-momentum locking, nonequilibrium spin accumulation causes magnetization switching. These surface properties are closely related to the Zak phase of the bulk band topology. Our findings propose another route to explore noble metal–free materials for SOC-based spin manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Development of new techniques to search for particles beyond the standard model is crucial for understanding the ultraviolet completion of particle physics. Several hypothetical particles are predicted to mediate exotic spin-dependent interactions between standard-model particles that may be accessible to laboratory experiments. However, laboratory searches are mostly conducted for static spin-dependent interactions, with a few experiments addressing spin- and velocity-dependent interactions. Here, we demonstrate a search for these interactions with a spin-based amplifier. Our technique uses hyperpolarized nuclear spins as an amplifier for pseudo-magnetic fields produced by exotic interactions by a factor of more than 100. Using this technique, we establish constraints on the spin- and velocity-dependent interactions between polarized neutrons and unpolarized nucleons for the force range of 0.03 to 100 meters, improving previous constraints by at least two orders of magnitude in partial force range. This technique can be further extended to investigate other exotic spin-dependent interactions.},

Here, we used whole-genome resequencing to elucidate different aspects of its recent evolutionary history. Our results support a model in which a central domestication event in grapevine was followed by postdomestication hybridization with local wild genotypes, leading to the presence of an introgression signature in modern wine varieties across Western Europe. The strongest signal was associated with a subset of Iberian grapevine varieties showing large introgression tracts. We targeted this study group for further analysis, demonstrating how regions under selection in wild populations from the Iberian Peninsula were preferentially passed on to the cultivated varieties by gene flow. Examination of underlying genes suggests that environmental adaptation played a fundamental role in both the evolution of wild genotypes and the outcome of hybridization with cultivated varieties, supporting a case of adaptive introgression in grapevine.},

We present a scheme to more efficiently mitigate these errors on quantum hardware and numerically show that our method consistently gives advantage over previous mitigation schemes. Our scheme removes biases in the readout errors, allowing a general error model to be built with far fewer calibration measurements. Specifically, for reading out n -qubits, we show a factor of 2 n reduction in the number of calibration measurements without sacrificing the ability to compensate for correlated errors. Our approach can be combined with, and simplify, other mitigation methods, allowing tractable mitigation even for large numbers of qubits.},

Late Copper Age (CA) settlements were abandoned in favor of hilltop sites, and collective graves were largely replaced by single or double burials with often distinctive grave goods indirectly reflecting a hierarchical social organization, as exemplified by the BA El Argar group. We explored this transition from a genomic viewpoint by tripling the amount of data available for this period. Concomitant with the rise of El Argar starting ~2200 cal BCE, we observe a complete turnover of Y-chromosome lineages along with the arrival of steppe-related ancestry. This pattern is consistent with a founder effect in male lineages, supported by our finding that males shared more relatives at sites than females. However, simple two-source models do not find support in some El Argar groups, suggesting additional genetic contributions from the Mediterranean that could predate the BA.},

We aimed to investigate additional disease mechanisms of OTULIN deficiency. Our study found a remarkable activation of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocytes, and serum from patients with OTULIN deficiency. We observed similar immunologic findings in OTULIN-deficient cell lines generated by CRISPR. Mechanistically, we identified proteasome subunits as substrates of OTULIN deubiquitinase activity and demonstrated proteasome dysregulation in OTULIN-deficient cells as the cause of IFN-I activation.

Here, by controlling the molecular beam epitaxy growth parameters, we demonstrate the successful growth of high-quality single-phase 1T-NbSe 2 . By combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and ab initio calculations, we show that this system is a charge transfer insulator with the upper Hubbard band located above the valence band maximum. To demonstrate the electron correlation resulted magnetic property, we create a vertical 1T/2H NbSe 2 heterostructure, and we find unambiguous evidence of exchange interactions between the localized magnetic moments in 1T phase and the metallic/superconducting phase exemplified by Kondo resonances and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov–like bound states.},

In this work, we used time-resolved x-ray solution scattering (TR-XSS) to visualize structural changes in the Escherichia coli adenylate kinase (AdK) enzyme upon laser-induced activation of a protected ATP substrate. A 4.3-ms transient intermediate showed partial closing of both the ATP- and AMP-binding domains, which indicates a cooperative closing mechanism. The ATP-binding domain also showed local unfolding and breaking of an Arg 131 -Asp 146 salt bridge. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data identified similar unfolding in an Arg 131 Ala AdK mutant, which refolded in a closed, substrate-binding conformation. The observed structural dynamics agree with a “cracking mechanism” proposed to underlie global structural transformation, such as allostery, in proteins.},

Here, we show that, when revealing and using the underlying mechanisms of thermomechanical nanomolding, a highly versatile nanofabrication toolbox is the result. Specifically, we reveal interface diffusion and dislocation slip as the controlling mechanisms and use their transition to control, combine, and predict the ability to fabricate general materials, material combinations, and length scales. Designing specific elemental distributions is based on the relative diffusivities, the transition temperature, and the distribution of the materials in the feedstock. The mechanistic origins of thermomechanical nanomolding and their homologous temperature-dependent transition suggest a versatile toolbox capable of combining many materials in nanostructures and potentially producing any material in moldable shapes on the nanoscale.},

A neuron-specific prefrontal mGluR2 knockdown in rats generated a phenotype of reduced cognitive flexibility and excessive alcohol seeking. Conversely, virally restoring prefrontal mGluR2 levels in alcohol-dependent rats rescued these pathological behaviors. In the search for a pharmacological intervention with high translational potential, psilocybin was capable of restoring mGluR2 expression and reducing relapse behavior. Last, we propose a FDG-PET biomarker strategy to identify mGluR2 treatment-responsive individuals.

The enrichment is associated with an increase in the light Cu isotope, melt inclusions rich in copper and sulfides, and Hg concentration spikes. The Cu and Hg elemental and isotopic signatures can be linked to S-rich vapor produced by felsic volcanism. We use these previously unknown geochemical data to estimate volcanic SO 2 injections and argue that this volcanism would have produced several degrees of rapid cooling before or coincident with the more protracted global warming. Large-scale eruptions near the South China block synchronous with the EPME strengthen the case that the STLIP may not have been the sole trigger.},

  abstract     = {Actin is a ubiquitous cytoskeletal protein, forming a dynamic network that generates mechanical forces in the cell. There is a growing demand for practical and accessible tools for dissecting the role of the actin cytoskeleton in cellular function, and the discovery of a new actin-binding small molecule is an important advance in the field, offering the opportunity to design and synthesize of new class of functional molecules. Here, we found an F-actin–binding small molecule and introduced two powerful tools based on a new class of actin-binding small molecule: One enables visualization of the actin cytoskeleton, including super-resolution imaging, and the other enables highly specific green light–controlled fragmentation of actin filaments, affording unprecedented control of the actin cytoskeleton and its force network in living cells.},

  abstract     = {Tendinopathy, the most common disorder affecting tendons, is characterized by chronic disorganization of the tendon matrix, which leads to tendon tear and rupture. The goal was to identify a rational molecular target whose blockade can serve as a potential therapeutic intervention for tendinopathy. We identified C1q/TNF-related protein-3 (CTRP3) as a markedly up-regulated cytokine in human and rodent tendinopathy. Overexpression of CTRP3 enhanced the progression of tendinopathy by accumulating cartilaginous proteoglycans and degenerating collagenous fibers in the mouse tendon, whereas CTRP3 knockdown suppressed the tendinopathy pathogenesis. Functional blockade of CTRP3 using a neutralizing antibody ameliorated overuse-induced tendinopathy of the Achilles and rotator cuff tendons. Mechanistically, CTRP3 elicited a transcriptomic pattern that stimulates abnormal differentiation of tendon stem/progenitor cells and ectopic chondrification as an effect linked to activation of Akt signaling. Collectively, we reveal an essential role for CTRP3 in tendinopathy and propose a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of tendinopathy.},

However, such investigations assume access to well-curated images, which are rarely available in practice and challenging to derive from photos not generated in a controlled laboratory setting. In this study, we reconsider re-identification risk and find that, for most individuals, the actual risk posed by linkage attacks to typical face images is substantially smaller than claimed in prior investigations. Moreover, we show that only a small amount of well-calibrated noise, imperceptible to humans, can be added to images to markedly reduce such risk. The results of this investigation create an opportunity to create image filters that enable individuals to have better control over re-identification risk based on linkage.},

Here, we tested whether hexadecanal (HEX), a human body volatile implicated as a mammalian-wide social chemosignal, affects human aggression. Using validated behavioral paradigms, we observed a marked dissociation: Sniffing HEX blocked aggression in men but triggered aggression in women. Next, using functional brain imaging, we uncovered a pattern of brain activity mirroring behavior: In both men and women, HEX increased activity in the left angular gyrus, an area implicated in perception of social cues. HEX then modulated functional connectivity between the angular gyrus and a brain network implicated in social appraisal (temporal pole) and aggressive execution (amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex) in a sex-dependent manner consistent with behavior: increasing connectivity in men but decreasing connectivity in women. These findings implicate sex-specific social chemosignaling at the mechanistic heart of human aggressive behavior.},

However, interspecies differences in the mechanisms regulating excitation-contraction coupling can limit the translation of experimental findings from animal models to human physiology and undermine the assessment of drugs’ efficacy and safety. Here, we built a suite of translators for quantitatively mapping electrophysiological responses in ventricular myocytes across species. We trained these statistical operators using a broad dataset obtained by simulating populations of our biophysically detailed computational models of action potential and Ca 2+ transient in mouse, rabbit, and human. We then tested our translators against experimental data describing the response to stimuli, such as ion channel block, change in beating rate, and β-adrenergic challenge. We demonstrate that this approach is well suited to predicting the effects of perturbations across different species or experimental conditions and suggest its integration into mechanistic studies and drug development pipelines.},

In vivo studies, in which bioscaffolds were transplanted into the epididymal fat pad of diabetic mice, demonstrated that, when islet:AD-MSC units were seeded into graphene–0.5 w/v\% Dex bioscaffolds, this resulted in complete restoration of glycemic control immediately after transplantation with these islets also showing a faster response to glucose challenges ( P &lt; 0.05).

To understand the consequences of new extremes in fire weather, here we quantify the sensitivity of wildfire occurrence and burned area in the Sierra Nevada to daily meteorological variables during 2001–2020. We find that the likelihood of fire occurrence increases nonlinearly with daily temperature during summer, with a 1°C increase yielding a 19 to 22\% increase in risk. Area burned has a similar, nonlinear sensitivity, with 1°C of warming yielding a 22 to 25\% increase in risk. Solely considering changes in summer daily temperatures from climate model projections, we estimate that by the 2040s, fire number will increase by 51 ± 32\%, and burned area will increase by 59 ± 33\%. These trends highlight the threat posed to fire management by hotter and drier summers.},

This type of resource, which can grow as new validation data are obtained for an expanding group of reagents, provides a community resource that should accompany future reagent-generating efforts. To address a pressing need for antibodies or other reagents that recognize human proteins, the National Institutes of Health Common Fund launched the Protein Capture Reagents Program in 2010 as a pilot to target human transcription factors.

Furthermore, the high-sucrose diet induced microcapillary impairments and reduced brain glucose uptake in brains of Glo1 -deficient mice. Aspirin protected against this angiopathy, enhancing brain glucose uptake and preventing abnormal behavioral phenotypes. Similar vascular damage to our model mice was found in the brains of randomly collected schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients, suggesting that psychiatric disorders are associated with angiopathy in the brain caused by various environmental stresses, including metabolic stress.},

All 77 species showed lower mean mass since the early 1980s—nearly half with 95\% confidence. A third of species concomitantly increased wing length, driving a decrease in mass:wing ratio for 69\% of species. Seasonal precipitation patterns were generally better than temperature at explaining morphological variation. Short-term climatic conditions affected all metrics, but time trends in wing and mass:wing remained robust even after controlling for annual seasonal conditions. We attribute these results to pressures to increase resource economy under warming.

O-NZ shows electron transfer of 1.8 nanoseconds in internal cores and 1.2 picoseconds between core and ligand molecule, leading to ultrahigh superoxidase dismutase–like and glutathione peroxidase–like activity (comparable with natural enzyme, Michaelis constant = 0.87 millimolars). Excitingly, O-NZ can improve the 1-month survival rate of mice with acute brain trauma from 50 to 90\% and promote the recovery of long-term neurocognition. Biochemical experiments show that O-NZ can decrease harmful peroxide and superoxide via in vivo catalytic chain reaction and reduce acute neuroinflammation via nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2–mediated up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1 expression.},

  abstract     = {Fundamental insights into the structural evolution of oxygen electrocatalysts under operating conditions are of substantial importance for designing efficient catalysts. Here, on the basis of operando x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, we probe the in situ activation of Br-confined conductive Ni-based metal-organic framework (Br-Ni-MOF) hollow prisms toward an active oxygen electrocatalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. The successive structural transformations from pristine Br-Ni-MOF to a β-Ni(OH) 2 analog then subsequently to a γ-NiOOH phase during OER are observed. This post-formed γ-NiOOH analog manifests high OER performance with a superior overpotential of 306 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and a high turnover frequency value of 0.051 s −1 at an overpotential of 300 mV, making Br-Ni-MOF one of the most active oxygen electrocatalysts reported. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong electronic coupling between Br and Ni atoms accelerates the generation of the key *O intermediate toward fast OER kinetics.},

  abstract     = {Optically inactive dark exciton states play an important role in light emission processes in semiconductors because they provide an efficient nonradiative recombination channel. Understanding the exciton fine structure in materials with potential applications in light-emitting devices is therefore critical. Here, we investigate the exciton fine structure in the family of two-dimensional (2D) perovskites (PEA) 2 SnI 4 , (PEA) 2 PbI 4 , and (PEA) 2 PbBr 4 . In-plane magnetic field mixes the bright and dark exciton states, brightening the otherwise optically inactive dark exciton. The bright-dark splitting increases with increasing exciton binding energy. Hot photoluminescence is observed, indicative of a non-Boltzmann distribution of the bright-dark exciton populations. We attribute this to the phonon bottleneck, which results from the weak exciton–acoustic phonon coupling in soft 2D perovskites. Hot photoluminescence is responsible for the strong emission observed in these materials, despite the substantial bright-dark exciton splitting.},

We find that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) enlarge under conditions known to decrease stem cell function. This decreased fitness of large HSCs is due to reduced proliferation and was accompanied by altered metabolism. Preventing HSC enlargement or reducing large HSCs in size averts the loss of stem cell potential under conditions causing stem cell exhaustion. Last, we show that murine and human HSCs enlarge during aging. Preventing this age-dependent enlargement improves HSC function.

In this work, we report the synthesis and sequencing of DNA on a single electrode with scalability for an integrated DNA-based data storage system. The synthesis of DNA is based on phosphoramidite chemistry and electrochemical deprotection. The sequencing relies on charge redistribution originated from polymerase-catalyzed primer extension, leading to a measurable current spike. By regeneration of the electrode after sequencing, repeated sequencing can be achieved to improve the accuracy. A SlipChip device is developed to simplify the liquid introduction involved in DNA synthesis and sequencing.

By single-cell analysis, we showed that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling regulates the CM in its stem cell–like property of self-renewal, differentiation, and survival, which is balanced by an evolutionarily conserved Wnt signaling gradient. FGF promotes Wnt signaling in the CM by stabilizing β-catenin in a GSK3β-independent manner. While Wnt signaling converts the NR to either the CM or the RPE depending on FGF signaling, FGF transforms the RPE to the NR or CM dependent on Wnt activity. The default fate of the eye cup is the NR, but synergistic FGF and Wnt signaling promotes CM formation both in vivo and in human retinal organoid. Our study reveals that the vertebrate eye develops through phase transition determined by a combinatorial code of FGF and Wnt signaling.},

Here, we combine scanning probe experiments with ab initio potential energy calculations to investigate the thermal stability of a prototypical standing molecule. We reveal its generic stabilization mechanism, a fine balance between covalent and van der Waals interactions including the latter’s long-range screening by many-body effects, and find a remarkable agreement between measured and calculated stabilizing potentials.

Lon is known to degrade protein substrates in a processive fashion, cutting a protein chain processively into small peptides before commencing cleavages of another protein chain. Here, we present structural and biochemical evidence demonstrating that processive substrate degradation occurs at each of the six proteolytic active sites of Lon, which forms a deep groove that partially encloses the substrate polypeptide chain by accommodating only the unprimed residues and permits processive cleavage in the C-to-N direction. We identify a universally conserved acidic residue at the exit side of the binding groove indispensable for the proteolytic activity. This noncatalytic residue likely promotes processive proteolysis by carboxyl-carboxylate interactions with cleaved intermediates. Together, these results uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism for processive substrate degradation by the Lon protease.},

Metabolism of acylated sugar esters in epidermal glandular secreting trichomes across the Solanaceae (nightshade) family is ideal for investigating the mechanisms of evolutionary metabolic diversification. We developed methods to structurally analyze acylhexose mixtures by 2D NMR, which led to the insight that the Old World species black nightshade ( Solanum nigrum ) accumulates acylglucoses and acylinositols in the same tissue. Detailed in vitro biochemistry, cross-validated by in vivo virus-induced gene silencing, revealed two unique features of the four-step acylglucose biosynthetic pathway: A trichome-expressed, neofunctionalized invertase-like enzyme, SnASFF1, converts BAHD-produced acylsucroses to acylglucoses, which, in turn, are substrates for the acylglucose acyltransferase, SnAGAT1. This biosynthetic pathway evolved independently from that recently described in the wild tomato Solanum pennellii , reinforcing that acylsugar biosynthesis is evolutionarily dynamic with independent examples of primary metabolic enzyme cooption and additional variation in BAHD acyltransferases.},

Despite the role of WNT/FZD signaling in health and disease, our understanding of how WNT binding is translated into receptor activation and transmembrane signaling remains limited. Current hypotheses dispute the roles for conformational dynamics. To clarify how WNT binding to FZD translates into receptor dynamics, we devised conformational FZD-CRD biosensors based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Using FZD with N-terminal nanoluciferase (Nluc) and fluorescently labeled unnatural amino acids in the linker domain and extracellular loop 3, we show that WNT-3A and WNT-5A induce similar CRD conformational rearrangements despite promoting distinct signaling pathways and that CRD dynamics are not required for WNT/β-catenin signaling. Thus, these FZD-CRD biosensors provide insights into binding, activation, and signaling processes in FZDs. The sensor design is broadly applicable to explore ligand-induced dynamics also in other membrane receptors.},

Strong polariton-polariton interactions and extended polariton fluids with a propagation length of around 25 μm have been reached.

We combine detailed information about extinct, extant, and established alien birds to quantify historical changes in functional diversity across nine oceanic archipelagos. We found that alien species often equal or exceed the number of anthropogenic extinctions yet apparently perform a narrower set of functional roles as current island assemblages have undergone a substantial and ubiquitous net loss in functional diversity and increased functional similarity among assemblages. Our results reveal that the introduction of alien species has not prevented anthropogenic extinctions from reducing and homogenizing the functional diversity of native bird assemblages on oceanic archipelagos.},

  abstract     = {The fungal plasma membrane H + -ATPase Pma1 is a vital enzyme, generating a proton-motive force that drives the import of essential nutrients. Autoinhibited Pma1 hexamers in the plasma membrane of starving fungi are activated by glucose signaling and subsequent phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain. As related P-type adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) are not known to oligomerize, the physiological relevance of Pma1 hexamers remained unknown. We have determined the structure of hexameric Pma1 from Neurospora crassa by electron cryo-microscopy at 3.3-Å resolution, elucidating the molecular basis for hexamer formation and autoinhibition and providing a basis for structure-based drug development. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations in a lipid bilayer suggest lipid-mediated contacts between monomers and a substantial protein-induced membrane deformation that could act as a proton-attracting funnel.},

Here, we provide the first experimental evidence for this hypothesis through an artificial selection experiment in the guppy ( Poecilia reticulata ). After four generations of selection on relative telencephalon volume (relative to brain size), we found substantial changes in telencephalon size but no changes in other regions. Further comparisons revealed that up-selected lines had larger telencephalon, while down-selected lines had smaller telencephalon than wild Trinidadian populations. Our results support that independent evolutionary changes in specific brain regions through mosaic brain evolution can be important facilitators of cognitive evolution.},

Differentiating and quantifying these inactive Li species are key to understand the failure mode. Here, using operando nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy together with ex situ titration gas chromatography (TGC) and mass spectrometry titration (MST) techniques, we established a solid foundation for quantifying the evolution of dead Li metal and SEI separately. The existence of LiH is identified, which causes deviation in the quantification results of dead Li metal obtained by these three techniques. The formation of inactive Li under various operating conditions has been studied quantitatively, which revealed a general “two-stage” failure process for the Li metal. The combined techniques presented here establish a benchmark to unravel the complex failure mechanism of Li metal.},

We here present the cryo-EM structure of complex I from Yarrowia lipolytica at 2.1-Å resolution, which reveals the positions of more than 1600 protein-bound water molecules, of which ~100 are located in putative proton translocation pathways. Another structure of the same complex under steady-state activity conditions at 3.4-Å resolution indicates conformational transitions that we associate with proton injection into the central hydrophilic axis.

However, their large voltage deficits limit their ultimate performance. Only a handful of studies probe the fundamental mechanisms underlying the voltage deficits, which remain an unsolved challenge in the field. In this study, we investigate the formation dynamics and defect physics of WBG mixed-halide perovskites in contrast with their corresponding triiodide-based perovskites. Our results show that the inclusion of bromide introduced a halide homogenization process that occurs during the perovskite growth stage from an initial bromide-rich phase toward the final target stoichiometry. We further elucidated a physical model that correlates the role of bromide with the formation dynamics, defect physics, and eventual optoelectronic properties of the film. This work provides a fundamental and unique perspective toward understanding the performance-limiting factors affecting WBG mixed-halide perovskites.},

We use reconstitution assays to demonstrate direct ubiquitylation by Parkin in vitro. We also identified a subset of cytoplasmic proteins recruited to mitochondria that undergo PINK1 and Parkin independent ubiquitylation, indicating the presence of alternate ubiquitin E3 ligase pathways that are activated by mitochondrial depolarization in neurons.

Our in-depth profiling indicates that the immune landscape in SARS-CoV-2 patients is largely similar to flu or RSV patients. Unique to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who had the most critical clinical disease were changes in the regulatory T cell (T reg ) compartment. A T reg signature including increased frequency, activation status, and migration markers was correlated COVID-19 severity. These findings are relevant as T regs are considered for therapy to combat the severe inflammation seen in COVID-19 patients.

Lactate-dependent M0 → M2 polarization requires both mitochondrial pyruvate uptake and adenosine triphosphate–citrate lyase (ACLY) enzymatic activity. Notably, exogenous acetate rescues defective M2 polarization and histone acetylation following mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) inhibition or ACLY deficiency. Lastly, M2 macrophage–dependent tumor progression is impaired by conditional macrophage ACLY deficiency, further supporting a dominant role for glucose/lactate mitochondrial metabolism and histone acetylation in driving immune evasion. This work adds to our understanding of how mitochondrial metabolism affects macrophage functional phenotypes and identifies a unique tumor microenvironment (TME)–driven metabolic-epigenetic link in M2 macrophages.},

To address this need, we develop fibrous hydrogel assemblies that are stabilized with photocrosslinking and display fiber density–dependent strain-responsive properties (strain stiffening and alignment). Encapsulated mesenchymal stromal cells locally contract low fiber density assemblies, resulting in macroscopic volumetric changes with increased cell densities and moduli. Because of properties such as shear-thinning and self-healing, assemblies can be processed into microtissues with aligned ECM deposition or through extrusion bioprinting and photopatterning to fabricate constructs with programmed shape changes due to cell contraction. These materials provide a synthetic approach to mimic features of natural ECM, which can now be processed for applications in biofabrication and tissue engineering.},

We find that replacing only several percent of lanthanum for strontium leaves behind nanometer-scale AF puddles clustering away from lanthanum substitutions preferentially located in the middle strontium oxide layer. Thermal erasure and reentry into the low-temperature ground state leads to a spatial reorganization of the AF puddles, which nevertheless maintain scale-invariant fractal geometry in each configuration. Our experiments reveal multiple stable AF configurations at low temperature and shed light onto spatial fluctuations of the AF order around atomic scale disorder in electron-doped Sr 3 Ir 2 O 7 .},

Here, we reported that MAPK6 directly activated AKT and induced oncogenic outcomes. MAPK6 interacted with AKT through its C34 region and the C-terminal tail and phosphorylated AKT at S473 independent of mTORC2, the major S473 kinase. mTOR kinase inhibitors have not made notable progress in the clinic. Our identified MAPK6-AKT axis may provide a major resistance pathway. Besides repressing growth, inhibiting MAPK6 sensitized cancer cells to mTOR kinase inhibitors. MAPK6 overexpression is associated with decreased overall survival and the survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma, uveal melanoma, and breast cancer. MAPK6 expression also correlated with AKT phosphorylation at S473 in human cancer tissues. We conclude that MAPK6 can promote cancer by activating AKT independent of mTORC2 and targeting MAPK6, either alone or in combination with mTOR blockade, may be effective in cancers.},

  abstract     = {We investigated the impact of cancer-associated mesenchymal stem cells (CA-MSCs) on ovarian tumor immunity. In patient samples, CA-MSC presence inversely correlates with the presence of intratumoral CD8 + T cells. Using an immune “hot” mouse ovarian cancer model, we found that CA-MSCs drive CD8 + T cell tumor immune exclusion and reduce response to anti–PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) via secretion of numerous chemokines (Ccl2, Cx3cl1, and Tgf-β1), which recruit immune-suppressive CD14 + Ly6C + Cx3cr1 + monocytic cells and polarize macrophages to an immune suppressive Ccr2 hi F4/80 + Cx3cr1 + CD206 + phenotype. Both monocytes and macrophages express high levels of transforming growth factor β–induced (Tgfbi) protein, which suppresses NK cell activity. Hedgehog inhibitor (HHi) therapy reversed CA-MSC effects, reducing myeloid cell presence and expression of Tgfbi, increasing intratumoral NK cell numbers, and restoring response to ICI therapy. Thus, CA-MSCs regulate antitumor immunity, and CA-MSC hedgehog signaling is an important target for cancer immunotherapy.},

We present a deep convolutional neural network approach and fully automated pipeline to detect and track two audiovisually distinctive actions in wild chimpanzees: buttress drumming and nut cracking. Using camera trap and direct video recordings, we train action recognition models using audio and visual signatures of both behaviors, attaining high average precision (buttress drumming: 0.87 and nut cracking: 0.85), and demonstrate the potential for behavioral analysis using the automatically parsed video. Our approach produces the first automated audiovisual action recognition of wild primate behavior, setting a milestone for exploiting large datasets in ethology and conservation.},

Although this community structure has been observed regionally, mostly among plankton groups, its generality has never been formally tested across all marine life over the global ocean, nor have the impacts of humans on it been globally assessed. Here, we bring together data at the global scale to test the hypothesis from bacteria to whales. We find that biomass within most order of magnitude size classes is indeed remarkably constant, near 1 gigatonne (Gt) wet weight (10 15 g), but bacteria and large marine mammals are markedly above and below this value, respectively. Furthermore, human impacts appear to have significantly truncated the upper one-third of the spectrum. This dramatic alteration to what is possibly life’s largest-scale regularity underscores the global extent of human activities.},

Relaxor-FEs, such as (1 − x )Pb(Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 -( x )PbTiO 3 (PMN- x PT), are ideal FE layer candidates because of their giant piezoelectricity. However, thin films of PMN-PT suffer from substrate clamping, which substantially reduces piezoelectric in-plane strains. Here, we demonstrate low-voltage ME coupling in an all-thin-film heterostructure that uses the anisotropic strains induced by the (011) orientation of PMN-PT. We completely remove PMN-PT films from their substrate and couple with FM Ni overlayers to create membrane PMN-PT/Ni heterostructures showing 90° Ni magnetization rotation with 3 V PMN-PT bias, much less than the bulk PMN-PT ~100-V requirement. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and phase-field simulations clarify the membrane response. These results provide a crucial step toward understanding the microstructural behavior of PMN-PT thin films for use in piezo-driven ME heterostructures.},

The rate-limiting enzyme of ethylene biosynthesis is 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (ACS), which is generally believed to be a single-activity enzyme evolving from aspartate aminotransferases. Here, we demonstrate that, in addition to catalyzing the conversion of S -adenosyl-methionine to the ethylene precursor ACC, genuine ACSs widely have C β -S lyase activity. Two N-terminal motifs, including a glutamine residue, are essential for conferring ACS activity to ACS-like proteins. Motif and activity analyses of ACS-like proteins from plants at different evolutionary stages suggest that the ACC-dependent pathway is uniquely developed in seed plants. A putative catalytic mechanism for the dual activities of ACSs is proposed on the basis of the crystal structure and biochemical data. These findings not only expand our current understanding of ACS functions but also provide novel insights into the evolutionary origin of ACS genes.},

Here, we develop an approach to CGH using partially coherent sources. For this purpose, we devise a wave propagation model for partially coherent light that is demonstrated in conjunction with a camera-in-the-loop calibration strategy. We evaluate this algorithm using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and superluminescent LEDs (SLEDs) and demonstrate improved speckle characteristics of the resulting holograms compared with coherent lasers. SLEDs in particular are demonstrated to be promising light sources for holographic display applications, because of their potential to generate sharp and high-contrast two-dimensional (2D) and 3D images that are bright, eye safe, and almost free of speckle.},

Maximal preservation of antigenicity allows imaging of nanoscopic architectures in 1000-fold expanded tissues without additional signal amplification. eMAP-processed tissue gel can endure repeated staining and destaining without epitope loss or structural damage, enabling highly multiplexed proteomic analysis.

In contrast to other proteins of the TMBIM family, RECS1 expression induces cell death through the canonical mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Unbiased screening indicated that RECS1 sensitizes cells to lysosomal perturbations. RECS1 localizes to lysosomes, where it regulates their acidification and calcium content, triggering lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Structural modeling and electrophysiological studies indicated that RECS1 is a pH-regulated calcium channel, an activity that is essential to trigger cell death. RECS1 also sensitizes whole animals to stress in vivo in Drosophila melanogaster and zebrafish models. Our results unveil an unanticipated function for RECS1 as a proapoptotic component of the TMBIM family that ignites cell death programs at lysosomes.},

NPR1 and EDS1 function as two central hubs in plant local and systemic immunity. However, it is unclear how NPR1 orchestrates gene regulation and whether EDS1 directly participates in transcriptional reprogramming. Here, we show that NPR1 and EDS1 synergistically activate pathogenesis-related ( PR ) genes and plant defenses by forming a protein complex and recruiting Mediator. We discover that EDS1 functions as an autonomous transcriptional coactivator with intrinsic transactivation domains and physically interacts with the CDK8 subunit of Mediator. Upon SA induction, EDS1 is directly recruited by NPR1 onto the PR1 promoter via physical NPR1-EDS1 interactions, thereby potentiating PR1 activation. We further demonstrate that EDS1 stabilizes NPR1 protein and NPR1 transcriptionally up-regulates EDS1 . Our results reveal an elegant interplay of key coactivators with Mediator and elucidate important molecular mechanisms for activating transcription during immune responses.},

In non-Hermitian systems, a topological invariant is predicted to emerge from the winding of the complex eigenenergies. Here, we directly measure the non-Hermitian topological invariant arising from exceptional points in the momentum-resolved spectrum of exciton polaritons. These are hybrid light-matter quasiparticles formed by photons strongly coupled to electron-hole pairs (excitons) in a halide perovskite semiconductor at room temperature. We experimentally map out both the real (energy) and imaginary (linewidth) parts of the spectrum near the exceptional points and extract the novel topological invariant—fractional spectral winding.

People with depression are highly vulnerable to alcohol use, and abusive alcohol consumption is a well-known obstacle to treating depressive disorders. Using a mouse model involving isolation stress (IS) and/or ethanol intake, we investigated the mutual influence between IS-derived depressive and ethanol-seeking behaviors along with the underlying mechanisms. IS increased ethanol craving, which robustly exacerbated depressive-like behaviors. Ethanol intake activated the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, as evidenced by dopamine/tyrosine hydroxylase double-positive signals in the ventral tegmental area and c-Fos activity in the nucleus accumbens. IS-induced ethanol intake also reduced serotonergic activity, via microglial hyperactivation in raphe nuclei, that was notably attenuated by a microglial inhibitor (minocycline).

  abstract     = {Many energy, environmental, industrial, and microfluidic processes rely on the flow of polymer solutions through porous media. Unexpectedly, the macroscopic flow resistance often increases above a threshold flow rate in a porous medium, but not in bulk solution. The reason why has been a puzzle for over half a century. Here, by directly visualizing flow in a transparent 3D porous medium, we demonstrate that this anomalous increase is due to the onset of an elastic instability in which the flow exhibits strong spatiotemporal fluctuations reminiscent of inertial turbulence, despite the small Reynolds number. Our measurements enable us to quantitatively establish that the energy dissipated by pore-scale fluctuations generates the anomalous increase in the overall flow resistance. Because the macroscopic resistance is one of the most fundamental descriptors of fluid flow, our results both help deepen understanding of complex fluid flows and provide guidelines to inform a broad range of applications.},

The lateral habenula (LHb) serves as a “hub” to filter and propagate stress- and aversion-relevant information in the brain. Here, we show that chemogenetic inhibition of cortical inputs to LHb attenuates relapse-like reinstatement of extinguished cocaine seeking in mice. Using an RNA sequencing–based brain mapping procedure with single-cell resolution, we identify networks of cortical neurons that project to LHb and then preferentially innervate different downstream brain sites, including the ventral tegmental area, median raphe nucleus, and locus coeruleus (LC). By using an intersectional chemogenetics approach, we show that inhibition of cortico-habenular neurons that project to LC, but not to other sites, blocks reinstatement of cocaine seeking. These findings highlight the remarkable complexity of descending cortical inputs to the habenula and identify a cortico-habenulo-hindbrain circuit that regulates cocaine seeking.},

Free T4 was associated with a decrease in DXA-derived body fat and bone mineral density. Furthermore, offspring PAX8 methylation was associated with periconceptional maternal nutrition, and methylation variability was influenced by genotype, suggesting that sensitivity to environmental exposures may be under partial genetic control. Together, our results demonstrate a possible link between early environment, PAX8 gene methylation and thyroid gland development and function, with potential implications for early embryonic programming of thyroid-related health and disease.},

However, its intrinsic solid-solid conversion is sluggish during repeated splitting and rebonding of metal-fluorine moieties. Here, we propose a solid-liquid conversion mechanism to activate the fluorine transport kinetics of iron oxyfluorides enabled by fluoride anion receptor of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFPB). TPFPB promotes the dissociation of inert lithium fluoride and provides a facile fluorine transport channel at multiphase interfaces via the formation of solvated F − intermediate therein. The construction of solid-liquid channel with fluorinated cathode electrolyte interface is the key for the achievement of FeO 0.3 F 1.7 and FeO 0.7 F 1.3 in terms of sustaining conversion reaction (with an energy efficiency approaching 80\%) and high-rate performance (with reversible capacity of 320 mAh/g at 2 A/g). The cathode energy densities can reach 1100 Wh/kg for FeO 0.3 F 1.7 and 700 Wh/kg for FeO 0.7 F 1.3 under the power densities of 220 and 4300 W/kg, respectively.},

Here, we overcome this fundamental limitation by implementing spatiotemporally modulated acoustic metamaterials that support nonreciprocal sound steering. Our mechanism relies on the coupling between an ultrathin membrane and external biasing electromagnetic fields, realizing programmable dynamic control of the acoustic impedance over a motionless and noiseless platform. The fast and flexible impedance modulation of our metamaterial imparts an effective unidirectional momentum in space-time to realize nonreciprocal transitions in k -ω space between different diffraction modes. On the basis of these principles, we demonstrate efficient nonreciprocal sound steering, showcasing unidirectional evanescent wave conversion and nonreciprocal upconversion focusing. More generally, our metamaterial platform offers opportunities for generation of nonreciprocal Bloch waves and extension to other domains, such as non-Hermitian topological and parity-time symmetric acoustics.},

A key issue is how the wave-like itinerant electrons change into a localized-like state due to increased interactions. However, observing the MIT in terms of the energy- and momentum-resolved electronic structure of the system, the only direct way to probe both itinerant and localized states, has been elusive. Here we show, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), that in V 2 O 3 , the temperature-induced MIT is characterized by the progressive disappearance of its itinerant conduction band, without any change in its energy-momentum dispersion, and the simultaneous shift to larger binding energies of a quasi-localized state initially located near the Fermi level.},

The absence of visible and/or histological tissue injury contrasts with current in vivo transfection systems such as electroporation. Specific utility was demonstrated with a synthetic SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccine, which generated host humoral immune response in rats with notable antibody production.

Here, we present new radio-isotopic dates from Ediacaran strata that directly constrain key fossil assemblages and large-magnitude carbon cycle perturbations. These new dates and integrated global correlations demonstrate that late Ediacaran strata of South China are time transgressive and that the 575- to 550-Ma interval is marked by two large negative carbon isotope excursions: the Shuram and a younger one that ended ca. 550 Ma ago. These data calibrate the tempo of Ediacaran evolution characterized by intervals of tens of millions of years of increasing ecosystem complexity, interrupted by biological turnovers that coincide with large perturbations to the carbon cycle.},

Previous studies showed increases in H over 1980–2000 but were inconsistent in projecting H trends after 2000. While H generally responds to temperature changes in the troposphere and stratosphere, the relative importance of these two contributions is uncertain. Here, we use radiosonde balloon observations in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) over 20°N to 80°N to reveal a continuous rise of H over 1980–2020. Over 2001–2020, H increases at 50 to 60 m/decade, which is comparable to the trend over 1980–2000. The GPS radio occultation measurements from satellites and homogenized radiosonde records are in good agreement with those results. The continuous rise of the tropopause in the NH after 2000 results primarily from tropospheric warming. A large trend in H remains after major natural forcings for H are removed, providing further observational evidence for anthropogenic climate change.},

Human kidney single-cell epigenetic and immunostaining studies indicated kidney tubule cells as a disease-causing cell type. Mice with genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of CASP9 showed lower apoptosis while having improved mitophagy, resulting in dampened activation of cytosolic nucleotide sensing pathways (cGAS-STING), reduction of inflammation, and protection from acute kidney disease or renal fibrosis.

Direct cathode recycling is found to be the most effective in reducing life cycle environmental impacts, while hydrometallurgical recycling provides limited sustainability benefits for high-performance LIBs. Battery design with less aluminum and alternative anode materials, such as silicon-based anode, could enable more sustainable LIB recycling. Compared to directly recycling LIBs after their electric vehicle use, carbon footprint and energy use of LIBs recycled after their second life can be reduced by 8 to 17\% and 2 to 6\%, respectively.},

This synthesis features the introduction of shearing flow to drive the spiral self-assembly, which is different from conventional chiral templating methods. Furthermore, a continuous adjustment in the amphipathicity of surfactants can cause the packing parameter changes, namely, micellar structure transformations, resulting in diverse pore structures from single-porous, to radial orientated, to flower-like, and to multi-shelled configurations. The self-supported spiral architecture of these multi-shelled carbon nanospheres, in combination with their high surface area (~530 m 2 g −1 ), abundant nitrogen content (~6.2 weight\%), and plentiful mesopores (~2.5 nm), affords them excellent electrochemical performance for potassium-ion storage.

  abstract     = {Autophagy, an essential intracellular recycling process, is linked to the pathogenesis of various diseases including Crohn’s disease (CD). Factors that lead to the development of impaired autophagy during intestinal inflammation remain largely unexplored. Here, we report the impact of the interaction between serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine; (5-HT)] and autophagy in colitis in mouse and human studies. In mice, increased gut 5-HT inhibited autophagy and led to enhanced colitis susceptibility. Reciprocally, mice with reduced 5-HT exhibited up-regulated autophagy via the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, which resulted in significantly decreased colitis. Deletion of autophagy gene, Atg7, in an epithelial-specific manner, in concert with reduced 5-HT, promoted the development of a colitogenic microbiota and abolished the protective effects conferred by reduced 5-HT. Notably, in control and patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we uncovered that 5-HT treatment inhibited autophagy. Our findings suggest 5-HT as a previously unidentified therapeutic target in intestinal inflammatory disorders such as CD that exhibits dysregulated autophagy.},

  abstract     = {Various pain therapies have been developed on the basis of the gate control theory of pain, which postulates that nonpainful sensory inputs mediated by large-diameter afferent fibers (Aβ-fibers) can attenuate noxious signals relayed to the brain. To date, this theory has focused only on neuronal mechanisms. Here, we identified an unprecedented function of astrocytes in the gating of nociceptive signals transmitted by neurokinin 1 receptor–positive (NK1R + ) projection neurons in the spinal cord. Electrical stimulation of peripheral Aβ-fibers in naïve mice activated spinal astrocytes, which in turn induced long-term depression (LTD) in NK1R + neurons and antinociception through activation of endogenous adenosinergic mechanisms. Suppression of astrocyte activation by pharmacologic, chemogenetic, and optogenetic manipulations blocked the induction of LTD in NK1R + neurons and pain inhibition by Aβ-fiber stimulation. Collectively, our study introduces astrocytes as an important component of pain gating by activation of Aβ-fibers, which thus exert nonneuronal control of pain.},

However, an overlooked aspect of their possible role in stabilizing 3D chromatin organization has not been extensively studied. To illuminate their structural importance, we started with the noncoding regions forming many 3D contacts (referred to as hubs) and performed a CRISPR library screening to identify dozens of hubs essential for cell viability. Hi-C and single-cell transcriptomic analyses showed that their deletion could significantly alter chromatin organization and affect the expressions of distal genes. This study revealed the 3D structural importance of noncoding loci that are not associated with any functional element, providing a previously unknown mechanistic understanding of disease-associated genetic variations (GVs). Furthermore, our analyses also suggest a possible approach to develop therapeutics targeting disease-specific noncoding regions that are critical for disease cell survival.},

The Basin and Range of western North America arose through widespread extension and collapse of topographic highlands in the Miocene, creating numerous basins with rich mammalian fossil records. We analyzed patterns of mammalian species richness from 36 to 0 million years ago in relation to the history of sediment accumulation to test whether intervals of high species richness corresponded with elevated sediment accumulation and fossil burial in response to tectonic deformation. We found that the sedimentary record of the Basin and Range tracks the tectonic evolution of landscapes, whereas species-richness trends reflect actual increased richness in the Miocene rather than increased fossil burial. The sedimentary record of the region broadly determines the preservation of the fossil record but does not drive the Miocene peak in mammalian species richness.},

Here, we found that about 8\% of cells within the human glioblastoma microenvironment coexpress programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and BTIC marker. Gain- or loss-of-function studies revealed that tumor-intrinsic PD-1 promoted proliferation and self-renewal of BTICs. Phosphorylation of tyrosines within the cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 recruited Src homology 2–containing phosphatase 2 and activated the nuclear factor kB in BTICs. Notably, the tumor-intrinsic promoting effects of PD-1 did not require programmed cell death ligand 1(PD-L1) ligation; thus, the therapeutic antibodies inhibiting PD-1/PD-L1 interaction could not overcome the growth advantage of PD-1 in BTICs. Last, BTIC-intrinsic PD-1 accelerated intracranial tumor growth, and this occurred in mice lacking T and B cells.

Furthermore, DRAM knockdown inhibited fatty acid (FA)–induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization and lysosome inhibitor reversed the down-regulation of exosome release in DRAM knockout mice.

We demonstrated that the identified causal missense mutation in the gelatin-binding domain of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin resulted in significant decreased binding capacity to collagen type II. Further analyses of formed hiPSC-derived neo-cartilage tissue highlighted that mutated fibronectin affected chondrogenic capacity and propensity to a procatabolic osteoarthritic state. Together, we demonstrate that binding of fibronectin to collagen type II is crucial for fibronectin downstream gene expression of chondrocytes.

Recent technological advances have made the artificial induction of these assemblies feasible, yet how various parameters of induction can be optimized is not clear. Here, we studied this question in large-scale cortical network models with excitatory-inhibitory balance. We found that the background network in which assemblies are embedded can strongly modulate their dynamics and formation. Networks with dominant excitatory interactions enabled a fast formation of assemblies, but this was accompanied by recruitment of other non-perturbed neurons, leading to some degree of nonspecific induction. On the other hand, networks with strong excitatory-inhibitory interactions ensured that the formation of assemblies remained constrained to the perturbed neurons, but slowed down the induction. Our results suggest that these two regimes can be suitable for computational and cognitive tasks with different trade-offs between speed and specificity.},

Genomic differentiation was increased in the presence of divergent selection and drift compared to drift alone. The quantification of phenotypic and genetic parallelism in four cichlid species occurring along a lake-stream environmental contrast revealed parallel and antiparallel components in rapid adaptive divergence, and morphological convergence in species replicates inhabiting the same environments.

Cancers with deficiency of MMR proteins MSH2/MSH6 (MutSα) exhibit mutational signature contributions distinct from those that are deficient in MLH1/PMS2 (MutLα). This disparity arises from unrepaired 5mC deamination–induced mismatches rather than replicative DNA polymerase errors. In cancers with biallelic loss of MBD4 DNA glycosylase, repair of 5mC deamination damage is strongly associated with H3K36me3 chromatin, implicating MutSα as the essential factor in its repair.

We previously linked a loss-of-function mutation in the TSC1 gene to tau accumulation and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Now, we have identified genetic variants in TSC1 that decrease TSC1/hamartin levels and predispose to tauopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Cellular and murine models of TSC1 haploinsufficiency, as well as human brains carrying a TSC1 risk variant, accumulated tau protein that exhibited aberrant acetylation. This acetylation hindered tau degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy, thereby leading to its accumulation. Aberrant tau acetylation in TSC1 haploinsufficiency resulted from the dysregulation of both p300 acetyltransferase and SIRT1 deacetylase. Pharmacological modulation of either enzyme restored tau levels. This study substantiates TSC1 as a novel tauopathy risk gene and includes TSC1 haploinsufficiency as a genetic model for tauopathies. In addition, these findings promote tau acetylation as a rational target for tauopathy therapeutics and diagnostic.},

Studies in preclinical models demonstrated that l -arginine radiosensitization is a NO-mediated mechanism secondary to the metabolic adaptation induced in cancer cells. We showed that the decrease in tumor lactate was a consequence of reduced glycolysis that also impacted ATP and NAD + levels. These effects were associated with NO-dependent inhibition of GAPDH and hyperactivation of PARP upon nitrosative DNA damage. These metabolic changes ultimately impaired the repair of DNA damage induced by radiation in cancer cells while greatly sparing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.},

  abstract     = {Self-assembly of supramolecular complexes such as viral capsids occurs prominently in nature. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we uncover the assembly pathway of hepatitis B virus (HBV), applying fluorescence optical tweezers and high-speed atomic force microscopy. This allows tracking the assembly process in real time with single-molecule resolution. Our results identify a specific, contact-rich pentameric arrangement of HBV capsid proteins as a key on-path assembly intermediate and reveal the energy balance of the self-assembly process. Real-time nucleic acid packaging experiments show that a free energy change of ~1.4 k B T per condensed nucleotide is used to drive protein oligomerization. The finding that HBV assembly occurs via contact-rich energy minima has implications for our understanding of the assembly of HBV and other viruses and also for the development of new antiviral strategies and the rational design of self-assembling nanomaterials.},

We show that the impact of short-term regional changes in fossil fuel emissions on CO 2 concentrations was observable from space. Starting in February and continuing through May, column CO 2 over many of the world’s largest emitting regions was 0.14 to 0.62 parts per million less than expected in a pandemic-free scenario, consistent with reductions of 3 to 13\% in annual global emissions.

These cells acquired a chondro-osteogenic fate. OCT4 in adult valvular aortic cells leads to calcification of mouse and human valves. These calcifying cells originate from the Oct4 embryonic lineage. Genetic deletion of Pou5f1 (Pit-Oct-Unc , OCT4) in the endocardial cell lineage prevents aortic stenosis and calcification of ApoE −/− mouse valve.

We observed that epidermal growth factor or low-density lipoprotein bound to collagen fibers leads to increased local nucleation and accumulation of TCALs. By using engineered, mixed collagen networks, we demonstrate that this mechanism selectively increases local forces applied on ligand-decorated fibers. We show that these effects depend on the ligand’s receptors but do not rely on their ability to trigger signaling events. We propose that the preferential accumulation of TCALs along ligand-decorated fibers steers migration in 3D environments. We conclude that ligand-regulated, local TCAL accumulation results in asymmetric force distribution that orients cell migration in 3D environments.},

However, pathways by which ABI3 contributes to the pathogenesis of AD are unknown. To address this question, we determined whether loss of ABI3 function affects pathological features of AD in the 5XFAD mouse model. We demonstrate that the deletion of Abi3 locus significantly increases amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation and decreases microglia clustering around the plaques. Furthermore, long-term potentiation is impaired in 5XFAD; Abi3 knockout (“ Abi3 −/− ”) mice. Moreover, we identified marked changes in the proportion of microglia subpopulations in Abi3 −/− mice using a single-cell RNA sequencing approach. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that Abi3 knockdown in microglia impairs migration and phagocytosis.

This defect is manifested by increased RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) readthrough and occupancy of serine-2 phosphorylated RNAPII, de novo trimethylation of lysine-36 on histone H3, and a compensatory elevation of the cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) complex beyond the canonical polyadenylation sites. 3′ RNA sequencing reveals that proximal polyadenylation site usage relies on the endonuclease activity of INTS11. The DNA sequence encompassing the transcription end sites of IRT genes features downstream polyadenylation motifs and an enrichment of GC content that permits the formation of secondary structures within the 3′UTR.

The intrinsically disordered low-complexity domain (LCD) of ABCF1 contributes to phase separation in vitro and transcriptional activation of pluripotency genes by mediating multivalent interactions with SOX2 and co-dependent coactivators XPC and DKC1. These LCD-driven transcription factor–coactivator interactions critical for pluripotency gene expression are disrupted by DNA damage, likely due to LCD-dependent binding of ABCF1 to damage-generated intracellular DNA fragments instead of SOX2. This study identifies a transcriptional coactivator that uses its LCD to form selective multivalent interactions to regulate stem cell self-renewal and exit from pluripotency when genome integrity is compromised.},

Using gene editing together with cell sorting, we demonstrate that even the propagation of wild-type HIV-1 is strikingly dependent on BST2, including in primary human cells. HIV-1 propagation in BST2 −/− populations can be fully rescued by exogenous BST2 irrespective of its capacity to signal and even by an artificial BST2-like protein that shares its virion entrapment activity but lacks sequence homology.

The simultaneous spin driving in the ground and excited states with the same SAW leads to the trapping of the spin along a direction given by the frequency detuning from the corresponding spin resonances. The coherence of the spin-trapped states becomes only limited by relaxation processes intrinsic to the ground state.

Recently, a monoclonal antibody against FGF23 has been approved for XLH but remains a high-cost lifelong therapy. We developed a liver-targeting AAV vector to inhibit FGF23 signaling. We showed that hepatic expression of the C-terminal tail of FGF23 corrected skeletal manifestations and osteomalacia in a XLH mouse model.

These results suggest that long-lived species are capable of processing DNA damage in a more accurate way than short-lived species.},

Chemical vapor deposition growth of 2D semiconductors such as monolayer MoS 2 has been reported to be activated by halide salts, for which various investigations have been conducted to understand the underlying mechanism from different aspects. Here, we provide experimental evidence showing that the MoS 2 growth dynamics are halogen dependent through the Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relation, based on which we build a growth model by considering MoS 2 edge passivation by halogens, and theoretically reproduce the trend of our experimental observations. These mechanistic understandings enable us to further optimize the fast growth of MoS 2 and reach record-large domain sizes that should facilitate practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic excitations in van der Waals (vdW) materials, especially in the two-dimensional (2D) limit, are an exciting research topic from both the fundamental and applied perspectives. Using temperature-dependent, magneto-Raman spectroscopy, we identify the hybridization of two-magnon excitations with two phonons in manganese phosphorus triselenide (MnPSe 3 ), a magnetic vdW material that hosts in-plane antiferromagnetism. Results from first-principles calculations of the phonon and magnon spectra further support our identification. The Raman spectra’s rich temperature dependence through the magnetic transition displays an avoided crossing behavior in the phonons’ frequency and a concurrent decrease in their lifetimes. We construct a model based on the interaction between a discrete level and a continuum that reproduces these observations. Our results imply a strong hybridization between each phonon and a two-magnon continuum. This work demonstrates that the magnon-phonon interactions can be observed directly in Raman scattering and provides deep insight into these interactions in 2D magnetic materials.},

Combining strong light-matter interaction with robust and mobile exciton quasiparticles, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) hold great promise in this endeavor. However, realizing complex excitonic architectures based on strain-induced electronic potentials alone has proven to be exceptionally difficult so far. Here, we demonstrate deterministic strain engineering of both single-particle electronic bandstructure and excitonic many-particle interactions. We create quasi-1D transport channels to confine excitons and simultaneously enhance their mobility through locally suppressed exciton-phonon scattering. Using ultrafast, all-optical injection and time-resolved readout, we realize highly directional exciton flow with up to 100\% anisotropy both at cryogenic and room temperatures. The demonstrated fundamental modification of the exciton transport properties in a deterministically strained 2D material with effectively tunable dimensionality has broad implications for both basic solid-state science and emerging technologies.},

Honey bee ( Apis mellifera ) colonies are ideal models to study this behavior because of the compartmentalized structure of these societies, evolved under exposure to parasite pressure and the need to ensure efficient functioning. Here, by using a combination of spatial and behavioral approaches, we investigated whether the presence of the ectoparasite mite Varroa destructor induces changes in the social organization of A. mellifera colonies that could reduce the spread of the parasite. Our results demonstrated that honey bees react to the intrusion of V. destructor by modifying space use and social interactions to increase the social distancing between young (nurses) and old (foragers) cohorts of bees. These findings strongly suggest a behavioral strategy not previously reported in honey bees to limit the intracolony parasite transmission.},

To explore this puzzle, we estimate the historical establishment of plant-feeding Hemiptera in Northern America as a function of historical U.S. imports of live plants from seven world regions. Delays between establishment and discovery are modeled using a previously unused proxy for dynamic discovery effort. By recovering the timing of pest arrivals from their historical discoveries, we disentangle the joint establishment-discovery process. We estimate long delays to discovery, which are partially attributable to the low detectability of less economically important insect species.

Here, we demonstrate that strong coupling and formation of organic exciton-polaritons can be used to selectively tune the isomer emission of organic molecules. By taking advantage of their delocalized and hybrid character, polaritons emerging in the strong coupling regime open a new relaxation pathway that allows for an efficient funneling of the excitation between the molecular isomers. We implement this by strong coupling to trans -DCS ( E -4-dimethylamino-4′cyanostilbene)molecules, which present two isomers in different amounts when immersed in a polymer matrix. Thanks to this new relaxation pathway, the photoexcitation that is first shared by the common polaritonic mode is then selectively funneled to the excited states of one of the isomers, recognizing pure emission from the isomeric states that do not contribute to emission under normal conditions.},

However, the neural mechanisms underlying human vmPFC grid-like representations and their interactions with EC grid activity have remained unknown. We conducted intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from epilepsy patients during a virtual spatial navigation task. Oscillatory theta power in the vmPFC exhibited a sixfold rotational symmetry that was coordinated with grid-like representations in the EC. We found that synchronous theta oscillations occurred between these regions that predicted navigational performance. Analysis of information transfer revealed a unidirectional signal from vmPFC to EC during memory retrieval.

The emerging network comprises hundreds of sRNA-mRNA pairs, including mRNAs of virulence-associated genes interacting with known sRNAs encoded within the core genome, as well as with newly found sRNAs encoded within pathogenicity islands. Some of the sRNAs affect multiple virulence genes, suggesting they function as hubs of virulence control. We further analyzed one such sRNA hub, MgrR, and one of its targets identified here, the major virulence-associated chaperon, cesT . We show that MgrR adjusts the level of EPEC cytotoxicity via regulation of CesT expression.

Inhibition of Piezo1 caused multinucleation both in vitro and in vivo. Piezo1 positioning at the ICB during cytokinesis depends on Pacsin3. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of Piezo1 or Pacsin3 resulted in mislocation of Rab11-family-interacting protein 3 (Rab11-FIP3) endosomes, apoptosis-linked gene 2-interacting protein X (ALIX), and endosomal sorting complex required for transport III (ESCRT-III). Furthermore, we identified FIP3 as the link between Piezo1-generated Ca 2+ signals and ALIX delivery to the ICB, where ALIX recruits the ESCRT-III component charged multivesicular body protein 4B, which promotes abscission. These results provide a different view of how mechanical forces participate in cytokinesis and identify Piezo1 as a key modulator of endosome trafficking.},

However, centrifugal pumps are predominately constructed by rigid and bulky components. Here, we combine the soft materials and flexible electronics to achieve soft magnetic levitation micropumps (SMLMs) that are only 1.9 to 12.8 grams in weight. The SMLMs that rotate at a rotation speed of 1000 revolutions per min to pump liquids with various viscosities ranging from 1 to 6 centipoise can be used in assisting dialysis, blood circulation, and skin temperature control because of excellent biocompatibility with no organ damage. The development of SMLMs not only demonstrates the possibility to replace rigid rotating structures with soft materials for handling large volumes of fluids but also indicates the potential for fully flexible artificial organs that may revolutionize health care and improve the well-being of patients.},

Aberrant Ca 2+ leak through ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane can lead to heatstroke and malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility, as well as severe myopathy. However, the mechanism by which Ca 2+ leak drives these pathologies is unknown. Here, we investigate the effects of four mouse genotypes with increasingly severe RyR1 leak in skeletal muscle fibers. We find that RyR1 Ca 2+ leak initiates a cascade of events that cause precise redistribution of Ca 2+ among the SR, cytoplasm, and mitochondria through altering the Ca 2+ permeability of the transverse tubular system membrane. This redistribution of Ca 2+ allows mice with moderate RyR1 leak to maintain normal function; however, severe RyR1 leak with RYR1 mutations reduces the capacity to generate force. Our results reveal the mechanism underlying force preservation, increased ATP metabolism, and susceptibility to MH in individuals with gain-of-function RYR1 mutations.},

  abstract     = {Here, we identified Dicer as a major cellular factor that recognizes the DNA binding domain (DBD) of p53 in a manner dependent on its acetylation status. Upon binding the unacetylated DBD, Dicer is recruited to the promoters of p53 target genes, where it represses p53-mediated transcriptional activation. Conversely, knockdown or knockout of endogenous Dicer leads to up-regulation of p53-mediated transcriptional activation without increasing its protein levels. Moreover, Dicer-mediated repression is independent of its intrinsic endoribonuclease activity; instead, Dicer directly represses transcription by recruiting the SUV39H1 histone methyltransferase. However, upon DNA damage, Dicer-mediated repression is abrogated by stress-induced acetylation at the DBD of p53. Notably, the inability of acetylation-defective p53-3KR in transcription is partially but significantly restored upon loss of Dicer expression. Our study reveals that Dicer acts as an unexpected acetylation “reader” for p53 and thus has important implications regarding the mechanism of acetylation-mediated regulation of p53 transcriptional program.},

A FRET-based interaction assay was used to screen for novel compounds that stabilize the noncovalent complex between CDC34A and ubiquitin, and thereby inhibit the CDC34A catalytic cycle. An isonipecotamide hit compound was elaborated into analogs with ~1000-fold increased potency in stabilizing the CDC34A-ubiquitin complex. These analogs specifically inhibited CDC34A-dependent ubiquitination in vitro and stabilized an E2~ubiquitin thioester reaction intermediate in cells. The x-ray crystal structure of a CDC34A-ubiquitin-inhibitor complex uncovered the basis for analog structure-activity relationships.

By single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified two major populations of Sim1 + PVH neurons, which are differentially affected by Sim1 haploinsufficiency. The Iroquois homeobox genes Irx3 and Irx5 have been implicated in the hypothalamic control of energy homeostasis. We found that Irx3 and Irx5 are ectopically expressed in the Sim1 + PVH cells of Sim1 +/− mice. By reducing their dosage and PVH-specific deletion of Irx3 , we demonstrate that misexpression of Irx3 and Irx5 contributes to the defects of Sim1 +/− mice.

We report several lines of evidence indicating that humans were present in the Falkland Islands centuries before Europeans, including (i) an abrupt increase in fire activity, (ii) deposits of mixed marine vertebrates that predate European exploration by centuries, and (iii) a surface-find projectile point made of local quartzite. Dietary evidence from D. australis remains further supports a potential mutualism with humans. The findings from our study are consistent with the culture of the Yaghan (Yámana) people from Tierra del Fuego.

Using genetically characteristic ruthenium and molybdenum isotope compositions of lunar impact–derived rocks, we show that the impactors during the LHB and the entire period of late accretion were the same type of bodies and that they originated in the terrestrial planet region. Because a cataclysmic LHB would have, in part, resulted in compositionally distinct projectiles, we conclude that the LHB reflects the tail end of accretion. This implies that the giant planet orbital instability occurred during the main phase of planet formation.

When housed under a 24-hour light:dark cycle and fed an obesogenic diet, these mice gained excess weight and accrued more liver fat than controls. These metabolic disturbances were corrected by matching environmental lighting to the shortened endogenous 21-hour clock period, which decreased food consumption. Thus, SCN REV-ERBs are not required for rhythmicity but determine the free-running period length.

By bringing together chemical kinetics with measurements of tau seeds and aggregates across brain regions, we can quantify their replication rate in human brains. Notably, we obtain comparable rates in several different datasets, with five different methods of tau quantification, from postmortem seed amplification assays to tau PET studies in living individuals. Our results suggest that from Braak stage III onward, local replication, rather than spreading between brain regions, is the main process controlling the overall rate of accumulation of tau in neocortical regions. The number of seeds doubles only every ∼5 years. Thus, limiting local replication likely constitutes the most promising strategy to control tau accumulation during AD.},

We show that the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway, but not the Toll pathway, is responsible for attraction and invasion of hemolymph-borne macrophages across the BBB during pupal stages. Macrophage recruitment is mediated by glial, but not neuronal, induction of the Imd pathway through expression of Pvf2. Within the brain, macrophages can phagocytose synaptic material and reduce locomotor abilities and longevity. Similarly, we show that central nervous system infection by group B Streptococcus elicits macrophage recruitment in an Imd-dependent manner.

Last, a sensory-neuromorphic system for sign language translation, which consists of stretchable resistive sensors and flexible artificial synapses, is designed and successfully evaluated via training and recognition simulation using hand sign patterns obtained by stretchable sensors (maximum recognition rate, 99.4\%).},

  abstract     = {Relationships between species diversity, productivity, temporal stability of productivity, and plant invasion have been well documented in grasslands, and these relationships could translate to improved agricultural sustainability. However, few studies have explored these relationships in agricultural contexts where fertility and weeds are managed. Using 7 years of biomass yield and species composition data from 12 species mixture treatments varying in native species diversity, we found that species richness increased yield and interannual yield stability by reducing weed abundance. Stability was driven by yield as opposed to temporal variability of yield. Nitrogen fertilization increased yield but at the expense of yield stability. We show how relationships between diversity, species asynchrony, invasion, productivity, and stability observed in natural grasslands can extend into managed agricultural systems. Increasing bioenergy crop diversity can improve farmer economics via increased yield, reduced yield variability, and reduced inputs for weed control, thus promoting perennial vegetation on agricultural lands.},

  abstract     = {Studying repeated adaptation can provide insights into the mechanisms allowing species to adapt to novel environments. Here, we investigate repeated evolution driven by habitat specialization in the common bottlenose dolphin. Parapatric pelagic and coastal ecotypes of common bottlenose dolphins have repeatedly formed across the oceans. Analyzing whole genomes of 57 individuals, we find that ecotype evolution involved a complex reticulated evolutionary history. We find parallel linked selection acted upon ancient alleles in geographically distant coastal populations, which were present as standing genetic variation in the pelagic populations. Candidate loci evolving under parallel linked selection were found in ancient tracts, suggesting recurrent bouts of selection through time. Therefore, despite the constraints of small effective population size and long generation time on the efficacy of selection, repeated adaptation in long-lived social species can be driven by a combination of ecological opportunities and selection acting on ancestral standing genetic variation.},

Here, we demonstrate a low-temperature process to transfer metal gate to 2D MoS 2 for high-quality interface. By excluding extrinsic doping to MoS 2 and increasing contact distance, the high–barrier height Pt-MoS 2 Schottky junction replaces the commonly used MOS capacitor and eliminates the use of gate dielectrics. The MoS 2 transferred metal gate (TMG) FETs exhibit sub-1 V operation voltage and a subthreshold slope close to thermal limit (60 mV/dec), owing to intrinsically high junction capacitance and the high-quality interface. The TMG and back gate enable logic functions in a single transistor with small footprint.},

In a complex virtual marine microbial ecosystem, we find that climate change–driven shifts over the 21st century are often abrupt, large in amplitude and extent, and unpredictable using standard early warning signals. Phytoplankton with unique resource needs, especially fast-growing species such as diatoms, are more prone to abrupt shifts. Abrupt shifts in biomass, productivity, and community structure are concentrated in Atlantic and Pacific subtropics. Abrupt changes in environmental variables such as temperature and nutrients rarely precede these ecosystem shifts, indicating that rapid community restructuring can occur in response to gradual environmental changes, particularly in nutrient supply rate ratios.},

Here, we show that EMT transcription factors promote ciliogenesis upon entry into intermediate EMT states by activating ciliogenesis inducers, including FGFR1. The resulting primary cilia promote ubiquitination and inactivation of a transcriptional repressor, GLIS2, which localizes to the ciliary base. We show that GLIS2 inactivation promotes MaSC stemness, and GLIS2 is required for normal mammary gland development. Moreover, GLIS2 inactivation is required to induce the proliferative and tumorigenic capacities of the mammary tumor–initiating cells (MaTICs) of claudin-low breast cancers. Claudin-low breast tumors can be segregated from other breast tumor subtypes based on a GLIS2-dependent gene expression signature. Collectively, our findings establish molecular mechanisms by which EMT programs induce ciliogenesis to control MaSC and MaTIC stemness, mammary gland development, and claudin-low breast cancer formation.},

However, in the case of high-power pulsed RF/microwave energy, a rapid thermal expansion can lead to stress waves within the body. In this study, a computational model is used to estimate the temperature profile in the human brain resulting from exposure to various RF/microwave incident field parameters. The temperatures are subsequently used to simulate the resulting mechanical response of the brain. Our simulations show that, for certain extremely high-power microwave exposures (permissible by current safety standards), very high stresses may occur within the brain that may have implications for neuropathological effects. Although the required power densities are orders of magnitude larger than most real-world exposure conditions, they can be achieved with devices meant to emit high-power electromagnetic pulses in military and research applications.},

  abstract     = {Microfluidic technologies have wide-ranging applications in chemical analysis systems, drug delivery platforms, and artificial vascular networks. This latter area is particularly relevant to 3D cell cultures, engineered tissues, and artificial organs, where volumetric capabilities in fluid distribution are essential. Existing schemes for fabricating 3D microfluidic structures are constrained in realizing desired layout designs, producing physiologically relevant microvascular structures, and/or integrating active electronic/optoelectronic/microelectromechanical components for sensing and actuation. This paper presents a guided assembly approach that bypasses these limitations to yield complex 3D microvascular structures from 2D precursors that exploit the full sophistication of 2D fabrication methods. The capabilities extend to feature sizes &lt;5 μm, in extended arrays and with various embedded sensors and actuators, across wide ranges of overall dimensions, in a parallel, high-throughput process. Examples include 3D microvascular networks with sophisticated layouts, deterministically designed and constructed to expand the geometries and operating features of artificial vascular networks.},

Animal models can be used to assess phenotypical changes in the absence of confounding factors. Here, we compared variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 to a recent B.1 SARS-CoV-2 isolate containing the D614G spike substitution in the rhesus macaque model. B.1.1.7 behaved similarly to D614G with respect to clinical disease and replication in the respiratory tract. Inoculation with B.1.351 resulted in lower clinical scores, lower lung virus titers, and less severe lung lesions. In bronchoalveolar lavages, cytokines and chemokines were up-regulated on day 4 in animals inoculated with D614G and B.1.1.7 but not with B.1.351. In nasal samples, cytokines and chemokines were up-regulated only in the B.1.1.7-inoculated animals. Together, our study suggests that circulation under diverse evolutionary pressures favors transmissibility and immune evasion rather than increased pathogenicity.},

The position and polarization control of single photons have been achieved via local strain engineering using nanostructures. However, most existing TMDC-based emitters are operated by optical pumping, while the emission sites in electrically pumped emitters are uncontrolled. Here, we demonstrate electrically driven single-photon emitters located at the positions where strains are induced by atomic force microscope indentation on a van der Waals heterostructure consisting of graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and tungsten diselenide. The optical, electrical, and mechanical properties induced by the local strain gradient were systematically analyzed. The emission at the indentation sites exhibits photon antibunching behavior with a g (2) (0) value of ~0.3, intensity saturation, and a linearly cross-polarized doublet, at 4 kelvin. This robust spatial control of electrically driven single-photon emitters will pave the way for the practical implementation of integrated quantum light sources.},

The interplay between nonlinear community dynamics and environmental fluctuations determines the rich statistical structure of community variability. We analyze long time series of individual human gut microbiomes and compare intra- and intercommunity dissimilarity under a macroecological framework. We show that most taxa have large but stationary fluctuations over time, while a minority of taxa display rapid changes in average abundance that cluster in time, suggesting the presence of alternative stable states. We disentangle interindividual variability in a stochastic component and a deterministic one, the latter recapitulated by differences in carrying capacities. Last, by combining environmental fluctuations and alternative stable states, we introduce a model that quantitatively predicts the statistical properties of both intra- and interindividual community variability, therefore summarizing variation in a unique macroecological framework.},

FleQ is a σ 54 -dependent master transcriptional regulator of flagellar genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The ATPase activity of FleQ is regulated via a P-loop ATPase, FleN, through protein-protein interaction. We report a high-resolution crystal structure of the AAA+ domain of FleQ in complex with antiactivator FleN. The data reveal that FleN allosterically prevents ATP binding to FleQ. Furthermore, FleN remodels the region of FleQ essential for engagement with σ 54 for transcription initiation. Disruption of the conserved protein-protein interface, by mutation, shows motility and transcription defects in vivo and multiflagellate phenotype.

Scaffolds consisting of polyvinylidene tri-fluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) were prepared to mimic the cell wall’s fibrillar structure and its relative hydrophobicity and piezoelectric property. We found that cells adhered best to scaffolds consisting of nanosized aligned fibers. In addition, poling of PVDF-TrFE, which orients the fiber dipoles and renders the scaffold more piezoelectric, increased cell adhesion. Enzymatic treatments revealed that the plant cell wall polysaccharide, pectin, is largely responsible for cell adhesion to scaffolds, analogous to pectin-mediated cell adhesion in plant tissues. Together, this work establishes the first plant biomimetic scaffolds that will enable studies of how cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions affect plant developmental pathways.},

Transcriptional cycling of core-clock genes BMAL1, CLOCK , and PER3 was altered in skeletal muscle from individuals with T2D, and this was coupled with reduced number and amplitude of cycling genes and disturbed circadian oxygen consumption. Inner mitochondria–associated genes were enriched for rhythmic peaks in normal glucose tolerance, but not T2D, and positively correlated with insulin sensitivity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing identified CLOCK and BMAL1 binding to inner-mitochondrial genes associated with insulin sensitivity, implicating regulation by the core clock.

To execute NLRC4-dependent cell death, three death pathways complement each other in a specific order: Pyroptosis pathway requiring caspase-1 and GSDMD is the default path; impairment of it initiates ASC-mediated caspase-8–dependent apoptosis; when these two pathways are blocked, caspase-1 triggers intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Blocking one or two of these death pathways inhibits induction of various cytokines and lipid mediators, but mice still succumb, and only genetic deletions that block all death paths prevent NLRC4-mediated cell death, tissue damage, and mice death. In addition, infection of nonpropagative Salmonella -caused mice death is attenuated by blocking these death pathways. Thus, to reduce the lethality of infection-related diseases, preventing cell death might be necessary when propagation of infected pathogen was controlled by other means.},

NAAA catalyzes the deactivating hydrolysis of palmitoylethanolamide, a lipid-derived agonist of the transcriptional regulator of cellular metabolism, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α). Our results show that disabling NAAA in spinal cord during a 72-h time window following peripheral tissue injury halts chronic pain development in male and female mice by triggering a PPAR-α-dependent reprogramming of local core metabolism from aerobic glycolysis, which is transiently enhanced after end-organ damage, to mitochondrial respiration.

Our process uses a paraffin swollen light responsive dynamic polymer network. Selective light exposure activates the network locally, causing stress imbalance. This drives the internal redistribution of the paraffin liquid, yielding controllable formation of microstructures. This single-step process is completed in 10 seconds, does not involve any volatile solvents/reactants, and can be adapted to three-dimensional complex surfaces. The living nature of the network further allows sequential growth of hierarchical microstructures.

  abstract     = {To survive in harsh environments, single-celled microorganisms autonomously respond to external stimuli, such as light, heat, and flow. Here, we elucidate the flow response of Tetrahymena, a well-known single-celled freshwater microorganism. Tetrahymena moves upstream against an external flow via a behavior called rheotaxis. While micrometer-sized particles are swept away downstream in a viscous flow, what dynamics underlie the rheotaxis of the ciliate? Our experiments reveal that Tetrahymena slides along walls during upstream movement, which indicates that the cells receive rotational torque from shear flow to control cell orientation. To evaluate the effects of the shear torque and propelling speed, we perform a numerical simulation with a hydrodynamic model swimmer adopting cilia dynamics in a shear flow. The swimmer orientations converge to an upstream alignment, and the swimmer slides upstream along a boundary wall. The results suggest that Tetrahymena automatically responds to shear flow by performing rheotaxis using cilia-stalling mechanics.},

  abstract     = {The bone-derived hormone osteocalcin (OCN) is crucial for brain development and neural cognitive functions, yet the exact roles of OCN in central nervous system (CNS) remain elusive. Here, we find that genetic deletion of OCN facilitates oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and hypermyelination in the CNS. Although dispensable for the proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), OCN is critical for the myelination of OLs, which affects myelin production and remyelination after demyelinating injury. Genome-wide RNA sequencing analyses reveal that OCN regulates a number of G protein–coupled receptors and myelination-associated transcription factors, of which Myrf might be a key downstream effector in OLs. GPR37 is identified as a previously unknown receptor for OCN, thus regulating OL differentiation and CNS myelination. Overall, these findings suggest that OCN orchestrates the transition between OPCs and myelinating OLs via GPR37 signaling, and hence, the OCN/GPR37 pathway regulates myelin homeostasis in the CNS.},

Using numerical simulations, we investigate the relative sensitivity of grounded-ice loss to the spatial distribution and overall volume of ice-shelf melt over two centuries. Contrary to earlier work, we find only minor sensitivity to melt distribution (&lt;6\%), with a linear dependence of ice loss on the total melt. Thus, less complex models that need not reproduce the detailed melt distribution may simplify the projection of future sea level. The linear sensitivity suggests a contribution of up to 5.1 cm from Pine Island Glacier over the next two centuries given anticipated levels of ocean warming, provided its ice shelf does not collapse because of other causes.},

This toxin acts by glucosylating small GTPases in the Rho/Ras families, but the structural basis for TcdB recognition and selectivity of specific GTPase substrates remain unsolved. Here, we report the cocrystal structures of the glucosyltransferase domain (GTD) of two distinct TcdB variants in complex with human Cdc42 and R-Ras, respectively. These structures reveal a common structural mechanism by which TcdB recognizes Rho and R-Ras. Furthermore, we find selective clustering of adaptive residue changes in GTDs that determine their substrate preferences, which helps partition all known TcdB variants into two groups that display distinct specificities toward Rho or R-Ras. Mutations that selectively disrupt GTPases binding reduce the glucosyltransferase activity of the GTD and the toxicity of TcdB holotoxin. These findings establish the structural basis for TcdB recognition of small GTPases and reveal strategies for therapeutic interventions for CDI.},

In the field of photonics, synchronization has been implemented in various laser and oscillator systems, enabling applications including coherent beam combining and high-precision pump-probe measurements. Recent experiments have also shown time-domain synchronization of Kerr frequency combs via coupling of two separate oscillators operating in the dissipative soliton [i.e., anomalous group velocity dispersion (GVD)] regime. Here, we demonstrate all-optical synchronization of Kerr combs in the nonsolitonic, normal GVD regime in which phase-locked combs with high pump-to-comb conversion efficiencies and relatively flat spectral profiles are generated. Our results reveal the universality of Kerr comb synchronization and extend its scope beyond the soliton regime, opening a promising path toward coherently combined normal GVD Kerr combs with spectrally flat profiles and high comb-line powers in an efficient microresonator platform.},

Here, we use statistical learning to extract a fingerprint of climate change that is robust to different model representations and magnitudes of internal variability. We find a best estimate forced warming trend of 0.8°C over the past 40 years, slightly larger than observed. It is extremely likely that at least 85\% is attributable to external forcing based on the median variability across climate models. Detection remains robust even when evaluated against models with high variability and if decadal-scale variability were doubled. This work addresses a long-standing limitation in attributing warming to external forcing and opens up opportunities even in the case of large model differences in decadal-scale variability, model structural uncertainty, and limited observational records.},

Bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) protein inhibitors were predicted to rely upon several gene clusters inclusive of galectin-8 (LGALS8). Correspondingly, LGALS8 was found to mediate the BET inhibitor–dependent control of endothelial apoptosis, an essential role for PH in vivo. Separately, a piperlongumine analog’s actions were predicted to depend upon the iron-sulfur biogenesis gene ISCU. Correspondingly, the analog was found to inhibit ISCU glutathionylation, rescuing oxidative metabolism, decreasing endothelial apoptosis, and improving PH. Thus, we identified crucial drug-gene axes central to endothelial dysfunction and therapeutic priorities for PH.

Here, we used high-resolution optical microscopy to observe single bacterial aggresomes, nanostructured intracellular assemblies of proteins, to undercover their role in cell stress. We find that proteins inside aggresomes are mobile and undergo dynamic turnover, consistent with a liquid state. Our observations are in quantitative agreement with phase-separated liquid droplet formation driven by interacting proteins under thermal equilibrium that nucleate following diffusive collisions in the cytoplasm. We have found aggresomes in multiple species of bacteria and show that these emergent, metastable liquid-structured protein assemblies increase bacterial fitness by enabling cells to tolerate environmental stresses.},

However, climate simulations and paleoenvironmental studies mostly provide snapshots of the past climate, therefore overlooking the role of this short-term variability in driving major environmental changes and possibly biasing model-data comparisons. We address this problem by performing numerical simulations describing the end-members of eccentricity, obliquity, and precession. The orbitally induced biome variability obtained in our simulations allows to reconcile previous apparent mismatch between models and paleobotanical compilations. We show that precession-driven intermittent monsoon-like climate may have taken place during the Eocene, resulting in biomes shifting from shrubland to tropical forest in the intertropical convergence zone migration region. Our Oligocene simulations suggest that, along with decreased p CO 2 , orbital variations crucially modulated major faunal dispersal events around the EOT such as the Grande Coupure by creating and fragmenting the biome corridors along several key land bridges.},

Using temporally controlled inhibition of D1R-NMDAR heteromerization, we unraveled their selective implication in early phases of cocaine-mediated synaptic, morphological, and behavioral responses. In contrast, preventing D2R-NMDAR heteromerization blocked the persistence of these adaptations. Interfering with these heteromers spared natural reward processing. Notably, we established that D2R-NMDAR complexes exist in human samples and showed that, despite a decreased D2R protein expression in the NAc, individuals with psychostimulant use disorder display a higher proportion of D2R forming heteromers with NMDAR.

  abstract     = {The microtubule-associated protein tau aggregates in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, causing inflammation and changing the inflammatory signature of microglia by unknown mechanisms. We have shown that microglia phagocytose live neurons containing tau aggregates cultured from P301S tau mice due to neuronal tau aggregate-induced exposure of the “eat me” signal phosphatidylserine. Here, we show that after phagocytosing tau aggregate-bearing neurons, microglia become hypophagocytic while releasing seed-competent insoluble tau aggregates. These microglia express a senescence-like phenotype, demonstrated by acidic β-galactosidase activity, secretion of paracrine senescence-associated cytokines, and maturation of matrix remodeling enzymes, results that are corroborated in P301S mouse brains and ex vivo brain slices. In particular, the nuclear factor κB–dependent activation of matrix metalloprotease 3 (MMP3/stromelysin1) was replicated in brains from patients with tauopathy. These data show that microglia that have been activated to ingest live tau aggregates-bearing neurons behave hormetically, becoming hypofunctional while acting as vectors of tau aggregate spreading.},

  abstract     = {Individual cells are heterogeneous when responding to environmental cues. Under an external signal, certain cells activate gene regulatory pathways, while others completely ignore that signal. Mechanisms underlying cellular heterogeneity are often inaccessible because experiments needed to study molecular states destroy the very states that we need to examine. Here, we developed an image-based support vector machine learning model to uncover variables controlling activation of the immune pathway nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Computer vision analysis predicts the identity of cells that will respond to cytokine stimulation and shows that activation is predetermined by minute amounts of “leaky” NF-κB (p65:p50) localization to the nucleus. Mechanistic modeling revealed that the ratio of NF-κB to inhibitor of NF-κB predetermines leakiness and activation probability of cells. While cells transition between molecular states, they maintain their overall probabilities for NF-κB activation. Our results demonstrate how computer vision can find mechanisms behind heterogeneous single-cell activation under proinflammatory stimuli.},

Specifically, we simulated how passengers encounter and infect each other during their journeys in public transport by tracking movements of passengers. The probabilities of exposure to infections in public transport via the aforementioned preventive measures were compared by using the Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, and Recovered model, a respiratory infectious disease diffusion model. We determined that the mandatory wearing of masks exhibits effects similar to maintaining 2-m social distancing in preventing COVID-19. Mandatory wearing of masks and practicing social distancing with masks during peak hours reduced infection rates by 93.5 and 98.1\%, respectively.},

We used two-photon calcium imaging to simultaneously observe layer (L) 2/3 and L5a excitatory neuronal activity in the motor cortex (M1) while mice adapted to changing speeds on a computerized running wheel. Despite circuit hypoactivity and weakened functional connectivity across L2/3 and L5a, the Mecp2 -null circuit’s firing pattern evolved with improved performance over 2 weeks. Moreover, trained mice became less anxious and lived 20\% longer than untrained mice. Because motor deficits and anxiety are core symptoms of RTT, which is not diagnosed until well after symptom onset, these results underscore the benefit of motor learning.},

Here, we show that in Arabidopsis , ABA homeostasis is regulated by two previously unknown ABA transporters. Adenosine triphosphate–binding cassette subfamily G member 17 (ABCG17) and ABCG18 are localized to the plasma membranes of leaf mesophyll and cortex cells to redundantly promote ABA import, leading to conjugated inactive ABA sinks, thus restricting stomatal closure. ABCG17 and ABCG18 double knockdown revealed that the transporters encoded by these genes not only limit stomatal aperture size, conductance, and transpiration while increasing water use efficiency but also control ABA translocation from the shoot to the root to regulate lateral root emergence. Under abiotic stress conditions, ABCG17 and ABCG18 are transcriptionally repressed, promoting active ABA movement and response. The transport mechanism mediated by ABCG17 and ABCG18 allows plants to maintain ABA homeostasis under normal growth conditions.},

Here, we show that when MYCN -amplified neuroblastoma cells are treated with retinoic acid, histone H3K27 acetylation and methylation become redistributed to decommission super-enhancers driving the expression of PHOX2B and GATA3 , together with the activation of new super-enhancers that drive high levels of MEIS1 and SOX4 expression. These findings indicate that treatment with retinoids can reprogram the enhancer landscape, resulting in down-regulation of MYCN expression, while establishing a new retino-sympathetic CRC that causes proliferative arrest and sympathetic differentiation. Thus, we provide mechanisms that account for the beneficial effects of retinoids in high-risk neuroblastoma and explain the rapid down-regulation of expression of MYCN despite massive levels of amplification of this gene.},

Notably, these abnormal phenotypes were robustly rescued by the administration of seven selected essential amino acids. The up-regulation of inflammation-associated gene expression and progressive brain atrophy in the tauopathy model were profoundly suppressed by treatment with these essential amino acids without modifications of tau depositions. Moreover, the levels of kynurenine, an initiator of a pathway inducing neuroinflammatory gliosis and neurotoxicity in the brain, were lowered by treatment through inhibition of kynurenine uptake in the brain. Our findings highlight the importance of specific amino acids as systemic mediators of brain homeostasis against neurodegenerative processes.},

Here, we present an in-depth investigation via both experimental and computational methods on the HMP dissipation process during printing as a result of (i) external resistance from the printing apparatus and (ii) internal physicochemical properties of HMPs. In general, a small syringe opening, large or polydisperse size of HMPs, and less deformable HMPs induce high resistance and closer HMP packing, which improves printing fidelity and stability due to increased interparticle adhesion. However, smooth extrusion and preserving viability of encapsulated cells require low resistance during printing, which is associated with less shear stress. These findings can be used to improve printability of HMPs and facilitate their broader use in 3D bioprinting.},

  abstract     = {For color vision, retinal circuits separate information about intensity and wavelength. In vertebrates that use the full complement of four “ancestral” cone types, the nature and implementation of this computation remain poorly understood. Here, we establish the complete circuit architecture of outer retinal circuits underlying color processing in larval zebrafish. We find that the synaptic outputs of red and green cones efficiently rotate the encoding of natural daylight in a principal components analysis–like manner to yield primary achromatic and spectrally opponent axes, respectively. Blue cones are tuned to capture most remaining variance when opposed to green cones, while UV cone present a UV achromatic axis for prey capture. We note that fruitflies use essentially the same strategy. Therefore, rotating color space into primary achromatic and chromatic axes at the eye’s first synapse may thus be a fundamental principle of color vision when using more than two spectrally well-separated photoreceptor types.},

  abstract     = {Dipolar recoupling is a central concept in the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of powdered solids and is used to establish correlations between different nuclei by magnetization transfer. The efficiency of conventional cross-polarization methods is low because of the inherent radio frequency (rf) field inhomogeneity present in the magic angle spinning (MAS) experiments and the large chemical shift anisotropies at high magnetic fields. Very high transfer efficiencies can be obtained using optimal control–derived experiments. These sequences had to be optimized individually for a particular MAS frequency. We show that by adjusting the length and the rf field amplitude of the shaped pulse synchronously with sample rotation, optimal control sequences can be successfully applied over a range of MAS frequencies without the need of reoptimization. This feature greatly enhances their applicability on spectrometers operating at differing external fields where the MAS frequency needs to be adjusted to avoid detrimental resonance effects.},

PatA is an essential acyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidyl- myo -inositol mannosides (PIMs), key structural elements and virulence factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis . We demonstrate by electron spin resonance spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance that PatA is an integral membrane acyltransferase tightly anchored to anionic lipid bilayers, using a two-helix structural motif and electrostatic interactions. PatA dictates the acyl chain composition of the glycolipid by using an acyl chain selectivity “ruler.” We established this by a combination of structural biology, enzymatic activity, and binding measurements on chemically synthesized nonhydrolyzable acyl–coenzyme A (CoA) derivatives. We propose an interfacial catalytic mechanism that allows PatA to acylate hydrophobic PIMs anchored in the inner membrane of mycobacteria, through the use of water-soluble acyl-CoA donors.},

Here, we comprehensively characterized metabolic alterations in Polg D257A mice. Plasma alanine increased markedly with time, with other organic acids accumulating to a lesser extent. These changes were reflective of increased Cori and Cahill cycling in Polg D257A mice and subsequent hypoglycemia, which did not occur during normal mouse aging. Tracing with [ 15 N]ammonium further supported this shift in amino acid metabolism with mild impairment of the urea cycle. We also measured alterations in the lipidome, observing a reduction in canonical lipids and accumulation of 1-deoxysphingolipids, which are synthesized from alanine via promiscuous serine palmitoyltransferase activity and correlate with peripheral neuropathy. Consistent with this metabolic link, Polg D257A mice exhibited thermal hypoalgesia. These results highlight the longitudinal changes that occur in intermediary metabolism upon mitochondrial impairment and identify a contributing mechanism to mitochondria-associated neuropathy.},

To take advantage of their emergent functionalities, such supraparticles must retain their structural integrity. Here, we investigate their size-dependent mechanical properties via nanoindentation. We find that the deformation resistance inversely scales with the primary particle diameter, while the work of deformation is dependent on the supraparticle diameter. We adopt the Griffith theory to such particulate systems to provide a predictive scaling to relate the fracture stress to the geometry of supraparticles. The interplay between primary particle material and cohesive interparticle forces dictates the mechanical properties of supraparticles. We find that enhanced stability, associated with ductile fracture, can be achieved if supraparticles are engineered to dissipate more energy via deformation of primary particles than breaking of interparticle bonds. Our work provides a coherent framework to analyze, predict, and design the mechanical properties of colloidal supraparticles.},

We here investigate the dynamics of brain fingerprints along two complementary axes: (i) What is the optimal time scale at which brain fingerprints integrate information and (ii) when best identification happens. Using dynamic identifiability, we show that the best identification emerges at longer time scales; however, short transient “bursts of identifiability, ” associated with neuronal activity, persist even when looking at shorter functional interactions. Furthermore, we report evidence that different parts of connectome fingerprints relate to different time scales, i.e., more visual-somatomotor at short temporal windows and more frontoparietal-DMN driven at increasing temporal windows. Last, different cognitive functions appear to be meta-analytically implicated in dynamic fingerprints across time scales.

Here, we present a fabrication method of 3DE based on predistorted pattern generation and thermoforming. Through this method, custom-designed 3DE is fabricated through the thermoforming process. The fabricated 3DE has high 3D conformability because the thermoforming process enables the complete replication of both the overall shape and the surface texture of the 3D mold. Furthermore, the usage of thermoplastic elastomer and a liquid metal–based conductive electrode allows for high thermoformability during the device fabrication as well as high stretchability during the device operation.

Plant invasions were not only more extensive in PAs than non-PA controls but also undermined PA performance by, without human intervention, irreversibly replacing expansive native wetlands (primarily mudflats) and precluding successional formation of new native marshes. Exotic species are invading PAs globally. This study across large spatiotemporal scales highlights that the consequences of bioinvasions for humanity’s major conservation tool may be more profound, far reaching, and critical for management than currently recognized.},

Corals performed better in mixed species assemblages. Improved performance was unexplained by competition theory alone, suggesting that positive effects exceeded agonistic interactions during our experiments. Peak coral performance occurred at intermediate species richness and declined thereafter. Positive effects of coral diversity suggest that species’ losses on degraded reefs make recovery more difficult and further decline more likely.

Here, we demonstrate that suppression of FGFR1 and OSMR by miR-1/133a is instrumental to prevent cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and cell cycle entry in the adult heart. Concomitant inactivation of both miR-1/133a clusters in adult cardiomyocytes activates expression of cell cycle regulators, induces a switch from fatty acid to glycolytic metabolism, and changes expression of extracellular matrix genes. Inhibition of FGFR and OSMR pathways prevents most effects of miR-1/133a inactivation. Short-term miR-1/133a depletion protects cardiomyocytes against ischemia, while extended loss of miR-1/133a causes heart failure.

  abstract     = {The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ~55.9 Ma) was a geologically rapid warming period associated with carbon release, which caused a marked increase in the hydrological cycle. Here, we use lithium (Li) isotopes to assess the global change in weathering regime, a critical carbon drawdown mechanism, across the PETM. We find a negative Li isotope excursion of ~3‰ in both global seawater (marine carbonates) and in local weathering inputs (detrital shales). This is consistent with a very large delivery of clays to the oceans or a shift in the weathering regime toward higher physical erosion rates and sediment fluxes. Our seawater records are best explained by increases in global erosion rates of ~2× to 3× over 100 ka, combined with model-derived weathering increases of 50 to 60\% compared to prewarming values. Such increases in weathering and erosion would have supported enhanced carbon burial, as both carbonate and organic carbon, thereby stabilizing climate.},

  abstract     = {Progressive loss of cardiac systolic function in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) has recently gained attention as an important clinical consideration in managing the disease. However, the mechanisms leading to reduction in cardiac contractility are poorly defined. Here, we use CRISPR gene editing to generate human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that harbor plakophilin-2 truncating variants ( PKP2 tv), the most prevalent ACM-linked mutations. The PKP2 tv iPSC–derived cardiomyocytes are shown to have aberrant action potentials and reduced systolic function in cardiac microtissues, recapitulating both the electrical and mechanical pathologies reported in ACM. By combining cell micropatterning with traction force microscopy and live imaging, we found that PKP2 tvs impair cardiac tissue contractility by destabilizing cell-cell junctions and in turn disrupting sarcomere stability and organization. These findings highlight the interplay between cell-cell adhesions and sarcomeres required for stabilizing cardiomyocyte structure and function and suggest fundamental pathogenic mechanisms that may be shared among different types of cardiomyopathies.},

By analyzing a five-decade (1971–2017) data series of individual southern right whales (SRWs; Eubalaena australis ) photo-identified at Península Valdés, Argentina, we found a marked increase in whale mortality rates following El Niño events. By modeling how the population responds to changes in the frequency and intensity of El Niño events, we found that such events are likely to impede SRW population recovery and could even cause population decline. Such outcomes have the potential to disrupt food-web interactions in the SO, weakening that ecosystem’s contribution to the mitigation of climate change at a global scale.},

We uncovered a muscle cell vulnerability by studying miR-1, a deeply conserved, muscle-specific microRNA whose ablation causes various muscle defects. Using Caenorhabditis elegans , we found that miR-1 represses multiple subunits of the ubiquitous vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) complex, which is essential for internal compartment acidification and metabolic signaling. V-ATPase subunits are predicted miR-1 targets in animals ranging from C. elegans to humans, and we experimentally validated this in Drosophila . Unexpectedly, up-regulation of V-ATPase subunits upon miR-1 deletion causes reduced V-ATPase function due to defects in complex assembly. These results reveal V-ATPase assembly as a conserved muscle cell vulnerability and support a previously unknown role for microRNAs in the regulation of protein complexes.},

We tagged soft and tough double-network elastomers with mechanofluorescent probes and quantified damage by sacrificial bond scission after crack propagation under cyclic and monotonic loading. Damage along fracture surfaces and its spatial localization depend on the elastomer design, as well as on the applied load (i.e., cyclic or monotonic). The key result is that reversible elasticity and strain hardening at low and intermediate strains dictates fatigue resistance, whereas energy dissipation at high strains controls toughness. This information serves to engineer fatigue-resistant elastomers, understand fracture mechanisms, and reduce the environmental footprint of the polymer industry.},

Using multivariate principal components analysis, we found sex-dimorphic responses in mice exposed to accelerated charged particles to simulate GCR (GCRsim); males displayed impaired spatial learning, whereas females did not. Mechanistically, these GCRsim-induced learning impairments corresponded with chronic microglia activation and synaptic alterations in the hippocampus. Temporary microglia depletion shortly after GCRsim exposure mitigated GCRsim-induced deficits measured months after the radiation exposure. Furthermore, blood monocyte levels measured early after GCRsim exposure were predictive of the late learning deficits and microglia activation measured in the male mice. Our findings (i) advance our understanding of charged particle–induced cognitive challenges, (ii) provide evidence for early peripheral biomarkers for identifying late cognitive deficits, and (iii) offer potential therapeutic strategies for mitigating GCR-induced cognitive loss.},

In standard cryogenic systems, however, thermal decoherence prevents access to the quantum regime for photon frequencies below the gigahertz domain. Here, we engineer two superconducting LC circuits coupled by a photon-pressure interaction and demonstrate sideband cooling of a hot radio frequency (RF) circuit using a microwave cavity. Because of a substantially increased coupling strength, we obtain a large single-photon quantum cooperativity 𝒞 q0 ∼ 1 and reduce the thermal RF occupancy by 75\% with less than one pump photon. For larger pump powers, the coupling rate exceeds the RF thermal decoherence rate by a factor of 3, and the RF circuit is cooled into the quantum ground state. Our results lay the foundation for RF quantum photonics.},

Here, we ask how the uniform activation oncogene RAS affects the morphology and tissue mechanics in a normal epithelium. We found that inducible induction of HRAS in confined epithelial monolayers on soft substrates drives a morphological transformation of a 2D monolayer into a compact 3D cell aggregate. This transformation was initiated by the loss of monolayer integrity and formation of two distinct cell layers with differential cell-cell junctions, cell-substrate adhesion, and tensional states. Computational modeling revealed how adhesion and active peripheral tension induces inherent mechanical instability in the system, which drives the 2D-to-3D morphological transformation. Consistent with this, removal of epithelial tension through the inhibition of actomyosin contractility halted the process. These findings reveal the mechanisms by which oncogene activation within an epithelium can induce mechanical instability to drive morphological tissue transformation.},

Here, we describe Copy-scAT, an R package that uses single-cell epigenomic data to infer copy number variants (CNVs) that define cancer cells. Copy-scAT enables studies of subclonal chromatin dynamics in complex tumors like glioblastoma. By deploying Copy-scAT, we uncovered potent influences of genetics on chromatin accessibility profiles in individual subclones. Consequently, some genetic subclones were predisposed to acquire stem-like or more differentiated molecular phenotypes, reminiscent of developmental paradigms. Copy-scAT is ideal for studies of the relationships between genetics and epigenetics in malignancies with high levels of intratumoral heterogeneity and to investigate how cancer cells interface with their microenvironment.},

We developed a framework for estimating the burden of yellow fever in Africa and evaluated its sensitivity to modeling assumptions that are often overlooked. We found that alternative interpretations of serological data resulted in a nearly 20-fold difference in burden estimates (range of central estimates, 8.4 × 10 4 to 1.5 × 10 6 deaths in 2021–2030). Uncertainty about the vaccination status of serological study participants was the primary driver of this uncertainty. Even so, statistical uncertainty was even greater than uncertainty due to modeling assumptions, accounting for a total of 87\% of variance in burden estimates. Combined with estimates that most infections go unreported (range of 95\% credible intervals, 99.65 to 99.99\%), our results suggest that yellow fever’s burden will remain highly uncertain without major improvements in surveillance.},

Using molecular modeling, we found DENV2 E protein mutations that induce dimerization at low concentrations (&lt;100 pM) and enhance production yield by more than 50-fold. Cross-dimer epitope antibodies bind to the stabilized dimers, and a crystal structure resembles the wild-type (WT) E protein bound to a dimer epitope antibody. Mice immunized with the stabilized dimers developed antibodies that bind to E dimers and not monomers and elicited higher levels of DENV2-neutralizing antibodies compared to mice immunized with WT E antigen.

The ability of the engineered implants to reduce fasting glucose levels was tested in diet-induced obesity mice. Decrease and stabilization of basal glucose levels were apparent up to 4 months after implantation. Analysis of the retrieved constructs showed elevated expression of myokines and proteins related to metabolic processes. In addition, we validated the efficiency of OEG4-EMCs in insulin-resistant mice. Following high glucose load administration, mice showed improved glucose tolerance. Our data indicate that OEG4-EMC implant is an efficient mode for restoring insulin sensitivity and improving glucose homeostasis in diabetic mice.

  abstract     = {Twinning is a prominent deformation mode that accommodates plasticity in many materials. This study elucidates the role of deformation rate on the atomic-scale mechanisms that govern twin boundary migration. Examination of Mg single crystals deformed under quasi-static compression was compared with crystals deformed via plate impact. Evidence of two mechanisms was uncovered. Atomic-level observations using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed that twin boundaries in the -axis quasi-statically compressed single crystals are relatively smooth. At these modest stresses and rates, the twin boundaries were found to migrate predominantly via shear (i.e., disconnection nucleation and propagation). By contrast, in the plate-impacted crystals, which are subjected to higher stresses and rates, twin boundary migration was facilitated by local atomic shuffling and rearrangement, resulting in rumpled twin boundaries. This rate dependency also leads to marked variations in twin variant, size, and number density in Mg. Analogous effects are anticipated in other hexagonal closed-packed crystals.},

  abstract     = {Gastrointestinal motility disorders occur frequently in patients with ciliopathy, but the underlying genetic link is unclear. The ciliary protein Kif7 can positively or negatively regulate Hedgehog signaling in different cellular contexts. Mice with neural crest cell (NCC)–specific Kif7 deficiency show a marked reduction of enteric NOS + inhibitory neurons. Malformation of enteric nervous system (ENS) causes growth retardation and gut motility defect in mice. Mechanistically, Kif7 inhibits Gli2 in enteric NCCs (ENCCs), where Gli2 positively regulates the expression of Ezh2 by inhibiting the miR124 -mediated suppression. In developing ENCCs, Ezh2 is a master regulator of 102 core genes underlying ENCC differentiation. Deletion of Gli2 or inhibition of Ezh2 favors the neurogenic lineage differentiation of mouse and human ENCCs and rescues the ENS defects of Kif7 mutants. In summary, Hedgehog signal, via Kif7-Gli-Ezh2, controls the timely expressions of the core genes to mediate the differentiation of ENCCs.},

Although many materials exist for additive manufacturing, most suffer from performance trade-offs. Current materials are designed with inefficient human-driven intuition-based methods, leaving them short of optimal solutions. We propose a machine learning approach to accelerating the discovery of additive manufacturing materials with optimal trade-offs in mechanical performance. A multiobjective optimization algorithm automatically guides the experimental design by proposing how to mix primary formulations to create better performing materials. The algorithm is coupled with a semiautonomous fabrication platform to substantially reduce the number of performed experiments and overall time to solution. Without prior knowledge of the primary formulations, the proposed methodology autonomously uncovers 12 optimal formulations and enlarges the discovered performance space 288 times after only 30 experimental iterations. This methodology could be easily generalized to other material design systems and enable automated discovery.},

Mechanical forces induce microtubule deformation, which is presumed to be critical for the mechanoregulation of cellular events. However, concrete evidence is lacking. In this work, with high-speed atomic force microscopy, we unravel how microtubule deformation regulates the translocation of the microtubule-associated motor protein kinesin-1, responsible for intracellular transport. Our results show that the microtubule deformation by bending impedes the translocation dynamics of kinesins along them. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that the hindered translocation of kinesins can be attributed to an enhanced affinity of kinesins to the microtubule structural units in microtubules deformed by bending. This study advances our understanding of the role of cytoskeletal components in mechanotransduction.},

We found that low temperature seasonality and high topographic heterogeneity were the main global determinants of phylogenetic endemism. While phylogenetic endemism hotspots cover 22\% of Earth, these regions currently have a high human footprint, low natural land cover, minimal protection, and will be greatly affected by climate change. Evolutionarily unique, narrow-range species are crucial for sustaining biodiversity in the face of environmental change.

Here, we quantify pollinator contribution to seed production by comparing fertility in the presence versus the absence of pollinators for a global dataset of 1174 plant species. We estimate that, without pollinators, a third of flowering plant species would produce no seeds and half would suffer an 80\% or more reduction in fertility. Pollinator contribution to plant reproduction is higher in plants with tree growth form, multiple reproductive episodes, more specialized pollination systems, and tropical distributions, making these groups especially vulnerable to reduced service from pollinators. These results suggest that, without mitigating efforts, pollinator declines have the potential to reduce reproduction for most plant species, increasing the risk of population declines.},

However, given the risk of revealing individual information, many statistical agencies are considering disclosure control methods based on differential privacy, which add noise to tabulated data. Unlike other applications of differential privacy, however, census statistics must be postprocessed after noise injection to be usable. We study the impact of the U.S. Census Bureau’s latest disclosure avoidance system (DAS) on a major application of census statistics, the redrawing of electoral districts. We find that the DAS systematically undercounts the population in mixed-race and mixed-partisan precincts, yielding unpredictable racial and partisan biases. While the DAS leads to a likely violation of the “One Person, One Vote” standard as currently interpreted, it does not prevent accurate predictions of an individual’s race and ethnicity. Our findings underscore the difficulty of balancing accuracy and respondent privacy in the Census.},

However, a mechanistic understanding of the molecular basis for the intervening structural transition, important for the design of fusion inhibitors, has remained elusive. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and other biophysical methods, we demonstrate the presence of α-helical, membrane-bound, intermediate states of spike’s heptad repeat (HR1 and HR2) domains that are embedded at the lipid-water interface while in a slow dynamic equilibrium with the postfusion 6HB state. These results support a model where the HR domains lower the large energy barrier associated with membrane fusion by destabilizing the host and viral membranes, while 6HB formation actively drives their fusion by forcing physical proximity.},

Traditional optimization is inefficient for this microlattice because (i) the design space has discrete, qualitative parameter states as input variables, (ii) the cost function is computationally expensive, and (iii) the design space is large.

In vitro, 100-nm nanoparticles were taken up readily by primary neurons, trafficking from the neuronal body and along the axons. We demonstrate that signaling between triple-negative breast cancer cells (4T1) and neurons involves secretion of cytokines stimulating neurite outgrowth. Reciprocally, neurons stimulated 4T1 proliferation, migration, and survival through secretion of neurotransmitters. Bupivacaine curbs neurite growth and signaling with cancer cells, inhibiting cancer cell viability. In vivo, bupivacaine-loaded nanoparticles intravenously administered suppressed neurons in orthotopic triple-negative breast cancer tumors, inhibiting tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.

ParB acts as adaptor protein between the 16–base pair centromeric parS DNA sequences and the DNA segregation proteins ParA and Smc (structural maintenance of chromosomes). Upon cytidine triphosphate (CTP) and parS DNA binding, ParB dimers form DNA clamps that spread onto parS -flanking DNA by sliding, thus assembling the so-called partition complex. We show here that CTP hydrolysis is essential for efficient chromosome segregation by ParABS but largely dispensable for Smc recruitment. Our results suggest that CTP hydrolysis contributes to partition complex assembly via two mechanisms. It promotes ParB unloading from DNA to limit the extent of ParB spreading, and it recycles off-target ParB clamps to allow for parS retargeting, together superconcentrating ParB near parS . We also propose a model for clamp closure involving a steric clash when binding ParB protomers to opposing parS half sites.},

  abstract     = {The lack of satisfactory treatment for persistent pain profoundly impairs the quality of life for many patients. Stimulation of brainstem pain control systems can trigger powerful analgesia, but their complex network organization frequently prevents separation of analgesia from side effects. To overcome this long-standing challenge, we developed a biocompatible gelatin-embedded cluster of ultrathin microelectrodes that enables fine-tuned, high-definition three-dimensional stimulation in periaqueductal gray/dorsal raphe nucleus in awake rats. Analgesia was assessed from both motor reactions and intracortical signals, corresponding to pain-related signals in humans. We could select an individual-specific subset of microelectrodes in each animal that reliably provided strong pain inhibition during normal and hyperalgesia conditions, without noticeable behavioral side effects. Gait, spontaneous cortical activity at rest, and cortical tactile responses were minimally affected, indicating a highly selective action. In conclusion, our developed biocompatible microelectrode cluster and stimulation paradigm reliably enabled powerful, fine-tuned, and selective analgesia without noticeable side effects.},

High Tox2 expression was almost exclusive to GC T FH cells among human tonsillar and blood CD4 + T cell subsets. Tox2 overexpression maintained the expression of T FH -associated genes in T cell receptor–stimulated human GC T FH cells and inhibited their spontaneous conversion into T H 1-like cells. Tox2-deficient mice displayed impaired secondary T FH cell expansion upon reimmunization with an antigen and upon secondary infection with a heterologous influenza virus.

We recently found that full-thickness micro skin tissue columns (MSTCs) can be harvested with minimal donor site morbidity, and that MSTCs applied to wounds “randomly” (without maintaining their natural epidermal-dermal orientation) can accelerate re-epithelialization. However, despite MSTCs containing all the cellular and extracellular contents of full-thickness skin, normal dermal architecture was not restored by random MSTCs. In this study, we developed a magnetically induced assembly method to produce constructs of densely packed, oriented MSTCs that closely resemble the overall architecture of full-thickness skin to test the hypothesis that maintaining MSTCs’ orientation could further hasten healing and restore a normal dermis. Our method led to faster and more orderly re-epithelialization but unexpectedly did not improve the retention of dermal architecture, which reveals a hitherto unappreciated role for tissue morphology in determining dermal remodeling outcomes.},

We find that carbon is rapidly devolatilized, while hydrogen mostly remains dissolved in the magma during the existence of a thick silicate-bearing atmosphere. In the early stages of the magma ocean, the atmosphere would have contained significantly more carbon than hydrogen, and the high concentrations of carbon dioxide would have prolonged the cooling time of early Earth.},

The underlying process that leads to varying molar emergence schedules, however, remains elusive. Using three-dimensional data to quantify masticatory form in ontogenetic samples representing 21 primate species, we test the hypothesis that the location and timing of molar emergence are constrained to avoid potentially dangerous distractive forces at the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) throughout growth. We show that (i) molars emerge in a predictable position to safeguard the TMJ, (ii) the rate and duration of jaw growth determine the timing of molar emergence, and (iii) the rate and cessation age of jaw growth is related to life history. Thus, orofacial development is constrained by biomechanics throughout ontogeny. This integrative perspective on primate skull growth is consistent with a long sought-after causal explanation underlying the correlation between molar emergence and life history.},

Here, we demonstrate focusing of in-plane hyperbolic PhPs propagating along thin slabs of α-MoO 3 . To that end, we developed metallic nanoantennas of convex geometries for both efficient launching and focusing of the polaritons. The foci obtained exhibit enhanced near-field confinement and absorption compared to foci produced by in-plane isotropic PhPs. Foci sizes as small as λ p /4.5 = λ 0 /50 were achieved (λ p is the polariton wavelength and λ 0 is the photon wavelength).

The blue cone identity is ensured by selective expression of blue ( sws2 ) opsin, and the mechanism is poorly understood because sws2 gene has been lost in mammalian species such as mouse, whose visual system has been extensively studied. Here, we pursued loss-of-function studies on transcription factors expressed predominantly in zebrafish cone photoreceptors and identified Foxq2 as a blue cone–specific factor driving sws2 gene expression. Foxq2 has dual functions acting as an activator of sws2 transcription and as a suppressor of UV ( sws1 ) opsin transcription in blue cones. A wide range of vertebrate species retain both foxq2 and sws2 genes. We propose that Foxq2-dependent sws2 expression is a prevalent regulatory mechanism that was acquired at the early stage of vertebrate evolution.},

Antitumor efficacy correlated with tumoral expression of creatine kinase B. Combining RGX-202 with 5-fluorouracil or the DHODH inhibitor leflunomide caused regressions of multiple colorectal xenograft and PDX tumors of distinct mutational backgrounds. RGX-202 also perturbed creatine metabolism in patients with metastatic CRC in a phase 1 trial, mirroring pharmacodynamic effects on creatine metabolism observed in mice.

Mutations in genes known to affect social behavior in humans perturb these simple reflexes in individual larval zebrafish and change their emergent collective behaviors in the predicted fashion. Model simulations show that changes in these two responses in individual mutant animals predict well the distinctive collective patterns that emerge in a group.

Impaired intestinal regeneration and survival in STING- deficient mice are fully rescued by a single IFN-β treatment given 48 hours after irradiation but not by wild-type (WT) bone marrow. IFN-β treatment remarkably improves the survival of WT mice and Lgr5 + stem cell regeneration through elevated compensatory proliferation and more rapid DNA damage removal.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) confers cancer stem cell-like properties, enhanced tumorigenicity and drug resistance to tumor cells, while mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) reverses these phenotypes. Using high-throughput chemical library screens, retinoids are found to be potent promoters of MET that inhibit tumorigenicity in basal-like breast cancer. Cell state transitions are defined by reprogramming of lipid metabolism. Retinoids bind cognate nuclear receptors, which target lipid metabolism genes, thereby redirecting fatty acids for β-oxidation in the mesenchymal cell state towards lipid storage in the epithelial cell state. Disruptions of key metabolic enzymes mediating this flux inhibit MET. Conversely, perturbations to fatty acid oxidation (FAO) rechannel fatty acid flux and promote a more epithelial cell phenotype, blocking EMT-driven breast cancer metastasis in animal models.

  abstract     = {Nanograined metal oxides are requisite for diverse applications that use large surface area, such as gas sensors and catalysts. However, nanoscale grains are thermodynamically unstable and tend to coarsen at elevated temperatures. Here, we report effective grain growth suppression in metal oxide nanoribbons annealed at high temperature (900°C) by tuning the metal-to-oxygen ratio and confining the nanoribbons. Despite the high annealing temperatures, the average grain size was maintained at ~6 nm, which also retained their structural integrity. We observe that excess oxygen in amorphous tin oxide nanoribbons prevents merging of small grains during crystallization, leading to suppressed grain growth. As an exemplary application, we demonstrate a gas sensor using grain growth–suppressed tin oxide nanoribbons, which exhibited both high sensitivity and unusual long-term operation stability. Our findings provide a previously unknown pathway to simultaneously achieve high performance and excellent thermal stability in nanograined metal oxide nanostructures.},

Because the default response of most cells to TNFα is NF-κB–mediated inflammation and survival, a specific mechanism must exist to control the divergence of signaling outcome. Here, we identify HSPA13 as a transcription-independent checkpoint to modulate the role of RIP1 in TNFα signaling. Through specific binding to TNFR1 and RIP1, HSPA13 enhances TNFα-induced recruitment of RIP1 to TNFR1, and consequently promotes downstream NF-κB transcriptional responses. Meanwhile, HSPA13 attenuates the participation of RIP1 in cytosolic complex II and prevents cells from programmed death. Loss of HSPA13 shifts the transition of RIP1 from complex I to complex II and promotes both apoptosis and necroptosis. Thus, our study provides compelling evidence for the cellular protective function of HSPA13 in fine-tuning TNFα responses.},

Recent field campaigns, reinforced by new remote-sensing and aerosol climatology datasets, have highlighted the absorbing nature of the elevated BBA layers over the South-East Atlantic (SEA), indicating that the absorption could be stronger than previously thought. We show that most of the latest generation of general circulation models (GCMs) from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) underestimates the absorption of BBA over the SEA. This underlines why many (~75\%) CMIP6 models do not fully capture the intense positive (warming) direct radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere observed over this region. In addition, underestimating the magnitude of the BBA-induced solar heating could lead to misrepresentations of the low-level cloud responses and fast precipitation feedbacks that are induced by BBA in tropical regions.},

However, the neural mechanisms underlying these transformations and their role in memory formation and retrieval have only started to be elucidated. Combining intracranial EEG recordings with deep neural network models, we provide a detailed picture of the representational transformations from encoding to short-term memory maintenance and long-term memory retrieval that underlie successful episodic memory. We observed substantial representational transformations during encoding. Critically, more pronounced semantic representational formats predicted better subsequent long-term memory, and this effect was mediated by more consistent item-specific representations across encoding events. The representations were further transformed right after stimulus offset, and the representations during long-term memory retrieval were more similar to those during short-term maintenance than during encoding. Our results suggest that memory representations pass through multiple stages of transformations to achieve successful long-term memory formation and recall.},

BC- Cosmc KO mice display multiple phenotypic abnormalities, including severe weight loss, ocular manifestations, lymphadenopathy, and increased female-associated mortality. Disruption of B cell tolerance in BC- Cosmc KO mice is manifested as elevated self-reactive IgM and IgG autoantibodies. Cosmc -deficient B cells exhibit enhanced basal activation and responsiveness to stimuli. There is also an elevated frequency of spontaneous germinal center B cells in BC- Cosmc KO mice. Mechanistically, loss of Cosmc confers enhanced B cell receptor (BCR) signaling through diminished BCR internalization.

However, LEDs based on anisotropic perovskite nanoemitters remain to be inefficient (external quantum efficiency, EQE &lt;5\%) due to the difficulties of simultaneously controlling the orientations of TDMs, achieving high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and realizing charge balance in the films of assembled nanostructures.

The ratio of horizontal TDMs of the perovskite nanoplatelet film is ~84\%, which leads to a light-outcoupling efficiency of ~31\%, substantially higher than that of isotropic emitters (~23\%).

A cytoplasmic membrane-localized β-catenin excluded from the nucleus promoted Akt activation, suggesting a new function of β-catenin independent of its role as a transcriptional activator. Furthermore, genetic ablation of β-catenin, retroviral expression of a dominant negative Akt mutant, and transgenic expression of a constitutively active Foxo1 restored emigration of GSK3-deficient thymocytes. Our findings establish an essential role for GSK3 in thymocyte egress and reveal a previously unidentified signaling function of β-catenin in the cytoplasm.},

To this end, we present the first high-quality chromosome-level genome assemblies for the bdelloid Adineta vaga , composed of six pairs of homologous (diploid) chromosomes with a footprint of paleotetraploidy. The observed large-scale losses of heterozygosity are signatures of recombination between homologous chromosomes, either during mitotic DNA double-strand break repair or when resolving programmed DNA breaks during a modified meiosis. Dynamic subtelomeric regions harbor more structural diversity (e.g., chromosome rearrangements, transposable elements, and haplotypic divergence).

Here, we show that abnormal IL-36 production activated by NF-κB is an essential feature of mouse and human leukemic progenitor cells (LPs). Mechanistically, IL-36 directly activates inflammatory monocytes (IMs) in bone marrow, which then precludes clearance of leukemia mediated by CD8 + T cells and facilitates LP growth. While sparing IMs, common chemotherapeutic agents stimulate IL-36 production from residual LPs via caspase-1 activation, thereby enabling the persistence of this immunosuppressive IL-36–IM axis after chemotherapy. Furthermore, IM depletion by trabectedin, with chemotherapy and PD-1 blockade, can synergistically restrict AML progression and relapse. Collectively, these results suggest inhibition of the IL-36–IM axis as a potential strategy for improving AML treatment.},

In this equilibrium, daily cases stabilize around ten or fewer new infections per million people. However, stability is endangered if restrictions are relaxed or case numbers grow too high. The latter destabilization marks a tipping point beyond which the spread self-accelerates. We show that a lockdown can reestablish control and that recurring lockdowns are not necessary given sustained, moderate contact reduction. We illustrate how this strategy profits from vaccination and helps mitigate variants of concern. This strategy reduces cumulative cases (and fatalities) four times more than strategies that only avoid hospital collapse.

Here, we found that the ZBP1-MLKL necroptotic cascade in irradiated tumor cells was essential for antitumor immunity. ZBP1-dependent activation of MLKL potentiated type I interferon responses following tumor cell irradiation. Mechanistically, the ZBP1-MLKL necroptotic cascade induced cytoplasmic DNA accumulation in irradiated tumor cells and, in turn, autonomously activated cGAS-STING signaling, thus creating a positive feedback loop between those two pathways to drive persistent inflammation. Accordingly, ablation of caspase-8 enhanced STING pathway activation and the antitumor effects of radiation by activating MLKL. These findings reveal that ZBP1-MLKL necroptosis signaling maximized radiation-induced antitumor immunity through mutual interaction with the tumor cell–intrinsic STING pathway.

  abstract     = {Here, we develop digital biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), computed from patterns of past medical encounters, identifying children at high risk with an area under the receiver operating characteristic exceeding 80\% from shortly after 2 years of age for either sex, and across two independent patient databases. We leverage uncharted ASD comorbidities, with no requirement of additional blood work, or procedures, to estimate the autism comorbid risk score (ACoR), during the earliest years when interventions are the most effective. ACoR has superior predictive performance to common questionnaire-based screenings and can reduce their current socioeconomic, ethnic, and demographic biases. In addition, we can condition on current screening scores to either halve the state-of-the-art false-positive rate or boost sensitivity to over 60\%, while maintaining specificity above 95\%. Thus, ACoR can significantly reduce the median diagnostic age, reducing diagnostic delays and accelerating access to evidence-based interventions.},

Here, we use a data-constrained marine ecosystem model to provide a first-order estimate of the historical reduction of fish biomass due to fishing and the associated change in biogeochemical cycling rates. The pre-exploitation global biomass of exploited fish (10 g to 100 kg) was 3.3 ± 0.5 Gt, cycling roughly 2\% of global primary production (9.4 ± 1.6 Gt year −1 ) and producing 10\% of surface biological export. Particulate organic matter produced by exploited fish drove roughly 10\% of the oxygen consumption and biological carbon storage at depth. By the 1990s, biomass and cycling rates had been reduced by nearly half, suggesting that the biogeochemical impact of fisheries has been comparable to that of anthropogenic climate change. Our results highlight the importance of developing a better mechanistic understanding of how fish alter ocean biogeochemistry.},

The application of a bilayer electrolyte comprising wide electrolytic oxide and highly conductive oxide is essential to lower the operating temperatures while maintaining high performance. However, a structurally and chemically ideal bilayer has been unattainable through cost-effective conventional ceramic processes. Here, we describe a strategy of naturally diffused sintering aid allowing the fabrication of defect-free doped-zirconia/doped-ceria bilayer electrolyte with full density and reduced interdiffusion layer at lower sintering temperature owing to the supply of small but appropriate amount of sintering aid from doped zirconia to doped ceria that makes the thermal shrinkages of both layers perfectly congruent. The resulting SOCs exhibit a minimal ohmic loss of 0.09 ohm cm 2 and remarkable performances in both fuel cell (power density exceeding 1.3 W cm −2 ) and electrolysis (current density of −1.27 A cm −2 at 1.3 V) operations at 700°C.},

The highest catalytic activity was found at vacancy in a four-layer InSe, up to ~30× higher than that on the basal plane. Moreover, lower adsorption strength of reactant and slower dissociation/diffusion rates of product were found at more photocatalytic active defects. These distinct dynamic properties are determined by lattice structures/electronic energy levels of defects and layer thickness of supported InSe.

Here we report that Alu cDNA is highly enriched in the RPE of human eyes with geographic atrophy, an untreatable form of age-related macular degeneration. We demonstrate that the DNA sensor cGAS engages Alu cDNA to induce cytosolic mitochondrial DNA escape, which amplifies cGAS activation, triggering RPE degeneration via the inflammasome. The L1-extinct rice rat was resistant to Alu RNA–induced Alu cDNA synthesis and RPE degeneration, which were enabled upon L1-RT overexpression. Nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), which inhibit both L1-RT and inflammasome activity, and NRTI derivatives (Kamuvudines) that inhibit inflammasome, but not RT, both block Alu cDNA toxicity, identifying inflammasome activation as the terminal effector of RPE degeneration.},

To inductively identify heterogeneity in postdisaster cognitive disability by predisaster characteristics, we applied a machine learning–based causal inference approach—generalized random forest. We identified strong evidence for heterogeneity in the association between home loss and cognitive disability objectively assessed 2.5 and 5.5 years after the 2011 earthquake. The subgroups with the strongest disaster-dementia associations tended to be from low socioeconomic backgrounds and have predisaster health problems. The study demonstrated that some subpopulations are particularly prone to experience cognitive disability after disasters, which could be overlooked in studies assessing population average associations only.},

LC3 and GABARAP members of the ATG8 protein family are required for selective autophagy and sensing perturbation within the endolysosomal system. Here, we show that during the conjugation of ATG8 to single membranes (CASM), Parkin-dependent mitophagy, and Salmonella -induced xenophagy, the membrane conjugation of GABARAP, but not LC3, is required for activation of TFEB/TFE3 to control lysosomal capacity. GABARAP directly binds to a previously unidentified LC3-interacting motif (LIR) in the FLCN/FNIP tumor suppressor complex and mediates sequestration to GABARAP-conjugated membrane compartments. This disrupts FLCN/FNIP GAP function toward RagC/D, resulting in impaired substrate-specific mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of TFEB. Thus, the GABARAP-FLCN/FNIP-TFEB axis serves as a molecular sensor that coordinates lysosomal homeostasis with perturbations and cargo flux within the autophagy-lysosomal network.},

However, a lack of drug and nutrient diffusion, insufficient cell-matrix interactions, and tedious fabrication procedures have compromised their therapeutic effects in vivo. To address these issues, we developed a biodegradable nanomaterial-templated 3D cell assembly method that enables the formation of hybrid stem cell spheroids with deep drug delivery capabilities and homogeneous incorporation of 3D cell-matrix interactions. Hence, high survival rates, controlled differentiation, and functional recovery were demonstrated in a spinal cord injury animal model. Overall, our hybrid stem cell spheroids represent a substantial development of material-facilitated 3D cell culture systems and can pave the way for stem cell–based treatment of CNS injuries.},

High sensitivity of scotopic vision is underlain by the rod’s low background noise, which originated from a much lower spontaneous activation rate of rhodopsin than of cone pigments. Here, we revealed that nocturnal gecko cone pigments decreased their spontaneous activation rates to mimic rhodopsin, whereas diurnal gecko cone pigments recovered high rates similar to those of typical cone pigments. We also identified amino acid residues responsible for the alterations of the spontaneous activation rates. Therefore, we concluded that the switch between diurnality and nocturnality in geckos required not only morphological transmutation of photoreceptors but also adjustment of the spontaneous activation rates of visual pigments.},

In a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, the IONP-engineered hMSCs achieve a remarkable mitigation of fibrotic progression because of the promoted intercellular mitochondrial transfer, with no serious safety issues identified.

We consider two end-member scenarios. First, if O 2 was evenly distributed throughout the atmosphere, then P O 2 &gt; 10 –6.9 present atmospheric level was required for large periods of time during the Archean eon. Alternatively, if O 2 accumulation was instead spatially restricted (e.g., occurring only near the sites of O 2 production), then O 2 production fluxes &gt;0.01 Tmol O 2 /year were required.

In applications requiring complex molecular differentiation, such as in natural gas processing, cascaded pore size distributions in membranes allow different permeate molecules to be separated without a reduction in throughput. Here, we report the decoration of microporous polymer membrane surfaces with molecular fluorine. Molecular fluorine penetrates through the microporous interface and reacts with rigid polymeric backbones, resulting in membrane micropores with multimodal pore size distributions. The fluorine acts as angstrom-scale apertures that can be controlled for molecular transport. We achieved a highly effective gas separation performance in several industrially relevant hollow-fibrous modular platform with stable responses over 1 year.},

Their solution often requires laborious analytical or computational tools, associated with a cost that is markedly amplified when different scenarios need to be investigated, for example, corresponding to different initial or boundary conditions, different inputs, etc. In this work, we introduce physics-informed DeepONets, a deep learning framework for learning the solution operator of arbitrary PDEs, even in the absence of any paired input-output training data. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in rapidly predicting the solution of various types of parametric PDEs up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to conventional PDE solvers, setting a previously unexplored paradigm for modeling and simulation of nonlinear and nonequilibrium processes in science and engineering.},

Independently manipulating the chemical compositions of aqueous droplets without altering their mobility, however, remains challenging. In this work, we address this challenge by designing a class of open surface microfluidic platforms based on thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs). We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that the unique positional and orientational order of LC molecules intrinsically decouple cargo release functionality from droplet mobility via selective phase transitions. Furthermore, we build sodium sulfide–loaded LC surfaces that can efficiently precipitate heavy metal ions in sliding water droplets to final concentration less than 1 part per million for more than 500 cycles without causing droplets to become pinned. Overall, our results reveal that LC surfaces offer unique possibilities for the design of novel open surface fluidic systems with orthogonal functionalities.},

Here, we describe how solution gel-shearing–strained polyethylene yields an electric insulating material with an outstanding in-plane thermal conductivity of 10.74 W m −1 K −1 and an average dielectric constant of 4.1. The dielectric constant and loss of such sheared polymer electric insulators are nearly independent of the frequency and a wide temperature range. The gel-shearing aligns ultrahigh–molecular weight polymer crystalline chains for the formation of separated and aligned nanoscale fibrous arrays. Together with lattice strains and the presence of boron nitride nanosheets, the dielectric polymer shows high current density carrying and high operating temperature, which is attributed to greatly enhanced heat conduction.},

Here, we explore the role of histone H3 methylated at lysine-36 (H3K36) and the associated methyltransferases—Set2, NSD, and Ash1—in these two chromosome-specific systems. We show that the loss of Set2 impairs the MSL complex–mediated dosage compensation; however, the effect is not recapitulated by H3K36 replacement and indicates an alternative target of Set2. Unexpectedly, balanced transcriptional output from the fourth chromosome requires intact H3K36 and depends on the additive functions of NSD and Ash1. We conclude that H3K36 methylation and the associated methyltransferases are important factors to balance transcriptional output of the male X chromosome and the fourth chromosome.

Myeloid cell reprogramming was triggered by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) secreted by mIDH1 glioma stem/progenitor-like cells. Blocking G-CSF in mIDH1 glioma–bearing mice restores the inhibitory potential of the tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, accelerating tumor progression.

Current models cannot reconcile an inferred gradual decrease in the rate of radial contraction beginning at ~3.9 billion years (Ga) with crustal magnetization indicating a dynamo at ~4 to 3.5 Ga and the production of extensive volcanism. Incorporating the strong cooling effects of mantle melting and effusive volcanism into an exhaustive thermal modeling study, here, we show that early, voluminous crustal production can drive a period of strong mantle cooling that both favors an ancient dynamo and explains the contractional history of the planet. We develop the first self-consistent model for Mercury’s early history and, more generally, propose an approach to assess the volcanic control over the evolution of any terrestrial planet or moon.},

Soft robots often harness volumetric expansion directed by strain limiters to deform in complex ways. Traditionally, strain limiters have been inert materials embedded within a system to prescribe a single deformation. Under changing task demands, a fixed deformation mode limits adaptability. Recent technologies for on-demand reprogrammable deformation of soft bodies, including thermally activated variable stiffness materials and jamming systems, presently suffer from long actuation times or introduce unwanted bending stiffness. We present fibers that switch tensile stiffness via jamming of segmented elastic fibrils. When jammed, tensile stiffness increases more than 20× in less than 0.1 s, but bending stiffness increases only 2×. When adhered to an inflating body, jamming fibers locally limit surface tensile strains, unlocking myriad programmable deformations. The proposed jamming technology is scalable, enabling adaptive behaviors in emerging robotic materials that interact with unstructured environments.},

  abstract     = {The way molecules break after ion bombardment is intimately related to the early electron dynamics generated in the system, in particular, charge (or electron) migration. We exploit the natural positive-negative charge splitting in the zwitterionic molecule betaine to selectively induce double electron removal from its negatively charged side by impact of fast O 6+ ions. The loss of two electrons in this localized region of the molecular skeleton triggers a competition between direct Coulomb explosion and charge migration that is examined to obtain temporal information from ion-ion coincident measurements and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations. We find a charge migration time, from one end of the molecule to the other, of approximately 20 to 40 femtoseconds. This migration time is longer than that observed in molecules irradiated by ultrashort light pulses and is the consequence of charge migration being driven by adiabatic nuclear dynamics in the ground state of the molecular dication.},

  abstract     = {Our understanding of the dynamics of charge transfer between solid surfaces and liquid electrolytes has been hampered by the difficulties in obtaining interface, charge, and solvent-specific information at both high spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we measure at the single charge scale the dynamics of protons at the interface between an hBN crystal and binary mixtures of water and organic amphiphilic solvents (alcohols and acetone), evidencing a marked influence of solvation on interfacial dynamics. Applying single-molecule localization microscopy to emissive crystal defects, we observe correlated activation between adjacent ionizable surface defects, mediated by the transport of single excess protons along the solid/liquid interface. Solvent content has a nontrivial effect on interfacial dynamics, leading at intermediate water fraction to an increased surface diffusivity, as well as an increased affinity of the proton charges to the solid surface. Our measurements evidence the notable role of solvation on interfacial proton charge transport.},

Based on models of 50 V– 10 Be co-production by in-situ irradiation, CAIs are considered to have formed within ~0.1 AU from the proto-Sun. Here, we present vanadium (V) and strontium (Sr) isotopic co-variations in fine- and coarse-grained CAIs and demonstrate that kinetic isotope effects during partial condensation and evaporation best explain V isotope anomalies previously attributed to solar particle irradiation. We also report initial excesses of 10 Be and argue that CV CAIs possess essentially a homogeneous level of 10 Be, inherited during their formation. Based on numerical modeling of 50 V– 10 Be co-production by irradiation, we show that CAI formation during protoplanetary disk build-up likely occurred at greater heliocentric distances than previously considered, up to planet-forming regions (~1AU), where solar particle fluxes were sufficiently low to avoid substantial in-situ irradiation of CAIs.},

We show that differentiated RAS KO ESC remain trapped in an intermediate state of pluripotency with naïve-associated features. Elimination of the transcription factor ERF overcomes the developmental blockage of RAS-deficient cells by naïve enhancer decommissioning. Mechanistically, ERF regulates NANOG expression and ensures naïve pluripotency by strengthening naïve transcription factor binding at ESC enhancers. Moreover, ERF negatively regulates the expression of the methyltransferase DNMT3B, which participates in the extinction of the naïve transcriptional program. Collectively, we demonstrated an essential role for ERF controlling the exit from naïve pluripotency in a MAPK-dependent manner during the progression to primed pluripotency.},

The high expression of DSC2 and PKP1 facilitated cancer cells to form clusters in circulation, and also activated PI3K/AKT/Bcl-2–mediated pathway to increase cell survival.

We report on the methodology that successfully unraveled this historical mystery. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy was used in macroscanning mode on the redacted sections. Specific data processing was applied to improve the legibility of the hidden writings (elemental ratios, statistical data reduction, multimodal images fusion, unmixing procedure, and image treatments). This methodology successfully revealed the redacted contents of eight letters, shedding new light not only on Marie-Antoinette and Fersen relationship but also on the author of the redactions.

Furthermore, current devices are large and rigid, potentially causing patient discomfort after implantation. To address this problem, we developed a thin, battery-free, flexible, implantable system based on flexible electronic technology that can not only achieve wireless recharging and communication simultaneously via ultrasound but also perform many current device functions, including in vivo physiological monitoring and cardiac pacing. To prove this, an animal experiment was conducted involving creating a cardiac arrest model and powering the system by ultrasound.

YAP/TAZ and Notch are required for the generation of non-neuroendocrine (Non-NE) SCLC tumor cells, but not for the initiation of SCLC. YAP signals through Notch-dependent and Notch-independent pathways to promote the fate conversion of SCLC from NE to Non-NE tumor cells by inducing Rest expression. In addition, YAP activation enhances the chemoresistance in NE SCLC tumor cells, while the inactivation of YAP in Non-NE SCLC tumor cells switches cell death induced by chemotherapy drugs from apoptosis to pyroptosis. Our study demonstrates that YAP plays critical roles in the establishment of intratumoral heterogeneity and highlights the potential of targeting YAP for chemoresistant SCLC.},

Here, we describe a previously unrecognized role for pseudogenes as potent epigenetic regulators that can demethylate and activate oncogenes. We focused on SALL4 , a known oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with eight pseudogenes. Using a locus-specific demethylating technology, we identified the critical CpG region for SALL4 expression. We demonstrated that SALL4 pseudogene 5 hypomethylates this region through interaction with DNMT1, resulting in SALL4 up-regulation. Intriguingly, pseudogene 5 is significantly up-regulated in a hepatitis B virus model before SALL4 induction, and both are increased in patients with HBV-HCC. Our results suggest that pseudogene-mediated demethylation represents a novel mechanism of oncogene activation in cancer.},

We show that the thermally driven magnon spin currents reveal a spin-flop transition in thin-film Cr 2 O 3 . Crucially, this spin-flop can be turned on or off by applying an electric field across the thickness of the film. Using this tunability, we demonstrate electric field–induced switching of the polarization of magnon spin currents by varying only a gate voltage while at a fixed magnetic field. We propose a model considering an electric field–dependent spin-flop transition, arising from a change in sublattice magnetizations via a magnetoelectric coupling.

In this work, we propose a nonferrous ferroptosis-like strategy based on hybrid CoMoO 4 -phosphomolybdic acid nanosheet (CPMNS)–enabled lipid peroxide (LOOH) accumulation via accelerated Mo(V)-Mo(VI) transition, elevated GSH depletion for GPX4 enzyme deactivation, and ROS burst, for efficient ferroptosis and chemotherapy. Both in vitro and in vivo outcomes demonstrate the notable anticancer ferroptosis efficacy, suggesting the high feasibility of this CPMNS-enabled ferroptosis-like therapeutic concept.

We have used computational and supporting biochemical approaches using the catalytic domain of the Escherichia coli BY-kinase, Wzc, to illustrate mechanistic divergences between BY-kinases and NTPases despite their deployment of similar catalytic motifs. In NTPases, the “arginine finger” drives the reactive conformation of ATP while also displacing its solvation shell, thereby making favorable enthalpic and entropic contributions toward βγ-bond cleavage. In BY-kinases, the reactive state of ATP is enabled by ATP·Mg 2+ -induced global conformational transitions coupled to the conformation of the Walker-A lysine. While the BY-kinase arginine finger does promote the desolvation of ATP, it does so indirectly by generating an ordered active site in combination with other structural elements. Bacteria, using these mechanistic variations, have thus repurposed an ancient fold to phosphorylate on tyrosine.},

Using an interferometric setup, we theoretically show that, when a two-photon wave function is coupled to matter, it is encoded with “which pathway?” information even at low-degree of entanglement. An interferometric protocol, which enables phase-sensitive discrimination between microscopic interaction histories (pathways), is developed. We find that quantum light interferometry facilitates utterly different set of time delay variables, which are unbound by uncertainty to the inverse bandwidth of the wave packet. We illustrate our findings on an exciton model system and demonstrate how to probe intraband dephasing in the time domain without temporally resolved detection.

  abstract     = {The nuclear architecture of rod photoreceptor cells in nocturnal mammals is unlike that of other animal cells. Murine rod cells have an “inverted” chromatin organization with euchromatin at the nuclear periphery and heterochromatin packed in the center of the nucleus. In conventional nuclear architecture, euchromatin is mostly in the interior, and heterochromatin is largely at the nuclear periphery. We demonstrate that inverted nuclear architecture is achieved through global relabeling of the rod cell epigenome. During rod cell maturation, H3K9me2-labeled nuclear peripheral heterochromatin is relabeled with H3K9me3 and repositioned to the nuclear center, while transcriptionally active euchromatin is labeled with H3K9me2 and positioned at the nuclear periphery. Global chromatin relabeling is correlated with spatial rearrangement, suggesting a critical role for histone modifications, specifically H3K9 methylation, in nuclear architecture. These results reveal a dramatic example of genome-wide epigenetic relabeling of chromatin that accompanies altered nuclear architecture in a postnatal, postmitotic cell.},

  abstract     = {The rule-based search of chemical space can generate an almost infinite number of molecules, but exploration of known molecules as a function of the minimum number of steps needed to build up the target graphs promises to uncover new motifs and transformations. Assembly theory is an approach to compare the intrinsic complexity and properties of molecules by the minimum number of steps needed to build up the target graphs. Here, we apply this approach to prebiotic chemistry, gene sequences, plasticizers, and opiates. This allows us to explore molecules connected to the assembly tree, rather than the entire space of molecules possible. Last, by developing a reassembly method, based on assembly trees, we found that in the case of the opiates, a new set of drug candidates could be generated that would not be accessible via conventional fragment-based drug design, thereby demonstrating how this approach might find application in drug discovery.},

AFM measurements revealed patient age– and stage of neurocognitive disorder–dependent differences in size, shape, morphology, assembly, and prevalence of protein aggregates on RBCs, referred to as physical biomarkers. Crystals composed of fibrils were exclusively detected on RBCs for AD patients aged above 80 years. Fibril prevalence was negatively correlated with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-amyloid (Aβ) 42/40 ratio and was observed to be higher in the Aβ-positive patient category. Using a cutoff of ≥40\% fibril prevalence, the CSF Aβ status was classified with 88\% accuracy (sensitivity 100\%, specificity 73\%).

A novel approach based on a comprehensive compilation of samarium-neodymium isotopic compositions of detrital sedimentary rocks is here used to unravel continental growth through time. This record reveals that continents were as felsic as today in the past 3.7 Ga (billion years) and that their growth was not continuous but episodic. Reworking of preexisting crust was a ubiquitous process during most of Earth history, but at least six periods of continental growth can be identified every 500 to 700 Ma (million years) in the past 3.7 Ga. This recurrence could be accounted for by changes in tectonic plate velocities favoring periods of rapid subduction and enhanced production of juvenile felsic crust.},

Here, hierarchically porous polyimide (PI)/Ti 3 C 2 T x films with consecutively conductive pathways have been constructed via a unidirectional PI aerogel–assisted immersion and hot-pressing strategy. Contributed by special architectures and high conductivities, PI/Ti 3 C 2 T x films with 2.0 volume\% Ti 3 C 2 T x have high absolute EMI shielding effectiveness up to 15, 527 dB cm 2 g −1 at the thickness of 90 μm. Superior EMI shielding performance can be retained even after being subjected to hygrothermal or combustion environments, cryogenic (−196°C) or high (250°C) temperatures, and rapid thermal shock (∆ T = 446°C), demonstrating high potential as high-performance EMI shielding materials resisting harsh conditions.},

This process is the contact electrification induced interface photon emission spectroscopy (CEIIPES). It naturally paves a way to a spectroscopy corresponding to the CE at an interface, which might impact our understanding of the interaction between solids, liquids, and gases. The physics presented here could be expanded to Auger electron excitation, x-ray emission, and electron emission in CE for general cases, which remain to be explored.

Many of the beads come as deposits dating to ≥142 thousand years, making them the oldest shell beads yet recovered. They extend the dates for the first appearance of this behavior into the late Middle Pleistocene. The ages and ubiquity of beads in Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites in North Africa provide further evidence of the potential importance of these artifacts as signals of identity.

Clock function in peripheral tissues is required, but not sufficient, for this task. Because of the lack of specialized animal models, it is unclear how tissue clocks interact with extrinsic signals to drive molecular oscillations. Here, we isolated the interaction between feeding and the liver clock by reconstituting Bmal1 exclusively in hepatocytes (Liver-RE), in otherwise clock-less mice, and controlling timing of food intake. We found that the cooperative action of BMAL1 and the transcription factor CEBPB regulates daily liver metabolic transcriptional programs. Functionally, the liver clock and feeding rhythm are sufficient to drive temporal carbohydrate homeostasis. By contrast, liver rhythms tied to redox and lipid metabolism required communication with the skeletal muscle clock, demonstrating peripheral clock cross-talk. Our results highlight how the inner workings of the clock system rely on communicating signals to maintain daily metabolism.},

In contrast, most artificial methods of externally directed assembly rely on field- or template-based energy minimization. However, methods directing the assembly process by controlling time-varying external stimuli instead of attaining the lowest-energy state remain largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce a method that applies time-varying and spatially nonlinear vibration fields to assemble particles into a desired two-dimensional shape. Our assembly method predicts, controls, and monitors the vibration-induced particle motion to iteratively minimize the difference between the desired shape and the actual particle distribution. We applied our method to a centrally actuated vibrating plate, also known as a Chladni plate, and assembled up to a hundred submillimeter particles into complex recognizable shapes. The method allows programmable formation of shapes beyond the intrinsic limits of periodic patterning of the plate.},

We used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to introduce this variant into the mouse Mrpp3 gene and show that the variant causes insulin resistance on a high-fat diet. The variant did not influence mitochondrial gene expression markedly, but instead, it reduced mitochondrial calcium that lowered insulin release from the pancreatic islet β cells of the Mrpp3 variant mice. Reduced insulin secretion resulted in lower insulin levels that contributed to imbalanced metabolism and liver steatosis in the Mrpp3 variant mice on a high-fat diet. Our findings reveal that the MRPP3 variant may be a predisposing factor to insulin resistance and metabolic disease in the human population.},

Here, we leverage optimal control methods to generate the first fully predictive, three-dimensional, muscle-driven simulations of locomotion in an extinct terrestrial vertebrate, the bipedal non-avian theropod dinosaur Coelophysis . Unexpectedly, our simulations involved pronounced lateroflexion movements of the tail. Rather than just being a static counterbalance, simulations indicate that the tail played a crucial dynamic role, with lateroflexion acting as a passive, physics-based mechanism for regulating angular momentum and improving locomotor economy, analogous to the swinging arms of humans. We infer this mechanism to have existed in many other bipedal non-avian dinosaurs as well, and our methodology provides new avenues for exploring the functional diversity of dinosaur tails in the future.},

We demonstrate that biologically relevant p CO 2 levels reduce ubiquitin conjugation at lysine-48 and down-regulate ubiquitin-dependent NF-κB pathway activation. Our results show that ubiquitin is a CO 2 -binding protein and demonstrates carbamylation as a viable mechanism by which mammalian cells can respond to fluctuating p CO 2 .},

  abstract     = {The expansion of Homo sapiens across Eurasia marked a major milestone in human evolution that would eventually lead to our species being found across every continent. Current models propose that these expansions occurred only during episodes of warm climate, based on age correlations between archaeological and climatic records. Here, we obtain direct evidence for the temperatures faced by some of these humans through the oxygen isotope analysis of faunal remains from Bacho Kiro Cave, Bulgaria, the earliest clear record of H. sapiens in Europe. The results indicate that humans ∼45, 000 years ago experienced subarctic climates with far colder climatic conditions than previously suggested. This demonstrates that the early presence of H. sapiens in Europe was not contingent on warm climates. Our results necessitate the revision of key models of human expansion and highlight the need for a less deterministic role of climate in the study of our evolutionary history.},

However, its evolutionary history and the molecular mechanisms through which it affects phenotypes remain unresolved. We present evidence that this deletion was nearly fixed in the ancestral population of anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals but underwent a recent adaptive reduction in frequency in East Asia. We documented that GHRd3 is associated with protection from severe malnutrition. Using a novel mouse model, we found that, under calorie restriction, Ghrd3 leads to the female-like gene expression in male livers and the disappearance of sexual dimorphism in weight. The sex- and diet-dependent effects of GHRd3 in our mouse model are consistent with a model in which the allele frequency of GHRd3 varies throughout human evolution as a response to fluctuations in resource availability.},

We combined high-resolution satellite imagery from 2011, crowd-sourcing, and habitat modeling to report the first global population estimate for the species and environmental factors that influence its distribution. We estimated ~202, 000 (95\% confidence interval: 85, 345 to 523, 140) sub-adult and adult female seals, with proximate ocean depth and fast-ice variables as factors explaining spatial prevalence. Distances to penguin colonies were associated with seal presence, but only emperor penguin population size had a strong negative relationship.

DNA aptamers are selected from a DNA library to bind intact infectious, but not noninfectious, virus and then incorporated into a solid-state nanopore, which allows strong confinement of the virus to enhance sensitivity down to 1 pfu/ml for human adenovirus and 1 × 10 4 copies/ml for SARS-CoV-2.

We use an atmospheric inversion system to show that global fire emissions have been stable or slightly decreasing despite the substantial decline in global burned area over the past two decades caused by the carbon dioxide emission increase from forest fires offsetting the decreasing emissions from grass and shrubland fires. Forest fires are larger carbon dioxide sources per unit area burned than grassland fires, with a slow or incomplete follow-up recovery—sometimes no recovery due to degradation and deforestation. With fires expanding over forest areas, the slow recovery of carbon dioxide uptake over burned forest lands weakens land sink capacity, implying positive feedback on climate change.},

It can generate surface piezopotential up to millivolts by cell inherent force and thus provide in situ electrical stimulation for the living cells. Besides, the unique 3D space in the bio-NGs provides an ECM-like growth microenvironment for cells. As a result, our bio-NGs effectively promote cell viability and development and, more importantly, maintain its specific functional expression. These advanced in vitro bio-NGs are expected to fill the gap between the inaccurate 2D systems and the expensive and time-consuming animal models, mimicking the complexity of the ECM and the physiological relevance of an in vivo biological system.},

This structural color arisen from total internal reflections is prepared by digitally printing the dome-shaped microstructure (microdome) with well-controlled morphology. By controlling the ink volume and substrate wettability, the microdome color can be continuously regulated across whole visible regions. The gamut, saturation, and lightness of the printed structural-color image are precisely adjusted via the programmable arrangement of different microdomes. With the advantages of simple manufacturing and widely available inks, this color printing approach presents great potential in imaging, decoration, sensing, and biocompatible photonics.},

The perturbation of short-term seismicity within teleseismic surface waves also increased with peak dynamic strain. Following rapid coeruptive subsidence and reduction in stress and background seismicity rates, equivalent dynamic strains no longer triggered detectable seismicity. These findings offer direct constraints on the primary controls on dynamic triggering and suggest that the response to dynamic stresses may help constrain the evolution of volcanic unrest.},

We use a frequency-locked loop to track the resonant frequency jitter of three different resonator types—one niobium nitride superinductor, one aluminum coplanar waveguide, and one aluminum cavity—and we observe notably similar random telegraph signal fluctuations. At low microwave drive power, the resonators exhibit multiple, unstable frequency positions, which, for increasing power, coalesce into one frequency due to motional narrowing caused by sympathetic driving of two-level system defects by the resonator. In all three devices, we identify a dominant fluctuator whose switching amplitude (separation between states) saturates with increasing drive power, but whose characteristic switching rate follows the power law dependence of quasi-classical Landau-Zener transitions.},

Sororin is present in the nucleus of GV oocytes and becomes associated with the spindle apparatus during meiosis I in mice. Depletion of Sororin causes failure of GVBD due to inactivation of Cdk1 and defective spindle assembly because of reduced levels of Cyclin B2. We validate Sororin interactions with Cyclin B2 that protects it from destruction by APC Cdh1 , which drives M phase entry and bipolar spindle formation. Notably, the meiotic functions of Sororin are conserved among mammals.

Anxiety levels surged, and positive emotion and anger dropped. In parallel, people’s thinking became more intuitive rather than analytic. When lockdowns began (“isolation phase”), analytic thinking dropped further. People became sadder, and their thinking reflected attempts to process the uncertainty. Familial ties strengthened, but ties to broader social groups weakened. Six weeks after COVID-19’s onset (“normalization phase”), people’s psychological states stabilized but remained elevated.

To achieve this, we developed Infinity Flow combining hundreds of overlapping flow cytometry panels using machine learning to enable the simultaneous analysis of the coexpression patterns of hundreds of surface-expressed proteins across millions of individual cells. In this study, we demonstrate that this approach allows the comprehensive analysis of the cellular constituency of the steady-state murine lung and the identification of previously unknown cellular heterogeneity in the lungs of melanoma metastasis–bearing mice. We show that by using supervised machine learning, Infinity Flow enhances the accuracy and depth of clustering or dimensionality reduction algorithms. Infinity Flow is a highly scalable, low-cost, and accessible solution to single-cell proteomics in complex tissues.},

  abstract     = {G-quadruplex (or G4) structures form in guanine-rich DNA sequences and threaten genome stability when not properly resolved. G4 unwinding occurs during S phase via an unknown mechanism. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we define a three-step G4 unwinding mechanism that acts during DNA replication. First, the replicative helicase composed of Cdc45, MCM2-7 and GINS (CMG) stalls at a leading strand G4 structure. Second, the DEAH-box helicase 36 (DHX36) mediates bypass of the CMG past the intact G4 structure, allowing approach of the leading strand to the G4. Third, G4 structure unwinding by the Fanconi anemia complementation group J helicase (FANCJ) enables DNA polymerase to synthesize past the G4 motif. A G4 on the lagging strand template does not stall CMG but still requires DNA replication for unwinding. DHX36 and FANCJ have partially redundant roles, conferring pathway robustness. This previously unknown genome maintenance pathway promotes faithful G4 replication, thereby avoiding genome instability.},

We solved three structures to near-atomic resolution: a 2D parallelogram, a 3D nanobracelet unexpectedly formed from an RNA designed for a nanocage, and, eventually, a bona fide 3D nanocage designed with the guidance of the two previous structures. Structural details of their constituent motifs, such as kissing loops, branched kissing loops, and T-junctions, that resemble natural RNA motifs and resisted x-ray determination are revealed, providing insights into those natural motifs. This work unveils the largely unexplored potential of crystallography in gaining high-resolution feedback for nanoarchitectural design and suggests a route to investigate RNA motif structures by configuring them into nanoarchitectures.},

New theory has highlighted that unpredictable environments could favor the evolution of altruism if altruistic acts reduce environmentally induced variance in the reproductive success of relatives (“altruistic bet-hedging”). Here, we show that altruism does indeed reduce environmentally induced reproductive variance in a wild cooperative bird. Our decade-long field study reveals that altruistic helping actually has no overall effect on the mean reproductive success of relatives but instead reduces their reproductive variance. This remarkable pattern arises because helpers improve reproductive performance in dry conditions but reduce it in wet conditions. Helpers thereby specifically reduce rainfall-induced reproductive variance, the very mechanism required for altruistic bet-hedging to explain the enigmatic global association between avian altruism and unpredictable rainfall.},

Here, we generated zebrafish models deficient in Ufm1 and Ufl1 that exhibited telomere shortening associated with developmental delay, impaired hematopoiesis and premature aging. We further report that HeLa cells lacking UFL1 have instability of telomeres replicated by leading-strand synthesis. We uncover that MRE11 UFMylation is necessary for the recruitment of the phosphatase PP1-α leading to dephosphorylation of NBS1. In the absence of UFMylation, NBS1 remains phosphorylated, thereby reducing MRN recruitment to telomeres. The absence of MRN at telomeres favors the formation of the TRF2-Apollo/SNM1 complex consistent with the loss of leading telomeres. These results suggest that MRE11-UFMylation may serve as module to recruit PP1-α. Last, zebrafish expressing Mre11 that cannot be UFMylated phenocopy Ufm1 -deficient zebrafish, demonstrating that UFMylation of MRE11 is a previously undescribed evolutionarily conserved mechanisms regulating telomere length.},

We further investigated temporal associations among lipid clusters. We observed that measures of stunting, wasting, and underweight are dynamically associated with each other and that lipid groups containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and phosphatidylcholines consistently predict future growth outcomes. Linear growth was dynamically associated with the majority of lipids, indicating a higher nutritional demand to improve height compared to weight among growth-restricted children.

We detected dendritic ribosomes and nascent proteins at single-molecule resolution using DNA-PAINT and metabolic labeling. Both ribosomes and nascent proteins positively correlated with synapse density. Ribosomes were detected at ~85\% of synapses with ~2 translational sites per synapse; ~50\% of the nascent protein was detected near synapses. The amount of locally synthesized protein detected at a synapse correlated with its spontaneous Ca 2+ activity.

We demonstrate the ability of CRISPRpath for simultaneously identifying functional enhancers of six genes in the 6-thioguanine–induced DNA mismatch repair pathway using both CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR nuclease (CRISPRn) approaches. Sixty percent of the identified enhancers are known promoters with distinct epigenomic features compared to other active promoters, including increased chromatin accessibility and interactivity. Furthermore, by imposing different levels of selection pressure, CRISPRpath can distinguish enhancers exerting strong impact on gene expression from those exerting weak impact.

Here, we developed Escherichia coli – Saccharomyces cerevisiae consortia to establish a microbial biosynthetic platform for the synthesis of various SLs, including carlactone, carlactonoic acid, 5-deoxystrigol (5DS; 6.65 ± 1.71 μg/liter), 4-deoxyorobanchol (3.46 ± 0.28 μg/liter), and orobanchol (OB; 19.36 ± 5.20 μg/liter). The SL-producing platform enabled us to conduct functional identification of CYP722Cs from various plants as either OB or 5DS synthase. It also allowed us to quantitatively compare known variants of plant SL biosynthetic enzymes in the microbial system. The titer of 5DS was further enhanced through pathway engineering to 47.3 μg/liter. This work provides a unique platform for investigating SL biosynthesis and evolution and lays the foundation for developing SL microbial production process.},

Here, we provide insights into the biogeographical history of Antarctic freshwater diatoms, using lacustrine fossils from mid-Miocene and Quaternary Antarctica, and dovetail this dataset with a global inventory of modern freshwater diatom communities. We reveal the existence of a diverse mid-Miocene diatom flora bearing similarities with several former Gondwanan landmasses. Miocene cooling and Plio-Pleistocene glaciations triggered multiple extinction waves, resulting in the selective depauperation of this flora. Although extinction dominated, in situ speciation and new colonizations ultimately shaped the species-poor, yet highly adapted and largely endemic, modern Antarctic diatom flora. Our results provide a more holistic view on the scale of biodiversity turnover in Neogene and Pleistocene Antarctica than the fragmentary perspective offered by macrofossils and underscore the sensitivity of lacustrine microbiota to large-scale climate perturbations.},

Here, we quantified the impact of PAs and indigenous lands in avoiding 34 years of vegetation destruction in forested and nonforested biomes in Brazil. We showed that the odds of destruction in the PA network are four times lower than in unprotected areas, and generally, this positive effect extends to a buffer zone around PAs. Among the most effective groups of PAs are those that are older, larger, located in the Amazonian region, and indigenous lands. Despite recent setbacks for the Brazilian PA system, we highlight the benefits of PAs for biodiversity and climate if they were instead strengthened.},

A long-standing hypothesis posits that mainland Japanese populations derive dual ancestry from indigenous Jomon hunter-gatherer-fishers and succeeding Yayoi farmers. However, the genomic impact of agricultural migration and subsequent sociocultural changes remains unclear. We report 12 ancient Japanese genomes from pre- and postfarming periods. Our analysis finds that the Jomon maintained a small effective population size of ~1000 over several millennia, with a deep divergence from continental populations dated to 20, 000 to 15, 000 years ago, a period that saw the insularization of Japan through rising sea levels. Rice cultivation was introduced by people with Northeast Asian ancestry. Unexpectedly, we identify a later influx of East Asian ancestry during the imperial Kofun period. These three ancestral components continue to characterize present-day populations, supporting a tripartite model of Japanese genomic origins.},

Here, we revealed, using a nonlinguistic task and functional magnetic resonance imaging, that activity in a region of the macaque middle superior temporal cortex was specifically modulated by the predictability of social situations. As in human TPJ, this region could be distinguished from other temporal regions involved in face processing.

In many cases, the states are complex, and their emergence is challenging to predict. Here, we show that an unexpectedly diverse collection of dissipative organized states emerges in a simple system of two liquids under planar confinement when driven by electrohydrodynamic shearing. At low shearing, a symmetry breaking at the liquid-liquid interface leads to a one-dimensional corrugation pattern. At slightly stronger shearing, topological changes give raise to the emergence of Quincke rolling filaments, filament networks, and two-dimensional bicontinuous fluidic lattices. At strong shearing, the system transitions into dissipating polygonal, toroidal, and active droplets that form dilute gas-like states at low densities and complex active emulsions at higher densities. The diversity of the observed dissipative organized states is exceptional, pointing toward non-equilibrium optical devices and new avenues in several fields of research.},

  abstract     = {Dendritic spines are critical components of neuronal synapses as they receive and transform synaptic inputs into a succession of calcium-regulated biochemical events. The spine apparatus (SA), an extension of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, regulates slow and fast calcium dynamics in spines. Calcium release events deplete SA calcium ion reservoir rapidly, yet the next cycle of signaling requires its replenishment. How spines achieve this replenishment without triggering calcium release remains unclear. Using computational modeling, calcium and STED superresolution imaging, we show that the SA replenishment involves the store-operated calcium entry pathway during spontaneous calcium transients. We identified two main conditions for SA replenishment without depletion: a small amplitude and a slow timescale for calcium influx, and a close proximity between SA and plasma membranes. Thereby, spine’s nanoscale organization separates SA replenishment from depletion. We further conclude that spine’s receptor organization also determines the calcium dynamics during the induction of long-term synaptic changes.},

Here, we propose an integral lithography based on integral image reconstruction coupled with a planar lens array. The individual microlenses maintain a high numerical aperture and are used to create digital light patterns that can expand the printable area by the number of microlenses (10 3 to 10 4 ), thereby allowing for the scalable stereolithographic fabrication of 3D features that surpass the resolution-to-area scaling limit. We extend the capability of integral lithography for programmable printing of deterministic nonperiodic structures through the rotational overlapping or stacking of multiple exposures with controlled angular offsets. This printing platform provides new possibilities for producing periodic and aperiodic microarchitectures spanning four orders of magnitude from micrometers to centimeters.},

Two such events took place in summer 2019 at Stromboli, a volcano otherwise known for its persistent mild open-vent activity, resulting in one fatality and damage to infrastructure. Here, we use a post hoc analysis and reinterpretation of volcanic gas compositions and fluxes acquired at Stromboli to show that the two paroxysms were preceded by detectable escalations in volcanic plume CO 2 degassing weeks to months beforehand. Our results demonstrate that volcanic gas CO 2 is a key driver of explosions and that the preparatory periods ahead of explosions in basaltic systems can be captured by precursory CO 2 leakage from deeply stored mafic magma.},

In a baseline study, we assign an incentivized puzzle to participants and examine their willingness to follow the example of their White and Black peers. White participants presume that Black peers are less competent—and fail to learn from their choices. We then test two interventions: Providing information about past accomplishments reduces the disparity in evaluations of Black peers, but the racial attention deficit persists. When Whites can witness the accomplishments of Black peers, rather than being told about them, the racial attention deficit subsides.

Notably, the nondiffractive nature of Bessel beams enables greater tolerance for focal plane positioning during 3D printing. We also demonstrate that Bessel beams significantly reduce the propensity for keyhole formation across a broad scan parameter space. High-speed imaging of the melt pool evolution and solidification dynamics reveals a unique mechanism where Bessel beams stabilize the melt pool turbulence and increase the time for melt pool solidification, owing to reduced thermal gradients. Consequently, we observe a distinctively improved combination of high density, reduced surface roughness, and robust tensile properties in 3D-printed test structures.},

The light scattering–based sensing medium, which is designed to be composed of polymeric interphase voids and hollow nanoparticles, provides an extremely large transmittance window (&gt;95\%) with outstanding selectivity and versatility. This sensing medium features ternary transparency states (transparent, semitransparent, and opaque) when immersed in liquids depending on liquid-polymer interactions and diffusion kinetics. Several different types of these transparency-changing media can be configured into an arrayed platform to discriminate a wide variety of liquids and also quantify their mixing ratios. The outstanding versatility and user friendliness of the sensing platform allow the development of a practical tool for discrimination of diverse organic liquids.},

  abstract     = {Genomic instability is a hallmark of human cancer; yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the cytoplasmic unconventional Myosin X (MYO10) regulates genome stability, through which it mediates inflammation in cancer. MYO10 is an unstable protein that undergoes ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme H7 (UbcH7)/β-transducin repeat containing protein 1 (β-TrCP1)–dependent degradation. MYO10 is upregulated in both human and mouse tumors and its expression level predisposes tumor progression and response to immune therapy. Overexpressing MYO10 increased genomic instability, elevated the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING)–dependent inflammatory response, and accelerated tumor growth in mice. Conversely, depletion of MYO10 ameliorated genomic instability and reduced the inflammation signaling. Further, inhibiting inflammation or disrupting Myo10 significantly suppressed the growth of both human and mouse breast tumors in mice. Our data suggest that MYO10 promotes tumor progression through inducing genomic instability, which, in turn, creates an immunogenic environment for immune checkpoint blockades.},

Plasma membrane–associated proteins with sufficiently low diffusion and/or detachment rates couple to the flows and deplete from areas of exocytosis. In rod-shaped fission yeast cells, zones of Cdc42 GTPase activity driving polarized exocytosis are limited by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). We show that membrane flows pattern the GAP Rga4 distribution and that coupling of a synthetic GAP to membrane flows is sufficient to establish the rod shape. Thus, membrane flows induced by Cdc42-dependent exocytosis form a negative feedback restricting the zone of Cdc42 activity.},

Here, we investigate the mechanics, molecules, and neurons responsible for proprioception in Caenorhabditis elegans to gain insight into how mechanosensation shapes the orbital trajectory to a well-defined limit cycle. We used genome editing, force spectroscopy, and multiscale modeling and found that alternating tension and compression with the spectrin network of a single proprioceptor encodes body posture and informs TRP-4/NOMPC and TWK-16/TREK2 homologs of mechanosensitive ion channels during locomotion. In contrast to a widely accepted model of proprioceptive “stretch” reception, we found that proprioceptors activated locally under compressive stresses in-vivo and in-vitro and propose that this property leads to compartmentalized activity within long axons delimited by curvature-dependent mechanical stresses.},

These advances are achieved by exploiting a previously unidentified flow regime in ladder microfluidic networks that, under appropriate conditions, yield a mathematically perfect cell trap. Machine learning and computer vision tools are used to control the imaging hardware and analyze the cellular phenotypic parameters within these images. Using this platform, we quantified the responses of tens of thousands of single cell–derived acute myeloid leukemia (AML) clones to targeted therapy, identifying rare resistance and morphological phenotypes at frequencies down to 0.05\%.

Using genomic and transcriptomic data from sardines collected around the South African coast, we identified two stocks, one cool temperate (Atlantic) and the other warm temperate (Indian Ocean). Unexpectedly, we found that sardines participating in the sardine run are primarily of Atlantic origin and thus prefer colder water. These sardines separate from the warm-temperate stock and move into temporarily favorable Indian Ocean habitat during brief cold-water upwelling periods. Once the upwelling ends, they find themselves trapped in physiologically challenging subtropical habitat and subject to intense predation pressure. This makes the sardine run a rare example of a mass migration that has no apparent fitness benefits.},

The decrease of intracellular K + concentration is a minimal upstream signal to most of the NLRP3 activation models. Here, we found that cellular K + efflux induces a stable structural change in the inactive NLRP3, promoting an open conformation as a step preceding activation. This conformational change is facilitated by the specific NLRP3 FISNA domain and a unique flexible linker sequence between the PYD and FISNA domains. This linker also facilitates the ensemble of NLRP3 PYD into a seed structure for ASC oligomerization. The introduction of the NLRP3 PYD-linker-FISNA sequence into NLRP6 resulted in a chimeric receptor able to be activated by K + efflux–specific NLRP3 activators and promoted an in vivo inflammatory response to uric acid crystals.

We demonstrate that these memory deficits are caused by abnormal mammalian target of rapamycin–dependent interferon signaling and impairments in microglia function. By mining the medical records of more than 3 million children followed from birth, we show that the prevalence of hospitalizations due to infections in males (but not in females) is associated with future development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

However, how the epigenome in BPs differs across species is not known. Here, we report that histone H3 acetylation is a key epigenetic regulation in bIP amplification and cortical expansion. Through epigenetic profiling of sorted bIPs, we show that histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) is low in murine bIPs and high in human bIPs. Elevated H3K9ac preferentially increases bIP proliferation, increasing the size and folding of the normally smooth mouse neocortex. H3K9ac drives bIP amplification by increasing expression of the evolutionarily regulated gene, Trnp1 , in developing cortex. Our findings demonstrate a previously unknown mechanism that controls cortical architecture.},

Here, we found that viral infection promoted the G protein–coupled receptor LPA1 expression, and LPA restrained type I/III interferon production through LPA1. Mechanistically, LPA1 signaling activated ROCK1/2, which phosphorylated IRF3 Ser 97 to suppress IRF3 activation. Targeting LPA1 or ROCK in macrophages, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and LPA1 conditional KO mice promoted interferon-induced clearance of multiple viruses. LPA1 was colocalized with the receptor ACE2 in lung and intestine. Together with previous findings that LPA1 and ROCK1/2 promoted vascular leaking or lung fibrosis, we propose that the current available preclinical drugs targeting the LPA1-ROCK module might protect from SARS-CoV-2 or various virus infections in the intestine or lung.},

  abstract     = {Antibiotic metabolites and antimicrobial peptides mediate competition between bacterial species. Many of them hijack inner and outer membrane proteins to enter cells. Sensitivity of enteric bacteria to multiple peptide antibiotics is controlled by the single inner membrane protein SbmA. To establish the molecular mechanism of peptide transport by SbmA and related BacA, we determined their cryo–electron microscopy structures at 3.2 and 6 Å local resolution, respectively. The structures show a previously unknown fold, defining a new class of secondary transporters named SbmA-like peptide transporters. The core domain includes conserved glutamates, which provide a pathway for proton translocation, powering transport. The structures show an outward-open conformation with a large cavity that can accommodate diverse substrates. We propose a molecular mechanism for antibacterial peptide uptake paving the way for creation of narrow-targeted therapeutics.},

Several mechanisms are hypothesized to explain CGP including natural selection, spatiotemporal fluctuations in larval source populations, self-recruitment, and sweepstake reproduction. Discriminating among them is extremely difficult but is fundamental to understanding how marine organisms reproduce and disperse. Here, we report a notable example of CGP in the Antarctic limpet, an unusually tractable system where multiple confounding explanations can be discounted. Using population genomics, temporally replicated sampling, surface drifters, and forward genetic simulations, we show that CGP likely arises from an extreme sweepstake event together with collective larval dispersal, while selection appears to be unimportant. Our results illustrate the importance of neutral demographic forces in natural populations and have important implications for understanding the recruitment dynamics, population connectivity, local adaptation, and resilience of marine populations.},

This study reveals that S100A9-deficient neutrophils produce higher levels of mitochondrial superoxide in response to Staphylococcus aureus and, as a result, form neutrophil extracellular traps (suicidal NETosis). Increased suicidal NETosis does not improve neutrophil killing of S. aureus in isolation but augments macrophage killing. NET formation enhances antibacterial activity by increasing phagocytosis by macrophages and by transferring neutrophil-specific antimicrobial peptides to them. Similar results were observed in response to other phylogenetically distinct bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , implicating this as an immune defense mechanism that broadly enhances antibacterial activity. These results demonstrate that achieving maximal bactericidal activity through NET formation requires macrophages and that accelerated and more robust suicidal NETosis makes neutrophils adept at increasing antibacterial activity, especially when A9 deficient.},

These metasurfaces have a globally random phase in reflection that leads to diffuse reflection, while the local space inversion and reciprocity principle ensure distortion-free transmission. Notably, the metasurface reflects like a rough surface yet transmits like a smooth one in a broad spectrum. On the basis of complementary random arrays of gold nanorods, we verified this functionality by both optical spectroscopy and imaging experiments over a broad range of frequencies from the visible to the infrared regime. This feature, which originates from breaking the phase correlation between reflection and transmission by the metasurface, could enable a range of new optical materials and display technology.},

We apply this approach to investigate the regulation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) by stimulatory and inhibitory G proteins—a prototypical allosteric system that has long escaped from in-depth molecular characterization. We reveal a surprisingly simple ON/OFF regulation of AC functional dynamics through multiple pathways of information transfer. The binding of G proteins reshapes the free-energy landscape of AC following the classical population-shift paradigm. The model agrees with structural and biochemical data and reveals previously unknown experimentally consistent intermediates.

We applied hierarchical clustering on a training subset of 11, 448 patients using nine pain-agnostic symptoms. We then validated a three-cluster solution reflecting a graded scale of severity across all symptoms and eight independent pain-specific measures in additional subsets of 3817 and 1273 patients. Negative affect–related factors were key determinants of cluster assignment. The smallest subset included follow-up assessments that were predicted by baseline cluster assignment.

Without prior knowledge of the primary wavefield, the signals for the secondary sources need to be estimated and adapted in real time. This has thus far impeded active cloaking and holography for broadband wavefields. We present experimental results of active acoustic cloaking and holography without prior knowledge of the wavefield so that objects remain invisible and illusions intact even for broadband moving sources.

This study uses molecular dynamics simulations to systematically characterize wood polymers, their mixtures, interface, and composites, yielding an unprecedented micromechanical dataset including swelling, mechanical weakening, and hydrogen bonding, over the full hydration range. The rich data reveal the mechanism of wood cell wall hygromechanics: Cellulose fiber dominates the mechanics of cell wall along the longitudinal direction. Hemicellulose glues lignin and cellulose fiber together defining the cell wall mechanics along the transverse direction, and water severely disturbs the hemicellulose-related hydrogen bonds. In contrast, lignin is rather hydration independent and serves mainly as a space filler. The moisture-induced highly anisotropic swelling and weakening of wood cell wall is governed by the interplay of cellulose reinforcement, mechanical degradation of matrix, and fiber-matrix interface.},

These beneficial effects are associated with normalization of dysregulated gene expression in DMD myogenic transcriptomes affecting NMJ assembly (e.g., MUSK ) and axon guidance (e.g., SLIT2 and SLIT3 ).

We demonstrate that reduced red blood cell (RBC) survival rather than altered erythropoiesis is driving the development of anemia. The tumor-induced inflammatory and metabolic remodeling affect RBC integrity and augment splenic phagocyte activity promoting erythrophagocytosis. Exercise training normalizes these tumor-associated abnormal metabolic profiles and inflammation and thereby ameliorates anemia, in part, by promoting RBC survival. Fatigue was prevented in exercising tumor-bearing mice. Thus, exercise has the unique potential to substantially modulate metabolism and inflammation and thereby counteracts pathological remodeling of these parameters by the tumor microenvironment.

  abstract     = {As a symbol of civilization and culture, architecture was originally developed for sheltering people from unpleasant weather or other environmental conditions. Therefore, architecture is expected to be sensitive to climate change, particularly to changes in the occurrence of extreme weather events. However, although meteorological factors are widely considered in modern architecture design, it remains unclear whether and how ancient people adapted to climate change from the perspective of architecture design, particularly on a millennium time scale. Here, we show periodic change and a positive trend in roof slope of traditional buildings in the northern part of central and eastern China and demonstrate climate change adaptation in traditional Chinese architecture, driven by fluctuations in extreme snowfall events over the past thousand years. This study provides an excellent example showing how humans have long been aware of the impact of climate change on daily life and learned to adapt to it.},

  abstract     = {Given the evidence for a hyperactive platelet phenotype in COVID-19, we investigated effector cell properties of COVID-19 platelets on endothelial cells (ECs). Integration of EC and platelet RNA sequencing revealed that platelet-released factors in COVID-19 promote an inflammatory hypercoagulable endotheliopathy. We identified S100A8 and S100A9 as transcripts enriched in COVID-19 platelets and were induced by megakaryocyte infection with SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with increased gene expression, the heterodimer protein product of S100A8 / A9 , myeloid-related protein (MRP) 8/14, was released to a greater extent by platelets from COVID-19 patients relative to controls. We demonstrate that platelet-derived MRP8/14 activates ECs, promotes an inflammatory hypercoagulable phenotype, and is a significant contributor to poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Last, we present evidence that targeting platelet P2Y 12 represents a promising candidate to reduce proinflammatory platelet-endothelial interactions. Together, these findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for platelets and their activation-induced endotheliopathy in COVID-19.},

However, synthesizing halide electrolytes from a liquid phase is extremely challenging because of the vulnerability of metal halides to hydrolysis. In this work, ammonium-assisted wet chemistry is reported to synthesize various solid-state halide electrolytes with an exceptional ionic conductivity (&gt;1 microsiemens per centimeter). Microstrain-induced localized microstructure change is found to be beneficial to lithium ion transport in halide electrolytes. Furthermore, the interfacial incompatibility between halide electrolytes and lithium metal is alleviated by transforming the mixed electronic/ionic conductive interface into a lithium ion–conductive interface. Such all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries (ASSLMBs) demonstrate a high initial coulombic efficiency of 98.1\% based on lithium cobalt oxide and a high discharge capacity of 166.9 microampere hours per gram based on single-crystal LiNi 0.6 Mn 0.2 Co 0.2 O 2 .

Using the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 as a model, we have developed such a platform by CRISPR engineering of bacteriophage T4. A pipeline of vaccine candidates was engineered by incorporating various viral components into appropriate compartments of phage nanoparticle structure. These include expressible spike genes in genome, spike and envelope epitopes as surface decorations, and nucleocapsid proteins in packaged core. Phage decorated with spike trimers was found to be the most potent vaccine candidate in animal models. Without any adjuvant, this vaccine stimulated robust immune responses, both T helper cell 1 (T H 1) and T H 2 immunoglobulin G subclasses, blocked virus-receptor interactions, neutralized viral infection, and conferred complete protection against viral challenge. This new nanovaccine design framework might allow the rapid deployment of effective adjuvant-free phage-based vaccines against any emerging pathogen in the future.},

We show here that magnetite nanorods interact along a critical angle, depending on their aspect ratios and assemble into body-centered tetragonal colloidal crystals. Under a magnetic field, size-dependent attractive and repulsive domains develop on the ends and center of the nanorods, respectively. Our joint experiment-computational multiscale study demonstrates the presence of a critical angle in the attractive domain, which defines the equilibrium bonding states of interacting rods and leads to the formation of non–close-packed yet hard-contact tetragonal crystals. Small-angle x-ray scattering measurement attributes the perfect tetragonal phase to the slow assembly kinetics. The crystals exhibit brilliant structural colors, which can be actively tuned by changing the magnetic field direction. These highly ordered frameworks and well-defined three-dimensional nanochannels may offer new opportunities for manipulating nanoscale chemical transformation, mass transportation, and wave propagation.},

Raman spectral signatures distinctively show that the population of six-membered GeO 4 rings increases at elevated substrate temperatures. Deposition near the glass transition temperature is more efficient than postgrowth annealing in modifying atomic structure at medium range. The enhanced medium-range organization correlates with reduction of the room temperature internal friction. Identifying the microscopic origin of room temperature internal friction in amorphous oxides is paramount to design the next-generation interference coatings for mirrors of the end test masses of gravitational wave interferometers, in which the room temperature internal friction is a main source of noise limiting their sensitivity.},

While organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have been used as local transducers of bioelectronic signals, their current output presents challenges for implementation. OECT-based circuits offer new opportunities for high-performance signal processing. In this work, we introduce an active sensing node based on cofacial vertical OECTs forming an ambipolar complementary inverter. The inverter, which shows a voltage gain of 28, is composed of two OECTs on opposite side walls of a single active area, resulting in a footprint identical to a planar OECT. The inverter is used as an analog voltage preamplifier for recording electrocardiogram signals when biased at the input voltage corresponding to peak gain. We further demonstrate compatibility with nontraditional fabrication methods with potential benefits for rapid prototyping and large-area printed electronics.},

This mutation disrupts key interactions in the wild-type PrP fibril, forming an amyloid fibril with a conformation distinct from the wild-type PrP fibril and hamster brain–derived prion fibril. The E196K fibril consists of two protofibrils. Each subunit forms five β strands stabilized by a disulfide bond and an unusual hydrophilic cavity stabilized by a salt bridge.

Sw-IMs stay inert (switch off) in the circulation and healthy tissues but get reactivated (switch on) selectively in tumor via responsive removal of the polymer masks, thus focusing the immune boosting activities in the tumor microenvironment. Sw-IMs applied to anti–4-1BB agonistic antibody and IL-15 cytokine led to equivalent antitumor efficacy to the parental IMs with markedly reduced toxicities.

We found that forest edge area increased from 27 to 31\% of the total forest area in just 10 years, with the largest increase in Africa. The number of forest fragments increased by 20 million with consequences for connectivity of tropical landscapes. Simulations suggest that ongoing deforestation will further accelerate forest fragmentation. By 2100, 50\% of tropical forest area will be at the forest edge, causing additional carbon emissions of up to 500 million MT carbon per year.

Deep phenotyping and transcriptional analysis of adult hearts and fins show that Il-11 signaling drives cellular reprogramming to orchestrate global and tissue-specific regenerative programs and broadly antagonizes hallmarks of adult mammalian scarring. Mechanistically, our data indicate that IL-11 signaling in endothelial cells antagonizes profibrotic transforming growth factor–β signaling and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, limiting scarring and promoting cardiomyocyte repopulation, after injury. Overall, our findings position damage-induced Il-11/Stat3 signaling in a key role limiting fibrosis and promoting regeneration, revealing novel targets for regenerative therapies.},

  abstract     = {Scalable fabrication of monolayer graphene membrane on porous supports is key to realizing practical applications of atomically thin membranes, but it is technologically challenging. Here, we demonstrate a facile and versatile electrospinning approach to realize nanoporous graphene membranes on different polymeric supports with high porosity for efficient diffusion- and pressure-driven separations. The conductive graphene works as an excellent receptor for deposition of highly porous nanofibers during electrospinning, thereby enabling direct attachment of graphene to the support. A universal “binder” additive is shown to enhance adhesion between the graphene layer and polymeric supports, resulting in high graphene coverage on nanofibers made from different polymers. After defect sealing and oxygen plasma treatment, the resulting nanoporous membranes demonstrate record-high performances in dialysis and organic solvent nanofiltration, with a pure ethanol permeance of 156.8 liters m −2 hour −1 bar −1 and 94.5\% rejection to Rose Bengal (1011 g mol −1 ) that surpasses the permeability-selectivity trade-off.},

Here, we report that HSD induces natural killer (NK) cell–mediated tumor immunity by inhibiting PD-1 expression while enhancing IFNγ and serum hippurate. Salt enhanced tumor immunity when combined with a suboptimal dose of anti-PD1 antibody. While HSD-induced tumor immunity was blunted upon gut microbiota depletion, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from HSD mice restored the tumor immunity associated with NK cell functions. HSD increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium and caused increased gut permeability leading to intratumor localization of Bifidobacterium , which enhanced NK cell functions and tumor regression. Intratumoral injections of Bifidobacterium activated NK cells, which inhibited tumor growth. These results indicate that HSD modulates gut microbiome that induces NK cell–dependent tumor immunity with a potential translational perspective.},

In plants, wounding triggers electrical and calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling, which involve homologs of mammalian glutamate receptors. The hydraulic dispersal and squeeze-cell hypotheses implicate pressure as a key component of systemic signaling. Here, we identify the stretch-activated anion channel MSL10 as necessary for proper wound-induced electrical and Ca 2+ signaling. Wound gene induction, genetics, and Ca 2+ imaging indicate that MSL10 acts in the same pathway as the glutamate receptor–like proteins (GLRs). Analogous to mammalian NMDA glutamate receptors, GLRs may serve as coincidence detectors gated by the combined requirement for ligand binding and membrane depolarization, here mediated by stretch activation of MSL10. This study provides a molecular genetic basis for a role of mechanical signal perception and the transmission of long-distance electrical and Ca 2+ signals in plants.},

An emerging strategy to treat bacterial infections relies on interference with their signaling systems. In this study, we investigated P. syringae pv. syringae , which produces the virulence factor mangotoxin that causes bacterial apical necrosis on mango leaves. A previously unknown signaling molecule named leudiazen was identified, determined to be unstable and volatile, and responsible for mangotoxin production. A strategy using potassium permanganate, compatible with organic farming, was developed to degrade leudiazen and thus to attenuate the pathogenicity of P. syringae pv. syringae .},

We further identify that somatostatin (SOM)–, calretinin (CR)–, and vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (Vglut2)–expressing cells display unique electrophysiological profiles; however, they similarly respond to anxiety-provoking stimuli and to diazepam. Optogenetic manipulations reveal that each of these ZI neuronal populations triggers specific anxiety-related behavioral phenotypes. Activation of SOM-expressing neurons induced anxiety, while photoactivation of CR-positive cells and photoinhibition of Vglut2-expressing neurons produce anxiolysis. Furthermore, activation of CR- and Vglut2-positive cells provokes rearing and jumps, respectively. Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that ZI subpopulations encode and modulate different components of anxiety.},

By combining spatially resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with optical spectroscopy, we report the first direct evidence of how strongly correlated phases evolve from a weakly interacting regime in a transition metal dichalcogenide superlattice. By comparing short and long wave vector moirés, we find that the electronic structure evolves into a highly localized regime with increasingly flat bands and renormalized effective mass. The flattening is accompanied by the opening of a large gap in the spectral function and splitting of the exciton peaks. These results advance our understanding of emerging phases in moiré superlattices and point to the importance of interlayer physics.},

Here, a climate reconstruction of 4500 years for the Jerusalem region was used to determine the relation between climate, vegetation, and groundwater recharge. Despite changes in air temperature and vegetation characteristics, simulated recharge remained linearly related to precipitation over the entire analyzed period, with drier decades having lower rates of recharge for a given annual precipitation due to soil memory effects. We show that in recent decades, the lack of changes in the precipitation–groundwater recharge relation results from the compensating responses of vegetation to increasing CO 2 , i.e., increased leaf area and reduced stomatal conductance. This multicentury relation is expected to be modified by climate change, with changes up to −20\% in recharge for unchanged precipitation, potentially jeopardizing water resource availability.},

We have studied one of the simplest hydrogen bond formers, hydrogen chloride, from crystallization to metallization, covering a pressure range of more than 2.5 million atmospheres. Following hydrogen bond symmetrization, we identify a previously unknown phase by the appearance of new Raman modes and changes to x-ray diffraction patterns that contradict previous predictions. On further compression, a broad Raman band supersedes the well-defined excitations of phase V, despite retaining a crystalline chlorine substructure. We propose that this mode has its origin in proton (H + ) mobility and disorder. Above 100 GPa, the optical bandgap closes linearly with extrapolated metallization at 240(10) GPa.

Mutations in mtDNA can cause a shortage in cellular energy supply, which can lead to numerous mitochondrial diseases. How cells secure mtDNA integrity over generations has remained unanswered. Here, we show that the single-celled yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can intracellularly distinguish between functional and defective mtDNA and promote generation of daughter cells with increasingly healthy mtDNA content. Purifying selection for functional mtDNA occurs in a continuous mitochondrial network and does not require mitochondrial fission but necessitates stable mitochondrial subdomains that depend on intact cristae morphology. Our findings support a model in which cristae-dependent proximity between mtDNA and the proteins it encodes creates a spatial “sphere of influence, ” which links a lack of functional fitness to clearance of defective mtDNA.},

  abstract     = {Interindividual variability in drug response constitutes a major concern in pharmacotherapy. While polymorphisms in genes involved in drug disposition have been extensively studied, drug target variability remains underappreciated. By mapping the genomic variability of all human drug target genes onto high-resolution crystal structures of drug target complexes, we identified 1094 variants localized within 6 Å of drug-binding pockets and directly affecting their geometry, topology, or physicochemical properties. We experimentally show that binding site variants affect pharmacodynamics with marked drug- and variant-specific differences. In addition, we demonstrate that a common BCHE variant confers resistance to tacrine and rivastigmine, which can be overcome by the use of derivatives based on squaric acid scaffolds or tryptophan conjugation. These findings underscore the importance of genetic drug target variability and demonstrate that integration of genomic data and structural information can inform personalized drug selection and genetically guided drug development to overcome resistance.},

Here, we report that two members of the nitrate/peptide transporter family, NAET1 and NAET2, function as NA transporters required for translocation of both iron and copper to seeds. We show that NAET1 and NAET2 are predominantly expressed in the shoot and root vascular tissues and mediate secretion of NA out of the cells in resembling the release of neurotransmitters from animal synaptic vesicles.

Here, we report that INTS11 is required for normal hematopoiesis and hematopoietic-specific genetic deletion of Ints11 leads to cell cycle arrest and impairment of fetal and adult HSPCs. We identified a novel INTS11-interacting protein complex, Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), that maintains HSPC functions. Loss of INTS11 destabilizes the PRC2 complex, decreases the level of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and derepresses PRC2 target genes. Reexpression of INTS11 or PRC2 proteins in Ints11 -deficient HSPCs restores the levels of PRC2 and H3K27me3 as well as HSPC functions. Collectively, our data demonstrate that INTS11 is an essential regulator of HSPC homeostasis through the INTS11-PRC2 axis.},

Autistic toddlers with poor early language outcome are instead specifically characterized by a secondary and independent genomic patterning effect on CT. Genes involved in these effects can be traced back to midgestational A-P and D-V gene expression gradients and different prenatal cell types (e.g., progenitor cells and excitatory neurons), are functionally important for vocal learning and human-specific evolution, and are prominent in prenatal coexpression networks enriched for high-penetrance autism risk genes.

Microglia-specific deletion of the noncanonical NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) impairs EAE disease progression. Although microglial NIK is dispensable for the initial phase of T cell infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) and EAE disease onset, it is critical for the subsequent CNS recruitment of inflammatory T cells and monocytes. Our data suggest that following their initial CNS infiltration, T cells activate the microglial noncanonical NF-κB pathway, which synergizes with the T cell-derived cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor to induce expression of chemokines involved in the second-wave of T cell recruitment and disease progression. These findings highlight a mechanism of microglial function that is dependent on NIK signaling and required for EAE disease progression.},

From only 10 ng of cfDNA (1 to 3 ml of plasma), we generated the most comprehensive cfDNA methylome to date.

These micromachines respond to time-variant magnetic fields for torque-driven steerable motion and exhibit multiple cycles of pH-responsive two-way shape memory behavior for controlled cargo delivery and release applications. Their proteinaceous fabrics enable enzymatic degradability with proteinases, thereby lowering risks of long-term toxicity.

Protein S -glutathionylation (PSSG) of cysteine residues is a distinct form of oxidative response that modifies protein structures and functions. Glutaredoxin-1 (GLRX) reverses PSSG by liberating glutathione (GSH). In this study, we showed that pirfenidone (PFD), an anti-lung fibrosis drug, inhibited HSC activation and liver fibrosis in a GLRX-dependent manner. Glrx depletion exacerbated liver fibrosis, and decreased GLRX and increased PSSG were observed in fibrotic mouse and human livers. In contrast, overexpression of GLRX inhibited PSSG and liver fibrosis. Mechanistically, the inhibition of HSC activation by GLRX may have been accounted for by deglutathionylation of Smad3, which inhibits Smad3 phosphorylation, leading to the suppression of fibrogenic gene expression. Our results have established GLRX as the therapeutic target of PFD and uncovered an important role of PSSG in liver fibrosis.

STAT1-deficient mice showed enhanced proliferation of peripheral naïve CD8 + T cells, which resulted in an abnormal increase in the number of CD44 hi memory/activated phenotype cells and an enlargement of secondary lymphoid tissues. This phenomenon was not observed in IFNR-deficient mice but was paradoxically dependent on type I interferon and its alternative signaling pathway via the STAT4–RagD–lysosomal mTORC1 axis.

The photocurrent displays a distinct dependence on light helicity, which can be tuned by varying the magnetic states and photon energy. Circular polarization–resolved absorption measurements reveal that these observations originate from magnetic order–coupled and, thus, helicity-dependent charge-transfer excitons. The photocurrent displays multiple plateaus as the magnetic field is swept, associated with different CrI 3 spin configurations.

Using mice with podocyte-specific knockdown of Klf4, we conducted glomerular RNA-sequencing, tandem mass spectrometry, and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to identify cell-specific transcriptional changes that trigger PEC activation due to podocyte loss. Integration with in silico chromatin immunoprecipitation identified key ligand-receptor interactions, such as fibronectin 1 (FN1)–αVβ6, between podocytes and PECs dependent on KLF4 and downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. Knockdown of Itgb6 in PECs attenuated PEC activation. Additionally, podocyte-specific induction of human KLF4 or pharmacological inhibition of downstream STAT3 activation reduced FN1 and integrin β 6 (ITGB6) expression and mitigated podocyte loss and PEC activation in mice.

  abstract     = {The balance between the amount of gas coexisting with mantle-derived magmas at depth and that emitted during intereruptive phases may play a key role in the eruptive potential of volcanoes. Taking the December 2018 eruption at Mt. Etna volcano as a case study, we discuss the geochemical data streams observed. The signals indicate a long-lasting prelude stage to eruption, starting in 2017 and involving magma-fluid accumulation in the deep (&gt;7 km bsl) reservoir, followed by pressure buildup in the system at intermediate depth (5 to 2 km bsl), 6 to 7 months before the eruption. A brief preeruptive phase marks the pressurization at 2 to 3 km below the craters. By comparing the magma and fluid recharge at depth to the measured volcanic degassing from the plume, we provide evidence that Mt. Etna was in a state of extreme overpressurization in the weeks before the onset of the eruption.},

Despite continuous improvements in surgical techniques, cancer recurrence after surgical resection remains the most common cause of treatment failure. Here, we report cold atmospheric plasma (CAP)–mediated postsurgical cancer treatment, using a portable air-fed CAP (aCAP) device. The aCAP device we developed uses the local ambient air as the source gas to generate cold plasma discharge with only joule energy level electrical input, thus providing a device that is simple and highly tunable for a wide range of biomedical applications. We demonstrate that local aCAP treatment on residual tumor cells at the surgical cavities effectively induces cancer immunogenic cell death in situ and evokes strong T cell–mediated immune responses to combat the residual tumor cells. In both 4T1 breast tumor and B16F10 melanoma models, aCAP treatment after incomplete tumor resection contributes to inhibiting tumor growth and prolonging survival.},

  abstract     = {AAA+ ring–shaped machines, such as the disaggregation machines ClpB and Hsp104, mediate ATP-driven substrate translocation through their central channel by a set of pore loops. Recent structural studies have suggested a universal hand-over-hand translocation mechanism with slow and rigid subunit motions. However, functional and biophysical studies are in discord with this model. Here, we directly measure the real-time dynamics of the pore loops of ClpB during substrate threading, using single-molecule FRET spectroscopy. All pore loops undergo large-amplitude fluctuations on the microsecond time scale and change their conformation upon interaction with substrate proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. Conformational dynamics of two of the pore loops strongly correlate with disaggregation activity, suggesting that they are the main contributors to substrate pulling. This set of findings is rationalized in terms of an ultrafast Brownian-ratchet translocation mechanism, which likely acts in parallel to the much slower hand-over-hand process in ClpB and other AAA+ machines.},

Here, an efficient biocatalyst was developed to selectively produce gallate from lignin components by integrating three main reactions: hydroxylation, O-demethylation, and aryl side-chain oxidation. A rationally designed hydroxylase system was first introduced into a gallate biodegradation pathway–blocked Rhodococcus opacus mutant so that gallate accumulated from protocatechuate and compounds in its upper pathways. Native and heterologous O-demethylation systems were then used, leading to multiple lignin-derived methoxy aromatics being converted to gallate. Furthermore, an aryl side-chain oxidase was engaged to broaden the substrate spectrum. Consequently, the developed biocatalyst showed that gallate yields as high as 0.407 and 0.630 g of gallate per gram of lignin when alkaline-pretreated lignin and base-depolymerized ammonia fiber explosion lignin were applied as substrates, respectively. These results suggested that this rationally developed biocatalyst enabled the lignin valorization process to be simple and efficient.},

NW Re-RAMs made of three types of methyl ammonium lead halide perovskites (MAPbX 3 ; X = Cl, Br, I) have been explored. A trade-off between device switching speed and retention time was intriguingly found. Ultrafast switching speed (200 ps) for monocrystalline MAPbI 3 and ~7 × 10 9 s ultralong extrapolated retention time for polycrystalline MAPbCl 3 NW devices were obtained. Further, first-principles calculation revealed that Ag diffusion energy barrier increases when lattice size shrinks from MAPbI 3 to MAPbCl 3 , culminating in the trade-off between the device switching speed and retention time.},

We illustrate the versatility of this approach by fabricating and studying curvilinear, branched, bridged-spiral, dendritic, and mesh-like polylithomers having controllable preassembled dimensions, topologies, configurations, intrinsic local curvatures, persistence lengths, and bond extensibilities. By advancing anisotropic particle tracking routines to handle lock-and-key tiles, we measure the dynamic conformational changes of polylithomers caused by Brownian excitations to the monomer scale, revealing markedly large bond extensibilities. Beyond modeling fluctuating semiflexible molecular polymers, polylithomers provide access to unusual polymer morphologies and bonding potentials that have not yet been synthesized through other kinds of assembly methods using either molecular or colloidal monomers.},

Here, using distinct models of immunization, we establish that cognate antigen recognition by CD8 + T M cells on dendritic cells initiates their rapid and coordinated production of a burst of CCL3, CCL4, and XCL1 chemokines under the transcriptional control of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 4. Using intravital microscopy imaging, we reveal that CD8 + T M cells undergo antigen-dependent arrest in splenic red pulp clusters of CCR2 + Ly6C + monocytes to which they deliver IFNγ and chemokines. IFNγ enables chemokine-induced microbicidal activities in monocytes for protection. Thus, rapid and effective CD8 + T M cell responses require spatially and temporally coordinated events that quickly restrict microbial pathogen growth through the local delivery of activating chemokines to CCR2 + Ly6C + monocytes.},

The key advance is a peptide coassembly design (PepCAD) algorithm that searches for pairs of coassembling peptides. Six peptide pairs are identified from a pool of ~10 6 candidates via the PepCAD algorithm and then subjected to DMD/PRIME20 simulations to examine their co-/self-association kinetics. The five pairs that spontaneously aggregate in kinetic simulations selectively coassemble in biophysical experiments, with four forming β-sheet nanofibers and one forming a stable nonfibrillar aggregate. Solid-state NMR, which is applied to characterize the coassembling pairs, suggests that the in silico peptides exhibit a higher degree of structural order than the previously reported CATCH(+/−) peptides.},

Here, we establish a cortex-dependent perceptual task in which mice discriminate tactile gratings on the basis of orientation using only their whiskers. Multielectrode recordings in the barrel cortex reveal weak orientation tuning in average firing rates (500-ms time scale) during grating exploration despite high levels of cortical activity. Just before decision, orientation information extracted from fast cortical dynamics (100-ms time scale) more closely resembles concurrent psychophysical measurements than single neuron orientation tuning curves. This temporal code conveys both stimulus and choice/action-related information, suggesting that fast cortical dynamics during exploration of a tactile object both reflect the physical stimulus and affect the decision.},

Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of SN-treated GSCs reveal metabolic alterations that are characteristic of biotin-deficient cells, including intracellular cholesterol depletion, impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, and energetic crisis. Furthermore, SN treatment reduces histone biotinylation, histone acetylation, and expression of superenhancer-associated GSC critical genes, which are also observed when biotin distribution is genetically disrupted by holocarboxylase synthetase ( HLCS ) depletion. HLCS silencing impaired GSC tumorigenicity in an orthotopic xenograft brain tumor model. In GBM, high HLCS expression robustly indicates a poor prognosis. Thus, the dependency of GBM on biotin distribution suggests that the rational cotargeting of biotin-dependent metabolism and epigenetic pathways may be explored for GSC eradication.},

For a quantum particle propagating in a hyperbolic lattice potential, we construct a continuous family of eigenstates that acquire Bloch-like phase factors under a discrete but noncommutative group of hyperbolic translations, the Fuchsian group of the lattice. A hyperbolic analog of crystal momentum arises as the set of Aharonov-Bohm phases threading the cycles of a higher-genus Riemann surface associated with this group. This crystal momentum lives in a higher-dimensional Brillouin zone torus, the Jacobian of the Riemann surface, over which a discrete set of continuous energy bands can be computed.},

The homozygous mutants die around embryonic day 10.5 and are apparently devoid of DNMT1 proteins. We present the evidence that the mutant DNMT1 proteins are unstable, most likely because of cleavage within RFTS domain by an unidentified proteinase.

  abstract     = {Sex is a fundamental trait determined by environmental and/or genetic factors, including sex chromosomes. Sex chromosomes are studied in species scattered across the tree of life, yet little is known about tempo and mode of sex chromosome evolution among closely related species. Here, we examine sex chromosome evolution in the adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika. Through the analysis of male and female genomes from 244 cichlid taxa (189 described species with 5 represented with two local variants/populations; 50 undescribed species) and of 396 multitissue transcriptomes from 66 taxa, we identify signatures of sex chromosomes in 79 taxa, involving 12 linkage groups. We find that Tanganyikan cichlids have the highest rates of sex chromosome turnover and heterogamety transitions known to date. We show that sex chromosome recruitment is not at random. Moreover convergently emerged sex chromosomes in cichlids support the “limited options” hypothesis of sex chromosome evolution.},

  abstract     = {Senescence of myogenic progenitors impedes skeletal muscle regeneration. Here, we show that overexpression of the transcription factor NANOG in senescent myoblasts can overcome the effects of cellular senescence and confer a youthful phenotype to senescent cells. NANOG ameliorated primary hallmarks of cellular senescence including genomic instability, loss of proteostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The rejuvenating effects of NANOG included restoration of DNA damage response via up-regulation of DNA repair proteins, recovery of heterochromatin marks via up-regulation of histones, and reactivation of autophagy and mitochondrial energetics via up-regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Expression of NANOG in the skeletal muscle of a mouse model of premature aging restored the number of myogenic progenitors and induced formation of eMyHC + myofibers. This work demonstrates the feasibility of reversing the effects of cellular senescence in vitro and in vivo, with no need for reprogramming to the pluripotent state.},

Retaining ductility in these metals, however, has proven difficult because detwinning rapidly exhausts TB migration mechanisms at large deformation, whereas TB sliding was only evidenced for loading on very specific crystallographic orientations. Here, we reveal the intrinsic shear deformability of twins in nanocrystals using in situ nanomechanical testing and multiscale simulations and report extreme shear deformability through TB sliding up to 364\%. Sliding-induced plasticity is manifested for orientations that are generally predicted to favor detwinning and shown to depend critically on geometric inhomogeneities. Normal and shear coupling are further examined to delineate a TB orientation-dependent transition from TB sliding to TB cracking. These dynamic observations reveal unprecedented mechanical properties in nanocrystals, which hold implications for improving metal processing by severe plastic deformation.},

Their contributions to research papers were more often devalued by both men and women. Women were more likely to discuss authorship with coauthors at the beginning of the project, whereas men were more likely to determine authorship unilaterally at the end. Women perceived that they received less credit than deserved, while men reported the opposite. This devaluation of women’s work in science creates cumulative disadvantages in scientific careers.

Critical to PI3Kγ function is the association of the p110γ catalytic subunit to either a p101 or p84 regulatory subunit, which mediates activation by G protein–coupled receptors. Here, we report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of a heterodimeric PI3Kγ complex, p110γ-p101. This structure reveals a unique assembly of catalytic and regulatory subunits that is distinct from other class I PI3K complexes. p101 mediates activation through its Gβγ-binding domain, recruiting the heterodimer to the membrane and allowing for engagement of a secondary Gβγ-binding site in p110γ. Mutations at the p110γ-p101 and p110γ–adaptor binding domain interfaces enhanced Gβγ activation. A nanobody that specifically binds to the p101-Gβγ interface blocks activation, providing a novel tool to study and target p110γ-p101–specific signaling events in vivo.},

Opioid analgesics remain the gold standard for intractable pain, but overprescription of increasingly powerful and addictive opioids has contributed to the current prescription drug abuse epidemic. There is a pressing need to screen experimental compounds more efficiently for analgesic potential that remains unmet by conventional research models. The spinal cord dorsal horn is a common target for analgesic intervention, where peripheral nociceptive signals are relayed to the central nervous system through synaptic transmission. Here, we demonstrate that coculturing peripheral and dorsal spinal cord nerve cells in a novel bioengineered microphysiological system facilitates self-directed emergence of native nerve tissue macrostructure and concerted synaptic function. The mechanistically distinct analgesics—morphine, lidocaine, and clonidine—differentially and predictably modulate this microphysiological synaptic transmission. Screening drug candidates for similar microphysiological profiles will efficiently identify therapeutics with analgesic potential.},

We carried out a synthetic lethal CRISPR screen to identify survival mechanisms governed by the tumor hypoxia–induced pH regulator carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX). We identified a redox homeostasis network containing the iron-sulfur cluster enzyme, NFS1. Depletion of NFS1 or blocking cyst(e)ine availability by inhibiting xCT, while targeting CAIX, enhanced ferroptosis and significantly inhibited tumor growth. Suppression of CAIX activity acidified intracellular pH, increased cellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, and induced susceptibility to alterations in iron homeostasis. Mechanistically, inhibiting bicarbonate production by CAIX or sodium-driven bicarbonate transport, while targeting xCT, decreased adenosine 5′-monophosphate–activated protein kinase activation and increased acetyl–coenzyme A carboxylase 1 activation. Thus, an alkaline intracellular pH plays a critical role in suppressing ferroptosis, a finding that may lead to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for solid tumors to overcome hypoxia- and acidosis-mediated tumor progression and therapeutic resistance.},

Because chronic hypoxia prominently delays wound healing, sustained oxygenation to alleviate hypoxia is hypothesized to promote diabetic wound healing. However, sustained oxygenation cannot be achieved by current clinical approaches, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Here, we present a sustained oxygenation system consisting of oxygen-release microspheres and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)–scavenging hydrogel. The hydrogel captures the naturally elevated ROS in diabetic wounds, which may be further elevated by the oxygen released from the administered microspheres. The sustained release of oxygen augmented the survival and migration of keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts, promoted angiogenic growth factor expression and angiogenesis in diabetic wounds, and decreased the proinflammatory cytokine expression. These effects significantly increased the wound closure rate. Our findings demonstrate that sustained oxygenation alone, without using drugs, can heal diabetic wounds.},

The Long Valley caldera, California, is one such setting where episodic earthquake swarms and persistent uplift suggest the presence of active magmatism. We quantify the long-term spatial and temporal characteristics of seismicity in the region using cluster analysis on a 25-year high-resolution earthquake catalog derived using leading-edge deep-learning algorithms. Our results show that earthquake swarms beneath the caldera exhibit enlarged families with statistically significant tendency for upward migration patterns. The ascending swarms tend to nucleate at the base of the seismogenic zone with a spatial footprint that is laterally constrained by the southern rim of the caldera. We suggest that these swarms are driven by the transport of volatile-rich fluids released from deep volcanic processes. The observations highlight the potential for extreme spatial segmentation of earthquake triggering processes in magmatic systems.},

Using a matched-pairs design, we found that street lighting strongly reduced moth caterpillar abundance compared with unlit sites (47\% reduction in hedgerows and 33\% reduction in grass margins) and affected caterpillar development. A separate experiment in habitats with no history of lighting revealed that ALAN disrupted the feeding behavior of nocturnal caterpillars. Negative impacts were more pronounced under white light-emitting diode (LED) street lights compared to conventional yellow sodium lamps. This indicates that ALAN and the ongoing shift toward white LEDs (i.e., narrow- to broad-spectrum lighting) will have substantial consequences for insect populations and ecosystem processes.},

Major migrations preceded the arrival of “steppe” ancestry, and at ~2800 BCE, three genetically and culturally differentiated groups coexisted. Corded Ware appeared by 2900 BCE, were initially genetically diverse, did not derive all steppe ancestry from known Yamnaya, and assimilated females of diverse backgrounds. Both Corded Ware and Bell Beaker groups underwent dynamic changes, involving sharp reductions and complete replacements of Y-chromosomal diversity at ~2600 and ~2400 BCE, respectively, the latter accompanied by increased Neolithic-like ancestry.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) expressed various antigens the same as multiple types of tumors, providing a promising source of wide-spectrum cancer vaccines. The damaged erythrocyte membrane entrapped by spleen could be developed as antigen deliverer for enhancing acquired immunity. Here, the modified lipid materials were used to dilate erythrocyte membrane to fabricate coalescent nanovector, which not only preserved the biological characteristics of erythrocyte membrane but also remedied the defect of insufficient drug loading capacity. After wrapping iPSC protein, the nanovaccine iPSC@RBC-Mlipo exhibited obvious splenic accumulation, systemic specific antitumor immunity evocation, and effective tumor expansion and metastasis inhibition in mice. Hence, our research may provide a prospective strategy of efficient tumor vaccine for clinical practice.},

A remarkable feature of the SLC15 family is their extreme substrate promiscuity, which has enabled the targeting of these transporters for the improvement of oral bioavailability for several prodrug molecules. Although recent structural and biochemical studies on bacterial homologs have identified conserved sites of proton and peptide binding, the mechanism of peptide capture and ligand promiscuity remains unclear for mammalian family members. Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the outward open conformation of the rat peptide transporter PepT2 in complex with an inhibitory nanobody. Our structure, combined with molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical and cell-based assays, establishes a framework for understanding peptide and prodrug recognition within this pharmaceutically important transporter family.},

We experimentally demonstrate that the topography alters single-cell motility and multicellular organization in M. xanthus . In topographies realized by randomly placing silica particles over agar plates, we observe that the cells’ interaction with particles drastically modifies the dynamics of cellular aggregation, leading to changes in the number, size, and shape of the fruiting bodies and even to arresting their formation in certain conditions. We further explore this type of cell-particle interaction in a computational model. These results provide fundamental insights into how the environment topography influences the emergence of complex multicellular structures from single cells, which is a fundamental problem of biological, ecological, and medical relevance.},

Seeking mechanisms behind such high survival, we developed a forward-genetic method for efficient isolation of high-survival mutants in any culturable bacterial species. We found that perturbation of an essential biosynthetic pathway (arginine biosynthesis) in a mycobacterium generated three distinct forms of resistance to diverse antibiotics, each mediated by induction of WhiB7: high persistence and tolerance to kanamycin, high survival upon exposure to rifampicin, and minimum inhibitory concentration–shifted resistance to clarithromycin. As little as one base change in a gene that encodes, a metabolic pathway component conferred multiple forms of resistance to multiple antibiotics with different targets. This extraordinary resilience may help explain how substerilizing exposure to one antibiotic in a regimen can induce resistance to others and invites development of drugs targeting the mediator of multiform resistance, WhiB7.},

Modulated by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation, NTA warm anomalies tend to induce La Niña events, droughts in Northeast Brazil, increased frequency of extreme hurricanes, and phytoplankton blooms in the Guinea Dome. Future changes of NTA variability could have profound socioeconomic impacts yet remain unknown. Here, we reveal a robust intensification of NTA variability under greenhouse warming. This intensification mainly arises from strengthening of ENSO-forced Pacific-North American pattern and tropospheric temperature anomalies, as a consequence of an eastward shift of ENSO-induced equatorial Pacific convection and of increased ENSO variability, which enhances ENSO influence by reinforcing the associated wind and moist convection anomalies. The intensification of NTA SST variability suggests increased occurrences of extreme NTA events, with far-reaching ramifications.},

However, understanding the interplay between environment, morphology, and behavior and its significance is complex. We explore a radiation of Pristionchus nematodes with discrete polyphenic mouth forms and associated microbivorous versus cannibalistic traits. Notably, comparing 29 Pristionchus species reveals that reproductive mode strongly correlates with mouth-form plasticity. Male-female species exhibit the microbivorous morph and avoid parent-offspring conflict as indicated by genetic hybrids. In contrast, hermaphroditic species display cannibalistic morphs encouraging competition. Testing predation between 36 co-occurring strains of the hermaphrodite P. pacificus showed that killing inversely correlates with genomic relatedness. These empirical data together with theory reveal that polyphenism (plasticity), kin recognition, and relatedness are three major factors that shape cannibalistic behaviors. Thus, developmental plasticity influences cooperative versus competitive social action strategies in diverse animals.},

Here, we show that OGCM simulation with sedimentary process considering enhanced Southern Ocean salinity stratification and iron fertilization from glaciogenic dust during glacial periods improves model-data agreement of glacial deep water with isotopically light carbon, low oxygen, and old radiocarbon ages. The glacial simulation shows a 77-ppm reduction of atmospheric p CO 2 , which closely matches the paleo record. The Southern Ocean salinity stratification and the iron fertilization from glaciogenic dust amplified the carbonate sedimentary feedback, which caused most of the increased carbon storage in the deep ocean and played an important role in p CO 2 reduction.

This blocks tumor cell movements, creates metabolic and oxidative stress, and inhibits primary and metastatic tumor growth. Uniformly down-regulated in cancer patients, Parkin tumor suppression requires its E3 ligase function, is reversed by antioxidants, and is independent of mitophagy.

WCs and CCs detect temperature changes using overlapping combinations of ionotropic receptors: Ir68a, Ir93a, and Ir25a for WCs and Ir21a, Ir93a, and Ir25a for CCs. WCs mediate avoidance to warming while cross-inhibiting avoidance to cooling, and CCs mediate avoidance to cooling while cross-inhibiting avoidance to warming. Ambient temperature–dependent regulation of the strength of WC- and CC-mediated cross-inhibition keeps larvae near their homeostatic set point.

During successive inbreeding among inbred lines, thousands of genomic regions across TCP-binding sites (TBS) are hypermethylated through the H3K9me2-mediated pathway. These hypermethylated regions are accompanied by decreased chromatin accessibility, increased levels of the repressive histone marks H3K27me2 and H3K27me3, and reduced binding affinity of maize TCP-proteins to TBS. Consequently, hundreds of TCP-target genes involved in mitochondrion, chloroplast, and ribosome functions are down-regulated, leading to reduced growth vigor. Conversely, random mating can reverse corresponding hypermethylation sites and TCP-target gene expression, restoring growth vigor. These results support a unique role of reversible epigenetic modifications in inbreeding depression.},

  abstract     = {The interaction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with air/water interfaces plays a crucial role in their overall stability in solution. We aim to understand this behavior using pendant bubble measurements to track the dynamic tension reduction and x-ray reflectivity to obtain the electron density profiles (EDPs) at the surface. Native immunoglobulin G mAb is a rigid molecule with a flat, “Y” shape, and simulated EDPs are obtained by rotating a homology construct at the surface. Comparing simulations with experimental EDPs, we obtain surface orientation probability maps showing mAbs transition from flat-on Y-shape configurations to side-on or end-on configurations with increasing concentration. The modeling also shows the presence of β sheets at the surface. Overall, the experiments and the homology modeling elucidate the orientational phase space during different stages of adsorption of mAbs at the air/water interface. These finding will help define new strategies for the manufacture and storage of antibody-based therapeutics.},

However, production of recombinant cytosine base editors (CBEs) or adenine base editors (ABEs) with ample yield and high purity in bacterial systems is challenging. Here, we obtained highly purified CBE/ABE proteins from a human cell expression system and showed that CBE/ABE RNPs exhibited different editing patterns (i.e., less conversion ratio of multiple bases to single base) compared to plasmid-encoded CBE/ABE, mainly because of the limited life span of RNPs in cells. Furthermore, we found that off-target effects in both DNA and RNA were greatly reduced for ABE RNPs compared to plasmid-encoded ABE. We ultimately applied NG PAM–targetable ABE RNPs to in vivo gene correction in retinal degeneration 12 ( rd12 ) model mice.},

Although global surveys are starting to reveal ecological drivers underlying planktonic community structure and predicted climate change responses, it is unclear how community-scale species interactions will be affected by climate change. Here, we leveraged Tara Oceans sampling to infer a global ocean cross-domain plankton co-occurrence network—the community interactome—and used niche modeling to assess its vulnerabilities to environmental change. Globally, this revealed a plankton interactome self-organized latitudinally into marine biomes (Trades, Westerlies, Polar) and more connected poleward. Integrated niche modeling revealed biome-specific community interactome responses to environmental change and forecasted the most affected lineages for each community. These results provide baseline approaches to assess community structure and organismal interactions under climate scenarios while identifying plausible plankton bioindicators for ocean monitoring of climate change.},

We sought to identify the role of microglial CSF1R haploinsufficiency in mediating pathogenesis. Using an inducible Cx3cr1 CreERT2/+ - Csf1r +/fl system, we found that postdevelopmental, microglia-specific Csf1r haploinsufficiency resulted in reduced expression of homeostatic microglial markers. This was associated with loss of presynaptic surrogates and the extracellular matrix (ECM) structure perineuronal nets. Similar phenotypes were observed in constitutive global Csf1r haploinsufficient mice and could be reversed/prevented by microglia elimination in adulthood. As microglial elimination is unlikely to be clinically feasible for extended durations, we treated adult CSF1R +/− mice at different disease stages with a microglia-modulating dose of the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622, which prevented microglial dyshomeostasis along with synaptic- and ECM-related deficits.

However, such hydrogels must cure quickly under water, bind strongly and permanently to the surrounding tissue, and maintain sufficient mechanical strength to withstand the hydraulic pressure of arthroscopic irrigation (~10 kilopascal). To address these challenges, we report a versatile hybrid photocrosslinkable (HPC) hydrogel fabricated though a combination of photoinitiated radical polymerization and photoinduced imine cross-linking. The ultrafast gelation, high mechanical strength, and strong adhesion to native tissue enable the direct use of these hydrogels in irrigated arthroscopic treatments. We demonstrate, through in vivo articular cartilage defect repair in the weight-bearing regions of swine models, that the HPC hydrogel can serve as an arthroscopic autologous chondrocyte implantation scaffold for long-term cartilage regeneration, integration, and reconstruction of articular function.},

The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) receives inputs from both visual cortex and subcortical regions required for spatial memory and projects to motor planning regions. However, it is not known whether RSC is important for associating familiar environmental contexts with specific motor actions. We test this possibility by developing a task in which motor trajectories are chosen based on the context. We find that mice exhibit differential predecision activity in RSC and that optogenetic suppression of RSC activity impairs task performance. Individual RSC neurons encode a range of task variables, often multiplexed with distinct temporal profiles. However, the responses are spatiotemporally organized, with task variables represented along a posterior-to-anterior gradient along RSC during the behavioral performance, consistent with histological characterization. These results reveal an anatomically organized retrosplenial cortical circuit for associating environmental contexts with appropriate motor outputs.},

Here, we performed integrative analyses combining CNAs with the transcriptomic data to reveal the cis- and trans-effects of CNAs in HCC. We identified recurrent genomic gains of chromosome 8q, which exhibit strong trans-effects and are broadly associated with ribosome biogenesis activity. Furthermore, 8q gain–driven overexpression of ribosome biogenesis regulator ( RRS1 ) promotes growth of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, RRS1 attenuates ribosomal stress through retaining RPL11 in the nucleolus, which, in turn, potentiates MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53. Clinically, higher RRS1 expression levels predict poor clinical outcomes for patients with HCC, especially in those with intact p53 . Our findings established that the chromosome 8q oncogene RRS1 promotes HCC development through attenuating the RPL11-MDM2-p53 pathway and provided new potential targets for treatment of this malignancy.},

Using remotely sensed big data, we investigated how lockdowns and traffic restrictions affected China’s spring vegetation in 2020. Our analyses show that travel decreased by 58\% in the first 18 days following implementation of the restrictions across China. Subsequently, atmospheric optical clarity increased and radiation levels on the vegetation canopy were augmented. Furthermore, the spring of 2020 arrived 8.4 days earlier and vegetation 17.45\% greener compared to 2015–2019. Reduced human activity resulting from COVID-19 restrictions contributed to a brighter, earlier, and greener 2020 spring season in China.

In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of calcium homeostasis modulator family protein 2 (Calhm2) is increased in an AD mouse model. In 5×FAD mice carrying five familial AD gene mutations, both conventional knockout of Calhm2 and conditional microglial knockout of Calhm2 significantly reduced amyloid β deposition, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairments. Mechanistically, knockout of Calhm2 inhibited microglial proinflammatory activity but increased phagocytic activity, leading to restoration of the balance between inflammation and phagocytosis. In addition, knockout of Calhm2 reduced acute LPS-induced neuroinflammation. These results highlight an important role for Calhm2 in microglial activation and provide a potential therapeutic target for diseases related to microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.},

This interaction is dissociated after DNA damage. Lamin B1 overexpression impedes 53BP1 recruitment to DNA damage sites and leads to a persistence of DNA damage, a defect in nonhomologous end joining and an increased sensitivity to DSBs. The identification of interactions domains between lamin B1 and 53BP1 allows us to demonstrate that the defect of 53BP1 recruitment and the DSB persistence upon lamin B1 overexpression are due to sequestration of 53BP1 by lamin B1.

  abstract     = {Organoids formed from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) could be a limitless source of functional tissue for transplantations in many organs. Unfortunately, fine-tuning differentiation protocols to form large quantities of hiPSC organoids in a controlled, scalable, and reproducible manner is quite difficult and often takes a very long time. Recently, we introduced a new approach of rapid organoid formation from dissociated hiPSCs and endothelial cells using microfabricated cell-repellent microwell arrays. This approach, when combined with real-time label-free Raman spectroscopy of biochemical composition changes and confocal light scattering spectroscopic microscopy of chromatin transition, allows for monitoring live differentiating organoids without the need to sacrifice a sample, substantially shortening the time of protocol fine-tuning. We used this approach to both culture and monitor homogeneous liver organoids that have the main functional features of the human liver and which could be used for cell transplantation liver therapy in humans.},

We show that the quanton source purity μ s is tightly bounded by the entanglement E between the quantons and the remaining degrees of freedom by the relation μ s = 1 − E 2 , which is experimentally confirmed.

Therefore, we recapitulated the tumor heterogenic microenvironment by creating fibrin glioblastoma bioink consisting of patient-derived glioblastoma cells, astrocytes, and microglia. In addition, perfusable blood vessels were created using a sacrificial bioink coated with brain pericytes and endothelial cells. We observed similar growth curves, drug response, and genetic signature of glioblastoma cells grown in our 3D-bioink platform and in orthotopic cancer mouse models as opposed to 2D culture on rigid plastic plates.

The activity of Alkbh5 comprises two coupled reactions. The first reaction involves decarboxylation of α-ketoglutarate (αKG) and formation of a Fe 4+ ═O species. This oxyferryl intermediate oxidizes the m 6 A to reestablish the canonical base. Despite coupling between the two reactions being required for the correct Alkbh5 functioning, the mechanisms linking dioxygen activation to m 6 A binding are not fully understood. Here, we use solution NMR to investigate the structure and dynamics of apo and holo Alkbh5. We show that binding of m 6 A to Alkbh5 induces a metal-centered rearrangement of αKG that increases the exposed area of the metal, making it available for binding O 2 . Our study reveals the molecular mechanisms underlying activation of Alkbh5, therefore opening new perspectives for the design of novel strategies to control gene expression and cancer progression.},

However, it remains challenging to precisely control the fluid interface because of its fluidity and instability. Here, we proposed a magnetic-actuated “capillary container” to realize three-dimensional (3D) fluid interface creation and programmable dynamic manipulation. By wettability modification, 3D fluid interfaces with predesigned sizes and geometries can be constructed in air, water, and oils. Multiple motion modes were realized by adjusting the container’s structure and magnetic field. Besides, we demonstrated its feasibility in various fluids by performing selective fluid collection and chemical reaction manipulations. The container can also be encapsulated with an interfacial gelation reaction. Using this process, diverse free-standing 3D membranes were produced, and the dynamic release of riboflavin (vitamin B 2 ) was studied. This versatile capillary container will provide a promising platform for open microfluidics, interfacial chemistry, and biomedical engineering.},

Restoring the transcriptional dysregulation without affecting other AR critical functions holds great promise for the treatment of SBMA and other AR-related conditions; however, how this targeted approach can be achieved and translated into a clinical application remains to be understood. Here, we characterized the role of AR isoform 2, a naturally occurring variant encoding a truncated AR lacking the polyQ-harboring domain, as a regulatory switch of AR genomic functions in androgen-responsive tissues. Delivery of this isoform using a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector type 9 resulted in amelioration of the disease phenotype in SBMA mice by restoring polyQ AR–dysregulated transcriptional activity.},

In microfluidics, acoustic tweezers typically use an array of sources to create standing wave patterns that can trap and move objects in ways constrained by the limited complexity of the acoustic wave field. Here, we demonstrate spatially complex particle trapping and manipulation inside a boundary-free chamber using a single pair of sources and an engineered structure outside the chamber that we call a shadow waveguide. The shadow waveguide creates a tightly confined, spatially complex acoustic field inside the chamber without requiring any interior structure that would interfere with net flow or transport. Altering the input signals to the two sources creates trapped particle motion along an arbitrary path defined by the shadow waveguide. Particle trapping, particle manipulation and transport, and Thouless pumping are experimentally demonstrated.},

Here, we report results for a precipitation-strengthening strategy, by tuning composition to design a CoNiV-based face-centered cubic/B2 duplex HEA. This alloy sustains ultrahigh gigapascal-level tensile yield strengths and excellent ductility from cryogenic to elevated temperatures. The highest specific yield strength (~150.2 MPa·cm 3 /g) among reported ductile HEAs is obtained. The ability of the alloy presented here to sustain this excellent strength-ductility synergy over a wide temperature range is aided by multiple deformation mechanisms i.e., twins, stacking faults, dynamic strain aging, and dynamic recrystallization. Our results open the avenue for designing precipitation-strengthened lightweight HEAs with advanced strength-ductility combinations over a wide service temperature range.},

Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of human NPC1L1 (hNPC1L1) bound to either cholesterol or a lipid resembling VE. These findings, together with functional assays, reveal that the same intramolecular channel in hNPC1L1 mediates transport of VE and cholesterol. hNPC1L1 exists primarily as a homodimer; dimerization is mediated by aromatic residues within a region of transmembrane helix 2 that exhibits a horizonal orientation in the membrane. Mutation of tryptophan-347 lies in this region disrupts dimerization and the resultant monomeric NPC1L1 exhibits reduced efficiency of cholesterol uptake. These findings identify the oligomeric state of hNPC1L1 as a target for therapies that inhibit uptake of dietary cholesterol and reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease.},

Here, we show that they are localized in the adult synapses and are essential for their maintenance. Synapse loss at early stages of Alzheimer’s disease is thought to be induced by β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology. We found that oligomeric Aβ binds to Celsr3 and assists Vangl2 in disassembling synapses. Moreover, a Wnt receptor and regulator of PCP signaling, Ryk, is also required for Aβ-induced synapse loss. In the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, Ryk conditional knockout or a function-blocking monoclonal Ryk antibody protected synapses and preserved cognitive function. We propose that tipping of the fine balance of Wnt/PCP signaling components in glutamatergic synapses may cause synapse degeneration in neurodegenerative disorders with Aβ pathology.},

X-ray free-electron laser studies including time-resolved crystallography and emission spectroscopy reveal how reaction of IPNS:Fe(II):ACV with dioxygen to yield an Fe(III) superoxide causes differences in active site volume and unexpected conformational changes that propagate to structurally remote regions. Combined with solution studies, the results reveal the importance of protein dynamics in regulating intermediate conformations during conversion of ACV to IPN. The results have implications for catalysis by multiple IPNS-related oxygenases, including those involved in the human hypoxic response, and highlight the power of serial femtosecond crystallography to provide insight into long-range enzyme dynamics during reactions presently impossible for nonprotein catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Alcohol intake remains controlled in a majority of users but becomes “compulsive, ” i.e., continues despite adverse consequences, in a minority who develop alcohol addiction. Here, using a footshock-punished alcohol self-administration procedure, we screened a large population of outbred rats to identify those showing compulsivity operationalized as punishment-resistant self-administration. Using unsupervised clustering, we found that this behavior emerged as a stable trait in a subpopulation of rats and was associated with activity of a brain network that included central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Activity of PKCδ + inhibitory neurons in the lateral subdivision of CeA (CeL) accounted for ~75\% of variance in punishment-resistant alcohol taking. Activity-dependent tagging, followed by chemogenetic inhibition of neurons activated during punishment-resistant self-administration, suppressed alcohol taking, as did a virally mediated shRNA knockdown of PKCδ in CeA. These findings identify a previously unknown mechanism for a core element of alcohol addiction and point to a novel candidate therapeutic target.},

However, weak physical adhesion at intrinsic heterojunctions has been a challenge in foldable electronics. This paper reports the completely foldable polymer thin-film transistors (PTFTs) and logic gate arrays. Homojunction-based PTFTs were fabricated by selectively doping p -type diketopyrrolopyrrole-based semiconducting polymer films with FeCl 3 to form source/drain electrodes. The doping process caused a gradual work function change with depth, which promoted charge injection to semiconducting regions and provided a low contact resistance. In addition, the interfacial adhesion in the PTFTs was improved by interfacial cross-linking between adjacent component layers. The electrical performance of the resulting PTFTs was maintained without noticeable degradation even after extreme folding, suggesting that the proposed fabrication strategy can further be applied to various semiconducting polymers for the realization of foldable electronics.},

However, agricultural systems are usually evaluated on their productivity and economic performance, and a systematic and quantitative assessment of the multifunctionality of agroecosystems including environmental services is missing. Using a long-term farming system experiment, we evaluated and compared the agronomic, economic, and ecological performance of the most widespread arable cropping systems in Europe: organic, conservation, and conventional agriculture. We analyzed 43 agroecosystem properties and determined overall agroecosystem multifunctionality. We show that organic and conservation agriculture promoted ecosystem multifunctionality, especially by enhancing regulating and supporting services, including biodiversity preservation, soil and water quality, and climate mitigation. In contrast, conventional cropping showed reduced multifunctionality but delivered highest yield. Organic production resulted in higher economic performance, thanks to higher product prices and additional support payments. Our results demonstrate that different cropping systems provide opposing services, enforcing the productivity–environmental protection dilemma for agroecosystem functioning.},

However, the feasibility and scale of genetic improvements remain untested despite ongoing population declines from recurrent thermal stress events. Here, we show that corals from the hottest reefs in the world transfer sufficient heat tolerance to a naïve population sufficient to withstand end-of-century warming projections. Heat survival increased up to 84\% when naïve mothers were selectively bred with fathers from the hottest reefs because of strong heritable genetic effects. We identified genomic loci associated with tolerance variation that were enriched for heat shock proteins, oxidative stress, and immune functions. Unexpectedly, several coral families exhibited survival rates and genomic associations deviating from origin predictions, including a few naïve purebreds with exceptionally high heat tolerance. Our findings highlight previously uncharacterized enhanced and intrinsic potential of coral populations to adapt to climate warming.},

Protein secretion across these barriers depends on a specialized protein secretion system, but none has been reported. We show that Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv3705c and its homologous MSMEG_6251 in Mycobacterium smegmatis are tube-forming proteins in the mycobacterial envelope (TiME). Crystallographic and cryo-EM structures of these two proteins show that both proteins form rotationally symmetric rings. Two layers of TiME rings pack together in a tail-to-tail manner into a ring-shaped complex, which, in turn, stacks together to form tubes. M. smegmatis TiME was detected mainly in the cell wall and capsule. Knocking out the TiME gene markedly decreased the amount of secreted protein in the M. smegmatis culture medium, and expression of this gene in knocked-out strain partially restored the level of secreted protein. Our structure and functional data thus suggest that TiME forms a protein transport tube across the mycobacterial outer envelope.},

The zebrafish mutants for scpp5 , which is lost in all syngnathids, were found to lack or have deformed pharyngeal teeth, supporting the hypothesis that the loss of scpp5 has contributed to the loss of teeth in syngnathids.

We found that ICI treatment was not associated with severe COVID-19 and did not alter the induction of inflammatory and type I interferon responses. In-depth phenotyping demonstrated expansion of CD8 effector memory T cells, enhanced T cell activation, and impaired plasmablast induction in ICI-treated COVID-19 patients. The evaluation of specific adaptive immunity in convalescent patients showed higher spike (S), nucleoprotein (N), and membrane (M) antigen-specific T cell responses and similar induction of spike-specific antibody responses.

The operation of TMD/Gr devices relies on interfacial charge/energy transfer processes, which remains unclear and challenging to unravel. Fortunately, the coupled spin and valley index in TMDs adds a new degree of freedom to the charges and, thus, another dimension to spectroscopy. Here, by helicity-resolved ultrafast spectroscopy, we find that photoexcitation in TMDs transfers to graphene by asynchronous charge transfer, with one type of charge transferring in the order of femtoseconds and the other in picoseconds. The rate correlates well with energy offset between TMD and graphene, regardless of compositions and charge species. Spin-polarized hole injection or long-lived polarized hole can be achieved with deliberately designed heterostructures. This study shows helicity-resolved ultrafast spectroscopy as a powerful and facile approach to reveal the fundamental and complex charge/spin dynamics in TMD-based heterostructures, paving the way toward valleytronic and optoelectronic applications.},

However, because of the substantial resource requirement, its experimental implementation remains challenging. Here, we develop a resonant analysis algorithm with minimal resource for ancillary qubits, in which only one frequency-scanning probe qubit is required to extract the principal components. In the experiment, we demonstrate the distillation of the first principal component of a 4 × 4 density matrix, with an efficiency of 86.0\% and a fidelity of 0.90.

  abstract     = {A three-dimensional microengineered human coronary artery–on–a–chip was developed for investigation of the mechanism by which low and oscillatory shear stress (OSS) induces pro-atherogenic changes. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that OSS induced distinct changes in endothelial cells (ECs) including pro-inflammatory endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). OSS promoted pro-inflammatory EndMT through the Notch1/p38 MAPK–NF-κB signaling axis. Moreover, OSS-induced EC phenotypic changes resulted in proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein up-regulation in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) through the RANTES-mediated paracrine mechanism. IL-37 suppressed OSS-induced pro-inflammatory EndMT and thereby abrogated SMC proliferation and ECM protein remodeling. Overall, this study provides insights into endothelial heterogeneity under atheroprone shear stress and identifies the mechanistic role of a novel EC subtype in promoting adverse vascular remodeling. Further, this study demonstrates that anti-inflammatory approach is capable of mitigating vascular pathobiology evoked by atheroprone shear stress.},

  abstract     = {Intensive building energy efficiency improvements can reduce emissions from energy use, improving outdoor air quality and human health, but may also affect ventilation and indoor air quality. This study examines the effects of highly ambitious, yet feasible, building energy efficiency upgrades in the United States. Our energy efficiency scenarios, derived from the literature, lead to a 6 to 11\% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and 18 to 25\% reductions in particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) emissions in 2050. These reductions are complementary with a carbon pricing policy on electricity. However, our results also point to the importance of mitigating indoor PM 2.5 emissions, improving PM 2.5 filtration, and evaluating ventilation-related policies. Even with no further ventilation improvements, we estimate that intensive energy efficiency scenarios could prevent 1800 to 3600 premature deaths per year across the United States in 2050. With further investments in indoor air quality, this can rise to 2900 to 5100.},

  abstract     = {Desiccation-tolerant cyanobacteria can survive frequent hydration/dehydration cycles likely affecting inorganic carbon (Ci) levels. It was recently shown that red/far-red light serves as signal-preparing cells toward dehydration. Here, the effects of desiccation on Ci assimilation by Leptolyngbya ohadii isolated from Israel’s Negev desert were investigated. Metabolomic investigations indicated a decline in ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase carboxylation activity, and this was accelerated by far-red light. Far-red light negatively affected the Ci affinity of L. ohadii during desiccation and in liquid cultures. Similar effects were evident in the non–desiccation-tolerant cyanobacterium Synechocystis . The Synechocystis Δ cph1 mutant lacking the major phytochrome exhibited reduced photosynthetic Ci affinity when exposed to far-red light, whereas the mutant Δ sbtB lacking a Ci uptake inhibitory protein lost the far-red light inhibition. Collectively, these results suggest that red/far-red light perception likely via phytochromes regulates Ci uptake by cyanobacteria and that this mechanism contributes to desiccation tolerance in strains such as L. ohadii .},

Provisioning is influenced by the parental environment, but the molecular pathways that transmit environmental cues between generations are not well understood. Here, we show that, in Caenorhabditis elegans , social cues modulate maternal provisioning to regulate gene silencing in offspring. Intergenerational signal transmission depends on a pheromone-sensing neuron and neuronal FMRFamide (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe)–like peptides. Parental FMRFamide-like peptide signaling dampens oxidative stress resistance and promotes the deposition of mRNAs for translational components in progeny, which, in turn, reduces gene silencing. This study identifies a previously unknown pathway for intergenerational communication that links neuronal responses to maternal provisioning. We suggest that loss of social cues in the parental environment represents an adverse environment that stimulates stress responses across generations.},

The basis for this difference is unclear. We find that mRNA and protein expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell entry receptor for the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19, increases with advancing age in distal lung epithelial cells. However, in humans, ACE2 expression exhibits high levels of intra- and interindividual heterogeneity. Further, cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience endoplasmic reticulum stress, triggering an unfolded protein response and caspase-mediated apoptosis, a natural host defense system that halts virion production. Apoptosis of infected cells can be selectively induced by treatment with apoptosis-modulating BH3 mimetic drugs. Notably, epithelial cells within young lungs and airways are more primed to undergo apoptosis than those in adults, which may naturally hinder virion production and support milder COVID-19 severity.},

The use of special dielectric liquid enhances fluid flow capabilities, improving the actuation performance of the SEFAs. SEFAs are easily manufactured by using widely available materials and common fabrication techniques, and display excellent comprehensive performances in portability, controllability, rapid response, versatility, safety, and actuation. An artificial muscle stretching a joint and a soft bionic ray swimming in a tank demonstrate their effective performance. Hence, SEFAs offer a platform for developing soft actuators with potential applications in wearable assistant devices and soft robots.},

However, it remains unclear whether these results can be generalized to fear learning in humans. We addressed this question using intracranial electroencephalography recordings in 13 patients with epilepsy during a fear conditioning paradigm. We observed increased power and inter-regional synchronization of amygdala and mPFC in theta (4 to 8 hertz) oscillations for conditioned stimulus (CS+) versus CS−. Analysis of information flow revealed that the dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) led amygdala activity in theta oscillations. Last, a computational model showed that trial-by-trial changes in amygdala theta oscillations predicted the model-based associability (i.e., learning rate). This study provides compelling evidence that theta oscillations within and between amygdala, ventral mPFC, and dmPFC constitute a general mechanism of fear learning across species.},

  abstract     = {Recent evidence suggests that nano-organization of proteins within synapses may control the strength of communication between neurons in the brain. The unique subsynaptic distribution of glutamate receptors, which cluster in nanoalignment with presynaptic sites of glutamate release, supports this hypothesis. However, testing it has been difficult because mechanisms controlling subsynaptic organization remain unknown. Reasoning that transcellular interactions could position AMPA receptors (AMPARs), we targeted a key transsynaptic adhesion molecule implicated in controlling AMPAR number, LRRTM2, using engineered, rapid proteolysis. Severing the LRRTM2 extracellular domain led quickly to nanoscale declustering of AMPARs away from release sites, not prompting their escape from synapses until much later. This rapid remodeling of AMPAR position produced significant deficits in evoked, but not spontaneous, postsynaptic receptor activation. These results dissociate receptor numbers from their nanopositioning in determination of synaptic function and support the novel concept that adhesion molecules acutely position receptors to dynamically control synaptic strength.},

Here, we show how to find partition function zeros on noisy intermediate-scale trapped-ion quantum computers in a scalable manner, using the XXZ spin chain model as a prototype, and observe their transition from XY-like behavior to Ising-like behavior as a function of the anisotropy. While quantum computers cannot yet scale to the thermodynamic limit, our work provides a pathway to do so as hardware improves, allowing the future calculation of critical phenomena for systems beyond classical computing limits.},

Here, we demonstrated a quantitative adhesion footprint assay combining DNA-based nonequilibrium force probes and modeling to measure the molecular force involved in fast rolling adhesion. We were able to directly profile the ensemble molecular force distribution in our system during rolling adhesion with a dynamic range between 0 and 18 pN. Our results showed that the shear stress driving bead rolling motility directly controls the molecular tension on the probe-conjugated adhesion complex. Furthermore, the shear stress can steer the dissociation bias of components within the molecular force probe complex, favoring either DNA probe dissociation or receptor-ligand dissociation.},

We extract and summarize the variation in language (grammar, phonology, lexicon), music (song structure, performance style), and genomes (genome-wide SNPs) and test for correlations. We find that grammatical structure correlates with population history (genetic history). Recent contact and shared descent fail to explain the signal, suggesting relationships that arose before the formation of current families.

This uses parallel Bayesian optimization to selectively acquire energy and property data, generating the same levels of insight at a fraction of the computational cost. We use this approach to obtain a two orders of magnitude speedup on an ESF study that focused on the discovery of molecular crystals for methane capture, saving more than 500, 000 central processing unit hours from the original protocol. By accelerating the acquisition of insight from ESF maps, we pave the way for the use of these maps in automated ultrahigh-throughput screening pipelines by greatly reducing the opportunity risk associated with the choice of system to calculate.},

  abstract     = {The centrality of the Krebs cycle in metabolism has long been interpreted as evidence of its antiquity, and consequently, questions regarding its provenance, and whether it initially functioned as a cycle or not, have received much attention. The present report shows that prebiotic oxidation of α-hydroxy carboxylates can be achieved by UV photolysis of a simple geochemical species (HS − ), which leads to α-oxo carboxylates that feature in the Krebs cycle and glyoxylate shunt. Further reaction of these products leads to almost all intermediates of the Krebs cycle proper, succinate semialdehyde bypass, and glyoxylate shunt. Fumarate, the missing Krebs cycle component, and the required α-hydroxy carboxylates can be provided by a highly related hydrogen cyanide chemistry, which also provides precursors for amino acids, nucleotides, and phospholipids.},

The properties of these devices are wide-ranging, but they are restricted by nature of the underlying thick STO substrate. Here, single-crystal freestanding membranes based on LAO/STO heterostructures were fabricated, which can be directly integrated with other materials via van der Waals stacking. The key properties of LAO/STO are preserved when LAO/STO membranes are formed. Conductive atomic force microscope lithography is shown to successfully create reversible patterns of nanoscale conducting regions, which survive to millikelvin temperatures.

Even more challenging is that the specific location of targets in the porous environment usually is not known and cannot be determined from the outside. Here, we demonstrate a two-step strategy to deliver suspended colloids to targets that are “hidden” within closed porous media. The first step serves to automatically convert any hidden targets into soluto-inertial “beacons, ” capable of sustaining long-lived solute outfluxes. The second step introduces the deliverable objects, which are designed to autonomously migrate against the solute fluxes emitted by the targets, thereby following chemical trails that lead to the target. Experimental and theoretical demonstrations of the strategy lay out the design elements required for the solute and the deliverable objects, suggesting routes to delivering colloidal objects to hidden targets in various environments and technologies.},

Formation of internalized vesicles from the flat plasma membrane is accompanied by maturation of cytoplasmic clathrin coats. How clathrin coats mature and the mechanistic role of clathrin coats are still largely unknown. Maturation models proposed clathrin coats to mature at constant radius or constant area, driven by molecular actions or elastic energy. Here, combining high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) imaging, HS-AFM nanodissection, and elasticity theory, we show that clathrin lattices deviating from the intrinsic curvature of clathrin form elastically loaded assemblies. Upon nanodissection of the clathrin network, the stored elastic energy in these lattices drives lattice relaxation to accommodate an ideal area-curvature ratio toward the formation of closed clathrin-coated vesicles. Our work supports that the release of elastic energy stored in curvature-frustrated clathrin lattices could play a major role in CME.},

Advancing from current few-qubit devices to silicon quantum processors with upward of a million qubits, as required for fault-tolerant operation, presents several unique challenges, one of the most demanding being the ability to deliver microwave signals for large-scale qubit control. Here, we demonstrate a potential solution to this problem by using a three-dimensional dielectric resonator to broadcast a global microwave signal across a quantum nanoelectronic circuit. Critically, this technique uses only a single microwave source and is capable of delivering control signals to millions of qubits simultaneously. We show that the global field can be used to perform spin resonance of single electrons confined in a silicon double quantum dot device, establishing the feasibility of this approach for scalable spin qubit control.},

In many plant species, a single isolated mesophyll protoplast may regenerate into an entire plant, which is widely used in gene transformation. Here, we identified two transcription factors whose ectopic activation promotes protoplast regeneration. Furthermore, we found that their expression was induced by protoplast isolation but at a very low frequency. Using live imaging and single-cell transcriptomics, we show that isolating protoplasts induces enhanced expression variation at the genome level. Isolating protoplasts also leads to genome-wide increases in chromatin accessibility, which promotes stochastic activation of gene expression and enhances protoplast regeneration. We propose that transcriptome chaos with increased expression variability among cells creates a cellular-level evolutionary driver selecting for regenerating cells.},

A remarkable variant has been noticed in simulations where the period of particle motions is a multiple of the period of driving, but the reasons for this behavior have remained unclear. Motivated by mesoscopic features of displacement fields in experiments on jammed solids, we propose and analyze a simple model of interacting soft spots—locations where particles rearrange under stress and that resemble two-level systems with hysteresis. We show that multiperiodic behavior can arise among just three or more soft spots that interact with each other, but in all cases it requires frustrated interactions, illuminating this otherwise elusive type of interaction. We suggest directions for seeking this signature of frustration in experiments and for achieving it in designed systems.},

We show that adding interactions between rearranging clusters overcomes these deficiencies. In addition, interactions allow simultaneous encoding of multiple memories, which would not have been possible otherwise. These memories are different in an essential way from those found in other systems, such as multiple transient memories observed in sheared suspensions, and contain information about the strength of the interactions.},

We show that this asymmetry is quantitatively consistent with a general mechanism of self-amplification that can be modeled using stochastic multiplicative noise. A numerical climate–carbon cycle model in which the amplitude of random biogeochemical fluctuations increases at higher temperatures reproduces the data well and can further explain the apparent pacing of past extreme warming events by changes in orbital parameters. Our results also suggest that, as anthropogenic warming continues, Earth’s climate may become more susceptible to extreme warming events on time scales of tens of thousands of years.},

The detection limit of these methods has been confined to the picomolar (10 −12 M) range, several orders of magnitude higher than the circulating concentrations of biomarker proteins present in many diseases.

We track the spatiotemporal dynamics of these angularly decelerating plasmon pulse train within the cavities for over 300 femtoseconds using time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy, showing that the angular momentum grows by multiples of the chiral order of the cavity.

  abstract     = {Beneficial microorganisms for corals (BMCs) ameliorate environmental stress, but whether they can prevent mortality and the underlying host response mechanisms remains elusive. Here, we conducted omics analyses on the coral Mussismilia hispida exposed to bleaching conditions in a long-term mesocosm experiment and inoculated with a selected BMC consortium or a saline solution placebo. All corals were affected by heat stress, but the observed “post-heat stress disorder” was mitigated by BMCs, signified by patterns of dimethylsulfoniopropionate degradation, lipid maintenance, and coral host transcriptional reprogramming of cellular restructuration, repair, stress protection, and immune genes, concomitant with a 40\% survival rate increase and stable photosynthetic performance by the endosymbiotic algae. This study provides insights into the responses that underlie probiotic host manipulation. We demonstrate that BMCs trigger a dynamic microbiome restructuring process that instigates genetic and metabolic alterations in the coral host that eventually mitigate coral bleaching and mortality.},

Quantum tunneling can extend stochastic resonance to the quantum realm. We demonstrate quantum stochastic resonance for magnetic transitions in atoms by inelastic electron tunneling with a scanning tunneling microscope. Stochastic resonance is shown deep in the quantum regime, where spin-state fluctuations are driven by tunneling of the magnetization, and in a semiclassical crossover region, where thermally excited electrons drive transitions between ground and excited states. Inducing synchronization by periodically modulating transition rates provides a general mechanism to determine real-time spin dynamics ranging from milliseconds to picoseconds.},

  abstract     = {Ceramic materials provide outstanding chemical and structural stability at high temperatures and in hostile environments but are susceptible to catastrophic fracture that severely limits their applicability. Traditional approaches to partially overcome this limitation rely on activating toughening mechanisms during crack growth to postpone fracture. Here, we demonstrate a more potent toughening mechanism that involves an intriguing possibility of healing the cracks as they form, even at room temperature, in an atomically layered ternary carbide. Crystals of this class of ceramic materials readily fracture along weakly bonded crystallographic planes. However, the onset of an abstruse mode of deformation, referred to as kinking in these materials, induces large crystallographic rotations and plastic deformation that physically heal the cracks. This implies that the toughness of numerous other layered ceramic materials, whose broader applications have been limited by their susceptibility to catastrophic fracture, can also be enhanced by microstructural engineering to promote kinking and crack-healing.},

For many human pathogens, the burden of disease depends on age and previous exposure. Understanding the intersection between human population demography and transmission dynamics is therefore critical. Here, we develop a realistic age-structured mathematical model that integrates demography, social mixing, and immunity to establish a plausible range for future age incidence and mortality. With respect to COVID-19, we identify a plausible transition in the age structure of risks once the disease reaches seasonal endemism across a range of immunity durations and relative severity of primary versus subsequent reinfections. We train the model using diverse real-world demographies and age-structured mixing to bound expectations for changing age incidence and disease burden. The mathematical framework is flexible and can help tailor mitigation strategies in countries worldwide with varying demographies and social mixing patterns.},

While primary hTSCs have been derived from embryos/early placenta, and transdifferentiated hTSCs from naïve human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), the generation of hTSCs from primed PSCs is problematic. We report the successful generation of TSCs from primed hPSCs and show that BMP4 substantially enhances this process. TSCs derived from primed hPSCs are similar to blastocyst-derived hTSCs in terms of morphology, proliferation, differentiation potential, and gene expression. We define the chromatin accessibility dynamics and histone modifications (H3K4me3/H3K27me3) that specify hPSC-derived TSCs. Consistent with low density of H3K27me3 in primed hPSC-derived hTSCs, we show that knockout of H3K27 methyltransferases (EZH1/2) increases the efficiency of hTSC derivation from primed hPSCs. Efficient derivation of hTSCs from primed hPSCs provides a simple and powerful model to understand human trophoblast development, including the pathogenesis of trophoblast-related disorders, by generating disease-specific hTSCs.},

Although binding and activation of PARP1 by DNA damage sites has been extensively studied, little is known about how PARP1 binds to long stretches of undamaged DNA and how it could shape chromatin architecture. Here, using single-molecule techniques, we show that PARP1 binds and condenses undamaged, kilobase-length DNA subject to sub-piconewton mechanical forces. Stepwise decondensation at high force and DNA braiding experiments show that the condensation activity is due to the stabilization of DNA loops by PARP1. PARP inhibitors do not affect the level of condensation of undamaged DNA but act to block condensation reversal for damaged DNA in the presence of NAD + . Our findings suggest a mechanism for PARP1 in the organization of chromatin structure.},

The results provide stratigraphically consistent sequences of radiocarbon dates in millimeter-scale laminated accretions, demonstrating their reliability for dating rock art, particularly symbolic markings commonly engraved into these relatively soft deposits. The age sequences are also consistent with correlations between distinctive patterns in the layer sequences visible in shelters up to 90 km apart in the Kimberley region of northwestern Australia, suggesting their synchronized formation is not entirely shelter specific but broadly controlled by variations in regional environmental conditions. Consequently, these accretions also offer potential as paleoenvironmental archives, with radiocarbon dating of layers in nine accretions indicating four, approximately synchronous growth intervals covering the past 43 ka.},

Here, we use coherent diffractive imaging spectroscopy (CDIS) to acquire quantitative hyperspectral images of the prototypical quantum material vanadium oxide across the vanadium L 2, 3 and oxygen K x-ray absorption edges with nanometer-scale resolution. We extract the full complex refractive indices of the monoclinic insulating and rutile conducting phases of VO 2 from a single sample and find no evidence for correlation-driven phase transitions.

In addition, users conform their outrage expressions to the expressive norms of their social networks, suggesting norm learning also guides online outrage expressions. Norm learning overshadows reinforcement learning when normative information is readily observable: in ideologically extreme networks, where outrage expression is more common, users are less sensitive to social feedback when deciding whether to express outrage. Our findings highlight how platform design interacts with human learning mechanisms to affect moral discourse in digital public spaces.},

We identified key sensorimotor circuits affected by stroke. iM1 stimulation treatment restored activation of the ipsilesional corticothalamic and corticocortical circuits, and the extent of activation was correlated with functional recovery. Furthermore, stimulated mice exhibited higher expression of axonal growth–associated protein 43 in the ipsilesional thalamus and showed increased Synaptophysin + /channelrhodopsin + presynaptic axonal terminals in the corticothalamic circuit. Selective stimulation of the corticothalamic circuit was sufficient to improve functional recovery.

In turn, IL-10 acts on dendritic cells (DCs) inducing the production of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1). Genetic ablation of Axl and Mertk in Mφs or IL-10 receptor in DCs or Timp1 substantially reduced MPE progression. Our results delineate an inflammatory cascade—from the clearance of apoptotic cells by Mφs, to production of IL-10, to induction of TIMP1 in DCs—that facilitates MPE progression.

Although 40.1\% of forests (3, 393, 250 ha) burned only once, by 2018, ~48\% of the evergreen forests converted to other, primarily grass-dominated uses. While greater fire frequency yielded more transformation, our results reveal the staggering impact of even a single fire. Increasing fire frequency imposes greater risks of irreversible forest loss, transforming forests into ecosystems increasingly vulnerable to degradation. Reversing this trend is indispensable to both mitigate and adapt to climate change globally. As climate change transforms fire regimes across the region, key actions are needed to conserve Latin American forests.},

  abstract     = {Systemic therapy of Gram-negative sepsis remains challenging. Polymyxin B (PMB) is well suited for sepsis therapy due to the endotoxin affinity and antibacterial activity. However, the dose-limiting toxicity has limited its systemic use in sepsis patients. For safe systemic use of PMB, we have developed a nanoparticulate system, called D-TZP, which selectively reduces the toxicity to mammalian cells but retains the therapeutic activities of PMB. D-TZP consists of an iron-complexed tannic acid nanocapsule containing a vitamin D core, coated with PMB and a chitosan derivative that controls the interaction of PMB with endotoxin, bacteria, and host cells. D-TZP attenuated the membrane toxicity associated with PMB but retained the ability of PMB to inactivate endotoxin and kill Gram-negative bacteria. Upon intravenous injection, D-TZP protected animals from pre-established endotoxemia and polymicrobial sepsis, showing no systemic toxicities inherent to PMB. These results support D-TZP as a safe and effective systemic intervention of sepsis.},

Here, we show that Apollo impact glass associated with a young 2 million–year–old crater records a strong Earth-like magnetization, providing evidence that impacts can impart intense signals to samples recovered from the Moon and other planetary bodies. Moreover, we show that silicate crystals bearing magnetic inclusions from Apollo samples formed at ∼3.9, 3.6, 3.3, and 3.2 billion years ago are capable of recording strong core dynamo–like fields but do not. Together, these data indicate that the Moon did not have a long-lived core dynamo. As a result, the Moon was not sheltered by a sustained paleomagnetosphere, and the lunar regolith should hold buried 3 He, water, and other volatile resources acquired from solar winds and Earth’s magnetosphere over some 4 billion years.},

Pure-/multi-metallic systems used for this task usually have low catalytic activity. Here, we tailored a highly active and selective InNi 3 C 0.5 /ZrO 2 catalyst by tuning the performance-relevant electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI), which is tightly linked with the ZrO 2 type–dependent oxygen deficiency. Highly oxygen-deficient monoclinic-ZrO 2 support imparts high electron density to InNi 3 C 0.5 because of the considerably enhanced EMSI, thereby enabling InNi 3 C 0.5 /monoclinic-ZrO 2 with an intrinsic activity three or two times as high as that of InNi 3 C 0.5 /amorphous-ZrO 2 or InNi 3 C 0.5 /tetragonal-ZrO 2 . The EMSI-governed catalysis observed in the InNi 3 C 0.5 /ZrO 2 system is extendable to other oxygen-deficient metal oxides, in particular InNi 3 C 0.5 /Fe 3 O 4 , achieving 25.7\% CO 2 conversion with 90.2\% methanol selectivity at 325°C, 6.0 MPa, 36, 000 ml g cat −1 hour −1 , and H 2 /CO 2 = 10:1.

Here, we found that the levels of the histone acetyltransferase MOF (males absent on the first) and its target modification histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation are heterogeneous among HSCs and influence their proliferation capacities. The increased proliferative capacities of MOF-depleted cells are linked to their expression of CD93. The CD93 + HSC subpopulation simultaneously shows transcriptional features of quiescent HSCs and functional features of active HSCs. CD93 + HSCs were expanded and exhibited an enhanced proliferative advantage in Mof +/− animals reminiscent of a premalignant state. Accordingly, low MOF and high CD93 levels correlate with poor survival and increased proliferation capacity in leukemia. Collectively, our study indicates H4K16ac as an important determinant for HSC heterogeneity, which is linked to the onset of monocytic disorders.},

We use ultrafast optical microscopy and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations to study well-ordered poly(3-hexylthiophene) nanofiber films prepared using living crystallization-driven self-assembly, and reveal a highly efficient energy transport regime: transient exciton delocalization, where energy exchange with vibrational modes allows excitons to temporarily re-access spatially extended states under equilibrium conditions. We show that this enables exciton diffusion constants up to 1.1 ± 0.1 cm 2 /s and diffusion lengths of 300 ± 50 nm. Our results reveal the dynamic interplay between localized and delocalized exciton configurations at equilibrium conditions, calling for a re-evaluation of exciton dynamics and suggesting design rules to engineer efficient energy transport in OSC device architectures not based on restrictive bulk heterojunctions.},

One unique case is that of bacteria swimming, which is based on the collective reorganization and rotation of flagella. Here, we mimic such motion using the light-driven evolution of a self-organized periodic arch pattern. The range and direction of translation are altered by separately varying the alignment period and the stimulating photon energy. Programmable self-propelling actuators are realized via a specific molecular assembly within a photoresponsive cholesteric medium. Through rationally presetting alignments, parallel transports of microspheres in customized trajectories are demonstrated, including convergence, divergence, gathering, and orbital revolution. This work extends the understanding of the rotation-translation conversion performed in an exquisitely self-organized system and may inspire future designs for functional materials and intelligent robotics.},

Most of the deposits in Gale crater seemingly did not form in an ancient lake, but the results nonetheless shed considerable light on ancient climate, environmental change, and the astrobiology of Mars.

A similar pattern has been observed for SSEs that trigger earthquake swarms, although no comparative studies exist on the source parameters of SSEs and tremor or earthquake swarms. We analyze the source scaling of SSEs and associated tremor- or swarm-like seismicity through our newly compiled dataset. We find a correlation between the aseismic and seismic moment release indicating that the shallower SSEs produce larger seismic moment release than deeper SSEs. The scaling may arise from the heterogeneous frictional and rheological properties of faults prone to SSEs and is mainly controlled by temperature. Our results indicate that similar physical phenomena govern tremor and earthquake swarms during SSEs.},

  abstract     = {Large earthquake ruptures propagating up to areas close to subduction trenches are infrequent, but when they occur, they heavily displace the ocean seafloor originating destructive tsunamis. The current paradigm is that the large seafloor deformation is caused by local factors reducing friction and increasing megathrust fault slip, or prompting the activation of ancillary faults or energy sources. As alternative to site-specific models, it has been proposed that large shallow slip could result from depth-dependent rock rigidity variations. To confront both hypotheses, here, we map elastic rock properties across the rupture zone of the M S 7.0- M W 7.7 1992 Nicaragua tsunami earthquake to estimate a property-compatible finite fault solution. The obtained self-consistent model accounts for trenchward increasing slip, constrains stress drop, and explains key tsunami earthquake characteristics such as long duration, high-frequency depletion, and magnitude discrepancy. The confirmation that these characteristics are all intrinsic attributes of shallow rupture opens new possibilities to improve tsunami hazard assessment.},

Using a mechanistic proteomic allocation model of a polar diatom focused on iron and manganese, we demonstrate how cellular processes fundamentally underpin micronutrient limitation, and how they interact and compensate for each other to shape cellular elemental stoichiometry and resource interdependence. We coupled our model with metaproteomic and environmental data, yielding an approach for estimating biogeochemical metrics, including taxon-specific growth rates.

A major player in greenhouse gas emissions, it is the main binding agent in concrete, providing a cohesive strength that rapidly increases during setting. Understanding how such cohesion emerges is a major obstacle to advances in cement science and technology. Here, we combine computational statistical mechanics and theory to demonstrate how cement cohesion arises from the organization of interlocked ions and water, progressively confined in nanoslits between charged surfaces of calcium-silicate-hydrates. Because of the water/ions interlocking, dielectric screening is drastically reduced and ionic correlations are proven notably stronger than previously thought, dictating the evolution of nanoscale interactions during cement hydration. By developing a quantitative analytical prediction of cement cohesion based on Coulombic forces, we reconcile a fundamental understanding of cement hydration with the fully atomistic description of the solid cement paste and open new paths for scientific design of construction materials.},

As disrupting maternal gene functions is either time-consuming or technically challenging, early developmental programs regulated by maternal factors remain mostly elusive. We provide a transgenic approach to inactivate maternal genes in zebrafish primary oocytes. By introducing three tandem single guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter into Tg( zpc : zcas9 ) embryos, we efficiently obtained maternal nanog and ctnnb2 mutants among GFP-positive F 1 offspring. Notably, most of these maternal mutants displayed either sgRNA site–spanning genomic deletions or unintended large deletions extending distantly from the sgRNA targets, suggesting a prominent deletion-prone tendency of genome editing in the oocyte. Thus, our method allows maternal gene knockout in the absence of viable and fertile homozygous mutant adults. This approach is particularly time-saving and can be applied for functional screening of maternal factors and generating genomic deletions in zebrafish.},

However, the structural features of ionic metal transporting ABC permeases have remained undefined. Here, we present the crystal structure of the manganese transporter PsaBC from Streptococcus pneumoniae in an open-inward conformation. The type II transporter has a tightly closed transmembrane channel due to “extracellular gating” residues that prevent water permeation or ion reflux. Below these residues, the channel contains a hitherto unreported metal coordination site, which is essential for manganese translocation. Mutagenesis of the extracellular gate perturbs manganese uptake, while coordination site mutagenesis abolishes import. These structural features are highly conserved in metal-specific ABC transporters and are represented throughout the kingdoms of life. Collectively, our results define the structure of PsaBC and reveal the features required for divalent cation transport.},

Mechanistically, eIF4A3 resides in nucleoli within the small subunit processome and regulates rRNA processing via R-loop clearance. EIF4A3 depletion induces cell cycle arrest through impaired RiBi checkpoint–mediated p53 induction and reprogrammed translation of cell cycle regulators. Multilevel omics analysis following eIF4A3 depletion pinpoints pathways of cell death regulation and translation of alternative mouse double minute homolog 2 ( MDM2 ) transcript isoforms that control p53. EIF4A3 expression and subnuclear localization among clinical cancer specimens correlate with the RiBi status rendering eIF4A3 an exploitable vulnerability in high-RiBi tumors.

Depolarized mitochondria recruit Parkin to the outer mitochondrial membrane, triggering autophagosome formation, rapid lysosomal fusion, and Parkin redistribution. Unexpectedly, these mitolysosomes are dynamic and persist for hours. Some are engulfed by healthy mitochondria, and others are deacidified before bursting. In other cases, Parkin is directly recruited to the matrix of polarized mitochondria. Loss of PINK1 blocks Parkin recruitment, causes LC3 accumulation within mitochondria, and exacerbates Drp1KO toxicity to dopamine neurons. These results define a distinct neuronal mitochondrial life cycle, revealing potential mechanisms of mitochondrial recycling and signaling relevant to neurodegeneration.},

Here, we identified Flowering locus VE ( FVE ), a well-known epigenetic component, as a new player in cytoplasmic PTGS. Loss-of-function fve mutations substantially reduced the accumulation of transgene-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). FVE interacts with suppressor of gene silencing 3 (SGS3), a master component in PTGS. FVE promotes SGS3 homodimerization that is essential for its function. FVE can bind to single-stranded RNA and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with moderate affinities, while its truncated form FVE-8 has a significantly increased binding affinity to dsRNA. These affinities affect the association and channeling of SGS3-RNA to downstream dsRNA binding protein 4 (DRB4)/Dicer-like protein 2/4 (DCL2/4) complexes. Hence, FVE, but not FVE-8, biochemically enhances the DRB4/DCL2/4 activity in vitro. We surmise that FVE promotes production of transgene-derived siRNAs through concertedly tuning SGS3-DRB4/DCL2/4 functions. Thus, this study revealed a noncanonical role of FVE in PTGS.},

Transcription from upstream genes in the cluster runs through the coding region of downstream loci and inhibits their expression in cis, most likely via transcriptional interference. Moreover, Ir75c blocks accumulation of other receptor proteins in trans through a protein-dependent, posttranscriptional mechanism. These repression mechanisms operate in endogenous neurons, in conjunction with cell type–specific gene regulatory networks, to ensure unique receptor expression. Our data provide evidence for inter-olfactory receptor regulation in invertebrates and highlight unprecedented, but potentially widespread, mechanisms for ensuring exclusive expression of chemosensory receptors, and other protein families, encoded by tandemly arranged genes.},

Both high C release and Q 10 are associated with weak organo-mineral associations but high microbial abundances and activities, whereas high microbial diversity corresponds to low Q 10 .

However, to date, single-molecule observations using HAADF-STEM has limited to simple planar molecules. In the present study, we demonstrate a direct structural investigation of nonplanar dendronized polynuclear Ir complexes with subnanometer resolution using Ir as an atomic label. Decreasing the electron dose to the dendrimer complexes is critical for the single-molecule observation. A comparison with simulated STEM images of conformational isomers is performed to determine the most plausible conformation.

  abstract     = {The study of RNA modifications in large clinical cohorts can reveal relationships between the epitranscriptome and human diseases, although this is especially challenging. We developed ModTect ( https://github.com/ktan8/ModTect ), a statistical framework to identify RNA modifications de novo by standard RNA-sequencing with deletion and mis-incorporation signals. We show that ModTect can identify both known ( N 1 -methyladenosine) and previously unknown types of mRNA modifications ( N 2 , N 2 -dimethylguanosine) at nucleotide-resolution. Applying ModTect to 11, 371 patient samples and 934 cell lines across 33 cancer types, we show that the epitranscriptome was dysregulated in patients across multiple cancer types and was additionally associated with cancer progression and survival outcomes. Some types of RNA modification were also more disrupted than others in patients with cancer. Moreover, RNA modifications contribute to multiple types of RNA-DNA sequence differences, which unexpectedly escape detection by Sanger sequencing. ModTect can thus be used to discover associations between RNA modifications and clinical outcomes in patient cohorts.},

Current “one-size-fits-all” guidelines for SCD risk assessment in CS result in insufficient appropriate primary prevention. Here, we present a two-step precision risk prediction technology for patients with CS. First, a patient’s arrhythmogenic propensity arising from heterogeneous CS-induced ventricular remodeling is assessed using a novel personalized magnetic-resonance imaging and positron-emission tomography fusion mechanistic model. The resulting simulations of arrhythmogenesis are fed, together with a set of imaging and clinical biomarkers, into a supervised classifier. In a retrospective study of 45 patients, the technology achieved testing results of 60\% sensitivity [95\% confidence interval (CI): 57-63\%], 72\% specificity [95\% CI: 70-74\%], and 0.754 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [95\% CI: 0.710-0.797]. It outperformed clinical metrics, highlighting its potential to transform CS risk stratification.},

UVB radiation induces cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) as the major form of DNA damage, but the mechanism of how CPDs cause mutations is unclear. To map CPDs at single-base resolution genome wide, we developed the circle damage sequencing (circle-damage-seq) method. In human cells, CPDs form preferentially in a tetranucleotide sequence context (5′-Py-TPy-T/A), but this alone does not explain the tumor mutation patterns. To test whether mutations arise at CPDs by cytosine deamination, we specifically mapped UVB-induced cytosine-deaminated CPDs. Transcription start sites (TSSs) were protected from CPDs and deaminated CPDs, but both lesions were enriched immediately upstream of the TSS, suggesting a mutation-promoting role of bound transcription factors. Most importantly, the genomic dinucleotide and trinucleotide sequence specificity of deaminated CPDs matched the prominent mutation signature of melanomas. Our data identify the cytosine-deaminated CPD as the leading premutagenic lesion responsible for mutations in melanomas.},

These secretions can act as public goods, creating incentives for exploiters to invade and “steal” public goods away from producers. This phenomenon has been studied extensively in vitro, but little is known about the occurrence and impact of public good exploiters in the environment. Here, we develop a genomic approach to systematically identify bacteria that can exploit public goods produced during the degradation of polysaccharides. Focusing on chitin, a highly abundant marine biopolymer, we show that public good exploiters are active in natural chitin degrading microbial communities, invading early during colonization, and potentially hindering degradation. In contrast to in vitro studies, we find that exploiters and degraders belong to distant lineages, facilitating their coexistence. Our approach opens novel avenues to use the wealth of genomic data available to infer ecological roles and interactions among microbes.},

Here, we develop an effective technique for the mass processing of organic microlaser arrays, which act as sensing units, on the chip of photonic skins. With a bilayer electron-beam direct writing method, we fabricated flexible mechanical sensor networks composed of coupled-cavity single-mode laser sources on pliable polymer substrates. These microlaser-based mechanical sensor chips were subsequently used to recognize hand gestures, showing great potential for artificial skin applications. This work represents a substantial advance toward scalable construction of high-performance and low-cost flexible photonic chips, thus paving the way for the implementation of smart photonic skins into practical applications.},

We found a consistent and strong effect of disease severity on antibody magnitude, driven by fever, cough, hospitalization, and oxygen requirement. Responses to spike protein versus nucleocapsid had consistently higher correlation with neutralization. Assays varied substantially in sensitivity during early convalescence and time to seroreversion. Variability was dramatic for individuals with mild infection, who had consistently lower antibody titers, with sensitivities at 6 months ranging from 33 to 98\% for commercial assays. Thus, the ability to detect previous infection by SARS-CoV-2 is highly dependent on infection severity, timing, and the assay used.

While these immunogens display the epitopes of potent neutralizing antibodies, they also present epitopes recognized by non-neutralizing or weakly neutralizing (“off-target”) antibodies. Using our recently developed electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping approach, we have uncovered a phenomenon wherein off-target antibodies elicited by HIV trimer subunit vaccines cause the otherwise highly stabilized trimeric proteins to degrade into cognate protomers. Further, we show that these protomers expose an expanded suite of off-target epitopes, normally occluded inside the prefusion conformation of trimer, that subsequently elicit further off-target antibody responses.

Despite the agricultural importance of this symbiosis, the mechanisms that govern carbon and nitrogen allocation in bacteroids and promote ammonia secretion to the plant are largely unknown. Using a metabolic model derived from genome-scale datasets, we show that carbon polymer synthesis and alanine secretion by bacteroids facilitate redox balance in microaerobic nodules. Catabolism of dicarboxylates induces not only a higher oxygen demand but also a higher NADH/NAD + ratio than sugars. Modeling and 13 C metabolic flux analysis indicate that oxygen limitation restricts the decarboxylating arm of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which limits ammonia assimilation into glutamate. By tightly controlling oxygen supply and providing dicarboxylates as the energy and electron source donors for N 2 fixation, legumes promote ammonia secretion by bacteroids. This is a defining feature of rhizobium-legume symbioses.},

We combined experimental and theoretical efforts to study the effects of nonstoichiometric mixing on coacervation behavior and accurately measured the concentrations of polyelectrolytes and small ions in the coacervate and supernatant phases. For synthetic polyacrylamides and polypeptides/DNA, with unequal mixing stoichiometry, we report a general “looping-in” phenomenon found around physiological salt concentrations, where the polymer concentrations in the coacervate initially increase with salt addition before subsequently decreasing. This looping-in behavior is captured by a molecular model that considers reversible ion binding and electrostatic interactions. Further analysis in the low-salt regime shows that the looping-in phenomenon originates from the translational entropy of counterions that are needed to neutralize nonstoichiometric coacervates.},

Here, we interrogate survivorship hypotheses using data from a new, nearly complete skull of Late Cretaceous (~70 million years) bird Ichthyornis and reassess shifts in bird body size across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Ichthyornis exhibited a wulst and segmented palate, previously proposed to have arisen within extant birds. The origin of Aves is marked by larger, reshaped brains indicating selection for relatively large telencephala and eyes but not by uniquely small body size.

CRISPR-based, m 6 A-editing tools further prove that the methyl groups on HMBOX1 per se contribute to the generation of altered cancer genome. In multiple types of human cancers, expression of the RNA methyltransferase METTL3 is negatively correlated with the telomere length but favorably with fractions of altered cancer genome, whereas HMBOX1 mRNA levels show the opposite patterns.

By calculating the fluctuation-dissipation relation of inherent structures, we obtain a temperature-like quantity T IS . For monocomponent crystal-formers, T IS agrees well with the crystallization temperature T c , while it matches with the onset temperature T on for glass-formers. It also agrees with effective temperatures of typical nonequilibrium systems, such as aging glasses, quasi-static shear flows, and quasi-static self-propelled flows.

  abstract     = {The cargo-binding capabilities of cytoskeletal motor proteins have expanded during evolution through both gene duplication and alternative splicing. For the light chains of the kinesin-1 family of microtubule motors, this has resulted in an array of carboxyl-terminal domain sequences of unknown molecular function. Here, combining phylogenetic analyses with biophysical, biochemical, and cell biology approaches, we identify a highly conserved membrane-induced curvature-sensitive amphipathic helix within this region of a subset of long kinesin light-chain paralogs and splice isoforms. This helix mediates the direct binding of kinesin-1 to lipid membranes. Membrane binding requires specific anionic phospholipids, and it contributes to kinesin-1–dependent lysosome positioning, a canonical activity that, until now, has been attributed exclusively the recognition of organelle-associated cargo adaptor proteins. This leads us to propose a protein-lipid coincidence detection framework for kinesin-1–mediated organelle transport.},

  abstract     = {Epidemiological data have linked vitamin D deficiency to the onset and severity of various cancers, including prostate cancer, and although in vitro studies have demonstrated anticancer activities for vitamin D, clinical trials provided conflicting results. To determine the impact of vitamin D signaling on prostatic precancerous lesions, we treated genetically engineered Pten (i)pe−/− mice harboring prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) with Gemini-72, a vitamin D analog with reported anticancer activities. We show that this analog induces apoptosis in senescent PINs, normalizes extracellular matrix remodeling by stromal fibroblasts, and reduces the prostatic infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrates that while a subset of luminal cells expressing Krt8, Krt4, and Tacstd2 (termed luminal-C cells) is lost by such a treatment, antiapoptotic pathways are induced in persistent luminal-C cells. Therefore, our findings delineate the distinct responses of PINs and the microenvironment to Gemini-72, and shed light on mechanisms that limit treatment’s efficacy.},

However, questions about the robustness and reproducibility of the relationship persist. Here, we show that climate models are able to simulate periods of strong ice-NAO correlation, albeit rarely. Furthermore, we show that the winter circulation signals during these periods are consistent with observations and not driven by sea ice. We do so by interrogating a multimodel ensemble for the specific time scale of interest, thereby illuminating the dynamics that produce large spread in the ice-NAO relationship. Our results support the importance of internal variability over sea ice but go further in showing that the mechanism behind strong ice-NAO correlations, when they occur, is similar in longer observational records and models. Rather than sea ice, circulation anomalies over the Urals emerge as a decisive precursor to the winter NAO signal.},

Using only publicly available data, we show that predictive models that include structural and procedural predictors can accurately predict the occurrence of non-state terrorism locally and a week ahead in regions affected by a relatively high prevalence of terrorism. In these regions, theoretically informed models systematically outperform models using predictors built on past terrorist events only. We further identify and interpret the local effects of major global and regional terrorism drivers.

These scaffolds showed the highest new bone volume, surface coverage, and mineral density among the tested groups in vivo. The regenerated bone exhibited a radially aligned fashion, closely recapitulating the scaffold’s architecture. The organic phase in regenerated bone showed an aligned, layered, and densely packed structure, while the inorganic mineral phase showed a uniform distribution with smaller pore size and an even distribution of stress upon the simulated compression.

Single-cell analyses showed that STK40 knockdown reduced cell motility and coordination by strengthening focal adhesion (FA) complexes. Furthermore, STK40 knockdown reduced the stability of yes-associated protein (YAP) and subsequently decreased YAP transported into the nucleus, while MAPK inhibition further weakened YAP activities in the nucleus to disturb FA remodeling. Together, we unveiled an integrated STK40-YAP-MAPK system regulating cell migration and introduced “synthetic dysmobility” as a novel strategy to collaboratively control cell migration.},

We use this approach to achieve crystalline and compositionally uniform intermetallic nanocrystals of Au-Ga, Ag-Ga, Cu-Ga, Ni-Ga, Pd-Ga, Pd-In, and Pd-Zn compounds. We demonstrate both compositional tunability across the phase spaces (e.g., AuGa 2 , AuGa, Au 7 Ga 2 , and Ga-doped Au), size tunability (e.g., 14.0-, 7.6-, and 3.8-nm AuGa 2 ), and size uniformity (e.g., 5.4\% size deviations).

Flexible avoidance may be supported by a mental model (i.e., model-based), a process for which neural reactivation and sequential replay have emerged as candidate mechanisms. During an aversive learning task, combined with magnetoencephalography, we show prospective and retrospective reactivation during planning and learning, respectively, coupled to evidence for sequential replay. Specifically, when individuals plan in an aversive context, we find preferential reactivation of subsequently chosen goal states. Stronger reactivation is associated with greater hippocampal theta power. At outcome receipt, unchosen goal states are reactivated regardless of outcome valence. Replay of paths leading to goal states was modulated by outcome valence, with aversive outcomes associated with stronger reverse replay than safe outcomes. Our findings are suggestive of avoidance involving simulation of unexperienced states through hippocampally mediated reactivation and replay.},

We find that richness increased steeply during the rapidly warming Early Holocene.

Using the identified variants, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis of the influence of testosterone on socioeconomic position, including income, employment status, neighborhood-level deprivation, and educational qualifications; on health, including self-rated health and body mass index; and on risk-taking behavior. We found little evidence that testosterone affected socioeconomic position, health, or risk-taking. Our results therefore suggest that it is unlikely that testosterone meaningfully affects these outcomes in men or women.

This means wider swings between wet and dry extremes. Such an amplification of precipitation variability is particularly prominent over climatologically wet regions, with percentage increases in variability more than twice those in mean precipitation. Thermodynamic effects, linked to increased moisture availability, increase precipitation variability uniformly everywhere. It is the dynamic effects (negative) linked to weakened circulation variability that make precipitation variability changes strongly region dependent.

  abstract     = {Understanding of dedifferentiation, an indicator of poo prognosis for patients with thyroid cancer, has been hampered by imprecise and incomplete characterization of its heterogeneity and its attributes. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we explored the landscape of thyroid cancer at single-cell resolution with 46, 205 cells and delineated its dedifferentiation process and suppressive immune microenvironment. The developmental trajectory indicated that anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) cells were derived from a small subset of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cells. Moreover, a potential functional role of CREB3L1 on ATC development was revealed by integrated analyses of copy number alteration and transcriptional regulatory network. Multiple genes in differentiation-related pathways (e.g., EMT) were involved as the downstream targets of CREB3L1, increased expression of which can thus predict higher relapse risk of PTC. Collectively, our study provided insights into the heterogeneity and molecular evolution of thyroid cancer and highlighted the potential driver role of CREB3L1 in its dedifferentiation process.},

Molecular insights on the water transport process are, however, less investigated because of computational difficulties of ionic soft matters and the self-assembly. Here we report specific behavior of water molecules in the nanochannels by using the self-consistent modeling combining density functional theory and molecular dynamics and the large-scale molecular dynamics calculation. The simulations clearly provide the one-dimensional (1D) and 3D-interconnected nanochannels of self-assembled columnar and bicontinuous structures, respectively, with the precise mesoscale order observed by x-ray diffraction measurement. Water molecules are then confined inside the nanochannels with the formation of hydrogen bonding network. The quantitative analyses of free energetics and anisotropic diffusivity reveal that, the mesoscale geometry of 1D nanodomain profits the nature of water transport via advantages of dissolution and diffusion mechanisms inside the ionic nanochannels.},

Our analysis suggests the presence of social spillovers. We estimate that while state closures directly reduced mobility by 3 to 4\%, all other states locking down further decreased mobility in the focal state by 8 to 14\%. Similarly, while reopening directly increased mobility by 2 to 3\%, all other states’ reopening increased mobility in the focal state by 12 to 21\%. Our analysis also suggests geographic spillovers: Travel from locked down origins to open destinations increased by 12 to 29\%. In contrast, travel from reopened origins to locked down destinations decreased by 6 to 7\% for nearby counties and by 14 to 18\% for distant counties. Despite its limitations, we believe that our approach takes the first steps toward creating a framework for interdependent program evaluation across policy domains.},

The IκB kinase (IKK) complex is an integration hub for cytokines that govern nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. In response to inflammation, IKK is activated through recruitment to receptor-associated protein assemblies. How and what information IKK complexes transmit about the milieu are open questions. Here, we track dynamics of IKK complexes and nuclear NF-κB to identify upstream signaling features that determine same-cell responses. Experiments and modeling of single complexes reveal their size, number, and timing relays cytokine-specific control over shared signaling mechanisms with feedback regulation that is independent of transcription. Our results provide evidence for variable-gain stochastic pooling, a noise-reducing motif that enables cytokine-specific regulation and parsimonious information transfer. We propose that emergent properties of stochastic pooling are general principles of receptor signaling that have evolved for constructive information transmission in noisy molecular environments.},

We developed videocystometry in mice, combining intravesical pressure measurements with high-speed fluoroscopy of the urinary tract. Videocystometry substantially outperforms current state-of-the-art methods to monitor the urine storage and voiding process, by enabling quantitative analysis of voiding efficiency, urethral flow, vesicoureteral reflux, and the relation between intravesical pressure and flow, in both anesthetized and awake, nonrestrained mice. Using videocystometry, we identified localized bladder wall micromotions correlated with different states of the filling/voiding cycle, revealed an acute effect of TRPV1 channel activation on voiding efficiency, and pinpointed the effects of urethane anesthesia on urine storage and urethral flow. Videocystometry has broad applications, ranging from the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of bladder control to drug development for LUTd.},

In this work, we explored the molecular basis of cholesterol sensitivity exhibited by the serotonin 1A receptor, the most studied GPCR in the context of cholesterol sensitivity, by generating mutants of key residues in CRAC motifs in transmembrane helix 2 (TM2) and TM5 of the receptor. Our results show that a lysine residue (K101) in one of the CRAC motifs is crucial for sensing altered membrane cholesterol levels. Insights from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations showed that cholesterol-sensitive functional states of the serotonin 1A receptor are associated with reduced conformational dynamics of extracellular loops of the receptor.

Models explained 40 to 50\% of area burned, with number of ignitions being the strongest variable. One hundred percent of SAW fires were human caused, and in the past decade, powerline failures have been the dominant cause.

Our analytically controlled theory provides a quantitative formula relating T c to microscopic parameters, with maximum T c reaching about 10\% of the Fermi temperature. Our work demonstrates a powerful method for studying strong coupling superconductivity with unconventional pairing symmetry.

During exploitative states, characterized by motivated repetition of the same action choice, dopamine neurons in SNc encoding movement vigor showed sustained elevation of basal activity that lasted many seconds. This sustained activity emerged from longer positive responses, which accumulated during exploitative action-reward bouts, and hysteretic dynamics. Conversely, noradrenergic neurons in LC showed sustained inhibition of basal activity due to the accumulation of longer negative responses in LC. Chemogenetic manipulation of these sustained dynamics revealed that dopaminergic activity mediates action drive, whereas noradrenergic activity modulates choice diversity. These data uncover the emergence of sustained neural states in dopaminergic and noradrenergic networks that mediate dissociable aspects of exploitative bouts.},

Moreover, as desired for valleytronics devices, the lifetime, valley polarization, and valley lifetime of the generated interlayer excitons can all be substantially improved as compared with that in the monolayer-monolayer heterostructure.

Here, using in vivo imaging in anesthetized mice, we reveal that brain capillary endothelial cells control blood flow through a hierarchy of IP 3 receptor–mediated Ca 2+ events, ranging from small, subsecond protoevents, reflecting Ca 2+ release through a small number of channels, to high-amplitude, sustained (up to ~1 min) compound events mediated by large clusters of channels. These frequent (~5000 events/s per microliter of cortex) Ca 2+ signals are driven by neuronal activity, which engages G q protein–coupled receptor signaling, and are enhanced by Ca 2+ entry through TRPV4 channels. The resulting Ca 2+ -dependent synthesis of nitric oxide increases local blood flow selectively through affected capillary branches, providing a mechanism for high-resolution control of blood flow to small clusters of neurons.},

  abstract     = {The deuterium versus hydrogen (D/H) isotopic ratios are important to understand the source of water on Earth and other terrestrial planets. However, the determinations of D/H ratios suggest a hydrogen isotopic diversity in the planetary objects of the solar system. Photochemistry has been suggested as one source of this isotope heterogeneity. Here, we have revealed the photodissociation features of the water isotopologue (HOD) at λ = 120.8 to 121.7 nm. The results show different quantum state populations of OH and OD fragments from HOD photodissociation, suggesting strong isotope effect. The branching ratios of H + OD and D + OH channels display large isotopic fractionation, with ratios of 0.70 ± 0.10 at 121.08 nm and 0.49 ± 0.10 at 121.6 nm. Because water is abundant in the solar nebula, photodissociation of HOD should be an alternative source of the D/H isotope heterogeneity. This isotope effect must be considered in the photochemical models.},

However, most of the magnetic moments in nanostructures are unstable due to size effect, and the possible solution based on exchange coupling between nanomagnetism is still not clear. Here, graphene-mediated exchange coupling between nanomagnets is demonstrated by depositing discrete superparamagnetic Ni nano-islands on single-crystal graphene. The heterostructure exhibits ideal two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism with clear hysteresis loops and Curie temperature up to 80 K. The intrinsic ferromagnetism in graphene and antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between graphene and Ni nano-islands are revealed by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism and density functional theory calculations. The artificial 2D ferromagnets constitute a platform to study the coupling mechanism between complex correlated electronic systems and magnetism on the nanoscale, and the results and concept provide insights into the realization of spin manipulation in quantum computing.},

We demonstrate parallel signs of mild degeneration and axonal sprouting of sympathetic innervations in early stages of experimental NAFLD and a collapse of sympathetic arborization in steatohepatitis. Human fatty livers display a similar pattern of sympathetic nerve degeneration, correlating with the severity of NAFLD pathology. We show that chronic sympathetic hyperexcitation is a key factor in the axonal degeneration, here genetically phenocopied in mice deficient of the Rac-1 activator Vav3. In experimental steatohepatitis, 3D imaging reveals a severe portal vein contraction, spatially correlated with the extension of the remaining nerves around the portal vein, enlightening a potential intrahepatic neuronal mechanism of portal hypertension. These fundamental alterations in liver innervation and vasculature uncover previously unidentified neuronal components in NAFLD pathomechanisms.},

Therefore, arresting tumor-platelet cross-talk with effective and atoxic antiplatelet agents in combination with anticancer drugs may serve as an effective cancer treatment strategy. To test this concept, we create an ovarian tumor microenvironment chip (OTME-Chip) that consists of a platelet-perfused tumor microenvironment and which recapitulates platelet extravasation and its consequences. By including gene-edited tumors and RNA sequencing, this organ-on-chip revealed that platelets and tumors interact through glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and tumor galectin-3 under shear. Last, as proof of principle of a clinical trial, we showed that a GPVI inhibitor, Revacept, impairs metastatic potential and improves chemotherapy. Since GPVI is an antithrombotic target that does not impair hemostasis, it represents a safe cancer therapeutic. We propose that OTME-Chip could be deployed to study other vascular and hematological targets in cancer.},

While neuronal oscillators within the mammalian central clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, couple intercellularly, coupling among peripheral oscillators is controversial and the molecular mechanisms are unknown. Using two- and three-dimensional mammalian culture models in vitro (mainly human U-2 OS cells) and ex vivo, we show that peripheral oscillators couple via paracrine pathways. We identify transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) as peripheral coupling factor that mediates paracrine phase adjustment of molecular clocks through transcriptional regulation of core-clock genes. Disruption of TGF-β signaling causes desynchronization of oscillator networks resulting in reduced amplitude and increased sensitivity toward external zeitgebers. Our findings reveal an unknown mechanism for peripheral clock synchrony with implications for rhythmic organ functions and circadian health.},

Meta-learning gives higher accuracy and improved generalization compared to fitting a model separately to each material and allows us to identify the optimal hydrogen storage temperature with the highest working capacity for a given pressure difference. Materials with high optimal temperatures are found in close proximity in the fingerprint space and exhibit high isosteric heats of adsorption.

In particular, thermomechanical liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) constitute artificial muscle-like actuators that can be remotely triggered for large stroke, fast response, and highly repeatable actuations. Here, we introduce a digital light processing (DLP)–based additive manufacturing approach that automatically shear aligns mesogenic oligomers, layer-by-layer, to achieve high orientational order in the photocrosslinked structures; this ordering yields high specific work capacity (63 J kg −1 ) and energy density (0.18 MJ m −3 ). We demonstrate actuators composed of these DLP printed LCEs’ applications in soft robotics, such as reversible grasping, untethered crawling, and weightlifting. Furthermore, we present an LCE self-sensing system that exploits thermally induced optical transition as an intrinsic option toward feedback control.},

Here, we report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the active ELMO1-DOCK5 complex bound to Rac1 at 3.8-Å resolution. The C-terminal region of ELMO1, including the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, aids in the binding of the catalytic DOCK homology region 2 (DHR-2) domain of DOCK5 to Rac1 in its nucleotide-free state. A complex α-helical scaffold between ELMO1 and DOCK5 stabilizes the binding of Rac1.

We show that key components of hepatic bile salt synthesis and ileal transport pathways are conserved and under control of Fxr in zebrafish. Zebrafish bile salts consist primarily of a C 27 bile alcohol and a C 24 bile acid that undergo multiple microbial modifications including bile acid deconjugation that augments Fxr activity. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we provide a cellular atlas of the zebrafish intestinal epithelium and uncover roles for Fxr in transcriptional and differentiation programs in ileal and other cell types.

This leads to repression of translation in mouse and human FUS-ALS motor neurons and is corroborated in vitro, where FUS and FMRP copartition and repress translation.

Under NIR light radiation, the designed catalyst increases catalytic activity of cyclohexene oxidation under O 2 atmosphere in water. The conversion reaches about pentaploid of the reaction without NIR radiation. By excluding heating effect from the external heater at the same temperature, about twice as much enhancement, which can be attributed to the sole photothermal action, is still observed.

Phospholipid flippases are eukaryotic type 4 P-type adenosine triphosphatases (P4-ATPases), which, in association with CDC50, translocate phospholipids across the membrane lipid bilayers. In this study, we investigated the function of a putative P4-ATPase, ATP7, from the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii . Disruption of ATP7 blocks the parasite infection of mosquitoes. ATP7 is localized on the ookinete plasma membrane. While ATP7-depleted ookinetes are capable of invading the midgut, they are eliminated within the epithelial cells by a process independent from the mosquito complement-like immunity. ATP7 colocalizes and interacts with the flippase cofactor CDC50C. Depletion of CDC50C phenocopies ATP7 deficiency. ATP7-depleted ookinetes fail to uptake phosphatidylcholine across the plasma membrane. Ookinete microinjection into the mosquito hemocoel reverses the ATP7 deficiency phenotype. Our study identifies Plasmodium flippase as a mechanism of parasite survival in the midgut epithelium that is required for mosquito transmission.},

  abstract     = {Metabolic dysregulation underlies malignant phenotypes attributed to cancer stem cells, such as unlimited proliferation and differentiation blockade. Here, we demonstrate that NAD + metabolism enables acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to evade apoptosis, another hallmark of cancer stem cells. We integrated whole-genome CRISPR screening and pan-cancer genetic dependency mapping to identify NAMPT and NMNAT1 as AML dependencies governing NAD + biosynthesis. While both NAMPT and NMNAT1 were required for AML, the presence of NAD + precursors bypassed the dependence of AML on NAMPT but not NMNAT1 , pointing to NMNAT1 as a gatekeeper of NAD + biosynthesis. Deletion of NMNAT1 reduced nuclear NAD + , activated p53, and increased venetoclax sensitivity. Conversely, increased NAD + biosynthesis promoted venetoclax resistance. Unlike leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in both murine and human AML xenograft models, NMNAT1 was dispensable for hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoiesis. Our findings identify NMNAT1 as a previously unidentified therapeutic target that maintains NAD + for AML progression and chemoresistance.},

We hypothesize that these waves are the predominant physiological process reflected in spontaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal fluctuations. The correlation structure (“functional connectivity”) of these fluctuations recapitulates the large-scale functional organization of the brain. However, a unifying physiological account of this structure has so far been lacking. Here, using fMRI in humans, we show that ongoing arousal fluctuations are associated with global waves of activity that slowly propagate in parallel throughout the neocortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum. We show that these waves can parsimoniously account for many features of spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations, including topographically organized functional connectivity. Last, we demonstrate similar, cortex-wide propagation of neural activity measured with electrocorticography in macaques. These findings suggest that traveling waves spatiotemporally pattern brain-wide excitability in relation to arousal.},

To establish object correspondence, the visual system is thought to match surface features of objects across saccades. Here, we show that an object’s intrasaccadic retinal trace—a signal previously considered unavailable to visual processing—facilitates this match making. Human observers made saccades to a cued target in a circular stimulus array. Using high-speed visual projection, we swiftly rotated this array during the eyes’ flight, displaying continuous intrasaccadic target motion. Observers’ saccades landed between the target and a distractor, prompting secondary saccades. Independently of the availability of object features, which we controlled tightly, target motion increased the rate and reduced the latency of gaze-correcting saccades to the initial presaccadic target, in particular when the target’s stimulus features incidentally gave rise to efficient motion streaks. These results suggest that intrasaccadic visual information informs the establishment of object correspondence and jump-starts gaze correction.},

Using primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and one well-defined trigger of the UJT, compression mimicking the mechanical effects of bronchoconstriction, here, we combine RNA sequencing data with protein-protein interaction networks to provide the first genome-wide analysis of the UJT. Our results show that compression induces an early transcriptional activation of the membrane and actomyosin network and a delayed activation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell-matrix networks. This response is associated with a signaling cascade that promotes actin polymerization and cellular motility through the coordinated interplay of downstream pathways including ERK, JNK, integrin signaling, and energy metabolism. Moreover, in nonasthmatic versus asthmatic HBECs, common genomic patterns associated with ECM remodeling suggest a molecular connection between airway remodeling, bronchoconstriction, and the UJT.},

Furthermore, our new approach reveals the transmembrane proteome remodeling landscape in the brain of a mouse depression model, which led to the identification of two previously unknown GPCR regulators of depressive-like behaviors.

We characterize the development of Charnia masoni and establish the affinity of rangeomorphs, among the oldest and most enigmatic components of the Ediacaran macrobiota. We provide the first direct evidence for the internal interconnected nature of rangeomorphs and show that Charnia was constructed of repeated branches that derived successively from pre-existing branches. We find homology and rationalize morphogenesis between disparate rangeomorph taxa, before producing a phylogenetic analysis, resolving Charnia as a stem-eumetazoan and expanding the anatomical disparity of that group to include a long-extinct bodyplan.

Here, we show that active lysogeny can fuel rapid, parallel adaptations in establishing a chronic infection. These recombination events repeatedly disrupted genes encoding global regulators, leading to increased cyclic di-GMP levels and elevated biofilm production.

In this work, a topotactic phase transition random-access memory (TPT-RAM) with a unique diffusive nonvolatile dual mode based on SrCoO x is demonstrated. The reversible phase transition of SrCoO x is well controlled by oxygen ion migrations along the highly ordered oxygen vacancy channels, enabling reproducible analog switching characteristics with reduced variability. Combining density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, the orientation-dependent switching mechanism of TPT-RAM is investigated synergistically. Furthermore, the dual-mode TPT-RAM is used to mimic the selective stabilization of developing synapses and implement neural network pruning, reducing ~84.2\% of redundant synapses while improving the image classification accuracy to 99\%.

  abstract     = {Histone H3K27M is a driving mutation in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), a deadly pediatric brain tumor. H3K27M reshapes the epigenome through a global inhibition of PRC2 catalytic activity and displacement of H3K27me2/3, promoting oncogenesis of DIPG. As a consequence, a histone modification H3K36me2, antagonistic to H3K27me2/3, is aberrantly elevated. Here, we investigate the role of H3K36me2 in H3K27M-DIPG by tackling its upstream catalyzing enzymes (writers) and downstream binding factors (readers). We determine that NSD1 and NSD2 are the key writers for H3K36me2. Loss of NSD1/2 in H3K27M-DIPG impedes cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis by disrupting tumor-promoting transcriptional programs. Further, we demonstrate that LEDGF and HDGF2 are the main readers mediating the protumorigenic effects downstream of NSD1/2-H3K36me2. Treatment with a chemically modified peptide mimicking endogenous H3K36me2 dislodges LEDGF/HDGF2 from chromatin and specifically inhibits the proliferation of H3K27M-DIPG. Our results indicate a functional pathway of NSD1/2-H3K36me2-LEDGF/HDGF2 as an acquired dependency in H3K27M-DIPG.},

  abstract     = {Unconventional superconductivity and, in particular, triplet superconductivity have been front and center of topological materials and quantum technology research. Here, we report our observation of triplet pairing in nonmagnetic CoSi 2 /TiSi 2 heterostructures on silicon. CoSi 2 undergoes a sharp superconducting transition at a critical temperature T c ≃ 1.5 K, while TiSi 2 is a normal metal. We investigate conductance spectra of both two-terminal CoSi 2 /TiSi 2 contact junctions and three-terminal T-shaped CoSi 2 /TiSi 2 superconducting proximity structures. Below T c , we observe (i) a narrow zero-bias conductance peak on top of a broad hump, accompanied by two symmetric side dips in the contact junctions, (ii) a narrow zero-bias conductance peak in T-shaped structures, and (iii) hysteresis in the junction magnetoresistance. These three independent and complementary observations point to chiral p-wave pairing in CoSi 2 /TiSi 2 heterostructures. The excellent fabrication compatibility of CoSi 2 and TiSi 2 with present-day silicon-based integrated-circuit technology suggests their potential use in scalable quantum-computing devices.},

Thus far, their differentiation from a common progenitor is mostly understood to be regulated by intrinsic mechanisms. However, the proportion of αβ/γδ T cells varies in different vertebrate taxa. How this process is regulated in species that tend to produce a high frequency of γδ T cells is unstudied. Using an in vivo teleost model, the medaka, we report that progenitors first enter a thymic niche where their development into γδ T cells is favored. Translocation from this niche, mediated by chemokine receptor Ccr9b, is a prerequisite for their differentiation into αβ T cells. On the other hand, the thymic niche also generates opposing gradients of the cytokine interleukin-7 and chemokine Ccl25a, and, together, they influence the lineage outcome. We propose a previously unknown mechanism that determines the proportion of αβ/γδ lineages within species.},

Here, we present cryo–electron microscopy structures of human NPC1L1 in apo state, cholesterol-enriched state, and ezetimibe-bound state to reveal molecular details of NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol uptake and ezetimibe inhibition. Comparison of these structures reveals that the sterol-sensing domain (SSD) could respond to the cholesterol level alteration by binding different number of cholesterol molecules. Upon increasing cholesterol level, SSD binds more cholesterol molecules, which, in turn, triggers the formation of a stable structural cluster in SSD, while binding of ezetimibe causes the deformation of the SSD and destroys the structural cluster, leading to the inhibition of NPC1L1 function. These results provide insights into mechanisms of NPC1L1 function and ezetimibe action and are of great significance for the development of new cholesterol absorption inhibitors.},

This suggests that even in the midst of an international health crisis, partisanship and emotional rhetoric play a critical part in elite communications and contribute to the attention messages receive. The messaging on COVID-19 is polarized and fractured. The valenced messaging provokes divergence in public engagement, reaction, and information spread.

We identified candidate genes associated with traits differentiating hemp and drug cultivars, including branching pattern and cellulose/lignin biosynthesis. We also found evidence for loss of function of genes involved in the synthesis of the two major biochemically competing cannabinoids during selection for increased fiber production or psychoactive properties.

Here, we present experimental evidence that the repressed state of a Drosophila PcG target gene, giant ( gt ), is not identified by the presence of a repressor. Rather, de novo establishment of PcG-mediated silencing at gt is the default state that is prevented by the presence of an activator or coactivator, which may inhibit the catalytic activity of Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2).},

We show that advanced nonlinear optical (NLO) microscopy enables quantitative in situ mapping of parchment degradation at the micrometer scale. We introduce two parameters that are sensitive to different degradation stages: the ratio of two-photon excited fluorescence to second harmonic generation (SHG) signals probes severe degradation, while the anisotropy parameter extracted from polarization-resolved SHG measurements is sensitive to early degradation. This approach is first validated by comparing NLO quantitative parameters to thermal measurements on artificially altered contemporary parchments. We then analyze invaluable parchments from the Middle Ages and show that we can map their conservation state and assess the impact of a restoration process. NLO quantitative microscopy should therefore help to identify parchments most at risk and optimize restoration methods.},

Exonuclease III, capable of performing both AP endonuclease and exonuclease activity, are responsible for gap creation in bacteria. We used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to examine the mechanism of gap creation. We found an AP site anchor-based mechanism by which the intrinsically distributive enzyme binds strongly to the AP site and becomes a processive enzyme, rapidly creating a gap and an associated transient ssDNA loop. The gap size is determined by the rigidity of the ssDNA loop and the duplex stability of the DNA and is limited to a few nucleotides to maintain genomic stability. When the 3′ end is released from the AP endonuclease, polymerase I quickly initiates DNA synthesis and fills the gap. Our work provides previously unidentified insights into how a signal of DNA damage changes the enzymatic functions.},

These applications underpin a novel attractor identification algorithm implemented for Boolean networks under stochastic dynamics. Its speed enables resolving a long-standing open question of how attractor count in critical random Boolean networks scales with network size and whether the scaling matches biological observations.

A pharmacological boost of catecholamine levels increased cortex-wide interactions during a visual task, but not rest. An acetylcholine boost decreased interactions during rest, but not task. Cortical circuit modeling explained this dissociation by differential changes in two circuit properties: the local excitation-inhibition balance (more strongly increased by catecholamines) and intracortical transmission (more strongly reduced by acetylcholine). The inferred catecholaminergic mechanism also predicted noisier decision-making, which we confirmed for both perceptual and value-based choice behavior.

We further show that regional transcriptional heterogeneity is essential for yielding both ignition-like dynamics, which are thought to support conscious processing, and a wide variance of regional-activity time scales, which supports a broad dynamical range. We thus identify a key role for E:I heterogeneity in generating complex neuronal dynamics and demonstrate the viability of using transcriptomic data to constrain models of large-scale brain function.},

Foxc2 loss compromised the gut epithelial barrier, promoted dysbiosis and bacterial translocation to peripheral lymph nodes, and increased circulating levels of purine metabolites and angiopoietin-2. Commensal microbiota depletion dampened systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, corrected intestinal lymphatic dysfunction, and improved survival. Foxc2 loss skewed the specialization of lymphatic endothelial subsets, leading to populations with mixed, pro-fibrotic identities and to emergence of lymph node–like endothelial cells. Our study uncovers a cross-talk between lymphatic vascular function and commensal microbiota, provides single-cell atlas of lymphatic endothelial subtypes, and reveals organ-specific and systemic effects of dysfunctional lymphatics. These effects potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, or lymphedema.},

Although the site of life’s emergence continues to be debated, evidence of early life provides insights into its early evolution and metabolic affinity. Here, we present the discovery of exceptionally well-preserved, ~3.42-billion-year-old putative filamentous microfossils that inhabited a paleo-subseafloor hydrothermal vein system of the Barberton greenstone belt in South Africa. The filaments colonized the walls of conduits created by low-temperature hydrothermal fluid. Combined with their morphological and chemical characteristics as investigated over a range of scales, they can be considered the oldest methanogens and/or methanotrophs that thrived in an ultramafic volcanic substrate.},

We investigated how chemotaxing neutrophils probe matrices and adjust their migration to collagen concentration ([col]) changes by tracking 20, 000 cell trajectories and quantifying cell-generated 3D matrix deformations. In low-[col] matrices, neutrophils exerted large deformations and followed straight trajectories. As [col] increased, matrix deformations decreased, and neutrophils turned often to circumvent rather than remodel matrix pores. Inhibiting protrusive or contractile forces shifted this transition to lower [col], implying that mechanics play a crucial role in defining migratory strategies. To balance frequent turning and directional bias, neutrophils used matrix obstacles as pivoting points to steer toward the chemoattractant. The Actin Related Protein 2/3 complex coordinated successive turns, thus controlling deviations from chemotactic paths. These results offer an improved understanding of the mechanisms and molecular regulators used by neutrophils during chemotaxis in restrictive 3D environments.},

However, it is unclear how these activation abnormalities emerge. We propose that aberrant flow of brain activity across functional connectivity (FC) pathways leads to altered activations that produce cognitive dysfunction in SZ. We tested this hypothesis using activity flow mapping, an approach that models the movement of task-related activity between brain regions as a function of FC. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging data from SZ individuals and healthy controls during a working memory task, we found that activity flow models accurately predict aberrant cognitive activations across multiple brain networks. Within the same framework, we simulated a connectivity-based clinical intervention, predicting specific treatments that normalized brain activations and behavior in patients. Our results suggest that dysfunctional task-evoked activity flow is a large-scale network mechanism contributing to cognitive dysfunction in SZ.},

Accordingly, cortical inhibitory interneurons (INs), which shape local network activity, exhibit subtype-specific laminar specificity of synaptic outputs. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Immunoglobulin Superfamily member 11 (IgSF11) homophilic adhesion proteins are preferentially expressed in one of the most distinctive IN subtypes, namely, chandelier cells (ChCs) that specifically innervate axon initial segments of pyramidal neurons (PNs), and their synaptic laminar target. Loss-of-function experiments in either ChCs or postsynaptic cells revealed that IgSF11 is required for ChC synaptic development in the target layer. While overexpression of IgSF11 in ChCs enlarges ChC presynaptic boutons, expressing IgSF11 in nontarget layers induces ectopic ChC synapses. These findings provide evidence that synapse-promoting adhesion proteins, highly localized to synaptic partners, determine the layer-specific synaptic connectivity of the cortical IN subtype.},

Source regions of the volcanic melts consist of imbricated packages of blueschist facies mélanges and depleted peridotites, constituting a new mantle lithosphere formed only 20 to 50 million years earlier during the accretionary convergence of small continental blocks and oceans. This takes place entirely at shallow depths (&lt;80 km) without any deep subduction of continental materials. High Th/La in potassic rocks may indicate shallow sources in accretionary settings even where later obscured by continental collision as in Tibet.

Here, we describe a molecular mechanism by which cells avoid high shear during intravasation. The transition from migration to intravasation was modeled using a microfluidic device where cells migrating inside longitudinal tissue-like microchannels encounter an orthogonal channel in which fluid flow induces physiological shear stresses. This approach was complemented with intravital microscopy, patch-clamp, and signal transduction imaging techniques. Fluid shear–induced activation of the transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) channel promotes extracellular calcium influx, which then activates RhoA/myosin-II and calmodulin/IQGAP1/Cdc42 pathways to coordinate reversal of migration direction, thereby avoiding shear stress. Cells displaying higher shear sensitivity due to higher TRPM7 activity levels intravasate less efficiently and establish less invasive metastatic lesions.

  abstract     = {Silicate glasses have no long-range order and exhibit a short-range order that is often fairly similar to that of their crystalline counterparts. Hence, the out-of-equilibrium nature of glasses is largely encoded in their medium-range order. However, the ring size distribution—the key feature of silicate glasses’ medium-range structure—remains invisible to conventional experiments and, hence, is largely unknown. Here, by combining neutron diffraction experiments and force-enhanced atomic refinement simulations for two archetypical silicate glasses, we show that rings of different sizes exhibit a distinct contribution to the first sharp diffraction peak in the structure factor. On the basis of these results, we demonstrate that the ring size distribution of silicate glasses can be determined solely from neutron diffraction patterns, by analyzing the shape of the first sharp diffraction peak. This method makes it possible to uncover the nature of silicate glasses’ medium-range order.},

A standard task in network analysis is the identification of closely related or densely interconnected nodes. We propose a probabilistic generative model of clustered hypergraphs with heterogeneous node degrees and edge sizes. Approximate maximum likelihood inference in this model leads to a clustering objective that generalizes the popular modularity objective for graphs. From this, we derive an inference algorithm that generalizes the Louvain graph community detection method, and a faster, specialized variant in which edges are expected to lie fully within clusters. Using synthetic and empirical data, we demonstrate that the specialized method is highly scalable and can detect clusters where graph-based methods fail. We also use our model to find interpretable higher-order structure in school contact networks, U.S. congressional bill cosponsorship and committees, product categories in copurchasing behavior, and hotel locations from web browsing sessions.},

  abstract     = {Transfer printing is a technique that integrates heterogeneous materials by readily retrieving functional elements from a grown substrate and subsequently printing them onto a specific target site. These strategies are broadly exploited to construct heterogeneously integrated electronic devices. A typical wet transfer printing method exhibits limitations related to unwanted displacement and shape distortion of the device due to uncontrollable fluid movement and slow chemical diffusion. In this study, a dry transfer printing technique that allows reliable and instant release of devices by exploiting the thermal expansion mismatch between adjacent materials is demonstrated, and computational studies are conducted to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of the dry transfer printing process. Extensive exemplary demonstrations of multiscale, sequential wet-dry, circuit-level, and biological topography-based transfer printing demonstrate the potential of this technique for many other emerging applications in modern electronics that have not been achieved through conventional wet transfer printing over the past few decades.},

To elucidate synchronization mechanisms and inform theoretical models, we recorded the collective display of thousands of Photinus carolinus fireflies in natural swarms, and provide the first spatiotemporal description of the onset of synchronization. At low firefly density, flashes appear uncorrelated. At high density, the swarm produces synchronous flashes within periodic bursts. Using three-dimensional reconstruction, we demonstrate that flash bursts nucleate and propagate across the swarm in a relay-like process. Our results suggest that fireflies interact locally through a dynamic network of visual connections defined by visual occlusion from terrain and vegetation. This model illuminates the importance of the environment in shaping self-organization and collective behavior.},

In an animal model for multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we found that mice with genetic deletion of Piezo1 in T cells showed diminished disease severity. Unexpectedly, Piezo1 was not essential for lymph node homing, interstitial motility, Ca 2+ signaling, T cell proliferation, or differentiation into proinflammatory T helper 1 (T H 1) and T H 17 subsets. However, Piezo1 deletion in T cells resulted in enhanced transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling and an expanded pool of regulatory T (T reg ) cells. Moreover, mice with deletion of Piezo1 specifically in T reg cells showed significant attenuation of EAE. Our results indicate that Piezo1 selectively restrains T reg cells, without influencing activation events or effector T cell functions.},

Potential applications in information carrying, transporting, and processing are expected, and logic circuits based on nonlinear wave interaction are promising for dipole waves. Although similar spin waves are well known in ferromagnetic materials for their roles in some physical essence, electric dipole wave behavior and even its existence in ferroelectric materials are still elusive. Here, we observe the atomic morphology of large-scale dipole waves in PbTiO 3 /SrTiO 3 superlattice mediated by tensile epitaxial strains on scandate substrates. The dipole waves can be expressed in the formula of y = A sin (2π x / L ) + y 0 , where the wave amplitude ( A ) and wavelength ( L ) correspond to 1.5 and 6.6 nm, respectively. This study suggests that by engineering strain at the nanoscale, it should be possible to fabricate unknown polar textures, which could facilitate the development of nanoscale ferroelectric devices.},

Vascular pathologies, such as atherosclerosis, characterized by abnormal mechanical forces are frequently accompanied by endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). However, how forces affect the mechanotransduction pathways controlling cellular plasticity, inflammation, and, ultimately, vessel pathology is poorly understood. Here, we identify a mechanoreceptor that is sui generis for EndMT and unveil a molecular Alk5-Shc pathway that leads to EndMT and atherosclerosis. Depletion of Alk5 abrogates shear stress–induced EndMT responses, and genetic targeting of endothelial Shc reduces EndMT and atherosclerosis in areas of disturbed flow. Tensional force and reconstitution experiments reveal a mechanosensory function for Alk5 in EndMT signaling that is unique and independent of other mechanosensors. Our findings are of fundamental importance for understanding how mechanical forces regulate biochemical signaling, cell plasticity, and vascular disease.},

In turn, guard cell anion channels are seen as key players for stomatal closure, but is activation of these channels sufficient to limit plant water loss? To answer this open question, we used an optogenetic approach based on the light-gated anion channelrhodopsin 1 ( Gt ACR1). In tobacco guard cells that express Gt ACR1, blue- and green-light pulses elicit Cl − and NO 3 − currents of −1 to −2 nA. The anion currents depolarize the plasma membrane by 60 to 80 mV, which causes opening of voltage-gated K + channels and the extrusion of K + . As a result, continuous stimulation with green light leads to loss of guard cell turgor and closure of stomata at conditions that provoke stomatal opening in wild type. Gt ACR1 optogenetics thus provides unequivocal evidence that opening of anion channels is sufficient to close stomata.},

In UCHL1 knockout cells, cellular pyruvate production and ATP levels are diminished, and the activity of AMP–activated protein kinase (AMPK) is highly induced. Consequently, the activated AMPK promotes the mitophagy mediated by Unc-51–like kinase 1 (ULK1) and FUN14 domain–containing 1 (FUNDC1), which underlies the effects of UCHL1 deficiency in rescuing PD-related defects. Furthermore, we identify tripartite motif–containing 63 (TRIM63) as a previously unknown E3 ligase of PKM and demonstrate its antagonistic interaction with UCHL1 to regulate PD-related pathologies. These results suggest that UCHL1 is an integrative factor for connecting glycolysis and PD pathology.},

Consequently, the modified inverted PSCs show an optimal power conversion efficiency of 22.1\% and a very high fill factor (FF) of 0.862, corresponding to 95.4\% of the Shockley-Queisser limited FF (0.904) of PSCs with a 1.59-eV bandgap.

However, the conditions under which such a layer is generated remains unclear. Using numerical models, we here show that a serpentinite layer begins to develop by the slab-derived fluids below the deeper end of the slab-mantle decoupling interface and grows toward the corner of the mantle wedge along the interface under warm subduction conditions only, explaining the large S -wave delay times in the forearc mantle. The serpentinite layer then allows continuous free-fluid flow toward the corner of the mantle wedge, presenting possible mechanisms for the deep nonvolcanic tremors in the forearc mantle.},

In six CAIs, the chemically resistant residues (0.06 to 9.7\% total CAI Sr) show extreme positive μ 84 Sr (up to +80, 655) and 87 Sr variations that cannot be explained by decay of 87 Rb. The extreme 84 Sr but more subdued 87 Sr anomalies are best explained by the presence of a presolar carrier enriched in the p -nuclide 84 Sr. We argue that this unidentified carrier controls the isotopic anomalies in bulk CAIs and outer solar system materials, which reinstates the chronological significance of differences in initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr between CAIs and volatile-depleted inner solar system materials.},

  abstract     = {The complex tumbling motion of spinning nonspherical objects is a topic of enduring interest, both in popular culture and in advanced scientific research. Here, we report all-optical control of the spin, precession, and nutation of vaterite microparticles levitated by counterpropagating circularly polarized laser beams guided in chiral hollow-core fiber. The circularly polarized light causes the anisotropic particles to spin about the fiber axis, while, regulated by minimization of free energy, dipole forces tend to align the extraordinary optical axis of positive uniaxial particles into the plane of rotating electric field. The end result is that, accompanied by oscillatory nutation, the optical axis reaches a stable tilt angle with respect to the plane of the electric field. The results reveal new possibilities for manipulating optical alignment through rotational degrees of freedom, with applications in the control of micromotors and microgyroscopes, laser alignment of polyatomic molecules, and study of rotational cell mechanics.},

Using satellite data and a recent method to disentangle multiscale processes, we find that wind deposits kinetic energy into the geostrophic ocean flow only at scales larger than 260 km, on a global average. We show that wind removes energy from scales smaller than 260 km at an average rate of −50 GW, a process known as eddy killing. To our knowledge, this is the first objective determination of the global eddy killing scale. We find that eddy killing is taking place at almost all times but with seasonal variability, peaking in winter, and it removes a substantial fraction (up to 90\%) of the wind power input in western boundary currents. This process, often overlooked in analyses and models, is a major dissipation pathway for mesoscales, the ocean’s most energetic scales.},

By mapping the clonal composition of thousands of metastases in two clinically relevant sites, the lungs and liver, we found that metastases were highly polyclonal in lungs but not in the liver. Furthermore, the transcriptome of the subclones varied according to their metastatic niche. We also identified a reversible niche-driven signature that was conserved in lung and liver metastases collected during patient autopsies. Among this signature, we found that the tumor necrosis factor–α pathway was up-regulated in lung compared to liver metastases, and inhibition of this pathway affected metastasis diversity. These results highlight that the cellular and molecular heterogeneity observed in metastases is largely dictated by the tumor microenvironment.},

Bottom waters were largely anoxic in the Richardson trough during the entirety of Road River Group deposition, while independent evidence from iron speciation and Mo/U ratios show that the biogeochemical nature of anoxia changed through time. Both in Yukon and globally, Ordovician through Early Devonian anoxic waters were broadly ferruginous (nonsulfidic), with a transition toward more euxinic (sulfidic) conditions in the mid–Early Devonian (Pragian), coincident with the early diversification of vascular plants and disappearance of graptolites. This ~80-million-year interval of the Paleozoic characterized by widespread ferruginous bottom waters represents a persistence of Neoproterozoic-like marine redox conditions well into the Phanerozoic.},

We describe here a previously unexplored approach using active liquids able to sustain levitation in the absence of any external forcing at ambient temperature. We focus on the particular case of carbonated water placed on a superhydrophobic solid and demonstrate how millimetric fizzy drops self-generate a gas cushion that provides levitation on time scales on the order of a minute. Last, we generalize this new regime to different kinds of chemically reactive droplets able to jump from the Cassie-Baxter state to a levitating regime, paving the way to the levitation of nonvolatile liquids.},

Since their discovery 40 years ago, the processes that produce Jupiter’s x-ray flares have remained unknown. Here, we report simultaneous in situ satellite and space-based telescope observations that reveal the processes that produce Jupiter’s x-ray flares, showing surprising similarities to terrestrial ion aurora. Planetary-scale electromagnetic waves are observed to modulate electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves, periodically causing heavy ions to precipitate and produce Jupiter’s x-ray pulses. Our findings show that ion aurorae share common mechanisms across planetary systems, despite temporal, spatial, and energetic scales varying by orders of magnitude.},

Here, we show that warming, eO 3 , and their combination induce tradeoffs between roots and their symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and stimulate organic C decomposition in a nontilled soybean agroecosystem. While warming and eO 3 reduced root biomass, tissue density, and AMF colonization, they increased specific root length and promoted decomposition of both native and newly added organic C. Also, they shifted AMF community composition in favor of the genus Paraglomus with high nutrient-absorbing hyphal surface over the genus Glomus prone to protection of soil organic C. Our findings provide deep insights into plant-microbial interactive responses to warming and eO 3 and how these responses may modulate soil organic C dynamics under future climate change scenarios.},

For nitrogen, acidity-driven changes in chemical speciation result in altered partitioning between the gas and particulate phases that subsequently affect long-range transport. Other important nutrients, notably iron and phosphorus, are affected, because their soluble fractions increase upon exposure to acidic environments during atmospheric transport. These changes affect the magnitude, distribution, and deposition mode of individual nutrients supplied to the ocean, the extent to which nutrient deposition interacts with the sea surface microlayer during its passage into bulk seawater, and the relative abundances of soluble nutrients in atmospheric deposition. Atmospheric acidity change therefore affects ecosystem composition, in addition to overall marine productivity, and these effects will continue to evolve with changing anthropogenic emissions in the future.},

Here, using ultrafast pump-probe microscopy, we investigate the possible excitonic insulator Ta 2 NiSe 5 . Below 328 K, we observe the anomalous micrometer-scale propagation of coherent modes at velocities of ~10 5 m/s, which we attribute to the hybridization between phonon modes and the phase mode of the condensate. We develop a theoretical framework to support this explanation and propose that electronic interactions provide a substantial contribution to the ordered phase in Ta 2 NiSe 5 . These results allow us to understand how the condensate’s collective modes transport energy and interact with other degrees of freedom.

Notably, the composition of the gut microbiome in mice fed an isoflavone diet exhibited parallels to healthy human donors, whereas the composition in those fed an isoflavone-free diet exhibited parallels to patients with MS.

Nevertheless, ceramic-based structures, in nature, overcome this limitation using bottom-up complex hierarchical assembly of hard ceramic and soft polymer, where ceramics are packaged with tiny fraction of polymers in an internalized fashion. Here, we propose a far simpler approach of entirely externalizing the soft phase via conformal polymer coating over architected ceramic structures, leading to damage tolerance. Architected structures are printed using silica-filled preceramic polymer, pyrolyzed to stabilize the ceramic scaffolds, and then dip-coated conformally with a thin, flexible epoxy polymer. The polymer-coated architected structures show multifold improvement in compressive strength and toughness while resisting catastrophic failure through a considerable delay of the damage propagation. This surface modification approach allows a simple strategy to build complex ceramic parts that are far more damage-tolerant than their traditional counterparts.},

A key unmet challenge is its limited throughput especially compared to rapid wide-field modalities that are used ubiquitously in thin specimens. Wide-field imaging methods in tissue specimens have found successes in optically cleared tissues and at shallower depths, but the scattering of emission photons in thick turbid samples severely degrades image quality at the camera. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel technique called De-scattering with Excitation Patterning or “DEEP, ” which uses patterned nonlinear excitation followed by computational imaging–assisted wide-field detection. Multiphoton temporal focusing allows high-resolution excitation patterns to be projected deep inside specimen at multiple scattering lengths due to the use of long wavelength light. Computational reconstruction allows high-resolution structural features to be reconstructed from tens to hundreds of DEEP images instead of millions of point-scanning measurements.},

However, the origin and evolution of anaerobic alkane metabolism in the domain Archaea remain controversial. Here, we present evidence that methylotrophic methanogenesis was the ancestral form of this metabolism. Carbon dioxide–reducing methanogenesis developed later through the evolution of tetrahydromethanopterin S -methyltransferase, which linked methanogenesis to the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway for energy conservation. Anaerobic multicarbon alkane metabolisms in Archaea also originated early, with genes coding for the activation of short-chain or even long-chain alkanes likely evolving from an ethane-metabolizing ancestor. These genes were likely horizontally transferred to multiple archaeal clades including Candidatus ( Ca .) Bathyarchaeia, Ca. Lokiarchaeia, Ca. Hadarchaeia, and the methanogenic Ca. Methanoliparia.},

Here, we optimized a vaccine candidate, parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (CVXGA1), and then demonstrated that a single-dose intranasal immunization with CVXGA1 protects against lethal infection of K18-hACE2 mice, a severe disease model. CVXGA1 immunization also prevented virus infection of ferrets and blocked contact transmission. This mucosal vaccine strategy inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in the upper respiratory tract, thus preventing disease progression to the lower respiratory tract.

Mechanistically, MSC-Ex-4 achieved self-augmentation and improved survival under high glucose stress via autocrine activation of the GLP-1R-mediated AMPK signaling pathway. Meanwhile, MSC-Ex-4-secreted Exendin-4 suppressed senescence and apoptosis of pancreatic β cells through endocrine effects, while MSC-Ex-4-secreted bioactive factors (e.g., IGFBP2 and APOM) paracrinely augmented insulin sensitivity and decreased lipid accumulation in hepatocytes through PI3K-Akt activation. Furthermore, we encapsulated MSC-Ex-4 in 3D gelatin microscaffolds for single-dose administration to extend the therapeutic effect for 3 months. Together, our findings provide mechanistic insights into Exendin-4-mediated MSCs self-persistence and antidiabetic activity that offer more effective MSC-based therapy for T2DM.},

Here, we conducted a protein modulation screen to isolate four artificial transmembrane proteins called traptamers that inhibit different steps of HPV entry. By analyzing cells expressing pairs of traptamers, we ordered the trafficking steps during entry into a coherent pathway. One traptamer stimulates ubiquitination of the L2 capsid protein or associated proteins and diverts incoming virus to the lysosome, whereas the others act downstream by preventing sequential passage of the virus through retrograde compartments. Complex genetic interactions between traptamers revealed that a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) on L2 mediates transient insertion of L2 into the endosome membrane, which is stabilized by retromer-L2 binding. These results define the retrograde entry route taken by HPV and show that retromer can play a role in CPP-mediated membrane insertion.},

RKNs are thought to locate hosts through chemotaxis by sensing host-secreted chemoattractants; however, the structures and properties of these attractants are not well understood. Here, we describe a previously unknown RKN attractant from flaxseed mucilage that enhances infection of Arabidopsis and tomato, which resembles the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I). Fucose and galactose sidechains of the purified attractant were found to be required for attractant activity. Furthermore, the disaccharide α- l -galactosyl-1, 3- l -rhamnose, which forms the linkage between the RG-I backbone and galactose sidechains of the purified attractant, was sufficient to attract RKN. These results show that the α- l -galactosyl-1, 3- l -rhamnose linkage in the purified attractant from flaxseed mucilage is essential for RKN attraction. The present work also suggests that nematodes can detect environmental chemicals with high specificity, such as the presence of chiral centers and hydroxyl groups.},

We develop an approach that combines SAXS, x-ray diffraction, and NMR spectroscopy data obtained on individual domains and integrate these through molecular dynamics simulations to interpret SAXS data on the full-length hGHR in nanodiscs. The hGHR domains reorient freely, resulting in a broad structural ensemble, emphasizing the need to take an ensemble view on signaling of relevance to disease states. The structure provides the first experimental model of any full-length cytokine receptor in a lipid membrane and exemplifies how integrating experimental data from several techniques computationally may access structures of membrane proteins with long, disordered regions, a widespread phenomenon in biology.},

We constructed a SARS-CoV-2–induced protein network, based on disease signatures defined by COVID-19 multiomics datasets, and cross-examined these pathways against approved drugs. This analysis identified 200 drugs predicted to target SARS-CoV-2–induced pathways, 40 of which are already in COVID-19 clinical trials, testifying to the validity of the approach. Using artificial neural network analysis, we classified these 200 drugs into nine distinct pathways, within two overarching mechanisms of action (MoAs): viral replication (126) and immune response (74). Two drugs (proguanil and sulfasalazine) implicated in viral replication were shown to inhibit replication in cell assays.

The correlation between suppressed recombination and degeneration is clear in animal XY systems, but the absence of recombination is confounded with other asymmetries between the X and Y. In contrast, UV sex chromosomes, like those found in bryophytes, experience symmetrical population genetic conditions. Here, we generate nearly gapless female and male chromosome-scale reference genomes of the moss Ceratodon purpureus to test for degeneration in the bryophyte UV sex chromosomes. We show that the moss sex chromosomes evolved over 300 million years ago and expanded via two chromosomal fusions. Although the sex chromosomes exhibit weaker purifying selection than autosomes, we find that suppressed recombination alone is insufficient to drive degeneration. Instead, the U and V sex chromosomes harbor thousands of broadly expressed genes, including numerous key regulators of sexual development across land plants.},

With these locomotion modes, the sheet-shaped soft robot can navigate through straight or bent gaps with varying sizes, tortuous channels, and tubes with a flowing fluid inside.

After an electrosyntrophic coculture is formed, electrons are transferred either directly or indirectly (via electron shuttles) from G. metallireducens to R. palustris, thereby providing reducing power and energy for the dark CO 2 fixation. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated the high expression of genes encoding for the extracellular electron transfer pathway in G. metallireducens and the Calvin-Benson-Bassham carbon fixation cycle in R. palustris . Given that sediments constitute one of the most ubiquitous and abundant niches on Earth and that, at depth, most of the sedimentary niche is both anoxic and dark, dark carbon fixation provides a metabolic window for the survival of anoxygenic phototrophs, as well as an as-yet unappreciated contribution to the global carbon cycle.},

Here, we present a sweat pore–inspired perforated e-skin that can effectively suppress sweat accumulation and allow inorganic sensors to obtain physical health information without malfunctioning. The auxetic dumbbell through-hole patterns in perforated e-skins lead to synergistic effects on physical properties including mechanical reliability, conformability, areal mass density, and adhesion to the skin.

Phonon softening and lifetime shortening are found around the charge ordering wave vector. In addition to these self-energy effects, the electron-phonon coupling is probed by its proportionality to the RIXS cross section. We find an enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling around the charge-stripe ordering wave vector upon cooling into the low-temperature tetragonal structure phase.

We report herein a unique color indicator with a static helicity memory, which exhibits visible color changes in response to the chirality of chiral amines. A difference of less than 2\% in the enantiomeric excess (ee) values causes a change in the absorption that is visible to the naked eyes. This was further quantified by digital photography by converting to RGB values. This system relies on the change in the tunable helical pitch of the π-conjugated polymer backbone in specific solvents and allows rapid on-site monitoring of chirality of nonracemic amines, including drugs, and the simultaneous quantitative determination of their ee values.},

Here, we report continuous strengthening in nanotwinned pure Ni with twin thicknesses ranging from 81.0 to 2.9 nm. An unprecedented strength of 4.0 GPa was achieved at extremely fine twin thickness of 2.9 nm, which is about 12 times stronger than that of conventional coarse-grained nickel. This ultrahigh strength arises from the excellent stability of twin boundaries and their strong impedance to dislocation motion. In particular, we find that secondary nanotwins are activated to sustain plastic deformation, which also contribute to the high strength. These results not only advance the understanding of the strengthening mechanisms in nanotwinned metals but also offer an alternative pathway to develop engineering materials with ultrahigh strength.},

Probing the bone microenvironment with enzalutamide led to stronger cancer cell adaptive responses and osteomimicry than bicalutamide.

Although initial repair mechanisms to reseal injured membranes are well established, less is known about how cells restructure damaged membranes in the aftermath to restore homeostasis. Here, we show that cells respond to plasma membrane injury by activating proteins associated with macropinocytosis specifically at the damaged membrane. Subsequent to membrane resealing, cells form large macropinosomes originating from the repair site, which eventually become positive for autophagy-related LC3B protein. This process occurs independent of ULK1, ATG13, and WIPI2 but dependent on ATG7, p62, and Rubicon. Internalized macropinosomes shrink in the cytoplasm, likely by osmotic draining, and eventually fuse with lysosomes. We propose that a form of macropinocytosis coupled to noncanonical autophagy, which we term LC3-associated macropinocytosis (LAM) functions to remove damaged material from the plasma membrane and restore membrane integrity upon injury.},

CENP-A, a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, establishes the foundations for centromere epigenetic memory and kinetochore assembly. It recruits the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), which in turn assembles the microtubule-binding interface. How the specific organization of centromeric chromatin relates to kinetochore assembly and to centromere identity through cell division remains conjectural. Here, we break new ground by reconstituting a functional full-length version of CENP-C, the largest human CCAN subunit and a blueprint of kinetochore assembly. We show that full-length CENP-C, a dimer, binds stably to two nucleosomes and permits further assembly of all other kinetochore subunits in vitro with relative ratios closely matching those of endogenous human kinetochores. Our results imply that human kinetochores emerge from clustering multiple copies of a fundamental module and may have important implications for transgenerational inheritance of centromeric chromatin.},

Here, we show that α-actinin-3 plays a key role in the regulation of protein synthesis and breakdown signaling in skeletal muscle and influences muscle mass from early postnatal development. We also show that α-actinin-3 deficiency reduces the atrophic and anti-inflammatory response to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone in muscle and protects against dexamethasone-induced muscle wasting in female but not male mice. The effects of α-actinin-3 deficiency on muscle mass regulation and response to muscle wasting provide an additional mechanistic explanation for the positive selection of the ACTN3 577X allele in recent human history.},

However, the metastable nature of tumor heterogeneity, which allows cells to transition between strong and weak tumorigenic phenotypes, and the lack of reliable markers of tumor-promoting properties hamper identification of the most relevant cells. To overcome these obstacles, we designed a functional microRNA (miR)–based live-cell reporter assay to identify highly tumorigenic cells in xenotransplants of primary Ewing sarcoma (EwS) 3D cultures. Leveraging the inverse relationship between cell pluripotency and miR-145 expression, we successfully separated highly tumorigenic, metastasis-prone (miR-145 low ) cells from poorly tumorigenic, nonmetastatic (miR-145 high ) counterparts. Gene expression and functional studies of the two cell populations identified the EPHB2 receptor as a prognostic biomarker in patients with EwS and a major promoter of metastasis. Our study provides a simple and powerful means to identify and isolate tumor cells that display aggressive behavior.},

In the absence of mtSSB, transcription from LSP is strongly up-regulated, but no replication primers are formed. Using deep sequencing in a mouse knockout model and biochemical reconstitution experiments with pure proteins, we find that mtSSB is necessary to restrict transcription initiation to optimize RNA primer formation at both origins of mtDNA replication.

This effective medium viscosity is well described by an equation for the viscosity of dilute polymer chains, where the additional viscous dissipation arises because of the presence of the polymer segments. These results shed light on the diffusive behavior of polymer-coated inorganic nanoparticles in complex and crowded biological environments, such as in the joint.},

An important feature of deformable conductors is their electrical response to strain. While development of stretchable materials with high gauge factors has attracted considerable attention, there is a growing need for stretchable conductors whose response to deformation can be accurately engineered to provide arbitrary resistance-strain relationships. Rare studies addressing this issue have focused on deterministic geometries of single rigid materials, limiting the scope of these strategies. We introduce the novel concept of periodic stretchable patterns combining multiple conductive materials to produce tailored responses. Using shortest path algorithms, we establish a computationally efficient selection method to obtain the required resistance-strain relationship. Using this algorithm, we identify and experimentally demonstrate constant resistance-strain responses up to 50\% elongation using a single microtextured material. Last, we demonstrate counterintuitive sinusoidal responses by integrating three materials, with interesting applications in sensing and soft robotics.},

In contrast with the classical paradigm, we found that increased COUP-TFI expression expands MEC, creating protrusions and disconnected ectopic tissue. We further developed a mathematical model that predicts that neuronal specification and differential cell affinity contribute to the emergence of an instability region and boundary sharpness. Correspondingly, we demonstrated that high expression of COUP-TFI induces MEC cell fate and protocadherin 19 expression. Thus, we conclude that a sharp boundary requires a subtle interplay between patterning transcription factors and differential cell affinity.},

After 100 days of evolution, triplicate populations exhibit no observable escape and exhibit normal growth rates at 10-fold lower BipA concentration than the ancestral synthetic auxotroph. Allelic reconstruction reveals the contribution of three genes to increased fitness at low BipA concentrations. Based on its evolutionary stability, we introduce the progenitor strain directly to mammalian cell culture and observe containment of bacteria without detrimental effects on HEK293T cells. Overall, our findings reveal that synthetic auxotrophy is effective on time scales and in contexts that enable diverse applications.},

  abstract     = {Millions of putative transcriptional regulatory elements (TREs) have been cataloged in the human genome, yet their functional relevance in specific pathophysiological settings remains to be determined. This is critical to understand how oncogenic transcription factors (TFs) engage specific TREs to impose transcriptional programs underlying malignant phenotypes. Here, we combine cutting edge CRISPR screens and epigenomic profiling to functionally survey ≈15, 000 TREs engaged by estrogen receptor (ER). We show that ER exerts its oncogenic role in breast cancer by engaging TREs enriched in GATA3, TFAP2C, and H3K27Ac signal. These TREs control critical downstream TFs, among which TFAP2C plays an essential role in ER-driven cell proliferation. Together, our work reveals novel insights into a critical oncogenic transcription program and provides a framework to map regulatory networks, enabling to dissect the function of the noncoding genome of cancer cells.},

Here, we report that premature senescence occurs in the mouse neuroepithelium and disrupts neurulation, leading to NTDs in diabetic pregnancy. Premature senescence and NTDs were abolished by knockout of the transcription factor Foxo3a , the miR-200c gene, and the cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27 ; transgenic expression of the dominant-negative FoxO3a mutant; or the senomorphic rapamycin. Double transgenic expression of p21 and p27 mimicked maternal diabetes in inducing premature neuroepithelium senescence and NTDs.

We use a new class of satellite measurements acquired during several days in 2019 and 2020 to perform the first regional-scale and high-resolution survey of methane sources in the Permian. We find an unexpectedly large number of extreme point sources (37 plumes with emission rates &gt;500 kg hour −1 ), which account for a range between 31 and 53\% of the estimated emissions in the sampled area. Our analysis reveals that new facilities are major emitters in the area, often due to inefficient flaring operations (20\% of detections).

Sensor response for cortisol concentrations between 1 and 15 μg/dl in buffer solution was recorded, and a limit of detection of 0.5 μg/dl was achieved. Last, 65 human serum samples were collected to compare the response from human serum samples with results from the standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Similar functionals were also enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) detected by single-cell transcriptome of both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This result can be explained by the significant enrichment of high-damage genes in the DEGs of neurons for both AD and ASD.

Conversely, vocal development in nonhuman primates has been assumed to be largely predetermined and completed within the first postnatal months. Contradicting this assumption, we found a dichotomy between the development of call features and vocal sequences in marmoset monkeys, suggestive of a role for experience. While changes in call features were related to physical maturation, sequences of and transitions between calls remained flexible until adulthood. As in humans, marmoset vocal behavior developed in stages correlated with motor and social development stages. These findings are evidence for a prolonged phase of plasticity during marmoset vocal development, a crucial primate evolutionary preadaptation for the emergence of vocal learning and speech.},

Neuronal adhesion is regulated by the Mowat-Wilson syndrome-associated transcription factor Zeb2 (Sip1/Zfhx1b) through direct repression of independent adhesion pathways controlled by Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) and Cadherin-6 (Cdh6). We reveal that to initiate radial migration, neurons must first suppress adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Zeb2 regulates the multipolar stage by transcriptional repression of Nrp1 and thereby downstream inhibition of integrin signaling. Upon completion of migration, neurons undergo an orientation process that is independent of migration. The parallel organization of neurons within the neocortex is controlled by Cdh6 through atypical regulation of integrin signaling via its RGD motif. Our data shed light on the mechanisms that regulate initiation of radial migration and the postmigratory orientation of neurons during neocortical development.},

Our results show that PI3K is activated by both the p85-mediated insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and Ras-mediated fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. On the other hand, PI3K also promotes extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) signaling via a direct interaction with Ras. Both PI3K and ERK are upstream regulators of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and, together, they prevent expansion of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor expression from the lacrimal gland stalk to the bud region. We further show that this suppression of EGF signaling is necessary for induction of lacrimal gland buds. These results reveal that the interplay between PI3K, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and mTOR mediates the cross-talk among FGF, IGF, and EGF signaling in support of lacrimal gland development.},

We show that live biomass has removed 4.9 to 5.5 PgC year −1 from the atmosphere, offsetting 4.6 ± 0.1 PgC year −1 of gross emissions from disturbances and adding substantially (0.23 to 0.88 PgC year −1 ) to the global carbon stocks. Gross emissions and removals in the tropics were four times larger than temperate and boreal ecosystems combined.

Our observations draw a new picture of the cell cortex as a highly dynamic layer, harboring large fluctuations in its third dimension because of actomyosin contractility.

Neurons in higher visual areas also exhibit FGM and optogenetic silencing of higher areas reduced FGM in V1. In V1, figures elicited higher activity of vasoactive intestinal peptide–expressing (VIP) interneurons than the background, whereas figures suppressed somatostatin-positive interneurons, resulting in an increased activation of pyramidal cells.

P. yoelii –infected mice had elevated gastric pH. Stimulation of gastric acid secretion during P. yoelii infection restored stomach acidity and colonization resistance, demonstrating that parasite-induced hypochlorhydria increases gastric survival of S. Typhimurium. Furthermore, blockade of P. yoelii –induced TNF-α signaling was sufficient to prevent elevation of gastric pH and enhance S. Typhimurium colonization during concurrent infection.

  abstract     = {Although intermetallics are attractive for their high strength, many of them are often brittle at room temperature, thereby severely limiting their potential as structural materials. Here, we report on a previously unidentified deformable nanocrystalline CoAl intermetallics with Co-rich thick grain boundaries (GBs). In situ micropillar compression studies show that nanocrystalline CoAl with thick GBs exhibits ultrahigh yield strength, exceeding 4.5 gigapascals. Unexpectedly, nanocrystalline CoAl intermetallics also show prominent work hardening to a flow stress of 5.7 gigapascals up to 20\% compressive strain. Transmission electron microscopy studies show that deformation induces abundant dislocations inside CoAl grains with thick GBs, which accommodate plastic deformation. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the Co-rich thick GBs play a vital role in promoting nucleation of dislocations at the Co/CoAl interfaces, thereby enhancing the plasticity of the intermetallics. This study provides a perspective to promoting the plasticity of intermetallics via the introduction of thick GBs.},

We hypothesized that providing anti-inflammatory cytokines in dystrophic muscle would promote proregenerative immune phenotypes and improve function. Primary T cells from dystrophic (mdx) mice responded appropriately to inflammatory or suppressive cytokines. Subsequently, interleukin-4 (IL-4)– or IL-10–conjugated gold nanoparticles (PA4, PA10) were injected into chronically injured, aged, mdx muscle. PA4 and PA10 increased T cell recruitment, with PA4 doubling CD4 + /CD8 − T cells versus controls. Further, 50\% of CD4 + /CD8 − T cells were immunosuppressive T regs following PA4, versus 20\% in controls. Concomitant with T reg recruitment, muscles exhibited increased fiber area and fourfold increases in contraction force and velocity versus controls. The ability of PA4 to shift immune responses, and improve dystrophic muscle function, suggests that immunomodulatory treatment may benefit many genetically diverse muscular dystrophies, all of which share inflammatory pathology.},

Here, we report a new type of light-based tweezers, termed opto-refrigerative tweezers, which exploit solid-state optical refrigeration and thermophoresis to trap particles and molecules at the laser-generated cold region. While laser refrigeration can avoid photothermal heating, the use of a weakly focused laser beam can further reduce the photodamages to the target object. This novel and noninvasive optical tweezing technique will bring new possibilities in the optical control of nanomaterials and biomolecules for essential applications in nanotechnology, photonics, and life science.},

However, the overall architecture of the fully assembled translocation machinery and the composition of the central secretion pore have remained unknown. Here, we present the high-resolution structure of the 2.1-megadalton ESX-5 core complex. Our structure captured a dynamic, secretion-competent conformation of the pore within a well-defined transmembrane section, sandwiched between two flexible protein layers at the cytosolic entrance and the periplasmic exit. We propose that this flexibility endows the ESX-5 machinery with large conformational plasticity required to accommodate targeted protein secretion. Compared to known secretion systems, a highly dynamic state of the pore may represent a fundamental principle of bacterial secretion machineries.},

Here, we show, in a three-dimensional in vitro BBB microvascular model, that astrocytes promote cancer cell transmigration via their secretion of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). We found that this chemokine, produced primarily by astrocytes, promoted the chemotaxis and chemokinesis of cancer cells via their C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2), with no notable changes in vascular permeability. These findings were validated in vivo, where CCR2-deficient cancer cells exhibited significantly reduced rates of arrest and transmigration in mouse brain capillaries.

By applying photo- and soft lithography fabrication, we have developed a device that features thin, flexible electronics and integrated fluidic channels. This device can be rolled up into the shape of a standard percutaneous needle then implanted on the site of interest before being expanded in situ, unfurling into its paddle-type conformation. The device and implantation procedure have been validated in vitro and on human cadaver models.

Here, we report the effects of interfaces on radiation-induced phase transformation and chemical composition changes in SiC-Ti 3 SiC 2 -TiC x multilayer materials based on combined transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis and first-principles calculations. We found that the undesirable phase transformation of Ti 3 SiC 2 is substantially enhanced near the SiC/Ti 3 SiC 2 interface, and it is suppressed near the Ti 3 SiC 2 /TiC interface. The results have been explained by ab initio calculations of trends in defect segregation to the above interfaces.

These routes are of vital significance in starting a chain of chemical reactions ultimately forming (organo) sulfur molecules—among them precursors to sulfur-bearing amino acids and grains. Here, we expose via laboratory experiments, computations, and astrochemical modeling that the silicon-sulfur chemistry can be initiated through the gas-phase reaction of atomic silicon with hydrogen sulfide leading to silicon monosulfide (SiS) via nonadiabatic reaction dynamics. The facile pathway to the simplest silicon and sulfur diatomic provides compelling evidence for the origin of silicon monosulfide in star-forming regions and aids our understanding of the nonadiabatic reaction dynamics, which control the outcome of the gas-phase formation in deep space, thus expanding our view about the life cycle of sulfur in the galaxy.},

Here, we developed a multi-tissue epigenetic clock and applied it, together with other aging clocks, to track changes in biological age during mouse and human prenatal development. This analysis revealed a significant decrease in biological age, i.e., rejuvenation, during early stages of embryogenesis, followed by an increase in later stages. We further found that pluripotent stem cells do not age even after extensive passaging and that the examined epigenetic age dynamics is conserved across species. Overall, this study uncovers a natural rejuvenation event during embryogenesis and suggests that the minimal biological age (ground zero) marks the beginning of organismal aging.},

The role of surface structures on bubble evolution and CHF enhancement remains unclear because of the lack of direct visualization of the liquid- and solid-vapor interfaces. Here, we use high-magnification in-liquid endoscopy to directly probe bubble behavior during boiling. We report the previously unidentified coexistence of two distinct three-phase contact lines underneath growing bubbles on structured surfaces, resulting in retention of a thin liquid film within the structures between the two contact lines due to their disparate advancing velocities. This finding sheds light on a previously unidentified mechanism governing bubble evolution on structured surfaces, which has notable implications for a variety of real systems using bubble formation, such as thermal management, microfluidics, and electrochemical reactors.},

It is unclear to what extent aerosols generated by wind instruments contribute to exposure because their fate is dependent on the airflow onstage. We use transient, second-order accurate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and quantitative microbial risk assessment to estimate aerosol concentrations and the associated risk and assess strategies to mitigate exposure in two distinct concert venues. Mitigation strategies involved rearranging musicians and altering the airflow by changing HVAC settings, opening doors, and introducing flow-directing geometries. Our results indicate that the proposed mitigation strategies can reduce aerosol concentrations in the breathing zone by a factor of 100, corresponding to a similar decrease in the probability of infection.},

Nevus-resident CD4 + T helper 1 cells, which exhibited a massive clonal expansion to melanocyte-specific antigens, were responsible for nevus rejection. Boosting regulatory T cell suppressive function with low-dose exogenous human interleukin-2 injection or treatment with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II–blocking antibody prevented nevus rejection. Notably, mice with rejected nevus PDXs were protected from melanoma tumor growth. We detected a parallel CD4 + T cell–dominant immunity in clinically regressing melanocytic nevi.

We found that silencing the bilateral dlPFC-MDl projections, but not the dlPFC-dCD projections, impaired performance in a spatial working memory task. Conversely, silencing the unilateral dlPFC-dCD projection, but not the unilateral dlPFC-MDl projection, altered preference in a decision-making task.

In this bimetallic hydrogel system, zinc and copper ions could not only act as crosslinkers but also provide strong antibacterial effects and induce regenerative capacity in vitro. The capability of hydrogels in simultaneously promoting tenogenesis and osteogenesis was further verified in a rat rotator cuff tear model. It was found that the Cu/Zn gradient layer could induce considerable collagen and fibrocartilage arrangement and ingrowth at the tendon-to-bone interface.

Recently, lactate was shown to modify histones of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–activated macrophages in a time-dependent way and promote the expression of genes linked to tissue repair, including arginase-1 (Arg1). We tested the interrelationships between histone lactylation (Kla) and tissue reparative gene expression and found that Kla was uncoupled from changes in gene expression linked to resolving M2 macrophage activation but correlated with Arg1 expression. LPS-induced Arg1 was instead dependent on autocrine-paracrine interleukin-6 (IL6) production, the IL6 receptor, and Stat3 signal transduction. We found that Kla increases as macrophages prepare to die under inflammatory stress, and Kla was absent in macrophages that cannot generate reactive nitrogen or have defects in diverse macrophage death pathways. Thus, Kla is a consequence rather than a cause of macrophage activation but occurs coincidently with an IL6- and Arg1-dependent metabolic rewiring under inflammatory duress.},

Astrocyte reprogramming has recently received much attention as an avenue for increasing functional dopaminergic neurons in the mouse PD brain. By targeting a microRNA (miRNA) loop, astrocytes in the mouse brain could be reprogrammed into functional dopaminergic neurons. Such in vivo astrocyte reprogramming in the mouse model of PD has successfully added new dopaminergic neurons to the substantia nigra and increased dopamine levels associated with axonal projections into the striatum. This review deliberates the astrocyte reprogramming methods using specific transcription factors and mRNAs and the progress in generating dopaminergic neurons in vivo.

Beyond the nervous system, a fundamental question is whether other organs also communicate their proteostasis status to distal tissues. Here, we examine whether proteostasis of the germ line influences somatic tissues. To this end, we induce aggregation of germline-specific PGL-1 protein in germline stem cells of Caenorhabditis elegans . Besides altering the intracellular mitochondrial network of germline cells, PGL-1 aggregation also reduces the mitochondrial content of somatic tissues through long-range Wnt signaling pathway. This process induces the unfolded protein response of the mitochondria in the soma, promoting somatic mitochondrial fragmentation and aggregation of proteins linked with neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Thus, the proteostasis status of germline stem cells coordinates mitochondrial networks and protein aggregation through the organism.},

Here, we show that the intracellular bacterial pathogen Rickettsia parkeri uses two protein-lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) to modify outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and prevent their ubiquitylation. Mutants deficient in the PKMTs were avirulent in mice and failed to grow in macrophages because of ubiquitylation and autophagic targeting. Lysine methylation protected the abundant surface protein OmpB from ubiquitin-dependent depletion from the bacterial surface. Analysis of the lysine-methylome revealed that PKMTs modify a subset of OMPs, including OmpB, by methylation at the same sites that are modified by host ubiquitin. These findings show that lysine methylation is an essential determinant of rickettsial pathogenesis that shields bacterial proteins from ubiquitylation to evade autophagic targeting.},

Here, we directly observe the nuclear dynamics accompanying the SEF process in single crystal pentacene using femtosecond electron diffraction. The data reveal coherent atomic motions at 1 THz, incoherent motions, and an anisotropic lattice distortion representing the polaronic character of the triplet excitons. Combining molecular dynamics simulations, time-dependent density-functional theory, and experimental structure factor analysis, the coherent motions are identified as collective sliding motions of the pentacene molecules along their long axis. Such motions modify the excitonic coupling between adjacent molecules. Our findings reveal that long-range motions play a decisive part in the electronic decoupling of the electronically correlated triplet pairs and shed light on why SEF occurs on ultrafast time scales.},

Here, we introduced an ultrathin silver (Ag) film as transparent electrode and conducted systematic modal analysis of OLEDs and report that waveguide mode can be completely eliminated by designing an OLED structure that is below the cutoff thickness of waveguide modes. We also experimentally verified the waveguide mode removal in organic waveguides with the help of index-matching fluid and prism. The negative permittivity, extremely thin thickness (~5 nanometers), and highly conductive properties achieved by a uniform copper-seeded Ag film can suppress waveguide mode formation, enhancing external quantum efficiency without compromising any other characteristics of OLEDs, which paves the way for cost-effective high-efficiency OLEDs in current display industry.},

Previous studies attributed these changes to high-latitude atmospheric dynamics, stratospheric ozone change, and tropical sea surface temperature anomalies. We show that up to 20 to 40\% of the observed summer cooling trend in East Antarctica was forced by decadal changes of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO). Both observational analysis and climate model experiments indicate that the decadal changes in the MJO, characterized by less (more) atmospheric deep convection in the Indian Ocean (western Pacific) during the recent two decades, led to the net cooling trend over East Antarctica through modifying atmospheric circulations linked to poleward-propagating Rossby wave trains. This study highlights that changes in intraseasonal tropical climate patterns may result in important climate change over Antarctica.},

However, it remains elusive how the viral genome specifically interacts with the host genome and hijacks host transcription machinery. Using pseudorabies virus (PRV) as model virus, we performed chromosome conformation capture assays to demonstrate a genome-wide specific trans-species chromatin interaction between the virus and host. Our data show that the PRV genome is delivered by the host DNA binding protein RUNX1 into the open chromatin and active transcription zone. This facilitates virus hijacking host RNAPII to efficiently transcribe viral genes, which is significantly inhibited by either a RUNX1 inhibitor or RNA interference. Together, these findings provide insights into the chromatin interaction between viral and host genomes and identify new areas of research to advance the understanding of herpesvirus genome transcription.},

  abstract     = {Pancreatic β cell therapy for type 1 diabetes is limited by low cell survival rate owing to physical stress and aggressive host immune response. In this study, we demonstrate a multilayer hydrogel nanofilm caging strategy capable of protecting cells from high shear stress and reducing immune response by interfering cell-cell interaction. Hydrogel nanofilm is fabricated by monophenol-modified glycol chitosan and hyaluronic acid that cross-link each other to form a nanothin hydrogel film on the cell surface via tyrosinase-mediated reactions. Furthermore, hydrogel nanofilm formation was conducted on mouse β cell spheroids for the islet transplantation application. The cytoprotective effect against physical stress and the immune protective effect were evaluated. Last, caged mouse β cell spheroids were transplanted into the type 1 diabetes mouse model and successfully regulated its blood glucose level. Overall, our enzymatic cross-linking–based hydrogel nanofilm caging method will provide a new platform for clinical applications of cell-based therapies.},

By specifically targeting the universal hydrolysate inhibitors, a single strain is enhanced to tolerate a broad diversity of highly toxified genuine feedstocks and consistently achieve industrial-scale titers (cellulosic ethanol of &gt;100 grams per liter when toxified). Furthermore, a functionally orthogonal, lightweight design enables seamless transferability to existing metabolically engineered chassis strains: We endow full, multifeedstock tolerance on a xylose-consuming strain and one producing the biodegradable plastics precursor lactic acid.

  abstract     = {Sea level and deep-sea temperature variations are key indicators of global climate changes. For continuous records over millions of years, deep-sea carbonate microfossil–based δ 18 O (δ c ) records are indispensable because they reflect changes in both deep-sea temperature and seawater δ 18 O (δ w ); the latter are related to ice volume and, thus, to sea level changes. Deep-sea temperature is usually resolved using elemental ratios in the same benthic microfossil shells used for δ c , with linear scaling of residual δ w to sea level changes. Uncertainties are large and the linear-scaling assumption remains untested. Here, we present a new process-based approach to assess relationships between changes in sea level, mean ice sheet δ 18 O, and both deep-sea δ w and temperature and find distinct nonlinearity between sea level and δ w changes. Application to δ c records over the past 40 million years suggests that Earth’s climate system has complex dynamical behavior, with threshold-like adjustments (critical transitions) that separate quasi-stable deep-sea temperature and ice-volume states.},

However, fully passive and uninterrupted 24-hour atmospheric water harvesting remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a rationally designed system that synergistically combines radiative shielding and cooling—dissipating the latent heat of condensation radiatively to outer space—with a fully passive superhydrophobic condensate harvester, working with a coalescence-induced water removal mechanism. A rationally designed shield, accounting for the atmospheric radiative heat, facilitates daytime atmospheric water harvesting under solar irradiation at realistic levels of relative humidity. The remarkable cooling power enhancement enables dew mass fluxes up to 50 g m −2 hour −1 , close to the ultimate capabilities of such systems. Our results demonstrate that the yield of related technologies can be at least doubled, while cooling and collection remain passive, thereby substantially advancing the state of the art.},

We found that elevation of serum glucagon levels stimulates cyclic adenosine monophosphate production and activates hepatic protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in TB mice. In turn, we found that PKA targets and destabilizes the circadian protein REV-ERBα, a negative transcriptional regulator of gluconeogenic genes, resulting in heightened de novo glucose production.

Here, we have used an innovative bone-targeting (BonTarg) technology to generate a first-in-class bone-targeting antibody. Our strategy involves the use of pClick antibody conjugation technology to chemically couple the bone-targeting moiety bisphosphonate to therapeutic antibodies. Bisphosphonate modification of these antibodies results in the delivery of higher conjugate concentrations to the bone metastatic niche, relative to other tissues. In xenograft mice models, this strategy provides enhanced inhibition of bone metastases and multiorgan secondary metastases that arise from bone lesions. Specific delivery of therapeutic antibodies to the bone, therefore, represents a promising strategy for the treatment of bone metastatic cancers and other bone diseases.},

These have a characteristic 4π-periodic current phase relation (CΦR) that leads to twice the conventional Shapiro step separation voltage in radio frequency–dependent measurements. In this context, we identify an attenuated first Shapiro step in (Bi 0.06 Sb 0.94 ) 2 Te 3 (BST) Josephson junctions with AlO x capping layer. We further investigate junctions on narrow, selectively deposited BST nanoribbons, where surface charges are confined to the perimeter of the nanoribbon. Within these junctions, previously identified signatures of gapless bound states are absent. Because of confinement, transverse momentum sub-bands are quantized and a topological gap opening is observed. Surface states within these quantized sub-bands are spin degenerate, which evokes bound states of conventional 2π-periodic CΦR within the BST nanoribbon weak link.},

HYLS1 is recruited to the ciliary base via a direct interaction with the type Iγ phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] 5-kinase (PIPKIγ). HYLS1 activates PIPKIγ by interrupting the autoinhibitory dimerization of PIPKIγ, which thereby expedites depletion of centrosomal PI(4)P to allow axoneme nucleation. HYLS1 deficiency interrupts the assembly of ciliary NPHP module and agonist-induced ciliary exit of β-arrestin, which, in turn, disturbs the removal of ciliary Gpr161 and activation of hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Consistent with this model of pathogenesis, the HLS mutant HYLS1 D211G supports ciliogenesis but not activation of Hh signaling. These results implicate mammalian HYLS1 as a multitasking protein that facilitates ciliogenesis and ciliary signaling by coordinating with the ciliary lipid kinase PIPKIγ.},

Here, we show that postdamming greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the Belo Monte area are up to three times higher than preimpoundment fluxes and equivalent to about 15 to 55 kg CO 2 eq MWh −1 . Since per-area emissions in Amazonian reservoirs are significantly higher than global averages, reducing flooded areas and prioritizing the power density of hydropower plants seem to effectively reduce their carbon footprints. Nevertheless, total GHG emissions are substantial even from this leading-edge ROR power plant. This argues in favor of avoiding hydropower expansion in Amazonia regardless of the reservoir type.},

  abstract     = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes a large burden of morbidity in young children and the elderly. Spatial variability in the timing of RSV epidemics provides an opportunity to probe the factors driving its transmission, including factors that influence epidemic seeding and growth rates. Using hospitalization data from Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York, we estimated epidemic timing at the ZIP code level using harmonic regression and then used a Bayesian meta-regression model to evaluate correlates of epidemic timing. Earlier epidemics were associated with larger household size and greater population density. Nearby localities had similar epidemic timing. Our results suggest that RSV epidemics grow faster in areas with more local contact opportunities, and that epidemic spread follows a spatial diffusion process based on geographic proximity. Our findings can inform the timing of delivery of RSV extended half-life prophylaxis and maternal vaccines and guide future studies on the transmission dynamics of RSV.},

Group 3 medulloblastoma (MB) is a malignant childhood brain cancer with poor prognosis and few candidates as putative cell of origin. We overexpressed the group 3 MB genetic drivers MYC and Gfi1 in different candidate cells of origin in the postnatal mouse cerebellum. We found that S100b + cells are competent to initiate group 3 MB, and we observed that S100b + cells have higher levels of Notch1 pathway activity compared to Math1 + cells. We found that additional activation of Notch1 in Math1 + and Sox2 + cells was sufficient to induce group 3 MB upon MYC / Gfi1 expression. Together, our data suggest that the Notch1 pathway plays a critical role in group 3 MB initiation.},

However, one long-standing puzzle is the apparent absence of the onset of the Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) cold event around 18 ka in Greenland ice core oxygen isotope δ 18 O records, inconsistent with other proxies. Here, combining proxy records with an isotope-enabled transient deglacial simulation, we propose that a substantial HS1 cooling onset did indeed occur over the Arctic in winter. However, this cooling signal in the depleted oxygen isotopic composition is completely compensated by the enrichment because of the loss of winter precipitation in response to sea ice expansion associated with AMOC slowdown during extreme glacial climate. In contrast, the Arctic summer warmed during HS1 and YD because of increased insolation and greenhouse gases, consistent with snowline reconstructions. Our work suggests that Greenland δ 18 O may substantially underestimate temperature variability during cold glacial conditions.},

A metasurface is a planar structure that can control light in a desired manner, which, however, has a limited number of controlled DOFs (≤4) in the Jones matrix. Here, we propose a metasurface design strategy to construct a Jones matrix with six DOFs, approaching the upper-limit number of a 2D planar structure. We experimentally demonstrate several polarization functionalities that can only be achieved with high (five or six) DOFs of the Jones matrix, such as polarization elements with independent amplitude and phase tuning along its fast and slow axes, triple-channel complex-amplitude holography, and triple sets of printing-hologram integrations. Our work provides a platform to design arbitrary complex polarization elements, which paves the way to a broader exploitation of polarization optics.},

Despite its importance as a drug target, the molecular activation mechanism of CCR5, i.e., how chemokine agonists transduce the activation signal through the receptor, is yet unknown. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of wild-type CCR5 in an active conformation bound to the chemokine super-agonist [6P4]CCL5 and the heterotrimeric G i protein. The structure provides the rationale for the sequence-activity relation of agonist and antagonist chemokines. The N terminus of agonist chemokines pushes onto specific structural motifs at the bottom of the orthosteric pocket that activate the canonical GPCR microswitch network. This activation mechanism differs substantially from other CC chemokine receptors that bind chemokines with shorter N termini in a shallow binding mode involving unique sequence signatures and a specialized activation mechanism.},

Hormonal changes have long been known to drive both physical and behavioral changes during adolescence, leading to the largely untested assumption that sexuality emerges from organizational changes to neuronal circuitry. We show that the transition to sexuality in male Drosophila is controlled by hormonal changes, but this regulation is functional rather than structural. In very young males, a broadly acting hormone directly inhibits the activity of three courtship-motivating circuit elements, ensuring the complete suppression of sexual motivation and behavior. Blocking or overriding these inhibitory mechanisms evokes immediate and robust sexual behavior from very young and otherwise asexual males. Similarities to mammalian adolescence suggest a general principle in which hormonal changes gate the transition to sexuality not by constructing new circuitry but by permitting activity in otherwise latent motivational circuit elements.},

Advancing the TPCA analysis to infer associations de novo, we build a time-resolved portrait of thousands of host-host, virus-host, and virus-virus PPIs. We demonstrate that, early in infection, the DNA sensor IFI16 recruits the active DNA damage response kinase, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), to incoming viral DNA at the nuclear periphery. We establish IFI16 T149 as a substrate of DNA-PK upon viral infection or DNA damage. This phosphorylation promotes IFI16-driven cytokine responses. Together, we characterize the global dynamics of PPIs during HSV-1 infection, uncovering the co-regulation of IFI16 and DNA-PK functions as a missing link in immunity to herpesvirus infection.},

The same loci used repeatedly in extant populations also show rapid allele frequency changes when new freshwater populations are experimentally established from marine ancestors. Marked genotypic and phenotypic changes arise within 5 years, facilitated by standing genetic variation and linkage between adaptive regions. Both the speed and location of changes can be predicted using empirical observations of recurrence in natural populations or fundamental genomic features like allelic age, recombination rates, density of divergent loci, and overlap with mapped traits. A composite model trained on these stickleback features can also predict the location of key evolutionary loci in Darwin’s finches, suggesting that similar features are important for evolution across diverse taxa.},

It is therefore critical to understand how Aβ pathology is initiated and where and when distinct Aβ species aggregate. Here, we used metabolic isotope labeling in APP NL-G-F knock-in mice together with mass spectrometry imaging to monitor the earliest seeds of Aβ deposition through ongoing plaque development. This allowed visualizing Aβ aggregation dynamics within single plaques across different brain regions. We show that formation of structurally distinct plaques is associated with differential Aβ peptide deposition. Specifically, Aβ1-42 is forming an initial core structure followed by radial outgrowth and late secretion and deposition of Aβ1-38. These data describe a detailed picture of the earliest events of precipitating amyloid pathology at scales not previously possible.},

In the rat superficial presubiculum, we find that inhibition by fast-spiking interneurons is organized in the form of a dominant super-reciprocal microcircuit motif where multiple pyramidal cells recurrently inhibit each other via a single interneuron. Multineuron recordings and subsequent 3D reconstructions and analysis further show that this nonrandom connectivity arises from an asymmetric, polarized morphology of fast-spiking interneuron axons, which individually cover different directions in the same volume. Network simulations assuming topographically organized input demonstrate that such polarized inhibition can improve head direction tuning of pyramidal cells in comparison to a “blanket of inhibition.” We propose that structured inhibition based on asymmetrical axons is an overarching spatial connectivity principle for tailored computation across brain regions.},

Analyses of the dynamics trajectories reveal that the activation process occurs in the semiquinone state FAD −● , resulting from excited-state electron transfer. The Arg 381 -Asp 410 salt bridge acts as an allosteric switch, regulated by the change in the redox state of FAD. In turn, Asp 410 forms new hydrogen bonds, connecting allosteric networks of the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal domains initially separated in the resting state. The expansion to a global dynamic network leads to enhanced protein fluctuations, an increase in the radius of gyration, and the expulsion of the carboxyl-terminal tail. These structural features are in accord with mutations and spectroscopic experiments.},

Here, we report SO 2 flux and plume height data retrieved from TROPOMI satellite imagery before, during, and after the 9 December 2019 eruption of Whakaari/White Island volcano, New Zealand, which resulted in 22 fatalities and numerous injuries. We show that SO 2 was detected without explosive activity on separate days before and after the explosion, and that fluxes increased from 10 to 45 kg/s ~40 min before the explosion itself. High temporal resolution gas monitoring from space can provide key insights into magmatic degassing processes globally, aiding understanding of eruption precursors and complementing ground-based monitoring.},

  abstract     = {Plants have a high ability to cope with changing environments and grow continuously throughout life. However, the mechanisms by which plants strike a balance between stress response and organ growth remain elusive. Here, we found that DNA double-strand breaks enhance the accumulation of cytokinin hormones through the DNA damage signaling pathway in the Arabidopsis root tip. Our data showed that activation of cytokinin signaling suppresses the expression of some of the PIN-FORMED genes that encode efflux carriers of another hormone, auxin, thereby decreasing the auxin signals in the root tip and causing cell cycle arrest at G 2 phase and stem cell death. Elevated cytokinin signaling also promotes an early transition from cell division to endoreplication in the basal part of the root apex. We propose that plant hormones spatially coordinate differential DNA damage responses, thereby maintaining genome integrity and minimizing cell death to ensure continuous root growth.},

A spin flip relative to this “spin-ice” manifold can fractionalize into two oppositely charged magnetic monopoles with effective Coulomb interactions. To understand this process, we have probed the low-temperature magnetic response of spin ice to time-varying magnetic fields through stroboscopic neutron scattering and SQUID magnetometry on a new class of ultrapure Ho 2 Ti 2 O 7 crystals. Covering almost 10 decades of time scales with atomic-scale spatial resolution, the experiments resolve apparent discrepancies between prior measurements on more disordered crystals and reveal a thermal crossover between distinct relaxation processes. Magnetic relaxation at low temperatures is associated with monopole motion through the spin-ice vacuum, while at elevated temperatures, relaxation occurs through reorientation of increasingly spin-like monopolar bound states. Spin fractionalization is thus directly manifest in the relaxation dynamics of spin ice.},

Here, we develop a comprehensive semiconducting photoresist with nano-interpenetrating structure. After photolithography, nanostructured cross-linking networks interpenetrate with continuous phases of semiconducting polymers, enabling submicrometer patterning accuracy and compact molecular stacking with high thermodynamic stability. The mobility reaches the highest values of photocrosslinkable organic semiconductors and maintains almost 100\% after soaking in developer and stripper for 1000 min. Owing to the comprehensive performance, all-photolithography is achieved, which fabricates organic inverters and high-density transistor arrays with densities up to 1.1 × 10 5 units cm −2 and 1 to 4 orders larger than conventional printing processes, opening up a new approach toward manufacturing highly integrated organic circuits and systems.},

Here, we have conducted time-resolved dissolution experiments of MFI-type zeolite crystals in ammonium fluoride medium where detailed structural analysis allowed us to extrapolate and elucidate the possible mechanism of nucleation and crystal growth. A combination of electron and scanning probe microscopy shows that dissolution initiates preferentially at lattice defects and progressively removes defect zones to reveal a mosaic structure of crystalline domains within each zeolite crystal. This mosaic architecture evolves during the growth process, reflecting the changing conditions of zeolite formation that can be retroactively assessed during zeolite crystal dissolution. Moreover, a more general implication of this study is the establishment that dissolution can be used successfully as an ex situ technique to uncover details about crystal growth features inaccessible by other methods.},

Mice lacking Gal1 exhibited exacerbated colitis and augmented mucosal CD8 + T cell activation in response to 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; this phenotype was partially ameliorated by treatment with recombinant Gal1. While C2gnt1 −/− mice exhibited aggravated colitis, St6gal1 −/− mice showed attenuated inflammation. These effects were associated with intrinsic T cell glycosylation.

Inhibiting PERK signaling or intrinsic apoptosis both alleviated MERS pathogenesis in vivo. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV induced apoptosis through distinct mechanisms but inhibition of intrinsic apoptosis similarly limited SARS-CoV-2– and SARS-CoV–induced apoptosis in vitro and markedly ameliorated the lung damage of SARS-CoV-2–inoculated human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) mice.

Our results display the generation of an electron-hole pair in the donor and its subsequent migration to the donor-acceptor interface. At the interface, electrons transfer from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of thiophenes to the second LUMOs of fullerene. Further migration of electrons and holes leads to the emergence of current. These findings support previous experimental evidence of coherent couplings between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom and are expected to stimulate further work toward exploring the interplay between electron-hole pair (exciton) binding and vibronic coupling for charge separation and transport.},

We tested the counterintuitive theory that the hippocampus contributes to long-term memory through remarkably short-term processing, as reflected in eye movements during scene encoding. While viewing scenes for the first time, short-term retrieval operative within the episode over only hundreds of milliseconds was indicated by a specific eye-movement pattern, which was effective in that it enhanced spatiotemporal memory formation. This viewing pattern was predicted by hippocampal theta oscillations recorded from depth electrodes and by shifts toward top-down influence of hippocampal theta on activity within visual perception and attention networks. The hippocampus thus supports short-term memory processing that coordinates behavior in the service of effective spatiotemporal learning.},

  abstract     = {Today’s oceans store as much dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water column as there is CO 2 in the atmosphere, and as such dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important component of the global carbon cycle. It was shown that in anoxic marine sediments, reduced sulfur species (e.g., H 2 S) abiotically react with organic matter, contributing to carbon preservation. It is not known whether such processes also contribute to preserving DOM in ocean waters. Here, we show DOM sulfurization within the sulfidic waters of the Black Sea, by combining elemental, isotopic, and molecular analyses. Dissolved organic sulfur (DOS) is formed largely in the water column and not derived from sediments or allochthonous nonmarine sources. Our findings suggest that during large-scale anoxic events, DOM may accumulate through abiotic reactions with reduced sulfur species, having long-lasting effects on global climate by enhancing organic carbon sequestration.},

Complex nonlinear dynamics govern many fields of science and engineering. Data-driven dynamic modeling often assumes a low-dimensional subspace or manifold for the state. We liberate ourselves from this assumption by proposing cluster-based network modeling (CNM) bridging machine learning, network science, and statistical physics. CNM describes short- and long-term behavior and is fully automatable, as it does not rely on application-specific knowledge. CNM is demonstrated for the Lorenz attractor, ECG heartbeat signals, Kolmogorov flow, and a high-dimensional actuated turbulent boundary layer. Even the notoriously difficult modeling benchmark of rare events in the Kolmogorov flow is solved. This automatable universal data-driven representation of complex nonlinear dynamics complements and expands network connectivity science and promises new fast-track avenues to understand, estimate, predict, and control complex systems in all scientific fields.},

Here, we show that p53 loss activates prometastatic secretory vesicle biogenesis in the Golgi. p53 loss up-regulates the expression of a Golgi scaffolding protein, progestin and adipoQ receptor 11 (PAQR11), which recruits an adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor 1–containing protein complex that loads cargos into secretory vesicles. PAQR11-dependent secretion of a protease, PLAU, prevents anoikis and initiates autocrine activation of a PLAU receptor/signal transducer and activator of transcription-3-dependent pathway that up-regulates PAQR11 expression, thereby completing a feedforward loop that amplifies prometastatic effector protein secretion. Pharmacologic inhibition of PLAU receptor impairs the growth and metastasis of p53-deficient cancers. Blockade of PAQR11-dependent secretion inhibits immunosuppressive processes in the tumor microenvironment. Thus, Golgi reprogramming by p53 loss is a key driver of hypersecretion in cancer.},

Viruses are key players in controlling algal demise, thereby diverting biomass from higher trophic levels to the DOM pool, a process termed the “viral shunt.” To decode the metabolic footprint of the viral shunt in the environment, we induced a bloom of Emiliania huxleyi and followed its succession using untargeted exometabolomics. We show that bloom succession induces dynamic changes in the exometabolic landscape. We found a set of chlorine-iodine–containing metabolites that were induced by viral infection and released during bloom demise. These metabolites were further detected in virus-infected oceanic E. huxleyi blooms. Therefore, we propose that halogenation with both chlorine and iodine is a distinct hallmark of the virus-induced DOM of E. huxleyi , providing insights into the metabolic consequences of the viral shunt.},

However, any proteins that specifically recognize H3Q5ser remain unknown. Here, we found that WDR5 interacts with the N-terminal tail of histone H3 and functions as a “reader” for H3Q5ser. Crystal structures of WDR5 in complex with H3Q5ser and H3K4me3Q5ser peptides revealed that the serotonyl group is accommodated in a shallow surface pocket of WDR5. Experiments in neuroblastoma cells demonstrate that H3K4me3 modification is hampered upon disruption of WDR5-H3Q5ser interaction. WDR5 colocalizes with H3Q5ser in the promoter regions of cancer-promoting genes in neuroblastoma cells, where it promotes gene transcription to induce cell proliferation. Thus, beyond revealing a previously unknown mechanism through which WDR5 reads H3Q5ser to activate transcription, our study suggests that this WDR5-H3Q5ser–mediated epigenetic regulation apparently promotes tumorigenesis.},

Here, we engineer an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector system that transfers genetic information into native target cells upon illumination with cell-compatible red light. This OptoAAV system allows adjustable and spatially resolved gene transfer down to single-cell resolution and is compatible with different cell lines and primary cells. Moreover, the sequential application of multiple OptoAAVs enables spatially resolved transduction with different transgenes. The approach presented is likely extendable to other classes of viral vectors and is expected to foster advances in basic and applied genetic research.},

The approach is based on multilayered microstructures containing superconducting, insulating, and ferromagnetic layers with modified photon phase velocities and magnon eigenfrequencies.

Here, we conduct the first direct geochronological comparison of Boltysh to the K-Pg boundary. Our 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age of 65.39 ± 0.14/0.16 Ma shows that the impact occurred ~0.65 Ma after the mass extinction. At that time, the climate was recovering from the effects of the Chicxulub impact and Deccan trap flood volcanism. This age shows that Boltysh has a close temporal association with the Lower C29n hyperthermal recorded by global sediment archives and in the Boltysh crater lake sediments.

We find that all three sites, all in the region of replication termination, display recurrent four-way DNA or Holliday junctions (HJs) and recurrent DNA breaks. Homology-directed double-strand break repair generates the recurrent HJs at all of these sites; however, distinct mechanisms of DNA breakage are implicated: replication fork collapse at natural replication barriers and, unexpectedly, frequent shearing of unsegregated sister chromosomes at cell division. We propose that mechanisms such as both of these may occur ubiquitously, including in humans, and may constitute some of the earliest events that underlie somatic cell mosaicism, cancers, and other diseases of genome instability.},

Dissociation of 53BP1 from DSBs and consequent activation of HR, a less error-prone pathway than NHEJ, helps maintain genome integrity during DNA replication; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that E3 ubiquitin ligase SPOP promotes HR during S phase of the cell cycle by excluding 53BP1 from DSBs. In response to DNA damage, ATM kinase–catalyzed phosphorylation of SPOP causes a conformational change in SPOP, revealed by x-ray crystal structures, that stabilizes its interaction with 53BP1. 53BP1-bound SPOP induces polyubiquitination of 53BP1, eliciting 53BP1 extraction from chromatin by a valosin-containing protein/p97 segregase complex. Our work shows that SPOP facilitates HR repair over NHEJ during DNA replication by contributing to 53BP1 removal from chromatin. Cancer-derived SPOP mutations block SPOP interaction with 53BP1, inducing HR defects and chromosomal instability.},

CCL21 injection suppressed breast cancer growth, and CCL21 receptor deletion attenuated T cell immunity against cancer metastasis in DMBA-treated PyMT animals.

  abstract     = {Mitigating the effects of disease outbreaks with timely and effective interventions requires accurate real-time surveillance and forecasting of disease activity, but traditional health care–based surveillance systems are limited by inherent reporting delays. Machine learning methods have the potential to fill this temporal “data gap, ” but work to date in this area has focused on relatively simple methods and coarse geographic resolutions (state level and above). We evaluate the predictive performance of a gated recurrent unit neural network approach in comparison with baseline machine learning methods for estimating influenza activity in the United States at the state and city levels and experiment with the inclusion of real-time Internet search data. We find that the neural network approach improves upon baseline models for long time horizons of prediction but is not improved by real-time internet search data. We conduct a thorough analysis of feature importances in all considered models for interpretability purposes.},

  abstract     = {CAR T cell therapy remains ineffective in solid tumors, due largely to poor infiltration and T cell suppression at the tumor site. T regulatory (T reg ) cells suppress the immune response via inhibitory factors such as transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β). T reg cells expressing the C-C chemokine receptor 8 (CCR8) have been associated with poor prognosis in solid tumors. We postulated that CCR8 could be exploited to redirect effector T cells to the tumor site while a dominant-negative TGF-β receptor 2 (DNR) can simultaneously shield them from TGF-β. We identified that CCL1 from activated T cells potentiates a feedback loop for CCR8 + T cell recruitment to the tumor site. This sustained and improved infiltration of engineered T cells synergized with TGF-β shielding for improved therapeutic efficacy. Our results demonstrate that addition of CCR8 and DNR into CAR T cells can render them effective in solid tumors.},

We engineered a bridge protein with high affinity for rhBMP-2 and collagen that can be simply added to the product’s formulation, demonstrating improved efficacy at low dose of rhBMP-2 in two mouse models of bone regeneration, including a newly developed spinal fusion model. Moreover, the bridge protein can control the retention of rhBMP-2 from endogenous collagenous extracellular matrix of tissue. Our approach may be generalizable to other growth factors and collagen-based materials, for use in many other applications in regenerative medicine.},

Bacterial flagella were site-specifically labeled via genetic code expansion. This enabled us to track bacterial flagella during biofilm maturation. Live flagella imaging revealed the presence and synthesis of flagella throughout the biofilm life cycle. To study the possible role of flagella in a biofilm, we produced a flagella knockout strain and compared its biofilm to that of the wild-type strain. Results showed a one order of magnitude stronger biofilm structure in the wild type in comparison with the flagella knockout strain. This suggests a possible structural role for flagella in a biofilm, conceivably as a scaffold. Our findings suggest a new model for biofilm maturation dynamic which underscores the importance of direct evidence from within the biofilm.},

In this study, we seed tau pathology in the brains of nontransgenic mice with AD tau and quantify pathology development over 9 months in 134 brain regions. Network modeling of pathology progression shows that diffusion through the connectome is the best predictor of tau pathology patterns. Further, deviations from pure neuroanatomical spread are used to estimate regional vulnerability to tau pathology and identify related gene expression patterns. Last, we show that pathology spread is altered in mice harboring a mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2. While tau pathology spread is still constrained by anatomical connectivity in these mice, it spreads preferentially in a retrograde direction.

We identified growth hormone receptor (GHR) is mainly expressed in mesenchymal cells, and its expression is substantially decreased in IPF lungs. Higher levels of GHR expression correlated with better lung function in patients with IPF. Profibrotic mesenchymal cells retarded ATII growth and were associated with suppressed vesicular GHR expression. Vesicles enriched with Ghr promote ATII proliferation and diminished pulmonary fibrosis in mesenchymal Ghr -deficient mice.

Here, we show that the ephrin-B3 protein in birds lacks several motifs present in other vertebrates, diminishing its affinity for the EphA4 receptor. The avian ephrin-B3 gene lacks an enhancer that drives midline expression and is missing in galliforms. The morphology and wiring at brachial levels of the chicken embryonic spinal cord resemble those of ephrin-B3 null mice. Dorsal midline decussation, evident in the mutant mouse, is apparent at the chick brachial level and is prevented by expression of exogenous ephrin-B3 at the roof plate.

The space radiation did not affect sperm DNA or fertility after preservation on ISS, and many genetically normal offspring were obtained without reducing the success rate compared to the ground-preserved control. The results of ground x-ray experiments showed that sperm can be stored for more than 200 years in space.

The tripartite consortium is physiologically complex because of the versatile energy metabolism of each partner but appears to be ecologically specialized as it prefers hypoxic sediments. The emergent niche of this complex symbiosis is predicted to be a partial overlap of each partners’ niches and may be largely defined by anoxygenic photosynthesis and possibly phagotrophy.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the formation of this class of gene loops is unknown. Here, we report the characterization of a group of linker histone-like proteins, named the GH1-HMGA family in Arabidopsis , which act as chromatin architecture modulators. We demonstrate that these family members redundantly promote the floral transition through the repression of FLC . A genome-wide study revealed that this family preferentially binds to the 5′ and 3′ ends of gene bodies. The loss of this binding increases FLC expression by stabilizing the FLC 5′ to 3′ gene looping.

While speeds remained fairly steady from 2009 to late 2017, our Copernicus Sentinel 1A/B–derived velocity data show a &gt;12\% speedup over the past 3 years, coincident with a 19-km retreat of the ice shelf. We use an ice-flow model to simulate this loss, finding that accelerated calving can explain the recent speedup, independent of the grounding-line, melt-driven processes responsible for past speedups. If the ice shelf’s rapid retreat continues, it could further destabilize the glacier far sooner than would be expected due to surface- or ocean-melting processes.},

Devices using state-of-the-art narrow bandgap semiconductors require complex manufacturing, high costs, and cooling requirements that remain prohibitive for many applications. We report high-performance infrared photodetection from a donor-acceptor conjugated polymer with broadband SWIR-LWIR operation. Electronic correlations within the π-conjugated backbone promote a high-spin ground state, narrow bandgap, long-wavelength absorption, and intrinsic electrical conductivity. These previously unobserved attributes enabled the fabrication of a thin-film photoconductive detector from solution, which demonstrates specific detectivities greater than 2.10 × 10 9 Jones. These room temperature detectivities closely approach those of cooled epitaxial devices. This work provides a fundamentally new platform for broadly applicable, low-cost, ambient temperature infrared optoelectronics.},

Using simultaneous PET-MRI in healthy volunteers, we find strong evidence that patterns of striatal dopamine signaling and cortical blood flow (an index of local neural activity) contain shared information. This shared information links amphetamine-induced changes in gradients of striatal dopamine receptor availability to changes in brain-wide blood flow and is informed by spatial patterns of gene expression enriched for genes implicated in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism spectrum disorder.

How cortically localized Par-3 establishes asymmetric Notch activity in the nucleus is not understood. Here, using in vivo time-lapse imaging of mitotic radial glia progenitors in the developing zebrafish forebrain, we uncover that during horizontal ACD along the anteroposterior embryonic axis, endosomes containing the Notch ligand DeltaD (Dld) move toward the cleavage plane and preferentially segregate into the posterior (subsequently basal) Notch hi daughter. This asymmetric segregation requires the activity of Par-3 and dynein motor complex. Using label retention expansion microscopy, we further detect Par-3 in the cytosol colocalizing the dynein light intermediate chain 1 (Dlic1) onto Dld endosomes. Par-3, Dlic1, and Dld are associated in protein complexes in vivo. Our data reveal an unanticipated mechanism by which cytoplasmic Par-3 directly polarizes Notch signaling components during ACD.},

Here, we characterized a previously unknown group of oncogenic BRAF mutants with in-frame insertions (LLR ins506 or VLR ins506 ) of αC-β4 loop. Using structure modeling and molecular dynamics simulation, we found that these insertions formed a large hydrophobic network that stabilizes R-spine and thus triggers the catalytic activity of BRAF. Furthermore, these insertions disrupted BRAF dimer interface and impaired dimerization. Unlike BRAF(V600E), these BRAF mutants with low dimer affinity were strongly resistant to all RAF inhibitors in clinic or clinical trials, which arises from their stabilized R-spines. As predicted by molecular docking, the stabilized R-spines in other BRAF mutants also conferred drug resistance. Together, our data indicated that the stability of R-spine but not dimer affinity determines the RAF inhibitor resistance of oncogenic BRAF mutants.},

The results indicate that the summer ITP rainfall is highly predictable on multiyear time scales. The predictability of ITP rainfall originates from the Silk Road pattern driven by sea surface temperature over the subpolar gyre region in North Atlantic. Real-time forecasts suggest that the ITP will become wetter, with 12.8\% increase in rainfall during 2020–2027 relative to 1986–2005.

Revisited hydrographic data from off East Antarctica indicate full-depth warming from 1996 to 2019, concurrent with an extensive poleward shift of the SB subsurface isotherms (&gt;50 km), which is most prominent at 120°E off the Sabrina Coast. The SB shift is attributable to enhanced upper overturning circulation and a depth-independent frontal shift, generally accounting for 30 and 70\%, respectively. Thirty years of oceanographic data corroborate the overall and localized poleward shifts that are likely controlled by continental slope topography. Numerical experiments successfully reproduce this locality and demonstrate its sensitivity to mesoscale processes and wind forcing. The poleward SB shift under intensified westerlies potentially induces multidecadal warming of Antarctic shelf water.},

Here, we show that different properties of the pheromones secreted by the MAT a and MAT α mating types of budding yeast lead to asymmetry in their behavioral responses during mating in mixed haploid populations, which resemble behavioral asymmetries between gametes in anisogamous organisms. MAT a behaves as a random searcher that is stimulated in proportion to the fraction of MAT α partner cells within the population, whereas MAT α behaves as a short-range directional distance sensor. Mathematical modeling suggests that the observed asymmetric responses can enhance efficiency of mating and might thus provide a selective advantage.

  abstract     = {The chemistry of copper and iron plays a critical role in normal brain function. A variety of enzymes and proteins containing positively charged Cu + , Cu 2+ , Fe 2+ , and Fe 3+ control key processes, catalyzing oxidative metabolism and neurotransmitter and neuropeptide production. Here, we report the discovery of elemental (zero–oxidation state) metallic Cu 0 accompanying ferromagnetic elemental Fe 0 in the human brain. These nanoscale biometal deposits were identified within amyloid plaque cores isolated from Alzheimer’s disease subjects, using synchrotron x-ray spectromicroscopy. The surfaces of nanodeposits of metallic copper and iron are highly reactive, with distinctly different chemical and magnetic properties from their predominant oxide counterparts. The discovery of metals in their elemental form in the brain raises new questions regarding their generation and their role in neurochemistry, neurobiology, and the etiology of neurodegenerative disease.},

  abstract     = {The large range of H 2 O contents recorded in minerals from exhumed mantle rocks has been challenging to interpret, as it often records a combination of melting, metasomatism, and diffusional processes in spatially isolated samples. Here, we determine the temporal variations of H 2 O contents in pyroxenes from a 24-Ma time series of abyssal peridotites exposed along the Vema fracture zone (Atlantic Ocean). The H 2 O contents of pyroxenes correlate with both crustal ages and pyroxene chemistry and increase toward younger and more refractory peridotites. These variations are inconsistent with residual values after melting and opposite to trends often observed in mantle xenoliths. Postmelting hydrogen enrichment occurred by ionic diffusion during cryptic metasomatism of peridotite residues by low-degree, volatile-rich melts and was particularly effective in the most depleted peridotites. The presence of hydrous melts under ridges leads to widespread hydrogen incorporation in the oceanic lithosphere, likely lowering mantle viscosity compared to dry models.},

Here, we determined the crystal structure of the active human S1PR3 in complex with its natural agonist S1P at 3.2-Å resolution. S1P exhibits an unbent conformation in the long tunnel, which penetrates through the receptor obliquely. Compared with the inactive S1PR1 structure, four residues surrounding the alkyl tail of S1P (the “quartet core”) exhibit orchestrating rotamer changes that accommodate the moiety, thereby inducing an active conformation. In addition, we reveal that the quartet core determines G protein selectivity of S1PR3. These results offer insight into the structural basis of activation and biased signaling in G protein–coupled receptors and will help the design of biased ligands for optimized therapeutics.},

To foster both continuous adaption and the storage of long-term information, spines need to be plastic and stable at the same time. Here, we advanced in vivo STED nanoscopy to superresolve distinct features of spines (head size and neck length/width) in mouse neocortex for up to 1 month. While LTP-dependent changes predict highly correlated modifications of spine geometry, we find both, uncorrelated and correlated dynamics, indicating multiple independent drivers of spine remodeling. The magnitude of this remodeling suggests substantial fluctuations in synaptic strength. Despite this high degree of volatility, all spine features exhibit persistent components that are maintained over long periods of time. Furthermore, chronic nanoscopy uncovers structural alterations in the cortex of a mouse model of neurodegeneration. Thus, at the nanoscale, stable dendritic spines exhibit a delicate balance of stability and volatility.},

We use macroevolutionary birth-death models to describe the range of total-group and crown-group ages expected under constant rates of speciation and extinction. We extend current predictions on origination times for crown- and total-groups, and extinction of stem-groups, demonstrating that there is broad variance in these predictions. Under constant rates of speciation and extinction, we show that the distribution of expected arthropod total-group ages is consistent with molecular clock estimates.

Polθ exhibits a significantly higher velocity and fidelity of deoxyribonucleotide incorporation on RNA versus DNA. The 3.2-Å crystal structure of Polθ on a DNA/RNA primer-template with bound deoxyribonucleotide reveals that the enzyme undergoes a major structural transformation within the thumb subdomain to accommodate A-form DNA/RNA and forms multiple hydrogen bonds with template ribose 2′-hydroxyl groups like retroviral RTs.

In vitro, hiNeuroSs demonstrated superior migration to human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and in vivo rapidly homed to TNBC tumor foci following intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion. In TNBC parenchymal metastasis models, ICV infusion of hiNeuroSs secreting the proapoptotic agent TRAIL (hiNeuroS-TRAIL) significantly reduced tumor burden and extended median survival.

This question is among the most studied in the social sciences with deep implications for the harmony of diverse societies. Yet, despite a voluminous body of scholarship, evidence around this question is limited to cross-sectional surveys that only measure short-term consequences of contact or to panel surveys with small samples covering short time periods. Using advances in machine learning that enable large-scale linkages across datasets, we examine the long-term determinants of sociopolitical behavior through an unprecedented individual-level analysis linking contemporary political records to the 1940 U.S. Census. These linked data allow us to measure the exact residential context of nearly every person in the United States in 1940 and, for men, connect this with the political behavior of those still alive over 70 years later. We find that, among white Americans, early-life exposure to black neighbors predicts Democratic partisanship over 70 years later.},

Here we report an increased prevalence of vitamin D (VitD) deficiency in patients diagnosed with opioid use disorder and an inverse and dose-dependent association of VitD levels with self-reported opioid use. We used multiple pharmacologic approaches and genetic mouse models and found that deficiencies in VitD signaling amplify exogenous opioid responses that are normalized upon restoration of VitD signaling. Similarly, physiologic endogenous opioid analgesia and reward responses triggered by ultraviolet (UV) radiation are repressed by VitD signaling, suggesting that a feedback loop exists whereby VitD deficiency produces increased UV/endorphin-seeking behavior until VitD levels are restored by cutaneous VitD synthesis. This feedback may carry the evolutionary advantage of maximizing VitD synthesis. However, unlike UV exposure, exogenous opioid use is not followed by VitD synthesis (and its opioid suppressive effects), contributing to maladaptive addictive behavior.},

Somite-derived satellite cells were clearly separated from cells derived from cranial mesoderm in Hoxa10 expression. Hoxa10 inactivation led to genomic instability and mitotic catastrophe in somite-derived satellite cells in mice and human. Satellite cell–specific Hoxa10 ablation in mice resulted in a decline in the regenerative ability of somite-derived muscles, which were unobserved in cranial mesoderm–derived muscles.

The challenge lies in the lack of tools that allow simultaneous spatial manipulation of signaling molecules. To circumvent this, we produced a nanoengineered multifunctional platform with molecular-scale spatial control of ligands, which was applied to elucidate KIR2DL1-mediated inhibition of NKG2D signaling—receptors of natural killer cells. This platform was conceived by bimetallic nanodot patterning with molecular-scale registry, followed by a ternary functionalization with distinct moieties. We found that a 40-nm gap between activating and inhibitory ligands provided optimal inhibitory conditions. Supported by theoretical modeling, we interpret these findings as a consequence of the size mismatch and conformational flexibility of ligands in their spatial interaction. This highly versatile approach provides an important insight into the spatial mechanism of inhibitory immune checkpoints, which is essential for the rational design of future immunotherapies.},

  abstract     = {The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on platinum catalysts is essential in fuel cells. Quantitative predictions of the relative ORR activity in experiments, in the range of 1 to 50 times, have remained challenging because of incomplete mechanistic understanding and lack of computational tools to account for the associated small differences in activation energies (&lt;2.3 kilocalories per mole). Using highly accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with the Interface force field (0.1 kilocalories per mole), we elucidated the mechanism of adsorption of molecular oxygen on regular and irregular platinum surfaces and nanostructures, followed by local density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The relative ORR activity is determined by oxygen access to platinum surfaces, which greatly depends on specific water adlayers, while electron transfer occurs at a similar slow rate. The MD methods facilitate quantitative predictions of relative ORR activities of any platinum nanostructures, are applicable to other catalysts, and enable effective MD/DFT approaches.},

Here, we show that the mRNAs of dengue virus and influenza A virus largely escape RNase L–mediated mRNA decay, and this permits viral protein production. However, activation of RNase L arrests nuclear mRNA export, which strongly inhibits influenza A virus protein synthesis and reduces cytokine production. The heterogeneous and temporal nature of the mRNA export block in individual cells permits sufficient production of antiviral cytokines from transcriptionally induced host mRNAs. This defines RNase L–mediated arrest of mRNA export as a key antiviral shutoff and cytokine regulatory pathway.},

Functional hIECs are more suitable for predicting compounds metabolized by CYP3A4 and absorbed in the intestine than Caco-2 cells. This system is a step toward the transition from three-dimensional (3D) intestinal organoids to 2D hIEC monolayers without compromising cellular diversity and function.

However, the production of stretchable wearable displays with sufficient pixels to display this information remains challenging. Here, we report a standalone organic SHP that provides real-time heart rate information. The 15-μm-thick SHP comprises a stretchable organic light-emitting diode display and stretchable organic photoplethysmography (PPG) heart rate sensor on all-elastomer substrate and operates stably under 30\% strain using a combination of stress relief layers and deformable micro-cracked interconnects that reduce the mechanical stress on the active optoelectronic components.

It turns out that once LRP is abandoned, new opportunities emerge. A prominent example is resonant systems operating near N th-order exceptional point degeneracies (EPDs) where a small perturbation ε ≪ 1 activates an inherent sublinear response ∼ ε N ≫ ε in resonant splitting. Here, we propose an alternative sublinear optomechanical sensing scheme that is rooted in Wigner’s cusp anomalies (WCAs), first discussed in the framework of nuclear reactions: a frequency-dependent square-root singularity of the differential scattering cross section around the energy threshold of a newly opened channel, which we use to amplify small perturbations. WCA hypersensitivity can be applied in a variety of sensing applications, besides optomechanical accelerometry discussed in this paper. Our WCA platforms are compact, do not require a judicious arrangement of active elements (unlike EPD platforms), and, if chosen, can be cavity free.},

Notably, these ciCECs could be cultured for as long as 30 passages and still retain the CEC features in defined medium. Transplantation of these ciCECs into an animal model reversed corneal opacity.

By integrating transcriptome (RNA-seq), enhancer landscape (ChIP-seq), genome structure (Hi-C), and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) datasets from H3K27M and wild-type specimens, we identified tumor-specific enhancers and regulatory networks for known oncogenes. We identified genomic structural variations that lead to potential enhancer hijacking and gene coamplification, including A2M , JAG2 , and FLRT1 .

South Asian precipitation and runoff are strongly coherent with, and lag, atmospheric carbon dioxide changes at Earth’s orbital eccentricity, obliquity, and precession bands and are closely tied to cross-equatorial wind strength at the precession band.

Here, subarctic Pacific laminated sediments from the past 1.2 million years demonstrate that hypoxic events recurred throughout the Pleistocene as episodes of highly productive phytoplankton growth and were generally associated with interglacial climates, high sea levels, and enhanced nitrate utilization—but not with deglaciations.

Within MM bone marrow (BM) stromal cell supernatants, TNF-α induces proteasomal degradation of TRAF2, noncanonical NF-κB, and downstream ERK signaling in MM cells, whereas interleukin-6 directly triggers ERK activation. RNA sequencing of MM patient samples shows nearly universal ERK pathway activation at relapse on lenalidomide maintenance therapy, confirming its clinical relevance. Combination MEK inhibitor treatment restores IMiD sensitivity of TRAF2 KO cells both in vitro and in vivo.

Atomic protrusions are laser-induced within plasmonic nanojunctions to concentrate light to atomic length scales, optically isolating individual molecules. By stabilizing these atomic sites, we unveil single-molecule deprotonation and binding dynamics under ambient conditions. High-speed field-enhanced spectroscopy allows us to monitor chemical switching of a single carboxylic group between three discrete states. Combining this with theoretical calculation identifies reversible proton transfer dynamics (yielding effective single-molecule pH) and switching between molecule-metal coordination states, where the exact chemical pathway depends on the intitial protonation state.

  abstract     = {Two models have been put forward for cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) control of the cell cycle. In the qualitative model, cell cycle events are ordered by distinct substrate specificities of successive cyclin waves. Alternatively, in the quantitative model, the gradual rise of Cdk activity from G 1 phase to mitosis leads to ordered substrate phosphorylation at sequential thresholds. Here, we study the relative contributions of qualitative and quantitative Cdk control in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . All S phase and mitotic cyclins can be replaced by a single mitotic cyclin, albeit at the cost of reduced fitness. A single cyclin can also replace all G 1 cyclins to support ordered cell cycle progression, fulfilling key predictions of the quantitative model. However, single-cyclin cells fail to polarize or grow buds and thus cannot survive. Our results suggest that budding yeast has become dependent on G 1 cyclin specificity to couple cell cycle progression to essential morphogenetic events.},

Given the immense library of materials choices, progress in this area for anisotropic NCs is limited by the lack of co-assembly design principles. Here, we use a rational design approach to guide the co-assembly of two such anisotropic systems. We modulate the removal of geometrical incompatibilities between NCs by tuning the ligand shell, taking advantage of the lock-and-key motifs between emergent shapes of the ligand coating to subvert phase separation. Using a combination of theory, simulation, and experiments, we use our strategy to achieve co-assembly of a binary system of cubes and triangular plates and a secondary system involving two two-dimensional (2D) nanoplates. This theory-guided approach to NC assembly has the potential to direct materials choices for targeted binary co-assembly.},

A critical step in HCC formation is the transition from fibrosis to cirrhosis, which is associated with a change in the liver parenchyma called ductular reaction. Here, we report a genetically engineered mouse model of HCC driven by loss of macroautophagy and hemizygosity of phosphatase and tensin homolog, which develops HCC involving ductular reaction. We show through lineage tracing that, following loss of autophagy, mature hepatocytes dedifferentiate into biliary-like liver progenitor cells (ductular reaction), giving rise to HCC. Furthermore, this change is associated with deregulation of yes-associated protein and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif transcription factors, and the combined, but not individual, deletion of these factors completely reverses the dedifferentiation capacity and tumorigenesis. These findings therefore increase our understanding of the cell of origin of HCC development and highlight new potential points for therapeutic intervention.},

From the viewpoint of practical applications, this work establishes a scalable method to firmly adhere hydrogel layers to diverse solid surfaces. The strategy, termed as renatured hydrogel painting (RHP), refers to adhering dehydrated xerogel to a surface with appropriate glues, followed by the formation of a hydrogel layer after rehydration of the xerogel. With the benefits of simplicity and generality, this strategy can be readily applied to different hydrogel systems, no matter what the substrate is. Hydrogel adhesion is demonstrated by its tolerance against mechanical impact with hydrodynamic shearing at 14 m/s. This method affords powerful supplements to renew the surface chemistry and physical properties of solid substrates. In addition, we show that the RHP technique can be applied to living tissue, with potential for clinical applications such as the protection of bone tissue.},

Our experiments with human blood demonstrated its highly selective binding to activated platelets and efficient tPA release at a thrombus site under both static and physiological flow conditions.

Furthermore, we report a purpose-built computational model capable of simulating targeted thrombolysis of the tPA-loaded nanovesicle and with a potential in predicting the dynamics of thrombolysis in physiologically realistic scenarios.

Here, we show that layered anion-ordered Ba 2−δ H 3−2δ X ( X = Cl, Br, and I) exhibit a remarkable conductivity, reaching 1 mS cm −1 at 200°C, with low activation barriers allowing H − conduction even at room temperature. In contrast to structurally related BaH 2 (i.e., Ba 2 H 4 ), the layered anion order in Ba 2−δ H 3−2δ X , along with Schottky defects, likely suppresses a structural transition, rather than the traditional chemical disorder, while retaining a highly symmetric hexagonal lattice.

Analysis of these structures identifies a conserved secondary structure switch in the 16 S ribosomal RNA central to decoding site maturation and suggests both a sequential order of action and molecular mechanisms for the assembly factors in coordinating and controlling this switch. Structural and mechanistic parallels between bacterial and eukaryotic systems indicate common folding features inherent to all ribosomes.},

Imaging chromatin in live Drosophila larvae, with preserved nuclear volume, revealed that active and repressed chromatin separates from the nuclear interior and forms a peripheral layer underneath the nuclear lamina. This is in contrast to the current view that chromatin distributes throughout the nucleus. Furthermore, peripheral chromatin organization was observed in distinct Drosophila tissues, as well as in live human effector T lymphocytes and neutrophils. Lamin A/C up-regulation resulted in chromatin collapse toward the nuclear center and correlated with a significant reduction in the levels of active chromatin. Physical modeling suggests that binding of lamina-associated domains combined with chromatin self-attractive interactions recapitulate the experimental chromatin distribution profiles. Together, our findings reveal a novel mode of mesoscale organization of peripheral chromatin sensitive to lamina composition, which is evolutionary conserved.},

Here, we report cryo-EM structures of both trimeric spike ectodomains in complex with the 47D11 Fab. 47D11 binds to the closed receptor-binding domain, distal to the ACE2 binding site. The CDRL3 stabilizes the N343 glycan in an upright conformation, exposing a mutationally constrained hydrophobic pocket, into which the CDRH3 loop inserts two aromatic residues. 47D11 stabilizes a partially open conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, suggesting that it could be used effectively in combination with other antibodies targeting the exposed receptor-binding motif.

Here, using ultrashort pulses of light, we control magnetic anisotropy in the two-dimensional van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS 3 . Tuning the photon energy in resonance with an orbital transition between crystal field split levels of the nickel ions, we demonstrate the selective activation of a subterahertz magnon mode with markedly two-dimensional behavior. The pump polarization control of the magnon amplitude confirms that the activation is governed by the photoinduced magnetic anisotropy axis emerging in response to photoexcitation of ground state electrons to states with a lower orbital symmetry.

This source surpassed the carbon accumulation by high-latitude undisturbed peatlands (36 to 47 Pg C). Carbon losses from the cultivation of northern peatlands are omitted in previous land-use emission assessments. Adding this ignored historical land-use emission implies an 18\% larger terrestrial carbon storage since 1750 to close the historical global carbon budget.

Research has focused on beliefs about narrow sets of claims never intended to capture the richness of the political information environment. Furthermore, factors contributing to this performance gap remain unclear. We generated an unique longitudinal dataset combining social media engagement data and a 12-wave panel study of Americans’ political knowledge about high-profile news over 6 months. Results confirm that conservatives have lower sensitivity than liberals, performing worse at distinguishing truths and falsehoods. This is partially explained by the fact that the most widely shared falsehoods tend to promote conservative positions, while corresponding truths typically favor liberals. The problem is exacerbated by liberals’ tendency to experience bigger improvements in sensitivity than conservatives as the proportion of partisan news increases. These results underscore the importance of reducing the supply of right-leaning misinformation.},

This study presents a novel intercalated structure of a metallic BRS by introducing a nanoscale Zn sacrificial layer between the nitrided Fe platform and the sirolimus-carrying poly( d , l -lactide) drug coating. The PDLLA-Zn-FeN BRS shows a multistage biodegradation behavior, maintaining mechanical integrity at the initial stage and exhibiting accelerated biodegradation at the subsequent stage in both rabbit abdominal aortas and human coronary arteries, where complete biodegradation was observed about 2 years after implantation. The presence of the nanoscale Zn sacrificial layer with an adjustable thickness also contributes to the tunable biodegradation of BRS and allows the reduction of the metallic strut thickness to 53 μm, with radial strength as strong as that of the current permanent drug-eluting stents.},

Furthermore, the physically cross-linked polymers can diffuse into the substrate polymeric network to enhance wet adhesion. Superficial deposition of PEI/PAA powder can effectively seal damaged porcine stomach and intestine despite excessive mechanical challenges and tissue surface irregularities.

To address such challenge, we use two-photon polymerization to selectively link Janus microparticle-based magnetic microactuators by three-dimensional (3D) printing of soft or rigid polymer microstructures or links. Sequentially, we position each microactuator at a desired location by surface rolling and rotation to a desired position and orientation by applying magnetic field–based torques, and then 3D printing soft or rigid links to connect with other temporarily fixed microactuators. The linked 2D microactuator networks exhibit programmed 2D and 3D shape transformations, and untethered limbless and limbed micromachine prototypes exhibit various robotic gaits for surface locomotion.

In this work, we present a strategy wherein sandwiching a ferroelectric BaTiO 3 in between paraelectric SrTiO 3 and CaTiO 3 in a superlattice form results in a strong and tunable enhancement in photocurrent. Comparison with BaTiO 3 of similar thickness shows the photocurrent in the superlattice is 10 3 times higher, despite a nearly two-thirds reduction in the volume of BaTiO 3 . The enhancement can be tuned by the periodicity of the superlattice, and persists under 1.5 AM irradiation.

These defects are recapitulated in Drosophila mutants affecting kismet , the sole CHD8/CHD7 ortholog. We show that Kismet is required in glia for early developmental and adult sleep architecture. This role localizes to subperineurial glia constituting the blood-brain barrier. We demonstrate that Kismet-related sleep disturbances are caused by high serotonin during development, paralleling a well-established but genetically unsolved autism endophenotype. Despite their developmental origin, Kismet’s sleep architecture defects can be reversed in adulthood by a behavioral regime resembling human sleep restriction therapy. Our findings provide fundamental insights into glial regulation of sleep and propose a causal mechanistic link between the CHD8/CHD7/Kismet family, developmental hyperserotonemia, and autism-associated sleep disturbances.},

Here, we report metabolically engineered exosomes that have been surface-modified for the targeted reprogramming of macrophages. Qualified exosomes were readily harvested from metabolically engineered stem cells by tangential flow filtration at a high yield while maintaining their innate immunomodulatory components. When systemically administered into mice with collagen-induced arthritis, these exosomes effectively accumulated in the inflamed joints, inducing a cascade of anti-inflammatory events via macrophage phenotype regulation. The level of therapeutic efficacy obtained with bare exosomes was achievable with the engineered exosomes of 10 times less dose. On the basis of the boosted nature to reprogram the synovial microenvironment, the engineered exosomes display considerable potential to be developed as a next-generation drug for RA.},

However, how cell type–specific genomic regions are specifically targeted to the NL is still elusive. Using fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) as a model, we identified Prdm16 as a nuclear envelope protein that anchors H3K9-methylated chromatin in a cell-specific manner. We show that Prdm16 mediates FAP developmental capacities by orchestrating lamina-associated domain organization and heterochromatin sequestration at the nuclear periphery. We found that Prdm16 localizes at the NL where it cooperates with the H3K9 methyltransferases G9a/GLP to mediate tethering and silencing of myogenic genes, thus repressing an alternative myogenic fate in FAPs. Genetic and pharmacological disruption of this repressive pathway confers to FAP myogenic competence, preventing fibro-adipogenic degeneration of dystrophic muscles. In summary, we reveal a druggable mechanism of heterochromatin perinuclear sequestration exploitable to reprogram FAPs in vivo.},

However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we report structure-function characterization of DRM2-mediated methylation. An arginine finger from the catalytic loop intercalates into the nontarget strand of DNA through the minor groove, inducing large DNA deformation that affects the substrate preference of DRM2. The target recognition domain stabilizes the enlarged major groove via shape complementarity rather than base-specific interactions, permitting substrate diversity. The engineered DRM2 C397R mutation introduces base-specific contacts with the +2-flanking guanine, thereby shifting the substrate specificity of DRM2 toward CHG DNA. Together, this study uncovers DNA deformation as a mechanism in regulating the specificity of DRM2 toward diverse CHH substrates and illustrates methylome complexity in plants.},

We present a method jointly inferring a model for both network structure and human behavior using only snapshot population-level behavioral data. This exploits the simplicity of a few parameter model, geometric sociodemographic network model, and a spin-based model of behavior. We illustrate, for the European Union referendum and two London mayoral elections, how the model offers both prediction and the interpretation of the homophilic inclinations of the population. Beyond extracting behavior-specific network structure from behavioral datasets, our approach yields a framework linking inequalities and social preferences to behavioral outcomes. We illustrate potential network-sensitive policies: How changes to income inequality, social temperature, and homophilic preferences might have reduced polarization in a recent election.},

Here, we present a dating approach based on optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)—OSL rock-surface burial dating—and apply it to a lithic surface scatter in Tibet. We generate OSL burial ages (age-depth profiles) for each artifact, outline the methodological complexities, and consider the artifact burial ages in the context of local-scale Earth-surface dynamics. The oldest age cluster between 5.2 and 5.5 thousand years is likely related to quarrying activities at the site and thus represents the oldest chronometric age constraints for human presence on the south-central Tibetan plateau.},

The mouth has finer tactile sensors than hand, which could improve visualization using microscopic models that are portable, inexpensive, and disposable. The mouth remains unused in tactile learning. Here, we created bite-size 3D models of protein molecules from “gummy bear” gelatin or nontoxic resin. Models were made as small as rice grain and could be coded with flavor and packaged like candy. Mouth, hands, and eyesight were tested at identifying specific structures. Students recognized structures by mouth at 85.59\% accuracy, similar to recognition by eyesight using computer animation. Recall accuracy of structures was higher by mouth than hand for 40.91\% of students, equal for 31.82\%, and lower for 27.27\%. The convenient use of entire packs of tiny, cheap, portable models can make 3D imagery more accessible to students.},

Using Syrian hamsters that model moderate to severe COVID-19 disease, we demonstrate the high efficacy of PiN-21 to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal delivery of PiN-21 at 0.6 mg/kg protects infected animals from weight loss and substantially reduces viral burdens in both lower and upper airways compared to control. Aerosol delivery of PiN-21 facilitates deposition throughout the respiratory tract and dose minimization to 0.2 mg/kg. Inhalation treatment quickly reverses animals’ weight loss after infection, decreases lung viral titers by 6 logs leading to drastically mitigated lung pathology, and prevents viral pneumonia. Combined with the marked stability and low production cost, this innovative therapy may provide a convenient and cost-effective option to mitigate the ongoing pandemic.},

Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we uncovered and characterized heterogeneities in naïve B cell, classical memory B cells, and ABC subsets. We showed remarkably similar transcriptional profiles for ABC clusters in malaria, HIV, and autoimmune diseases and demonstrated that interferon-γ drove the expansion of ABCs in malaria. These observations suggest that ABCs represent a separate B cell lineage with a common inducer that further diversifies and acquires disease-specific characteristics and functions. In malaria, we identified ABC subsets based on isotype expression that differed in expansion in African children and in B cell receptor repertoire characteristics. Of particular interest, IgD + IgM lo and IgD − IgG + ABCs acquired a high antigen affinity threshold for activation, suggesting that ABCs may limit autoimmune responses to low-affinity self-antigens in chronic malaria.},

FATZ (filamin-, α-actinin-, and telethonin-binding protein of the Z-disk) proteins interact with α-actinin and other core Z-disk proteins, contributing to myofibril assembly and maintenance. Here, we report the first structure and its cellular validation of α-actinin-2 in complex with a Z-disk partner, FATZ-1, which is best described as a conformational ensemble. We show that FATZ-1 forms a tight fuzzy complex with α-actinin-2 and propose an interaction mechanism via main molecular recognition elements and secondary binding sites. The obtained integrative model reveals a polar architecture of the complex which, in combination with FATZ-1 multivalent scaffold function, might organize interaction partners and stabilize α-actinin-2 preferential orientation in Z-disk. Last, we uncover FATZ-1 ability to phase-separate and form biomolecular condensates with α-actinin-2, raising the question whether FATZ proteins can create an interaction hub for Z-disk proteins through membraneless compartmentalization during myofibrillogenesis.},

We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike binds biliverdin and bilirubin, the tetrapyrrole products of heme metabolism, with nanomolar affinity. Using cryo–electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography, we mapped the tetrapyrrole interaction pocket to a deep cleft on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). At physiological concentrations, biliverdin significantly dampened the reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 spike with immune sera and inhibited a subset of neutralizing antibodies. Access to the tetrapyrrole-sensitive epitope is gated by a flexible loop on the distal face of the NTD. Accompanied by profound conformational changes in the NTD, antibody binding requires relocation of the gating loop, which folds into the cleft vacated by the metabolite. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 spike NTD harbors a dominant epitope, access to which can be controlled by an allosteric mechanism that is regulated through recruitment of a metabolite.},

The present paper deals with the very basic process of contact electrification between two metals. We have developed an experimental method to follow the charge of a small sphere bouncing on a grounded planar electrode on a time scale down to 1 μs. It reveals that the sphere is discharged in the moment of contact, which lasts about 6 to 8 μs. However, at the very moment of disruption of the electrical contact, it regains charge far beyond the expectation according to the contact potential difference. The excess charge rises with increasing contact area.},

Recent epidemiological data and studies in model organisms have shown that maternal circadian disruption is important for offspring health and adult phenotypes. Less is known about the role of paternal circadian rhythm for offspring health. Here, we disrupted circadian rhythm in male mice by night-restricted feeding and showed that paternal circadian disruption at conception is important for offspring feeding behavior, metabolic health, and oscillatory transcription. Mechanistically, our data suggest that the effect of paternal circadian disruption is not transferred to the offspring via the germ cells but initiated by corticosterone-based parental communication at conception and programmed during in utero development through a state of fetal growth restriction. These findings indicate paternal circadian health at conception as a newly identified determinant of offspring phenotypes.},

Spectroscopic data indicated multiple CO binding events, but structural analyses of Mo and V nitrogenase only confirmed a single site. Here, we report the structure of a two CO-bound state of V nitrogenase at 1.05 Å resolution, with one μ-bridging and one terminal CO molecule. This additional, specific ligand binding site suggests a mechanistic route for CO reduction and hydrocarbon formation, as well as a second access pathway for protons required during the reaction.

Loss of iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) synthesis can increase iron loading and promote cell death by ferroptosis. Iron-responsive element-binding proteins IRP1 and IRP2 posttranscriptionally regulate iron homeostasis. IRP1 binding to target mRNAs is competitively regulated by ISC occupancy. However, IRP2 is principally thought to be regulated at the protein level via E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXL5–mediated degradation. Here, we show that ISC synthesis suppression can activate IRP2 and promote ferroptosis sensitivity via a previously unidentified mechanism. At tissue-level O 2 concentrations, ISC deficiency enhances IRP2 binding to target mRNAs independent of IRP1, FBXL5, and changes in IRP2 protein level. Deletion of both IRP1 and IRP2 abolishes the iron-starvation response, preventing its activation by ISC synthesis inhibition. These findings will inform strategies to manipulate ferroptosis sensitivity and help illuminate the mechanism underlying ISC biosynthesis disorders, such as Friedreich’s ataxia.},

The microfiber can be stretched up to 1170\%, and upon fully activating the conductive path, a very high conductivity of 4.35 × 10 4 S/m and resistance change of only 4\% at 200\% strain are realized, arising from both stretch-induced channel opening and stretching out of tortuous serpentine conductive path of the percolating liquid metal network.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) analysis reveals that NFI (nuclear factor I) factors repress Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt signaling in tanycytes and modulation of these pathways blocks proliferation and tanycyte-derived neurogenesis in Nfia/b/x -deficient mice. Nfia/b/x -deficient tanycytes give rise to multiple mediobasal hypothalamic neuronal subtypes that can mature, fire action potentials, receive synaptic inputs, and selectively respond to changes in internal states.

Structures are now available for the receptor bound to ligands with different modes of action, including antagonists, agonists, and positive allosteric modulators, and captured in different conformational states from the inactive apo to the fully active state bound to a G protein. These discoveries provide comprehensive insights into the activation of the GABA B receptor, which not only broaden our understanding of its structure, pharmacology, and physiological effects but also will ultimately facilitate the discovery of new therapeutic drugs and neuromodulators.},

  abstract     = {The Stern-Gerlach effect, found a century ago, has become a paradigm of quantum mechanics. Unexpectedly, until recently, there has been little evidence that the original scheme with freely propagating atoms exposed to gradients from macroscopic magnets is a fully coherent quantum process. Several theoretical studies have explained why a Stern-Gerlach interferometer is a formidable challenge. Here, we provide a detailed account of the realization of a full-loop Stern-Gerlach interferometer for single atoms and use the acquired understanding to show how this setup may be used to realize an interferometer for macroscopic objects doped with a single spin. Such a realization would open the door to a new era of fundamental probes, including the realization of previously inaccessible tests at the interface of quantum mechanics and gravity.},

Despite its importance for conceptual advances in both fundamental aspects and practical applications, a universal framework for the accurate determination of Casimir-vdW forces is lacking. Here, we propose a universal theoretical platform for computing Casimir-vdW forces, accounting for the electronic dielectric constant, optical bandgap, density, and chemical composition. Using this methodology, we determine the dielectric function for 55 materials, over a wide range of photon energies, covering an extensive list of common metals, organic and inorganic semiconductors, and insulators. Internal consistency of the compiled data is validated using optical sum rules and Kramers-Kronig relations. We demonstrate that the calculated vdW forces based on these data match remarkably well with the experimentally measured vdW forces.},

Furthermore, we applied the TEVMP as ex vivo and in vivo screening systems to evaluate the effect of human CD200 (hCD200) overexpression in porcine endothelial cells (PECs) on vascular xenogeneic immune responses. These screening systems, in contrast to 2D in vitro and cellular xenotransplantation in vivo models, clearly demonstrated that hCD200 overexpression effectively suppressed vascular xenograft rejection.

Mechanism investigation indicates that the IL cation and anion serve as hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor, respectively, to activate the C─O and O─H bonds of alcohol via hydrogen bonds, which synergistically catalyze dehydrative cyclization of diols to O-heterocycles. Notably, the products could be spontaneously separated after reaction because of their immiscibility with the IL, and the IL could be recycled. This green strategy has great potential for application in industry.},

Here, we analyze the impact of declining biodiversity on nutrients supplied by fish using detailed information from the Peruvian Amazon, where inland fisheries provide a critical source of nutrition for many of the region’s 800, 000 people. We found that the impacts of biodiversity loss on nutrient supplies depended on compensation, trophic dynamics, and functional diversity. When small sedentary species compensated for declines in large migratory species, fatty acid supplies increased, while zinc and iron supplies decreased. In contrast, the probability of failing to maintain supplies or nutrient supply risk increased when species were nutritionally unique. Our results show that trait-based regulations and public health polices need to consider biodiversity’s vital role in sustaining nutritional benefits for over 2 billion people dependent on wild foods across the globe.},

Here, we show that cost-effective metrics for methane that minimize the overall mitigation costs are time-dependent, primarily determined by the pathway, and strongly influenced by temperature overshoot. Parties to the Paris Agreement have already adopted the conventional GWP100 (100-year global warming potential), which is shown to be a good approximation of cost-effective metrics for the coming decades. In the longer term, however, we suggest that parties consider adapting the choice of common metrics to the future pathway as it unfolds, as part of the recurring global stocktake, if global cost-effectiveness is a key consideration.},

The protocell subcompartments can sense extracellular signals, take actions in response to these stimuli, and adapt their physicochemical behaviors. The tiered protocells are also capable of enriching biomolecular reactants within the confined organelles, thereby accelerating enzymatic reactions. The ability of signal processing inside protocells allows us to design the Boolean logic gates (NOR and NAND) using biochemical inputs.

This neural circuit potently suppresses food intake via enhanced satiation response. Notably, this cohort of DA cVTA neurons is activated immediately before the cessation of each feeding bout. Acute inhibition of these DA neurons before bout termination substantially suppresses satiety and prolongs the consummatory feeding. Activation of postsynaptic DRD1 LPBN neurons inhibits feeding, whereas genetic deletion of Drd1 within the LPBN causes robust increase in food intake and subsequent weight gain. Furthermore, the DRD1 LPBN signaling manifests the central mechanism in methylphenidate-induced hypophagia. In conclusion, our study illuminates a hindbrain DAergic circuit that controls feeding through dynamic regulation in satiety response and meal structure.},

BRD4 methylation negatively regulates the expression of genes that are involved in translation and inhibits total mRNA translation in cells. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that supports a model where BRD4 methylation by SETD6 does not have a direct role in the association with acetylated histone H4 at chromatin. However, this methylation specifically determines the recruitment of the transcription factor E2F1 to selected target genes that are involved in mRNA translation.

In field-collected and laboratory-incubated samples, foraminifera expressed denitrification genes regardless of oxygen regime with a putative nitric oxide dismutase, a characteristic enzyme of oxygenic denitrification. A pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase was highly expressed, indicating the capability for anaerobic energy generation during exposure to hypoxia and anoxia. Near-complete expression of a diatom’s plastid genome in one foraminiferal species suggests kleptoplasty or sequestration of functional plastids, conferring a metabolic advantage despite the host living far below the euphotic zone.

We report an intricate interplay between three transcription factors regulating the mitochondrial stress response: CHOP, C/EBPβ, and ATF4. We show that CHOP acts as a rheostat that attenuates prolonged ISR, prevents unfavorable metabolic alterations, and postpones the onset of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy. Upon mitochondrial dysfunction, CHOP interaction with C/EBPβ is needed to adjust ATF4 levels, thus preventing overactivation of the ATF4-regulated transcriptional program. Failure of this interaction switches ISR from an acute to a chronic state, leading to early respiratory chain deficiency, energy crisis, and premature death. Therefore, contrary to its previously proposed role as a transcriptional activator of mitochondrial unfolded protein response, our results highlight a role of CHOP in the fine-tuning of mitochondrial ISR in mammals.},

  abstract     = {Sodium, in contrast to other metals, cannot intercalate in graphite, hindering the use of this cheap, abundant element in rechargeable batteries. Here, we report a nanometric graphite-like anode for Na + storage, formed by stacked graphene sheets functionalized only on one side, termed Janus graphene. The asymmetric functionalization allows reversible intercalation of Na + , as monitored by operando Raman spectroelectrochemistry and visualized by imaging ellipsometry. Our Janus graphene has uniform pore size, controllable functionalization density, and few edges; it can store Na + differently from graphite and stacked graphene. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that Na + preferably rests close to -NH 2 group forming synergic ionic bonds to graphene, making the interaction process energetically favorable. The estimated sodium storage up to C 6.9 Na is comparable to graphite for standard lithium ion batteries. Given such encouraging Na + reversible intercalation behavior, our approach provides a way to design carbon-based materials for sodium ion batteries.},

We fabricated electrospun membranes with three types of surface topography (random, aligned, and latticed), introduced them to dorsal skin excisional wounds in mice and rats, and evaluated their effects on wound healing and immunomodulatory properties. An overview of different immune cells in the microenvironment with the help of single-cell RNA sequencing revealed diverse cellular heterogeneity in vivo. The time course of immune response was advanced toward an adaptive immunity–dominant stage by the aligned scaffold. In mice without mature T lymphocytes, lack of wound-induced hair neogenesis indicated a regulatory role of T cells on hair follicle regeneration. The microenvironment around scaffolds involved an intricate interplay of immune and cutaneous cells.},

Here, we established a force mapping method based on a “light nano-antenna” array with the use of piezo-phototronic effect. A spatial resolution of 800 nm and a temporal resolution of 333 ms have been demonstrated for force mapping. The dynamic mapping of cell force of live cardiomyocytes was directly derived by locating the antennas’ positions and quantifying the light intensities of the piezo-phototronic light nano-antenna array. This study presents a rapid and ultrahigh-resolution methodology for the fundamental study of cardiomyocyte behavior at the cell or subcellular level.

However, it remains unclear whether alterations in mitochondria-innate immune cross-talk contribute to the pathobiology of mitochondrial disorders and aging. Using the polymerase gamma (POLG) mutator model of mitochondrial DNA instability, we report that aberrant activation of the type I interferon (IFN-I) innate immune axis potentiates immunometabolic dysfunction, reduces health span, and accelerates aging in mutator mice. Mechanistically, elevated IFN-I signaling suppresses activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2), which increases oxidative stress, enhances proinflammatory cytokine responses, and accelerates metabolic dysfunction. Ablation of IFN-I signaling attenuates hyperinflammatory phenotypes by restoring NRF2 activity and reducing aerobic glycolysis, which combine to lessen cardiovascular and myeloid dysfunction in aged mutator mice. These findings further advance our knowledge of how mitochondrial dysfunction shapes innate immune responses and provide a framework for understanding mitochondria-driven immunopathology in POLG-related disorders and aging.},

Encoding models that predict neural responses to arbitrary stimuli can be very useful for studying brain function. However, existing models focus on limited aspects of naturalistic stimuli, ignoring the dynamic interactions of modalities in this inherently context-rich paradigm. Using movie-watching data from the Human Connectome Project, we build group-level models of neural activity that incorporate several inductive biases about neural information processing, including hierarchical processing, temporal assimilation, and auditory-visual interactions. We demonstrate how incorporating these biases leads to remarkable prediction performance across large areas of the cortex, beyond the sensory-specific cortices into multisensory sites and frontal cortex. Furthermore, we illustrate that encoding models learn high-level concepts that generalize to task-bound paradigms. Together, our findings underscore the potential of encoding models as powerful tools for studying brain function in ecologically valid conditions.},

Our phylogeographic analyses of PRV-1 suggest that development of Atlantic salmon aquaculture facilitated spread from Europe to the North and South East Pacific. Phylogenetic analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction surveillance further illuminate the circumstances of emergence of PRV-1 in the North East Pacific and provide strong evidence for Atlantic salmon aquaculture as a source of infection in wild Pacific salmon.

The review assesses whether and how this COVID-19–focused research (i) examines components of an integrated system; (ii) accounts for interactions including complex, adaptive dynamics; and (iii) is oriented to informing action. It finds that this research to date has not comprehensively accounted for complex, coupled interactions, especially involving societal factors, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions and hampering efforts to draw broader insights across sustainability-relevant domains. Lack of systems perspective in COVID-19 research reflects a broader challenge in environmental research, which often neglects societal feedbacks. Practical steps through which researchers can better incorporate systems perspectives include using analytical frameworks to identify important components and interactions, connecting frameworks to models and methods, and advancing sustainability science theory and methodology.},

Adult mice exposed to low-dose BPA during gestation displayed notable disruption in circadian activity, social interactions, and associated neural hyperactivity, with some phenotypes maintained transgenerationally. Gestational BPA exposure increased vasopressin + neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the region that regulates circadian rhythms, of F1 and F3 generations. Mechanistically, BPA increased proliferation of hypothalamic neural progenitors ex vivo and caused precocious neurogenesis in vivo. Co-antagonism of both estrogen and androgen receptors was necessary to block BPA’s effects on hypothalamic neural progenitors, illustrating a dual role for these endocrine targets.

Here, we present evidence from records of 14 Antarctic ice cores and 1 central Andean ice core, suggesting that historical fire activity in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) exceeded present-day levels. To understand this observation, we use a global fire model to show that overall SH fire emissions could have declined by 30\% over the 20th century, possibly because of the rapid expansion of land use for agriculture and animal production in middle to high latitudes. Radiative forcing calculations suggest that the decreasing trend in SH fire emissions over the past century largely compensates for the cooling effect of increasing aerosols from fossil fuel and biofuel sources.},

Satellites produce a sixfold overestimate of UHI relative to station measurements (mean SUHI 1.45°C; CUHI 0.26°C), with SUHI exceeding CUHI in 96\% of cities during daytime and in 80\% at night. Using empirical evidence, we confirm the control of aerodynamic roughness on UHI intensity, but find evaporative cooling to have a stronger overall impact during this time period.

Trees on south-facing slopes (SFS) grew faster than those on north-facing slopes (NFS) until the mid-20th century, when this pattern reversed notably with marked growth rate declines on SFS and increases on NFS. Stable isotopes of carbon, oxygen, and carbon-to-nitrogen ratios suggest that this reversal is linked to interactions between CO 2 stimulation of photosynthesis and water or nitrogen limitation.

Eosinophilia is responsible for increased bone metastasis in eosinophil-enriched Cd3 δ -Il-5 transgenic ( Il-5 Tg) mice. We also observe increased eosinophils in the malignant pleural effusion of cancer patients with pleural metastasis. Mechanistically, eosinophils promote tumor cell migration and metastasis formation through secreting C-C motif chemokine ligand 6 (CCL6). Genetic knockout of Ccl6 in Il-5 Tg mice remarkably attenuates bone metastasis. Moreover, inhibition of C-C chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1, the receptor of CCL6) in tumor cells reduces tumor cell migration and metastasis. Thus, our study identifies a CCL6-dependent prometastatic activity of eosinophils, which can be inhibited by targeting CCR1 and represent an approach to preventing metastatic disease.},

This platform integrates a sensor array for measuring inflammatory mediators [tumor necrosis factor–α, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and transforming growth factor–β1], microbial burden ( Staphylococcus aureus ), and physicochemical parameters (temperature and pH) with a microfluidic wound exudate collector and flexible electronics for wireless, smartphone-based data readout. We demonstrate in situ multiplexed monitoring in a mouse wound model and also profile wound exudates from patients with venous leg ulcers. This technology may facilitate more timely and personalized wound management to improve chronic wound healing outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Virus-infected cells and cancers share metabolic commonalities that stem from their insatiable need to replicate while evading the host immune system. These similarities include hijacking signaling mechanisms that induce metabolic rewiring in the host to up-regulate nucleotide metabolism and, in parallel, suppress the immune response. In both cancer and viral infections, the host immune cells and, specifically, lymphocytes augment nucleotide synthesis to support their own proliferation and effector functions. Consequently, established treatment modalities targeting nucleotide metabolism against cancers and virally infected cells may result in restricted immune response. Encouragingly, following the introduction of immunotherapy against cancers, multiple studies improved our understanding for improving antigen presentation to the immune system. We propose here that understanding the immune consequences of targeting nucleotide metabolism against cancers may be harnessed to optimize therapy against viral infections.},

Molecular mechanisms underlying activation of this critical G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling system are still unknown. To fill this gap of knowledge, we report here the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the AVP-V2R-G s complex. Single-particle analysis revealed the presence of three different states. The two best maps were combined with computational and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy constraints to reconstruct two structures of the ternary complex. These structures differ in AVP and G s binding modes. They reveal an original receptor-G s interface in which the Gα s subunit penetrates deep into the active V2R. The structures help to explain how V2R R137H or R137L/C variants can lead to two severe genetic diseases.

Six known binding sites on tubulin dimers have been identified thus far, with five sites on β-tubulin and only one site on α-tubulin, hinting that compounds binding to α-tubulin are less well characterized. Cevipabulin, a microtubule-active antitumor clinical candidate, is widely accepted as a microtubule-stabilizing agent by binding to the vinblastine site. Our x-ray crystallography study reveals that, in addition to binding to the vinblastine site, cevipabulin also binds to a new site on α-tubulin. We find that cevipabulin at this site pushes the αT5 loop outward, making the nonexchangeable GTP exchangeable, which reduces the stability of tubulin, leading to its destabilization and degradation. Our results confirm the existence of a new agent binding site on α-tubulin and shed light on the development of tubulin degraders as a new generation of antimicrotubule drugs targeting this novel site.},

The 3D macroporous framework can inhibit the formation of dendritic Li by capturing metallic Li in the matrix as well as reducing local current density, the lithiophilic nitrogen-doped carbons act as homogeneous nucleation sites owing to the small nucleation barrier, and the Ag nanoparticles improve the Li nucleation and growth behavior with the reversible solid solution–based alloying reaction. As a result, the Ag@CMF composite enables a dendrite-free Li plating/stripping behavior with high Coulombic efficiency for more than 500 cycles.

To enhance LSC targeting, we loaded LNP-Cas9 RNP and the chemokine CXCL12α onto mesenchymal stem cell membrane–coated nanofibril (MSCM-NF) scaffolds mimicking the bone marrow microenvironment. In vitro, CXCL12α release induced migration of LSCs to the scaffolds, and LNP-Cas9 RNP induced efficient gene editing. IL1RAP knockout reduced LSC colony-forming capacity and leukemic burden. Scaffold-based delivery increased the retention time of LNP-Cas9 in the bone marrow cavity. Overall, sustained local delivery of Cas9/IL1RAP sgRNA via CXCL12α-loaded LNP/MSCM-NF scaffolds provides an effective strategy for attenuating LSC growth to improve AML therapy.},

The method is demonstrated on a radiation portal monitor prototype system based on fast organic scintillators, measuring the characteristic fast time and energy correlations between particles emitted in nuclear fission processes. The use of these correlations in real time in conjunction with modern machine learning techniques provides unprecedented imaging efficiency and high spatial resolution.

While the extinction of large animals with popular appeal garners widespread public and research interest, the importance of smaller, less “charismatic” species to ecosystem health is increasingly recognized. Benefitting from systematically collected fossil and archaeological archives, we examined snake and lizard extinctions in the Guadeloupe Islands of the Caribbean. Study of 43, 000 bone remains across six islands revealed a massive extinction of 50 to 70\% of Guadeloupe’s snakes and lizards following European colonization. In contrast, earlier Indigenous populations coexisted with snakes and lizards for thousands of years without affecting their diversity. Study of archaeological remains provides insights into the causes of snake and lizard extinctions and shows that failure to consider fossil-derived data probably contributes to substantial underestimation of human impacts to global biodiversity.},

Here, structural, biochemical, and single-molecule studies show that this transition requires multiple sequential conformational rearrangements in the targeting complex initiated by guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)–driven compaction of the SRP receptor (SR). Disruption of these rearrangements, particularly in mutant SRP54 G226E linked to severe congenital neutropenia, uncouples the SRP/SR GTPase cycle from protein translocation. Structures of targeting intermediates reveal the molecular basis of early SRP-SR recognition and emphasize the role of eukaryote-specific elements in regulating targeting.

Different high-quality meta-images generated by a dual-channel Malus metasurface play the role of keys to encode multiple target images and retrieve them following the principle of SPI. Our work eliminates the conventional digital transmission process of keys in SPI encryption, enables the reusability of a single metasurface in different encryption processes, and thereby paves the way toward a high-security optical encryption between direct and indirect imaging methods.},

Here, we study the Kondo semimetal CeRu 4 Sn 6 by magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and inelastic neutron scattering experiments. The power-law divergence of the magnetic Grünesien ratio reveals that, unexpectedly, this compound is quantum critical without tuning. The dynamical energy over temperature scaling in the neutron response throughout the Brillouin zone and the temperature dependence of the static uniform susceptibility, indicate that temperature is the only energy scale in the criticality. Such behavior, which has been associated with Kondo destruction quantum criticality in metallic systems, could be generic in the semimetal setting.},

Previous demonstrations of exciton polariton topological insulators demand cryogenic temperatures, and their topological properties are usually fixed. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a room temperature exciton polariton topological insulator in a perovskite zigzag lattice. Polarization serves as a degree of freedom to switch between distinct topological phases, and the topologically nontrivial polariton edge states persist in the presence of onsite energy perturbations, showing strong immunity to disorder. We further demonstrate exciton polariton condensation into the topological edge states under optical pumping.

  abstract     = {Bromodomain and extraterminal proteins (BET) are epigenetic readers that play critical roles in gene regulation. Pharmacologic inhibition of the bromodomain present in all BET family members is a promising therapeutic strategy for various diseases, but its impact on individual family members has not been well understood. Using a transcriptional induction paradigm in neurons, we have systematically demonstrated that three major BET family proteins (BRD2/3/4) participated in transcription with different recruitment kinetics, interdependency, and sensitivity to a bromodomain inhibitor, JQ1. In a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS), BRD2/3 and BRD4 showed oppositely altered expression and chromatin binding, correlating with transcriptional dysregulation. Acute inhibition of CBP/p300 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity restored the altered binding patterns of BRD2 and BRD4 and rescued memory impairment in FXS. Our study emphasizes the importance of understanding the BET coordination controlled by a balanced action between HATs with different substrate specificity.},

Here, we demonstrate that the adult hippocampal neural progenitors harbor an inflammatory potential that is proactively suppressed by transcription factor 4 ( Tcf4 ). Deletion of Tcf4 in hippocampal nestin -expressing progenitors causes loss of proliferative capacity and acquisition of myeloid inflammatory properties. This transformation abolishes their differentiation potential and causes production of detrimental factors that adversely affect niche cells, causing inflammation in the dentate gyrus. Thus, on one hand, Tcf4 deletion causes abrogation of proliferative progenitors leading to reduction of adult neurogenesis, while on the other, their accompanying inflammatory transformation inflicts inflammation in the niche. Taken together, we provide the first evidence for a latent inflammatory potential of adult hippocampal neural progenitors and identify Tcf4 as a critical regulator that facilitates adult neurogenesis via proactive suppression of this detrimental potential.},

Recently, breakthroughs such as imaging through biological tissues and looking around corners have been obtained via wavefront-shaping approaches. However, these require an implanted guidestar for determining the wavefront correction, controlled coherent illumination, and most often raster scanning of the shaped focus. Alternative novel computational approaches that exploit speckle correlations avoid guidestars and wavefront control but are limited to small two-dimensional objects contained within the “memory-effect” correlation range. Here, we present a new concept, image-guided wavefront shaping, allowing widefield noninvasive, guidestar-free, incoherent imaging through highly scattering layers, without illumination control. The wavefront correction is found even for objects that are larger than the memory-effect range, by blindly optimizing image quality metrics. We demonstrate imaging of extended objects through highly scattering layers and multicore fibers, paving the way for noninvasive imaging in various applications, from microscopy to endoscopy.},

In this study, we performed comprehensive CRISPR screens to interrogate the regulatory network of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC cells. We found marked discrepancies between the artificial TOP reporter activity and β-catenin–mediated endogenous transcription and redundant roles of T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor transcription factors in transducing β-catenin signaling. Compiled functional genomic screens and network analysis revealed unique epigenetic regulators of β-catenin transcriptional output, including the histone lysine methyltransferase 2A oncoprotein (KMT2A/Mll1). Using an integrative epigenomic and transcriptional profiling approach, we show that KMT2A loss diminishes the binding of β-catenin to consensus DNA motifs and the transcription of β-catenin targets in CRC. These results suggest that KMT2A may be a promising target for CRCs and highlight the broader potential for exploiting epigenetic modulation as a therapeutic strategy for β-catenin–driven malignancies.},

We next identify the pol α-primase complex to limit deletion mutagenesis, a conclusion substantiated by whole-genome analysis of animals carrying mutated POLA2/DIV-1. We subsequently identify a new role for the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp in protecting Okazaki fragments from resection by EXO1.

The resulting “alchemical” enantiomers have the same electronic energy up to the third order, independent of respective covalent bond topology, imposing relevant constraints on chemical bonding. Alchemical chirality deepens our understanding of CCS and enables the establishment of trends without empiricism for any materials with fixed lattices. We demonstrate the efficacy for three cases: (i) new rules for electronic energy contributions to chemical bonding; (ii) analysis of the electron density of BN-doped benzene; and (iii) ranking over 2000 and 4 million BN-doped naphthalene and picene derivatives, respectively.},

We identify dynamins, yeast Vps1 orthologs, as DCV fusion site organizers in mammalian neurons. Genetic or pharmacological inactivation of all three dynamins strongly impaired DCV exocytosis, while SV exocytosis remained unaffected. Wild-type dynamin restored normal exocytosis but not guanosine triphosphatase–deficient or membrane-binding mutants that cause neurodevelopmental syndromes. During prolonged stimulation, repeated use of the same DCV fusion location was impaired in dynamin 1-3 triple knockout neurons. The syntaxin-1 staining efficiency, but not its expression level, was reduced. αSNAP (α–soluble N -ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein) expression restored this. We conclude that mammalian dynamins organize DCV fusion sites, downstream of αSNAP, by regulating the equilibrium between fusogenic and non-fusogenic syntaxin-1 promoting its availability for SNARE (SNAP receptor) complex formation and DCV exocytosis.},

Unbiased high-throughput chemical screening revealed that the highest synergistic antiproliferative effects observed were the combinations of DNA-damaging agents with TAK-931. Functional phosphoproteomic analysis demonstrated that TAK-931 suppressed homologous recombination repair activity, delayed recovery from double-strand breaks, and led to accumulation of DNA damages in the combination. Whole-genome small interfering RNA library screening identified sensitivity-modulating molecules, which propose the experimentally predicted target cancer types for the combination, including pancreatic, esophageal, ovarian, and breast cancers.

  abstract     = {Critical slowing down of the time it takes a system to reach equilibrium is a key signature of bistability in dissipative first-order phase transitions. Understanding and characterizing this process can shed light on the underlying many-body dynamics that occur close to such a transition. Here, we explore the rich quantum activation dynamics and the appearance of critical slowing down in an engineered superconducting quantum circuit. Specifically, we investigate the intermediate bistable regime of the generalized Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian (GJC), realized by a circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) system consisting of a transmon qubit coupled to a microwave cavity. We find a previously unidentified regime of quantum activation in which the critical slowing down reaches saturation and, by comparing our experimental results with a range of models, we shed light on the fundamental role played by the qubit in this regime.},

Here, we found that (i) myeloid cell–specific myeloid-derived growth factor (MYDGF) deficiency exacerbated vascular inflammation, adhesion responses, endothelial injury, and atherosclerosis in vivo. (ii) Myeloid cell–specific MYDGF restoration attenuated vascular inflammation, adhesion responses and leukocyte homing and alleviated endothelial injury and atherosclerosis in vivo. (iii) MYDGF attenuated endothelial inflammation, apoptosis, permeability, and adhesion responses induced by palmitic acid in vitro. (iv) MYDGF alleviated endothelial injury and atherosclerosis through mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4)/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. Therefore, we concluded that MYDGF inhibits endothelial inflammation and adhesion responses, blunts leukocyte homing, protects against endothelial injury and atherosclerosis in a manner involving MAP4K4/NF-κB signaling, and serves as a cross-talk factor between bone marrow and arteries to regulate the pathophysiology of arteries. Bone marrow functions as an endocrine organ and serves as a potential therapeutic target for metabolic disorders.},

We hypothesized that an age-related reduction in C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7)–dependent egress of immune cells through the lymphatic vasculature mediates some aspects of brain aging and potentially exacerbates cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease–like brain β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology. We report a reduction in CCR7 expression by meningeal T cells in old mice that is linked to increased effector and regulatory T cells. Hematopoietic CCR7 deficiency mimicked the aging-associated changes in meningeal T cells and led to reduced glymphatic influx and cognitive impairment. Deletion of CCR7 in 5xFAD transgenic mice resulted in deleterious neurovascular and microglial activation, along with increased Aβ deposition in the brain. Treating old mice with anti-CD25 antibodies alleviated the exacerbated meningeal regulatory T cell response and improved cognitive function, highlighting the therapeutic potential of modulating meningeal immunity to fine-tune brain function in aging and in neurodegenerative diseases.},

Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors are powerful tools to dissect compartmentalized signaling, but current approaches to probe these microdomains typically rely on biosensor fusion and overexpression of critical regulatory elements. Here, we present a novel class of biosensors named FluoSTEPs (fluorescent sensors targeted to endogenous proteins) that combine self-complementing split green fluorescent protein, CRISPR-mediated knock-in, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer biosensor technology to probe compartmentalized signaling dynamics in situ. We designed FluoSTEPs for simultaneously highlighting endogenous microdomains and reporting domain-specific, real-time signaling events including kinase activities, guanosine triphosphatase activation, and second messenger dynamics in live cells. A FluoSTEP for 3′, 5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) revealed distinct cAMP dynamics within clathrin microdomains in response to stimulation of G protein–coupled receptors, showcasing the utility of FluoSTEPs in probing spatiotemporal regulation within endogenous signaling architectures.},

Previous work hypothesized that the surface of gecko setae is hydrophobic, with nonpolar lipid tails exposed on the surface. However, direct experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis and its implications on the adhesion mechanism is lacking. Here, we investigate the sapphire-setae contact interface using interface-sensitive spectroscopy and provide direct evidence of the involvement of acid-base interactions between polar lipid headgroups exposed on the setal surface and sapphire. During detachment, a layer of unbound lipids is left as a footprint due to cohesive failure within the lipid layer, which, in turn, reduces wear to setae during high stress sliding. The absence of this lipid layer enhances adhesion, despite a small setal-substrate contact area. Our results show that gecko adhesion is not exclusively a vdW-based, residue-free system.},

In this study, we demonstrate that plants contain endogenous levels of TMAO, that it is synthesized by flavin-containing monooxygenases, and that its levels increase in response to abiotic stress conditions. In addition, our results reveal that TMAO operates as a protective osmolyte in plants, promoting appropriate protein folding and as an activator of abiotic stress–induced gene expression. Consistent with these functions, we show that TMAO enhances plant adaptation to low temperatures, drought, and high salt. We have thus uncovered a previously unidentified plant molecule that positively regulates abiotic stress tolerance.},

Studies are investigating how checkpoints are hijacked by cancer cells and why most patients remain resistant to immunotherapy. Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), which drives tumor cell invasion via the Zeb1 transcription factor, is linked to immunotherapy resistance. In addition, M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which inhibit T cell migration and activation, may also cause immunotherapy resistance. How EMT in invading cancer cells is linked to therapy resistance and events driving TAM M2 polarization are therefore important questions. We show that Zeb1 links these two resistance pathways because it is required for PDL1 expression on invading lung cancer cells, and it also induces CD47 on these invading cells, which drives M2 polarization of adjacent TAMs. Resulting reprogramming of the microenvironment around invading cells shields them from the hostile inflammatory environment surrounding tumors.},

The loss of subsoil carbon was primarily from unprotected particulate organic matter. Warming also stimulated a sustained 30 ± 4\% increase in soil CO 2 efflux due to increased CO 2 production through the whole-soil profile. The observed in situ decline in subsoil carbon stocks with warming is now definitive evidence of a positive soil carbon-climate feedback, which could not be concluded based on increases in CO 2 effluxes alone.

Purification of MDC1 in the absence of exogenous DNA damage revealed interactions with factors involved in gene expression and RNA processing, in addition to DDR factors. ChIP-seq showed that MRN subunits, MRE11 and NBS1, colocalized throughout the genome, notably at TSSs and bodies of actively transcribing genes, which was dependent on the RNAPII transcriptional complex rather than transcription per se. Depletion of MRN increased RNAPII abundance at MRE11/NBS1-bound genes. Prolonged MRE11 or NBS1 depletion induced single-nucleotide polymorphisms across actively transcribing MRN target genes.

  abstract     = {Proanthocyanidins (PAs) are plant natural products important for agriculture and human health. They are polymers of flavan-3-ol subunits, commonly (−)-epicatechin and/or (+)-catechin, but the source of the in planta extension unit that comprises the bulk of the polymer remains unclear, as does how PA composition is determined in different plant species. Anthocyanidin reductase (ANR) can generate 2, 3- cis -epicatechin as a PA starter unit from cyanidin, which itself arises from 2, 3- trans -leucocyanidin, but ANR proteins from different species produce mixtures of flavan-3-ols with different stereochemistries in vitro. Genetic and biochemical analyses here show that ANR has dual activity and is involved not only in the production of (−)-epicatechin starter units but also in the formation of 2, 3- cis -leucocyanidin to serve as (−)-epicatechin extension units. Differences in the product specificities of ANRs account for the presence/absence of PA polymerization and the compositions of PAs across plant species.},

  abstract     = {While skeletal muscle has a high capacity for endogenous repair in acute injuries, volumetric muscle loss can leave long-lasting or permanent structural and functional deficits to the injured muscle and surrounding tissues. With clinical treatments failing to repair lost tissue, there is a great need for a tissue-engineered therapy to promote skeletal muscle regeneration. In this study, we aim to assess the potential for electrospun decellularized skeletal muscle extracellular matrix (dECM) with tunable physicochemical properties to control mouse myoblast growth and myotube formation. The material properties as well as cell behavior – growth and differentiation – were assessed in response to modulation of crosslinking and scaffold architecture. The fabrication of a bioactive dECM-based system with tunable physicochemical properties that can control myotube formation has several applications in skeletal muscle engineering and may bring the field one step closer to developing a therapy to address these unmet clinical needs.},

Several pharmacologically relevant but structurally unrelated small molecules have been identified as specific complex I inhibitors, but their modes of action remain unclear. Here, we present a 3.0-Å resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of mammalian complex I inhibited by a derivative of IACS-010759, which is currently in clinical development against cancers reliant on oxidative phosphorylation, revealing its unique cork-in-bottle mechanism of inhibition. We combine structural and kinetic analyses to deconvolute cross-species differences in inhibition and identify the structural motif of a “chain” of aromatic rings as a characteristic that promotes inhibition.

To reveal the little-known ecosystem dynamics, we identified prey, measured feeding events, and quantified the daily energy balance of 48 deep-diving elephant seals throughout their oceanic migrations by leveraging innovative technologies: animal-borne smart accelerometers and video cameras. Seals only attained positive energy balance after feeding 1000 to 2000 times per day on small fishes, which required continuous deep diving (80 to 100\% of each day). Interspecies allometry suggests that female elephant seals have exceptional diving abilities relative to their body size, enabling them to exploit a unique foraging niche on small but abundant mesopelagic fish. This unique foraging niche requires extreme round-the-clock deep diving, limiting the behavioral plasticity of elephant seals to a changing mesopelagic ecosystem.},

Here, we investigate the aggregation of α-synuclein bound to negatively charged phospholipid small unilamellar vesicles. Through a combination of kinetic and structural studies, we identify key time points in the aggregation process that enable targeted isolation of prefibrillar and early fibrillar intermediates. By using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, we show the gradual buildup of structural features in an α-synuclein fibril filament, revealing a segmental folding process. We identify distinct membrane-binding domains in α-synuclein aggregates, and the combined data are used to present a comprehensive mechanism of the folding of α-synuclein on lipid membranes.},

Here, we found that the abundance of Vangl proteins is tightly controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system through endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation (ERAD). The key ERAD component p97/VCP directly binds to Vangl at a highly conserved VCP-interacting motif and recruits the E3 ligase KBTBD7 via its UBA-UBX adaptors to promote Vangl ubiquitination and ERAD. We found that Wnt5a/CK1 prevents Vangl ubiquitination and ERAD by inducing Vangl phosphorylation, which facilitates Vangl export from the ER to the plasma membrane. We also provide in vivo evidence that KBTBD7 regulates convergent extension during zebrafish gastrulation and functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer by promoting Vangl degradation. Our findings reveal a previously unknown regulatory mechanism of Wnt/PCP signaling through the p97/VCP-KBTBD7–mediated ERAD pathway.},

Recent advances in high-entropy materials (HEMs) have triggered broad interests in exploring entropy-stabilized systems for catalysis, where the enhanced configurational entropy affords a virtually unlimited scope for tailoring the structures and properties of HEMs. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the discovery and design of HEMs for catalysis. The correlation between compositional and structural engineering and optimization of the catalytic behaviors is highlighted for high-entropy alloys, oxides, and beyond. Tuning composition and configuration of HEMs introduces untapped opportunities for accessing better catalysts and resolving issues that are considered challenging in conventional, simple systems.},

The challenge is further intensified by the tedious training of conventional recurrent neural networks for edge deployment. Here, we report in-sensor reservoir computing for language learning. High dimensionality, nonlinearity, and fading memory for the in-sensor reservoir were achieved via two-dimensional memristors based on tin sulfide (SnS), uniquely having dual-type defect states associated with Sn and S vacancies.

Specifically, while unconventional myosins have been associated with transporting cargo along F-actin to spatially target cytoskeletal assembly, we now find they also target disassembly. Myo15 specifically positions this F-actin disassembly by associating with Mical and using its motor and MyTH4-FERM cargo-transporting functions to broaden Mical’s distribution. Myo15’s broadening of Mical’s distribution also expands and directionally orients Mical-mediated F-actin disassembly and subsequent cellular remodeling, including in response to Semaphorin/Plexin cell surface activation signals. Thus, we identify a mechanism that spatiotemporally propagates F-actin disassembly while also proposing that other F-actin-trafficked-cargo is derailed by this disassembly to directionally orient rebuilding.},

Because of its natural occurrence in circular form, DNA has been extensively used as a proxy to study the fundamental physics of ring polymers in different topological states. Yet, torsionally constrained—such as supercoiled—topologies have been largely neglected so far. The applicability of existing theoretical models to dense supercoiled DNA is thus unknown. Here, we address this gap by coupling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with differential dynamic microscopy of entangled supercoiled DNA plasmids. We find that, unexpectedly, larger supercoiling increases the size of entangled plasmids and concomitantly induces an enhancement in DNA mobility. These findings are reconciled as due to supercoiling-driven asymmetric and double-folded plasmid conformations that reduce interplasmid entanglements and threadings. Our results suggest a way to topologically tune DNA mobility via supercoiling, thus enabling topological control over the (micro)rheology of DNA-based complex fluids.},

  abstract     = {Organisms make decisions based on the information they gather from their environment, the effects of which affect their fitness. Understanding how these interactions affect physiology may generate interventions that improve the length and quality of life. Here, we provide evidence that exposure to live yeast volatiles during starvation significantly extends survival, increases activity, and slows the rate of triacylglyceride (TAG) decline independent of canonical sensory perception. We demonstrate that ethanol (EtOH) is one of the active components in yeast volatiles that influences these phenotypes and that EtOH metabolites mediate dynamic mechanisms to promote Drosophila survival. Silencing R4d neurons reverses the ability of high EtOH concentrations to promote starvation survival, and their activation promotes EtOH metabolism. The transcription factor foxo promotes EtOH resistance, likely by protection from EtOH toxicity. Our results suggest that food-related cues recruit neural circuits and modulate stress signaling pathways to promote survival during starvation.},

Biofunctional scaffolds were here prepared by immobilizing mesenchymal stromal exosomes onto fibrous polyester materials and allowed cell-mediated delivery of membrane-bound vesicles. Quantitative cell-level analyses revealed that immune cells dominated the uptake of exosomes from scaffolds in vivo, with materials and exosomes acting as the recruiter and trainer for immune cells, respectively, to synergistically promote beneficial macrophage and regulatory T cell responses in skin wounds in mice. Adaptive T helper cell responses were found active in remote immune organs, and exosome-laden scaffolds facilitated tissue repair in large skin injury models. This study demonstrated important mechanisms involved in local and systemic immune responses to biological implants, and understanding tissue-reparative immunomodulation may guide the design of new biofunctional scaffolds.},

However, building a TCR-antigen interaction map has been challenging due to the staggering diversity of TCRs and antigens. Accordingly, highly multiplexed dextramer-TCR binding assays have been recently developed, but the utility of the ensuing large datasets is limited by the lack of robust computational methods for normalization and interpretation. Here, we present a computational framework comprising a novel method, ICON (Integrative COntext-specific Normalization), for identifying reliable TCR-pMHC (peptide–major histocompatibility complex) interactions and a neural network–based classifier TCRAI that outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for TCR-antigen specificity prediction. We further demonstrated that by combining ICON and TCRAI, we are able to discover novel subgroups of TCRs that bind to a given pMHC via different mechanisms. Our framework facilitates the identification and understanding of TCR-antigen–specific interactions for basic immunological research and clinical immune monitoring.},

Using rabies-virus tracing and optogenetics-assisted recording, we analyzed the long-range connections to various brain regions along the hierarchy of visual processing, including primary visual cortex, medial association cortices, and frontal cortices. We found that hierarchical corticocortical and thalamocortical connectivity is reflected by the relative weights of inputs to parvalbumin-positive (PV + ) and vasoactive intestinal peptide–positive (VIP + ) neurons within the conserved local circuit motif, with bottom-up and top-down inputs preferring PV + and VIP + neurons, respectively. Our algorithms based on innervation weights for these two types of local interneurons generated testable predictions of the hierarchical position of many brain areas. These results support the notion that preferential long-range inputs to specific local interneurons are essential for the hierarchical information flow in the brain.},

Genetic defects in these three proteins cause the lysosomal storage diseases GM1-gangliosidosis/mucopolysaccharidosis IV type B, sialidosis, and galactosialidosis, respectively. To better understand the interactions between these enzymes, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the murine LMC core. This 0.8-MDa complex is composed of three GLB1 dimers and three CTSA dimers, adopting a triangular architecture maintained through six copies of a unique GLB1-CTSA polar interface. Mutations in this contact surface that occur in GM1-gangliosidosis prevent formation of the LMC in vitro. These findings may facilitate development of therapies for lysosomal storage disorders.},

We analyzed plant-herbivore networks based on literature-derived interactions and long-term sampling from 289 grasslands and forests in three regions of Germany. Network size and nestedness were the most important determinants of network robustness in both ecosystems. Along land-use intensity gradients, networks in moderately grazed grasslands were more robust than in those managed by frequent mowing or fertilization. In forests, changes of network robustness along land-use intensity gradients relied on changes in plant species richness. Our results expand our knowledge of the stability of plant-herbivore networks and indicate options for management aimed at stabilizing herbivore communities.},

Quasi-impulsive and wave vector–specific renormalization of soft zone-boundary phonon frequencies (stiffening) is observed, followed by wave vector–independent electron-phonon equilibration.

In this study, we modified electrodes with RuO 2 nanosheets to enhance the extraction of PEs from thylakoids, and the PE transfer was promoted by proton adsorption and surface polarity characteristics. The adsorbed protons maintained the potential of an electrode more positive, and the surface polarity enhanced thylakoid attachment to the electrode in addition to promoting ensemble docking between the redox species and the electrode. The RuO 2 bioanode exhibited a five times larger current density and a four times larger power density than the Au bioanode.

Neutron tomography now enabled us to reveal the lens types Van Leeuwenhoek used. We argue that Van Leeuwenhoek’s instruments incorporate some innovations that testify to an awareness of concurrent developments. In particular, our analysis shows that for making his best-performing microscopes, Van Leeuwenhoek deployed a lens-making procedure popularized in 1678 by Robert Hooke. This is notable, as Hooke always wanted to find the secret of Van Leeuwenhoek’s lenses, but never managed to do so. Therefore, Van Leeuwenhoek was far from the isolated scholar he is often claimed to be; rather, his secrecy about his lenses was motivated by an attempt to conceal his indebtedness to Hooke.},

Here, we identify and characterize SAMD1 (SAM domain-containing protein 1) as an unmethylated CGI-binding protein. SAMD1 has an atypical winged-helix domain that directly recognizes unmethylated CpG-containing DNA via simultaneous interactions with both the major and the minor groove. The SAM domain interacts with L3MBTL3, but it can also homopolymerize into a closed pentameric ring. At a genome-wide level, SAMD1 localizes to H3K4me3-decorated CGIs, where it acts as a repressor. SAMD1 tethers L3MBTL3 to chromatin and interacts with the KDM1A histone demethylase complex to modulate H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels at CGIs, thereby providing a mechanism for SAMD1-mediated transcriptional repression. The absence of SAMD1 impairs ES cell differentiation processes, leading to misregulation of key biological pathways. Together, our work establishes SAMD1 as a newly identified chromatin regulator acting at unmethylated CGIs.},

In adult flies, Iswi neural knockdown caused decreased brain size, aberrant mushroom body morphology, and abnormal locomotor function.

The shelf geometry and orientation relative to the storm acted to stabilize and strengthen stratification. This maintained elevated sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) throughout the storm and led to an estimated 65\% greater potential hurricane intensity contribution at this site before eye passage. Coastal cooling did not occur until 11 hours after the eye passage.

  abstract     = {Methods capable of maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis to prevent bacterial translocation and infection under external threats are critical for multiple facets of human health but have been rarely reported. Here, we describe the elicitation of mucosal immunity to modulate the gut microbiota by oral delivery of living probiotics into Peyer’s patches. Probiotics are individually camouflaged within a yeast membrane, on which the embedded β-glucan can facilitate the phagocytosis of microfold cells that locate in the intestinal epithelium. The delivery of probiotics into lymphoid follicles after oral ingestion promotes robust mucosal immune responses and notably upgrades the production of secretory immunoglobulin A. The provoked immunity positively regulates the gut microflora, which, in turn, retains gut homeostasis and provides defense against environmental attacks. In two murine models of gut barrier impairment, oral administration with camouflaged probiotics effectively prevents the breakdown of intestinal barrier and evidences limited bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation.},

  abstract     = {Ice-sheet responses to climate warming and associated sea-level rise depend sensitively on the form of the slip law that relates drag at the beds of glaciers to their slip velocity and basal water pressure. Process-based models of glacier slip over idealized, hard (rigid) beds with water-filled cavities yield slip laws in which drag decreases with increasing slip velocity or water pressure (rate-weakening drag). We present results of a process-based, three-dimensional model of glacier slip applied to measured bed topographies. We find that consideration of actual glacier beds eliminates or makes insignificant rate-weakening drag, thereby uniting process-based models of slip with some ice-sheet model parameterizations. Computed slip laws have the same form as those indicated by experiments with ice dragged over deformable till, the other common bed condition. Thus, these results may point to a universal slip law that would simplify and improve estimations of glacier discharges to the oceans.},

Here, we advance our understanding of glacier thermodynamics with an exceptionally high-vertical-resolution (~0.65 m), distributed-fiber-optic temperature-sensing profile from a 1043-m borehole drilled to the base of Sermeq Kujalleq (Store Glacier), Greenland. We report substantial but isolated strain heating within interglacial-phase ice at 208 to 242 m depth together with strongly heterogeneous ice deformation in glacial-phase ice below 889 m. We also observe a high-strain interface between glacial- and interglacial-phase ice and a 73-m-thick temperate basal layer, interpreted as locally formed and important for the glacier’s fast motion. These findings demonstrate notable spatial heterogeneity, both vertically and at the catchment scale, in the conditions facilitating the fast motion of marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland.},

However, the fundamental electrical and thermal transport in these materials has remained elusive due to the heterogeneity of bulk, polycrystalline, thin films reported thus far. Here, we systematically investigate a model hybrid comprising a single core/shell nanowire of Te-PEDOT:PSS. We show that as the nanowire diameter is reduced, the electrical conductivity increases and the thermal conductivity decreases, while the Seebeck coefficient remains nearly constant—this collectively results in a figure of merit, ZT , of 0.54 at 400 K. The origin of the decoupling of charge and heat transport lies in the fact that electrical transport occurs through the organic shell, while thermal transport is driven by the inorganic core. This study establishes design principles for high-performing thermoelectrics that leverage the unique interactions occurring at the interfaces of hybrid nanowires.},

A molecular chaperone, premembrane (prM) maintains the virus particles in an immature, fusion-incompetent state until they exit the cell. Taking advantage of an insect virus that produces particles that are both immature and infectious, we determined the structure of the first immature flavivirus with a complete spike by cryo–electron microscopy. Unexpectedly, the prM chaperone forms a supporting pillar that maintains the immature spike in an asymmetric and upright state, primed for large rearrangements upon acidification. The collapse of the spike along a path defined by the prM chaperone is required, and its inhibition by a multivalent immunoglobulin M blocks infection. The revised architecture and collapse model are likely to be conserved across flaviviruses.},

Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) involves introducing large amounts of CI material well within the stratosphere to enhance the aerosol loading, thereby increasing reflection of solar radiation. We explore a delivery method termed solar-powered lofting (SPL) that uses solar energy to loft CI material injected at lower altitudes accessible by conventional aircraft. Particles that absorb solar radiation are dispersed with the CI material and heat the surrounding air. The heated air rises, carrying the CI material to the stratosphere. Global model simulations show that black carbon aerosol (10 microgram per cubic meter) is sufficient to quickly loft CI material well into the stratosphere. SPL could make SAI viable at present, is also more energy efficient, and disperses CI material faster than direct stratospheric injection.},

Here, we investigate the evolution of local structural homogeneity on an individual particle level in amorphous jammed two-dimensional (athermal) systems under oscillatory shear and relate this evolution to rearrangement, memory, and macroscale rheological measurements. We define the structural metric crystalline shielding, and show that it is predictive of rearrangement propensity and structural volatility of individual particles under shear. We use this metric to identify localized regions of the system in which the material’s memory of its preparation is preserved.

The value signal was maintained for many objects (&gt;90) many weeks after reward learning and was resistant to extinction in both regions and to repetition suppression in vlPFC. Both regions showed comparable granularity in encoding expected value and value uncertainty, which was paralleled by enhanced gaze bias during free viewing.

Here, we describe functional interferometric diffusing wave spectroscopy (fiDWS), which introduces and collects near-infrared light via the scalp, using inexpensive detector arrays to rapidly monitor coherent light fluctuations that encode brain blood flow index (BFI), a surrogate for CBF. Compared to other functional optical approaches, fiDWS measures BFI faster and deeper while also providing continuous wave absorption signals. Achieving clear pulsatile BFI waveforms at source-collector separations of 3.5 cm, we confirm that optical BFI, not absorption, shows a graded hypercapnic response consistent with human cerebrovascular physiology, and that BFI has a better contrast-to-noise ratio than absorption during brain activation. By providing high-throughput measurements of optical BFI at low cost, fiDWS will expand access to CBF.},

We leveraged a gas-solid (CO 2 –lithium peroxide) reaction that was completely separated from the aqueous cellular environment by a gas permeable membrane. O 2 measurements and imaging validated CO 2 -responsive O 2 release, which improved cell survival in hypoxic conditions. Simulation-guided optimization yielded a device that restored normoglycemia of immunocompetent diabetic mice for over 3 months. Furthermore, functional islets were observed in scaled-up device implants in minipigs retrieved after 2 months. This inverse breathing device provides a potential system to support long-term cell function in the clinically attractive subcutaneous site.},

Here, we combine lidar, archaeological excavation data, radiocarbon dates, and machine learning algorithms to create maps that model the development of the city and its population growth through time. We conclude that the Greater Angkor Region was home to approximately 700, 000 to 900, 000 inhabitants at its apogee in the 13th century CE. This granular, diachronic, paleodemographic model of the Angkor complex can be applied to any ancient civilization.},

  abstract     = {The checkpoint kinase ATR [ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) and rad3-related] is a master regulator of DNA damage response. Yet, how ATR activity is regulated remains to be investigated. We report here that histone demethylase PHF8 (plant homeodomain finger protein 8) plays a key role in ATR activation and replication stress response. Mechanistically, PHF8 interacts with and demethylates TOPBP1 (DNA topoisomerase 2-binding protein 1), an essential allosteric activator of ATR, under unperturbed conditions, but replication stress results in PHF8 phosphorylation and dissociation from TOPBP1. Consequently, hypomethylated TOPBP1 facilitates RAD9 (RADiation sensitive 9) binding and chromatin loading of the TOPBP1-RAD9 complex to fully activate ATR and thus safeguard the genome and protect cells against replication stress. Our study uncovers a demethylation and phosphorylation code that controls the assembly of TOPBP1-scaffolded protein complex, and provides molecular insight into non-histone methylation switch in ATR activation.},

Socioeconomic drivers of the wildlife trade are influential at the local scale yet rarely accounted for in multinational agreements aimed at curtailing international trade in threatened species. In recent decades (1998–2018), approximately 421, 000, 000 threatened (i.e., CITES-listed) wild animals were traded between 226 nations/territories. The global trade network was more highly connected under conditions of greater international wealth inequality, when rich importers may have a larger economic advantage over poorer exporting nations/territories. Bilateral trade was driven primarily by socioeconomic factors at the supply end, with wealthier exporters likely to supply more animals to the global market. Our findings suggest that international policies for reducing the global wildlife trade should address inequalities between signatory states, possibly using incentive/compensation-driven programs modeled after other transnational environmental initiatives (e.g., REDD+).},

Although previous studies have pointed out the importance of nonuniform body bending stiffness distribution ( k ) in improving the undulatory swimming efficiency of adult fish–like robots in the inertial flow regime, whether such an elastic mechanism is beneficial in the intermediate flow regime remains elusive. Hence, we develop a class of untethered soft milliswimmers consisting of a magnetic composite head and a passive elastic body with different k . These robots realize larval zebrafish–like undulatory swimming at the same scale. Investigations reveal that uniform k and high swimming frequency (60 to 100 Hz) are favorable to improve their efficiency. A shape memory polymer–based milliswimmer with tunable k on the fly confirms such findings. Such acquired knowledge can guide the design of energy-efficient leading edge–driven soft undulatory milliswimmers for future environmental and biomedical applications in the same flow regime.},

PDAC cells acquire metabolic changes that augment NADPH production and cytosolic redox homeostasis. Here, we show that high NADPH levels drive activity of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. NOX4 produces H 2 O 2 metabolized by peroxiredoxin 4 (PRDX4) in the ER lumen. Using functional genomics and subsequent in vitro and in vivo validations, we find that PDAC cell lines with high NADPH levels are dependent on PRDX4 for their growth and survival. PRDX4 addiction is associated with increased reactive oxygen species, a DNA-PKcs–governed DNA damage response and radiosensitivity, which can be rescued by depletion of NOX4 or NADPH. Hence, this study has identified NOX4 as a protein that paradoxically converts the reducing power of the cytosol to an ER-specific oxidative stress vulnerability in PDAC that may be therapeutically exploited by targeting PRDX4.},

Linking survey and Census data, we follow a population-representative U.S. sample, including large subsamples of young women living in Colorado in 2010 and in comparison states. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find expansion of access to contraception was associated with a statistically significant 1.66 percentage-point increase in high school graduation. This increase in graduation represents a 14\% decrease in the baseline percentage not graduating high school before the policy change. Results are robust to a variety of sensitivity tests.

Close to a magic twist angle, insulating behavior is observed, which gives way to superconductivity on doping. Here, we propose a unifying description of both observations. A symmetry breaking condensate leads to the ordered insulator, while topological solitons in the condensate—skyrmions—are shown to be charge 2 e bosons. Condensation of skyrmions leads to a superconductor, whose physical properties we calculate. More generally, we show how topological textures can mitigate Coulomb repulsion and provide a previously unexplored route to superconductivity.

ELF3, a proposed thermosensor, negatively regulates protein activity of the growth-promoting factor PIF4, and such an inhibitory effect is subjected to attenuation at warm temperature. However, how ELF3 stability is regulated at warm temperature remains enigmatic. Here, we report the identification of XBAT31 as the E3 ligase that mediates ELF3 degradation in response to warm temperature in Arabidopsis . XBAT31 interacts with ELF3, ubiquitinates ELF3, and promotes ELF3 degradation via the 26S proteasome. Mutation of XBAT31 results in enhanced accumulation of ELF3 and reduced hypocotyl elongation at warm temperature. In contrast, overexpression of XBAT31 accelerates ELF3 degradation and promotes hypocotyl growth. Furthermore, XBAT31 interacts with the B-box protein BBX18, and the XBAT31-mediated ELF3 degradation is dependent on BBX18 . Thus, our findings reveal that XBAT31-mediated destruction of ELF3 represents an additional regulatory layer of complexity in temperature signaling during plant thermomorphogenesis.},

We demonstrate from quantitative experiments and multiphysics simulations that parametric surface grooving can induce temporary asynchronous swelling or deswelling and can transform flat objects into designed, three-dimensional shapes. By tuning the grooving pattern, we can achieve both zero (e.g., helices) and nonzero (e.g., saddles) Gaussian curvature geometries.

Whereas previous studies documented extinction selectivity for crinoids during background extinction, we find no evidence for selectivity during mass extinctions. Despite no evidence for extinction selectivity, disparity remains strongly correlated with richness over extinction events, contradicting expected patterns of disparity given nonselective extinction. Results indicate that (i) disparity and richness can remain coupled across extinctions even when selective extinction does not occur, (ii) simultaneous decreases in taxonomic diversity and disparity are insufficient evidence for extinction selectivity, and (iii) selectivity differs between background and mass extinction regimes.},

We determine the kinetics of the response and show that intergenerational immunity prevents host-cell invasion by Nematocida parisii and enhances survival to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa . We demonstrate that immunity is induced by the parental transcriptional response to infection, which can be mimicked through maternal somatic depletion of PALS-22 and the retinoblastoma protein ortholog, LIN-35. We find that other biotic and abiotic stresses (viral infection and cadmium exposure) that induce a similar transcriptional response as microsporidia also induce immunity in progeny.

  abstract     = {GeTe alloys have recently attracted wide attention as efficient thermoelectrics. In this work, a single-leg thermoelectric device with a conversion efficiency as high as 14\% under a temperature gradient of 440 K was fabricated on the basis of GeTe-Cu 2 Te-PbSe alloys, which show a peak thermoelectric figure of merit ( zT ) &gt; 2.5 and an average zT of 1.8 within working temperatures. The high performance of the material is electronically attributed to the carrier concentration optimization and thermally due to the strengthened phonon scattering, the effects of which all originate from the defects in the alloys. A design of Ag/SnTe/GeTe contact successfully enables both a prevention of chemical diffusion and an interfacial contact resistivity of 8 microhm·cm 2 for the realization of highly efficient devices with a good service stability/durability. Not only the material’s high performance but also the device’s high efficiency demonstrated the extraordinariness of GeTe alloys for efficient thermoelectric waste-heat recovery.},

  abstract     = {In situ vaccination is a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy owing to its convenience and the ability to induce numerous tumor antigens. However, the advancement of in situ vaccination techniques has been hindered by low cross-presentation of tumor antigens and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To balance the safety and efficacy of in situ vaccination, we designed a lipidoid nanoparticle (LNP) to achieve simultaneously enhancing cross-presentation and STING activation. From combinatorial library screening, we identified 93-O17S-F, which promotes both the cross-presentation of tumor antigens and the intracellular delivery of cGAMP (STING agonist). Intratumor injection of 93-O17S-F/cGAMP in combination with pretreatment with doxorubicin exhibited excellent antitumor efficacy, with 35\% of mice exhibiting total recovery from a primary B16F10 tumor and 71\% of mice with a complete recovery from a subsequent challenge, indicating the induction of an immune memory against the tumor. This study provides a promising strategy for in situ cancer vaccination.},

Here, we show a hypoxia-inducible factor 1α–dependent microRNA (miR)–210 up-regulation in monocytes and macrophages upon pathogen interaction. MiR-210 knockout in the hematopoietic lineage or in monocytes/macrophages mitigated the symptoms of endotoxemia, bacteremia, sepsis, and parasitosis, limiting the cytokine storm, organ damage/dysfunction, pathogen spreading, and lethality. Similarly, pharmacologic miR-210 inhibition improved the survival of septic mice. Mechanistically, miR-210 induction in activated macrophages supported a switch toward a proinflammatory state by lessening mitochondria respiration in favor of glycolysis, partly achieved by downmodulating the iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme ISCU. In humans, augmented miR-210 levels in circulating monocytes correlated with the incidence of sepsis, while serum levels of monocyte/macrophage-derived miR-210 were associated with sepsis mortality. Together, our data identify miR-210 as a fine-tuning regulator of macrophage metabolism and inflammatory responses, suggesting miR-210–based therapeutic and diagnostic strategies.},

The α 5 β 1 -fibronectin complex revealed simultaneous interactions at the arginine-glycine-aspartate loop, the synergy site, and a newly identified binding site proximal to adjacent to metal ion–dependent adhesion site, inducing the translocation of helix α1 to secure integrin opening. Resting α 5 β 1 adopts an incompletely bent conformation, challenging the model of integrin sharp bending inhibiting ligand binding. Our biochemical and structural analyses showed that affinity of α 5 β 1 for fibronectin is increased with manganese ions (Mn 2+ ) while adopting the half-bent conformation, indicating that ligand-binding affinity does not depend on conformation, and α 5 β 1 opening is induced by ligand-binding.},

However, our understanding of the impact of glycosylation on the ER structure remains unclear. Here, we show that exostosin-1 (EXT1) glycosyltransferase, an enzyme involved in N -glycosylation, is a key regulator of ER morphology and dynamics. We have integrated multiomics and superresolution imaging to characterize the broad effect of EXT1 inactivation, including the ER shape-dynamics-function relationships in mammalian cells. We have observed that inactivating EXT1 induces cell enlargement and enhances metabolic switches such as protein secretion. In particular, suppressing EXT1 in mouse thymocytes causes developmental dysfunctions associated with the ER network extension.

Here, we hybridized infrared photons with graphene Dirac electrons to form surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and uncovered a previously unexplored means to control SPPs in structures with periodically modulated carrier density. In these periodic structures, common SPPs with continuous dispersion are transformed into Bloch polaritons with attendant discrete bands separated by bandgaps. We explored directional Bloch polaritons and steered their propagation by dialing the proper gate voltage. Fourier analysis of the near-field images corroborates that this on-demand nano-optics functionality is rooted in the polaritonic band structure. Our programmable polaritonic platform paves the way for the much-sought benefits of on-the-chip photonic circuits.},

However, it is unclear whether additional mechanisms are required to maintain replication fork stability. We describe a hitherto unknown mechanism, by which the SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily-A containing DEAD/H box-1 (SMARCAD1) stabilizes active replication forks, that is essential to maintaining resistance towards replication poisons. We find that SMARCAD1 prevents accumulation of 53BP1-associated nucleosomes to preclude toxic enrichment of 53BP1 at the forks. In the absence of SMARCAD1, 53BP1 mediates untimely dissociation of PCNA via the PCNA-unloader ATAD5, causing frequent fork stalling, inefficient fork restart, and accumulation of single-stranded DNA. Although loss of 53BP1 in SMARCAD1 mutants rescues these defects and restores genome stability, this rescued stabilization also requires BRCA1-mediated fork protection. Notably, fork protection-challenged BRCA1-deficient naïve- or chemoresistant tumors require SMARCAD1-mediated active fork stabilization to maintain unperturbed fork progression and cellular proliferation.},

These functions were found to be dominantly influenced by a previously unidentified, higher-order interactive effect between strain magnitude and duty period. Empirical models based on our combinatorial cue-response data predicted an optimal loading regime in which strain magnitude and duty period were increased synchronously over time, which was validated to most effectively promote MSC matrix production.

Investigation of the regulation of CYP4C64 , which confers resistance to the insecticide thiamethoxam, revealed a mutation in the 5′ untranslated region of this gene in resistant B. tabaci strains that introduces a predicted m 6 A site. We provide several lines of evidence that mRNA methylation of the adenine at this position, in combination with modified expression of m 6 A writers, acts to increase expression of CYP4C64 and resistance.

Mechanistically, we identify that c-Cbl functions downstream of Dectin-2 and Dectin-3 to mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of noncanonical nuclear factor κB subunit RelB. Thus, c-Cbl deficiency in DCs promotes α-mannan–induced activation of RelB, which suppresses p65-mediated transcription of an anti-inflammatory cytokine gene, il10 , thereby aggravating DSS-induced colitis. Moreover, suppressing fungal growth with fluconazole or inhibition of RelB activation in vivo attenuates colitis in mice with DC-specific deletion of c-Cbl. We also demonstrate an interaction between c-Cbl and c-Abl tyrosine kinase and find that treatment with DPH, a c-Abl agonist, synergistically increases fungi-induced c-Cbl activation to restrict colitis.

Here, we assess the importance of respiratory surface area in explaining patterns of metabolic rate across the vertebrate tree of life using a novel phylogenetic Bayesian multilevel modeling framework coupled with a species-paired dataset of metabolic rate and respiratory surface area. We reveal that respiratory surface area explains twice as much variation in metabolic rate, compared to temperature, across the vertebrate tree of life.

In these interfaces, AOM often appears to deplete methane in the heavy isotopes toward isotopic compositions similar to methanogenesis. Here, we shed light on this effect and its physiological underpinnings using a thermophilic ANME-1–dominated culture. At high sulfate concentrations, residual methane is enriched in both 13 C and 2 H ( 13 α = 1.016 and 2 α = 1.155), as observed previously. In contrast, at low sulfate concentrations, the residual methane is substantially depleted in 13 C ( 13 α = 0.977) and, to a lesser extent, in 2 H. Using a biochemical-isotopic model, we explain the sulfate dependence of the net isotopic fractionation through the thermodynamic drive of the involved intracellular reactions. Our findings relate these isotopic patterns to the physiology and environment of the ANME, thereby explaining a commonly observed isotopic enigma.},

Activation of LH PBN strongly suppressed feeding by limiting eating frequency and also reduced motivation to work for food reward. Refined approach-avoidance paradigm revealed that suppression of LH PBN, but not CeA PBN, sustained motivation to obtain food. The effect of LH PBN neurons on feeding was reversed by suppressing downstream LH VGluT2 neurons. Thus, distinct from a circuit for fear and escape responses, LH PBN neurons channel nociceptive signals to LH VGluT2 neurons to suppress motivational drive for feeding.

  abstract     = {Photoactivated genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) have the potential to enable optically sectioned voltage imaging at the intersection of a photoactivation beam and an imaging beam. We developed a pooled high-throughput screen to identify archaerhodopsin mutants with enhanced photoactivation. After screening ~10 5 cells, we identified a novel GEVI, NovArch, whose one-photon near-infrared fluorescence is reversibly enhanced by weak one-photon blue or two-photon near-infrared excitation. Because the photoactivation leads to fluorescent signals catalytically rather than stoichiometrically, high fluorescence signals, optical sectioning, and high time resolution are achieved simultaneously at modest blue or two-photon laser power. We demonstrate applications of the combined molecular and optical tools to optical mapping of membrane voltage in distal dendrites in acute mouse brain slices and in spontaneously active neurons in vivo.},

As a result, post-lockdown COVID-19 dynamics are heterogeneous and difficult to interpret. We describe a set of contact surveys performed in four Chinese cities (Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Changsha) during the pre-pandemic, lockdown and post-lockdown periods to quantify changes in contact patterns. In the post-lockdown period, the mean number of contacts increased by 5 to 17\% as compared to the lockdown period. However, it remains three to seven times lower than its pre-pandemic level sufficient to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We find that the impact of school interventions depends nonlinearly on the intensity of other activities. When most community activities are halted, school closure leads to a 77\% decrease in the reproduction number; in contrast, when social mixing outside of schools is at pre-pandemic level, school closure leads to a 5\% reduction in transmission.},

We have previously shown that members of the fungal Avr4 effector family use a carbohydrate-binding module of family 14 (CBM14) to bind chitin in fungal cell walls and protect them from host chitinases during infection. Here, we show that gene duplication in the Avr4 family produced an Avr4-2 paralog with a previously unknown effector function. Specifically, we functionally characterize Pf Avr4-2, a paralog of Pf Avr4 in the tomato pathogen Pseudocercospora fuligena , and show that although it contains a CBM14 domain, it does not bind chitin or protect fungi against chitinases. Instead, Pf Avr4-2 interacts with highly de-esterified pectin in the plant’s middle lamellae or primary cell walls and interferes with Ca 2+ -mediated cross-linking at cell-cell junction zones, thus loosening the plant cell wall structure and synergizing the activity of pathogen secreted endo-polygalacturonases.},

However, active metasurfaces operating at visible frequencies often exhibit low performance due to design and fabrication restrictions at the nanoscale. In this work, we demonstrate electrochemically controlled metasurfaces with high intensity contrast, fast switching rate, and excellent reversibility at visible frequencies. We use a conducting polymer, polyaniline (PANI), that can be locally conjugated on preselected gold nanorods to actively control the phase profiles of the metasurfaces. The optical responses of the metasurfaces can be in situ monitored and optimized by controlling the PANI growth of subwavelength dimension during the electrochemical process. We showcase electrochemically controlled anomalous transmission and holography with good switching performance. Such electrochemically powered optical metasurfaces lay a solid basis to develop metasurface devices for real-world optical applications.},

Spikes from grid cells progress relative to the theta phase in a phenomenon called phase precession, which is suggested as essential to create the spatial periodicity of grid cells. Here, we show that optogenetic activation of parvalbumin-positive (PV + ) cells in the MSA enabled selective pacing of local field potential (LFP) oscillations in MEC. During optogenetic stimulation, the grid cells were locked to the imposed pacing frequency but kept their spatial patterns. Phase precession was abolished, and speed information was no longer reflected in the LFP oscillations but was still carried by rate coding of individual MEC neurons. Together, these results support that theta oscillations are not critical to the spatial pattern of grid cells and do not carry a crucial velocity signal.},

To this end, we exposed the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis to sublethal concentrations of the widely used herbicide atrazine for 85 generations. Our results reveal that atrazine exposure not only mediated adaptive changes within the microbiome, which conferred host resistance to atrazine toxicity, but also exerted selective pressure on the host genome and altered host gene expression and immune response. Furthermore, microbiome transplant experiments reveal a decreased survival of adults from the control population after exposure to the evolved microbiome of the atrazine-exposed population, while no such decrease occurred in the reciprocal transplant. These results indicate that xenobiotic-induced selection mediated host-microbiome coadaptation, ultimately leading to a new host genome–microbiome equilibrium.},

The functionalized hydrogel acted as a liquid electrolyte on the skin and formed an extremely conformal and low-impedance interface for wearable electrochemical biosensors and electrical stimulators. Furthermore, its porous structure and ultrathin thickness facilitated the efficient transport of target molecules through the interface.

PerSpect attributes are defined as the function of spectral variables over the filtration value. Molecular descriptors obtained from PerSpect attributes are combined with machine learning models for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. Our results, for the three most commonly used databases including PDBbind-2007, PDBbind-2013, and PDBbind-2016, are better than all existing models, as far as we know.

Together with previous data, our results suggest that these motors cycle between helical and planar configurations, providing a possible mechanism for directional translocation of DNA.

Limited megathermal paleoclimatic and fossil data are known from this period, despite its potential as an analog for future climate conditions. Here, we report a rich middle Miocene rainforest biome, the Zhangpu biota (~14.7 Ma ago), based on material preserved in amber and associated sedimentary rocks from southeastern China. The record shows that the mid-Miocene rainforest reached at least 24.2°N and was more widespread than previously estimated. Our results not only highlight the role of tropical rainforests acting as evolutionary museums for biodiversity at the generic level but also suggest that the MMCO probably strongly shaped the East Asian biota via the northern expansion of the megathermal rainforest biome. The Zhangpu biota provides an ideal snapshot for biodiversity redistribution during global warming.},

We provide bulk and single-cell estimates of microbial biomass production from carbon and nitrogen substrates in cool, oxic basement fluids from the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The wide range in carbon and nitrogen incorporation rates indicates a microbial community well poised for dynamic conditions, potentially anabolizing carbon and nitrogen at rates ranging from those observed in subsurface sediments to those found in on-axis hydrothermal vent environments. Bicarbonate incorporation rates were highest where fluids are most isolated from recharging bottom seawater, suggesting that anabolism of inorganic carbon may be a potential strategy for supplementing the ancient and recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon that is prevalent in the globally distributed subseafloor crustal environment.},

In laboratory-scale experiments, Cu recovery was rapid (up to 57 weight\% after 94 days) despite low ore hydraulic conductivity (permeability = 6.1 mD; porosity = 10.6\%). Multiphysics numerical model simulations confirm the feasibility of EK-ISL at the field scale. This new approach to mining is therefore poised to spearhead a new paradigm of metal recovery from currently inaccessible ore bodies with a markedly reduced environmental footprint.},

However, recent advances triggered fundamental questions regarding the role of the particle wave function in these processes. Here, we find that even in seemingly classical experimental regimes, light emission is fundamentally tied to the quantum coherence and correlations of the emitting particle. We use quantum electrodynamics to show how the particle’s momentum uncertainty determines the optical coherence of the emitted light. We find that the temporal duration of Cherenkov radiation, envisioned for almost a century as a shock wave of light, is limited by underlying entanglement between the particle and light. Our findings enable new capabilities in electron microscopy for measuring quantum correlations of shaped electrons. Last, we propose new Cherenkov detection schemes, whereby measuring spectral photon autocorrelations can unveil the wave function structure of any charged high-energy particle.},

Here, we experimentally demonstrate a selective manipulation of photon spin angular momentum at a deep subwavelength scale via electron-induced OSHE in Au nanoantennas. The inversion of the OSHE radiation pattern is observed by angle-resolved cathodoluminescence polarimetry with the electron impact position shifting within 80 nm in a single antenna unit.

Thus, as marine-based sectors of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) retreated during past interglacials, or will retreat in the future, exposed bedrock will rebound rapidly and flux meltwater out into the open ocean. Previous studies have suggested that this contribution to global mean sea level (GMSL) rise is small and occurs slowly. We challenge this notion using sea level predictions that incorporate both the outflux mechanism and complex three-dimensional viscoelastic mantle structure. In the case of the last interglacial, where the GMSL contribution from WAIS collapse is often cited as ~3 to 4 meters, the outflux mechanism contributes ~1 meter of additional GMSL change within ~1 thousand years of the collapse. Using a projection of future WAIS collapse, we also demonstrate that the outflux can substantially amplify GMSL rise estimates over the next century.},

Coronet cells express melanopsin and share additional properties with the saccus vasculosus, a specialized region of the hypothalamus that mediates photoperiodism in nontropical fishes. Comparative transcriptome analyses identified orthologous cell types for mechanosensory switch neurons, and VP + and VPR + relay neurons in different regions of the mouse hypothalamus. These observations provide evidence that the hypothalamus predates the evolution of the vertebrate brain. We discuss the possibility that switch neurons, coronet cells, and FoxP + / VPR + relay neurons comprise a behavioral circuit that helps trigger metamorphosis of Ciona larvae in response to twilight.},

Here, we have examined delivery of siRNA, packaged in 50-nm cationic lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHs:siRNA), combined with microbubble-enhanced focused ultrasound (MB-FUS) in pediatric and adult preclinical brain tumor models. Using single-cell image analysis, we show that MB-FUS in combination with LPHs:siRNA leads to more than 10-fold improvement in siRNA delivery into brain tumor microenvironments of the two models. MB-FUS delivery of Smoothened ( SMO ) targeting siRNAs reduces SMO protein production and markedly increases tumor cell death in the SMO -activated medulloblastoma model. Moreover, our analysis reveals that MB-FUS and nanoparticle properties can be optimized to maximize delivery in the brain tumor microenvironment, thereby serving as a platform for developing next-generation tunable delivery systems for RNA-based therapy in brain tumors.},

Its practical applicability is typically bounded, however, by the so-called “spin diffusion barrier, ” which relates to the poor efficiency of polarization transfer from highly polarized nuclei close to paramagnetic centers to bulk nuclei. A quantitative assessment of this barrier has been hindered so far by the lack of general methods for studying nuclear polarization flow in the vicinity of paramagnetic centers. Here, we fill this gap and introduce a general set of experiments based on microwave gating that are readily implemented. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach in experiments conducted between 1.2 and 4.2 K in static mode and at 100 K under magic angle spinning (MAS)—conditions typical for dissolution DNP and MAS-DNP—and directly observe the marked dependence of polarization flow on temperature.},

We found that modulation of the copy number of the noncanonical vesicular SNARE (soluble N -ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor), vesicle-associated membrane protein 4 (VAMP4), on SVs is key for regulating Pr. Mechanistically, this is underpinned by its reduced ability to form an efficient SNARE complex with canonical plasma membrane SNAREs. VAMP4 has unusually high synaptic turnover and is selectively sorted to endolysosomes during activity-dependent bulk endocytosis. Disruption of endolysosomal trafficking and function markedly increased the abundance of VAMP4 in the SV pool and inhibited SV fusion. Together, our results unravel a new mechanism for generating SV heterogeneity and control of Pr through coupling of SV recycling to a major clearing system that regulates protein homeostasis.},

Here, we demonstrate versatile heterojunctions between metal-halide perovskite nanocrystals and semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes that enable room-temperature, long-lived (thousands of seconds), writable, and erasable PPC. Optical switching and basic neuromorphic functions can be stimulated at low operating voltages with femto- to pico-joule energies per spiking event, and detailed analysis demonstrates that PPC in this nanoscale interface arises from field-assisted control of ion migration within the nanocrystal array. Contactless optical measurements also suggest these systems as potential candidates for photonic synapses that are stimulated and read in the optical domain.

  abstract     = {KIF1A is a critical cargo transport motor within neurons. More than 100 known mutations result in KIF1A -associated neurological disorder (KAND), a degenerative condition for which there is no cure. A missense mutation, P305L, was identified in children diagnosed with KAND, but the molecular basis for the disease is unknown. We find that this conserved residue is part of an unusual 3 10 helix immediately adjacent to the family-specific K-loop, which facilitates a high microtubule-association rate. We find that the mutation negatively affects several biophysical parameters of the motor. However, the microtubule-association rate of the motor is most markedly affected, revealing that the presence of an intact K-loop is not sufficient for its function. We hypothesize that the 3 10 helix facilitates a specific K-loop conformation that is critical for its function. We find that the function of this proline is conserved in kinesin-1, revealing a fundamental principle of the kinesin motor mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Organ development in plants predominantly occurs postembryonically through combinatorial activity of meristems; therefore, meristem and organ fate are intimately connected. Inflorescence morphogenesis in grasses (Poaceae) is complex and relies on a specialized floral meristem, called spikelet meristem, that gives rise to all other floral organs and ultimately the grain. The fate of the spikelet determines reproductive success and contributes toward yield-related traits in cereal crops. Here, we examined the transcriptional landscapes of floral meristems in the temperate crop barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.) using RNA-seq of laser capture microdissected tissues from immature, developing floral structures. Our unbiased, high-resolution approach revealed fundamental regulatory networks, previously unknown pathways, and key regulators of barley floral fate and will equally be indispensable for comparative transcriptional studies of grass meristems.},

The VHOS implantation effectively suppresses the side effects observed with synthetic hormone treatment (i.e., tissue overgrowth, hyperplasia, cancer progression, deep vein thrombosis) to the normal levels, while effectively preventing the representative aftereffects of menopause (i.e., gaining fatty weight, inducing osteoporosis).

Temperature compensation of the oscillation speed is a common feature of the circadian clocks, but the evolutionary-conserved mechanism has been unclear. Here, we show that Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX) mediates cold-responsive Ca 2+ signaling important for the temperature-compensated oscillation in mammalian cells. In response to temperature decrease, NCX elevates intracellular Ca 2+ , which activates Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and accelerates transcriptional oscillations of clock genes. The cold-responsive Ca 2+ signaling is conserved among mice, Drosophila , and Arabidopsis . The mammalian cellular rhythms and Drosophila behavioral rhythms were severely attenuated by NCX inhibition, indicating essential roles of NCX in both temperature compensation and autonomous oscillation. NCX also contributes to the temperature-compensated transcriptional rhythms in cyanobacterial clock. Our results suggest that NCX-mediated Ca 2+ signaling is a common mechanism underlying temperature-compensated circadian rhythms both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.},

We hypothesized that mitochondria could work as a sensor of LECs’ metabolic specific needs by determining their functional requirements according to their differentiation status and local tissue microenvironment. Accordingly, we conditionally deleted the QPC subunit of mitochondrial complex III in differentiating LECs of mouse embryos. Unexpectedly, mutant mice were devoid of a lymphatic vasculature by mid-gestation, a consequence of the specific down-regulation of main LEC fate regulators, particularly Vegfr3, leading to the loss of LEC fate. Mechanistically, this is a result of reduced H3K4me3 and H3K27ac in the genomic locus of key LEC fate controllers (e.g., Vegfr3 and Prox1 ). Our findings indicate that by sensing the LEC differentiation status and microenvironmental metabolic conditions, mitochondrial complex III regulates the critical Prox1-Vegfr3 feedback loop and, therefore, LEC fate specification and maintenance.},

Growing efforts have focused on materials engineering strategies (e.g., superhydrophobicity) to prevent fouling. Here, we present a curious phenomenon in which crystals self-eject from heated, nanotextured superhydrophobic materials during evaporation of saline water drops. These crystal structures (crystal critters) have exceedingly minimal contact with the substrate and thus pre-empt crystal fouling. This unusual phenomenon is caused by cooperative effects of crystallization, evaporative flows, and nanoscale effects. The temperature dependence of the critter effect can be predicted using principles of mass conservation, and we demonstrate that self-propulsion can be generated via temperature gradients, which promote asymmetric growth. The insights on confinement-driven evaporative crystallization can be applied for antifouling by self-ejection of mineral foulants, for drop-based fluidic machines, or even for self-propulsion.},

We reconstruct permafrost history in western Canada during Pleistocene interglacials from 130 uranium-thorium ages on 72 speleothems, cave deposits that only accumulate with deep ground thaw. We infer that permafrost thaw extended to the high Arctic during one or more periods between ~1.5 million and 0.5 million years ago but has been limited to the sub-Arctic since 400, 000 years ago. Our Canadian speleothem growth history closely parallels an analogous reconstruction from Siberia, suggesting that this shift toward more stable permafrost across the Pleistocene may have been Arctic-wide. In contrast, interglacial greenhouse gas concentrations were relatively stable throughout the Pleistocene, suggesting that either permafrost thaw did not trigger substantial carbon release to the atmosphere or it was offset by carbon uptake elsewhere on glacial-interglacial time scales.},

Field-induced electron spin resonance measurements of charge dynamics provide evidence for relatively slow hopping over, however, long distances.

The materials used display similar properties, while the metal ions can be tracked with high spatial resolution by energy-dispersive x-ray spectrum imaging.

Yet, the notion that relative brain size validly represents selection on brain size relies on the untested assumptions that brain-body allometry is restrained to a stable scaling relationship across species and that any deviation from this slope is due to selection on brain size. Using the largest fossil and extant dataset yet assembled, we find that shifts in allometric slope underpin major transitions in mammalian evolution and are often primarily characterized by marked changes in body size. Our results reveal that the largest-brained mammals achieved large relative brain sizes by highly divergent paths. These findings prompt a reevaluation of the traditional paradigm of relative brain size and open new opportunities to improve our understanding of the genetic and developmental mechanisms that influence brain size.},

However, experiments performed on retinal proteins in solution showed that the first step of vision consists in an ultrafast photoisomerization that can be coherently controlled by shaping the phase of femtosecond laser pulses, especially in the multiphoton interaction regime. The link between these experiments in solution and the biological process allowing vision was not demonstrated. Here, we measure the electric signals fired from the retina of living mice upon femtosecond multipulse and single-pulse light stimulation. Our results show that the electrophysiological signaling is sensitive to the manipulation of the light excitation on a femtosecond time scale. The mechanism relies on multiple interactions with the light pulses close to the conical intersection, like pump-dump (photoisomerization interruption) and pump-repump (reverse isomerization) processes. This interpretation is supported both experimentally and by dynamics simulations.},

  abstract     = {The ocean attenuates global warming by taking up about one quarter of global anthropogenic carbon emissions. Around 40\% of this carbon sink is located in the Southern Ocean. However, Earth system models struggle to reproduce the Southern Ocean circulation and carbon fluxes. We identify a tight relationship across two multimodel ensembles between present-day sea surface salinity in the subtropical-polar frontal zone and the anthropogenic carbon sink in the Southern Ocean. Observations and model results constrain the cumulative Southern Ocean sink over 1850-2100 to 158 ± 6 petagrams of carbon under the low-emissions scenario Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 1-2.6 (SSP1-2.6) and to 279 ± 14 petagrams of carbon under the high-emissions scenario SSP5-8.5. The constrained anthropogenic carbon sink is 14 to 18\% larger and 46 to 54\% less uncertain than estimated by the unconstrained estimates. The identified constraint demonstrates the importance of the freshwater cycle for the Southern Ocean circulation and carbon cycle.},

We have confirmed that Mettl3- deficient macrophages exhibited reduced TNF-α production upon LPS stimulation in vitro. Consistently, Mettl3 flox/flox ; Lyzm- Cre mice displayed increased susceptibility to bacterial infection and showed faster tumor growth. Mechanistically, the transcripts of the Irakm gene encoding a negative regulator of TLR4 signaling were highly decorated by m 6 A modification. METTL3 deficiency led to the loss of m 6 A modification on Irakm mRNA and slowed down its degradation, resulting in a higher level of IRAKM, which ultimately suppressed TLR signaling–mediated macrophage activation. Our findings demonstrate a previously unknown role for METTL3-mediated m 6 A modification in innate immune responses and implicate the m 6 A machinery as a potential cancer immunotherapy target.},

Analyses of differentially regulated enhancers and super-enhancers uncovered previously unrecognized layers of intertumor heterogeneity. Integrative analysis of variant enhancer loci and transcriptome identified topographies of transcriptional enhancers and core regulatory circuitries in four molecular subtypes of primary tumors: AC1-mesenchymal, AC1-classical, AC2-proneural, and AC3-proneural. Moreover, this study reveals core oncogenic dependency on super-enhancer–driven transcriptional factors, long noncoding RNAs, and druggable targets in GBM.

Conversely, in the context of autoimmunity, T cell exhaustion has been favorably correlated with long-term clinical outcome. Understanding the development of exhaustion in autoimmune settings may provide underlying principles that can be exploited to quell autoreactive T cells. Here, we demonstrate that the adaptor molecule Bat3 acts as a molecular checkpoint of T cell exhaustion, with deficiency of Bat3 promoting a profound exhaustion phenotype, suppressing autoreactive T cell–mediated neuroinflammation. Mechanistically, Bat3 acts as a critical mTORC2 inhibitor to suppress Akt function. As a result, Bat3 deficiency leads to increased Akt activity and FoxO1 phosphorylation, indirectly promoting Prdm1 expression. Transcriptional analysis of Bat3 −/− T cells revealed up-regulation of dysfunction-associated genes, concomitant with down-regulation of genes associated with T cell effector function, suggesting that absence of Bat3 can trigger T cell dysfunction even under highly proinflammatory autoimmune conditions.},

Direct mapping of these fields has so far proven to be too challenging. Therefore, indirect methods are needed, e.g., deconvolving the response of “tracer” particles to the activity-induced fields. Here, we study experimentally the response of silica particles, sedimented at a wall, to active Pt/silica Janus particles. The latter are either immobilized at the wall, with the symmetry axis perpendicular or parallel to the wall, or motile. The experiments reveal complex effective interactions that are dependent on the configuration and on the state of motion of the active particle. Within the framework of a coarse-grained model, the behavior of tracers near an immobilized Janus particle can be captured qualitatively once activity-induced osmotic flows on the wall are considered.},

Consequent behavior shifts have the potential to mitigate or accelerate climate impacts on livelihoods and food security. Particularly within the small-scale inland fisheries that support approximately 10\% of the global population, temperature changes likely affect both fish and fishers. To analyze how changing temperatures alter households’ fishing behavior, we examined fishing effort and fish catch in a major inland fishery. We used longitudinal observational data from households in Cambodia, which has the highest per-capita consumption of inland fish in the world. Higher temperatures caused households to reduce their participation in fishing but had limited net effects on fish catch. Incorporating human behavioral responses to changing environmental conditions will be fundamental to determining how climate change affects rural livelihoods, food production, and food access.},

Here, we investigated the roles of DEAD-box helicases in the formation and alteration of membraneless nuclear dicing bodies (D-bodies) in Arabidopsis thaliana . We uncovered that RNA helicase 6 (RH6), RH8, and RH12 are previously unidentified D-body components. These helicases interact with and promote the phase separation of SERRATE, a key component of D-bodies, and drive the formation of D-bodies through liquid-liquid phase separations (LLPSs). The accumulation of these helicases in the nuclei decreases upon Turnip mosaic virus infections, which couples with the decrease of D-bodies. Our results thus reveal the key roles of RH6, RH8, and RH12 in modulating D-body formation via LLPSs.},

We estimate that more than 1000 rivers account for 80\% of global annual emissions, which range between 0.8 million and 2.7 million metric tons per year, with small urban rivers among the most polluting.

We show that the cell phenotype shifts from amoeboid to mesenchymal upon increasing resistance. By combining automated morphological tracking and wavelet analysis along with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we found an oscillatory phenotypic transition that cycles from blebbing to short, medium, and long actin network formation, and back to blebbing. Elevated hydraulic resistance promotes focal adhesion maturation and long actin filaments, thereby reducing the period required for amoeboid-to-mesenchymal transition. The period becomes independent of resistance upon blocking the mechanosensor TRPM7. Mathematical modeling links intracellular calcium oscillations with actomyosin turnover and force generation and recapitulates experimental data. We identify hydraulic resistance as a critical physical cue controlling cell phenotype and present an approach for connecting fluorescent signal fluctuations to morphological oscillations.},

Current models suggest that clustered ubiquitin chains on a cargo trigger a cascade from autophagic cargo receptors through the core complexes ULK1 and class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I, WIPI2, and the ATG7, ATG3, and ATG12ATG5-ATG16L1 machinery of LC3 lipidation. This was tested using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), GST-Ub 4 as a model cargo, the cargo receptors NDP52, TAX1BP1, and OPTN, and the autophagy core complexes. All three cargo receptors potently stimulated LC3 lipidation on GUVs. NDP52- and TAX1BP1-induced LC3 lipidation required all components, but not ULK1 kinase activity. However, OPTN bypassed the ULK1 requirement. Thus, cargo-dependent stimulation of LC3 lipidation is common to multiple autophagic cargo receptors, yet the details of core complex engagement vary between the different receptors.},

  abstract     = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of tissues has revealed remarkable heterogeneity of cell types and states but does not provide information on the spatial organization of cells. To better understand how individual cells function within an anatomical space, we developed XYZeq, a workflow that encodes spatial metadata into scRNA-seq libraries. We used XYZeq to profile mouse tumor models to capture spatially barcoded transcriptomes from tens of thousands of cells. Analyses of these data revealed the spatial distribution of distinct cell types and a cell migration-associated transcriptomic program in tumor-associated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Furthermore, we identify localized expression of tumor suppressor genes by MSCs that vary with proximity to the tumor core. We demonstrate that XYZeq can be used to map the transcriptome and spatial localization of individual cells in situ to reveal how cell composition and cell states can be affected by location within complex pathological tissue.},

Using glycosylated artificial metalloenzyme (GArM)–based protein labeling, this study reports two separate functional strategies. In one approach, early tumor onset can be suppressed by tagging cancer cells in living mice with an integrin-blocking cyclic–Arg-Gly-Asp (cRGD) moiety, thereby disrupting cell adhesion onto the extracellular matrix. In another approach, tumor growth in mice can be reduced by tagging with a cytotoxic doxorubicin moiety. Subsequent cell death occurs following internalization and drug release. Overall, experiments have shown that mouse populations receiving the mixture of SeCT labeling reagents exhibited a significant delay/reduction in tumor onset and growth compared with controls. Highlighting its adaptability, this work represents a foundational step for further development of SeCT therapy and its potential therapeutic applications.},

However, its interpretation remains essentially phenomenological and qualitative, because the existing microscopic theory has not been quantitatively confirmed by confronting calculations based on this theory with experimental data. Here, we report the experimental low-temperature MChD spectra of two archetypal chiral paramagnetic crystals taken as model systems, tris(1, 2-diaminoethane)nickel(II) and cobalt(II) nitrate, for light propagating parallel or perpendicular to the c axis of the crystals, and the calculation of the MChD spectra for the Ni(II) derivative by state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations. By incorporating vibronic coupling, we find good agreement between experiment and theory, which opens the way for MChD to develop into a powerful chiral spectroscopic tool and provide fundamental insights for the chemical design of new magnetochiral materials for technological applications.},

Here, we directly image the excitonic wave function in reciprocal space by measuring the momentum distribution of electrons photoemitted from excitons in monolayer tungsten diselenide. By transforming to real space, we obtain a visual of the distribution of the electron around the hole in an exciton. Further, by also resolving the energy coordinate, we confirm the elusive theoretical prediction that the photoemitted electron exhibits an inverted energy-momentum dispersion relationship reflecting the valence band where the partner hole remains, rather than that of conduction band states of the electron.},

This occurs in a system with highly mismatched vibrational frequencies (copper/diamond) modified by a self-assembled monolayer. Using finely controlled fabrication and detailed characterization, complemented by molecular simulation, the effects of bridging the vibrational spectrum mismatch and bonding at the interface are systematically varied and understood from a molecular dynamics viewpoint. The results reveal that the bridging and binding effects have a trade-off relationship and, consequently, that the bridging can overwhelm the binding effect at a highly mismatched interface. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of phonon transport at interfaces, unifying physical and chemical understandings, and allowing interfacial tailoring of the thermal transport in various material systems.},

To elucidate the role of the vmPFC in processing our ongoing experiences, we developed a computational framework and analysis pipeline to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual vmPFC responses as participants viewed a 45-minute television drama. Through a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging, facial expression tracking, and self-reported emotional experiences across four studies, our data suggest that the vmPFC slowly transitions through a series of discretized states that broadly map onto affective experiences. Although these transitions typically occur at idiosyncratic times across people, participants exhibited a marked increase in state alignment during high affectively valenced events in the show.

Polyethylene glycol demonstrates a retention mechanism dominated by entropy with little sign of interaction with the pore, while peptides show an enthalpic mechanism, which can be attributed to physisorption to the nanopore (e.g., hydrogen bonding). To manipulate the energetics, we introduced thiolate-capped gold clusters [Au 25 (SG) 18 ] into the pore, which increases the charge and leads to additional electrostatic interactions that help dissect the contribution that enthalpy and entropy make in this modified environment.

FXR activation suppressed Mgat5 , while Shp deletion induced St3gal6 and St6gal1 . Increased percentages of core-fucosylated and triantennary glycan moieties were seen in LDKO livers, and proteins with the “hyperglycoforms” preferentially localized to exosomes and lysosomes. This up-regulation of N-glycosylation machinery was specific to the Golgi apparatus and not the endoplasmic reticulum. The increased glycan complexity in the LDKO correlated well with dilated unstacked Golgi ribbons and alterations in the secretion of albumin, cholesterol, and triglycerides.

  abstract     = {Groundwater is an important source of drinking and irrigation water. Dating groundwater informs its vulnerability to contamination and aids in calibrating flow models. Here, we report measurements of multiple age tracers ( 14 C, 3 H, 39 Ar, and 85 Kr) and parameters relevant to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from 17 wells in California’s San Joaquin Valley (SJV), an agricultural region that is heavily reliant on groundwater. We find evidence for a major mid-20th century shift in groundwater DIC input from mostly closed- to mostly open-system carbonate dissolution, which we suggest is driven by input of anthropogenic carbonate soil amendments. Crucially, enhanced open-system dissolution, in which DIC equilibrates with soil CO 2 , fundamentally affects the initial 14 C activity of recently recharged groundwater. Conventional 14 C dating of deeper SJV groundwater, assuming an open system, substantially overestimates residence time and thereby underestimates susceptibility to modern contamination. Because carbonate soil amendments are ubiquitous, other groundwater-reliant agricultural regions may be similarly affected.},

In this study, by exploiting the ability of monocytes to actively penetrate into diseased sites, we designed aptamer-based lipid nanovectors that actively bind onto the surface of monocytes and are released upon reaching the diseased sites. Our method was thoroughly assessed through treating two of the top causes of death in the world, cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with or without liver metastasis, and showed a significant increase in survival and healing with no toxicity to the liver and kidneys in either case, indicating the success and ubiquity of our platform.

As inspired by the Pauling’s rule, we propose that structure motifs in inorganic crystals can serve as a central input to a machine learning framework. We demonstrated that the presence of structure motifs and their connections in a large set of crystalline compounds can be converted into unique vector representations using an unsupervised learning algorithm. To demonstrate the use of structure motif information, a motif-centric learning framework is created by combining motif information with the atom-based graph neural networks to form an atom-motif dual graph network (AMDNet), which is more accurate in predicting the electronic structures of metal oxides such as bandgaps. The work illustrates the route toward fundamental design of graph neural network learning architecture for complex materials by incorporating beyond-atom physical principles.},

Using the Ising model as an example, we show that our approach gives excellent results on both real and synthetic networks, improving substantially on standard message passing methods.

Recent engineering advances have produced planar scaffolds optimized for retinal pigment epithelium monolayer delivery, which are being tested in early-stage clinical trials. We previously described a three-dimensional scaffold supporting a polarized photoreceptor monolayer, but photoreceptor somata typically occupy multiple densely packed strata to maximize light detection. Thus, patients with severe photoreceptor degeneration are expected to extract greater benefits from higher-density photoreceptor delivery. Here, we describe the microfabrication of a biodegradable scaffold patterned for high-density photoreceptor replacement. The “ice cube tray” structure optimizes mechanical properties and cell-to-biomaterial load, enabling production of a multicellular photoreceptor layer designed for outer retinal reconstruction.

We show that AFD and FE modes are cooperatively coupled in LAO/STO (111) heterostructures; they coexist below the critical thickness ( t c ) and disappear simultaneously above t c with the formation of 2DEG. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide direct evidence of oxygen vacancy ( V O ) formation at the LAO (111) surface, which acts as the source of 2DEG. Tracing the AFD rotation and FE distortion of LAO reveals that their evolution is strongly correlated with V O distribution. The present study demonstrates that AFD and FE modes in oxide heterostructures emerge as a consequence of interplay between misfit strain and polar field, and further that their combination can be tuned to competitive or cooperative coupling by changing the interface orientation.},

To develop principles that can leverage physical interactions and thus be used across scales, we take a two-pronged approach: a theoretical abstraction of self-organizing particle systems and an experimental robot system of active cohesive granular matter that intentionally lacks digital electronic computation and communication, using minimal (or no) sensing and control. As predicted by theory, as interparticle attraction increases, the collective transitions from dispersed to a compact phase. When aggregated, the collective can transport non-robot “impurities, ” thus performing an emergent task driven by the physics underlying the transition. These results reveal a fruitful interplay between algorithm design and active matter robophysics that can result in principles for programming collectives without the need for complex algorithms or capabilities.},

It is understood that the ProPerDP method generates a mixture of cysteine-containing and non–cysteine-containing peptides. Instead, Fan et al . suggested that the detection of non–cysteine-containing peptides indicates nonspecific alkylation at noncysteine residues. However, if true, then such peptides would not be released by reduction and therefore not appear as products in the reported workflow. Moreover, the authors’ biological assessment of ProPerDP using Escherichia coli mutants was based on assumptions that have not been confirmed by other methods.

Despite robust and widespread increases in future projected WAFR in our case study of California (for 56/80\% of subbasins in 2070–2099 under RCP4.5/RCP8.5), strong nonlinear interactions between diversion infrastructure and policy uncertainties constrain how much WAFR can be captured. To tap future elevated recharge potential through infrastructure expansion under deep uncertainties, we outline a novel robustness-based policy typology to identify priority areas of investment needs.

Testing the boundary conditions of the generosity-effect, we explore a hiring process that, in contrast to the previous process, was very selective, because candidates were more likely to fail than to pass. In this scenario, no evidence is found for the generosity-erosion effect (experiment 2; N = 3171).

Despite decades of modeling efforts, a unified description of the physics in such intrusions is as yet unknown. Here, we show that a continuum model based on the simple notions of frictional flow and tension-free separation describes complex granular intrusions near free surfaces. This model captures dynamics in a variety of experiments including wheel locomotion, plate intrusions, and running legged robots. The model reveals that one static and two dynamic effects primarily give rise to intrusion forces in such scenarios. We merge these effects into a further reduced-order technique (dynamic resistive force theory) for rapid modeling of granular locomotion of arbitrarily shaped intruders. The continuum-motivated strategy we propose for identifying physical mechanisms and corresponding reduced-order relations has potential use for a variety of other materials.},

  abstract     = {Fermi surface is at the heart of our understanding of metals and strongly correlated many-body systems. An abrupt change in the Fermi surface topology, also called Lifshitz transition, can lead to the emergence of fascinating phenomena like colossal magnetoresistance and superconductivity. While Lifshitz transitions have been demonstrated for a broad range of materials by equilibrium tuning of macroscopic parameters such as strain, doping, pressure, and temperature, a nonequilibrium dynamical route toward ultrafast modification of the Fermi surface topology has not been experimentally demonstrated. Combining time-resolved multidimensional photoemission spectroscopy with state-of-the-art TDDFT+ U simulations, we introduce a scheme for driving an ultrafast Lifshitz transition in the correlated type-II Weyl semimetal T d -MoTe 2 . We demonstrate that this nonequilibrium topological electronic transition finds its microscopic origin in the dynamical modification of the effective electronic correlations. These results shed light on a previously unexplored ultrafast scheme for controlling the Fermi surface topology in correlated quantum materials.},

Furthermore, the biosynthetic mechanism of Cu 0 production is proposed via proteomics analysis. This microbial conversion is carried out naturally under aerobic conditions eliminating toxic solvents. One of the most advanced commercially available transmission electron microscopy systems on the market (NeoArm) was used to demonstrate the abundant intracellular synthesis of single-atom zero-valent copper by this bacterium. This finding shows that microbes in acid mine drainages can naturally extract metal ions, such as copper, and transform them into a valuable commodity.},

Recently described three-dimensional (3D) human pluripotent stem cell–derived cyst (hPSC-cyst) structures can replicate these processes. To gain mechanistic insights into the poorly understood machinery involved in epiblast cavity formation, we interrogated the proteomes of apical and basolateral membrane territories in 3D human hPSC-cysts. APEX2-based proximity bioinylation, followed by quantitative mass spectrometry, revealed a variety of proteins without previous annotation to specific membrane subdomains. Functional experiments validated the requirement for several apically enriched proteins in cyst morphogenesis. In particular, we found a key role for the AP-1 clathrin adaptor complex in expanding the apical membrane domains during lumen establishment. These findings highlight the robust power of this proximity labeling approach for discovering novel regulators of epithelial morphogenesis in 3D stem cell–based models.},

Restoring intraneural sensory feedback results in functional and cognitive benefits. It is unknown how this artificial feedback, restored through a neuro-robotic leg, influences users’ sensorimotor strategies and its implications for future wearable robotics. To unveil these mechanisms, we measured gait markers of a sensorized neuroprosthesis in two leg amputees during motor tasks of different difficulty. Novel sensorimotor strategies were intuitively promoted, allowing for a higher walking speed in both tasks. We objectively quantified the augmented prosthesis’ confidence and observed the reshaping of the legs’ kinematics toward a more physiological gait. In a possible scenario of a leg amputee driving a conventional car, we showed a finer pressure estimation from the prosthesis. Users exploited different features of the neural stimulation during tasks, suggesting that a simple prosthesis sensorization could be effective for future neuro-robotic prostheses.},

This approach allowed us to explore the dynamic evolution of electron beam–induced processes in a silicon-doped graphene system, but it can be also applied for a much broader range of atomic scale and mesoscopic phenomena to introduce the bottom-up order parameters and explore their dynamics with time and in response to external stimuli.},

In this study, we found the osteoclastogenic cytokine RANKL drove expression of GILT in osteoclast precursors in a STAT1-dependent manner, resulting in high levels of GILT in mature osteoclasts, which could be further augmented by γ-interferon. GILT colocalized with the collagen-degrading cysteine protease, cathepsin K, suggesting a role for GILT inside the osteoclastic resorption lacuna. GILT-deficient osteoclasts had reduced bone-resorbing capacity, resulting in impaired bone turnover and an osteopetrotic phenotype in GILT-deficient mice. We demonstrated that GILT could directly reduce the noncollagenous bone matrix protein SPARC, and additionally, enhance collagen degradation by cathepsin K.

We find high heterozygosity in all sifakas compared with other primates and endangered mammals. Demographic reconstructions nevertheless suggest declines in effective population size beginning before human arrival on Madagascar. Comparative genomic analyses indicate pervasive accelerated evolution in the ancestral sifaka lineage affecting genes in several complementary pathways relevant to folivory, including nutrient absorption and xenobiotic and fatty acid metabolism. Sifakas show convergent evolution at the level of the pathway, gene family, gene, and amino acid substitution with other folivores. Although sifakas have relatively generalized diets, the physiological challenges of habitual folivory likely led to strong selection.},

We trigger bacterial turbulence by suddenly increasing the swimming speed of light-powered bacteria and image the transition to the turbulence in real time. Our experiments identify two unusual kinetic pathways, i.e., the one-step transition with long incubation periods near the phase boundary and the two-step transition driven by long-wavelength instabilities deep inside the turbulent phase.

To enhance the ApoBD-based neighboring effect, we fabricated disulfide-linked prodrug nanoparticles consisting of camptothecin (CPT) and hypoxia-activated prodrug PR104A. CPT kills external normoxic tumor cells to produce ApoBDs, while PR104A remains inactive. The remaining drugs could be effectively delivered into internal tumor cells via ApoBDs. Although CPT exhibits low toxicity to internal hypoxic tumor cells, PR104A could be activated to exert strong cytotoxicity, which further facilitates deep penetration of the remaining drugs.

Light passing through this stack of metasurfaces accumulates the phase shift of both holograms and optically reconstructs the secret with high fidelity. In addition, the hologram generated by each single metasurface can uniquely identify its shareholder. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inherent translational alignment sensitivity between two stacked metasurface holograms can be used for spatial multiplexing, which can be further extended to realize optical rulers.},

  abstract     = {Surfactant molecules migrate to interfaces, reduce interfacial tension, and form micelles. All of these behaviors occur at or near equilibrium. Here, we describe active analogs of surfactants that operate far from equilibrium in active chiral fluids. Unlike molecular surfactants, the amphiphilic character of surfactants in active chiral fluids is a consequence of their activity. Our fluid of choice is a mixture of spinners that demixes into left-handed and right-handed chiral fluid domains. We realize spinners in experiment with three-dimensionally printed vibrots. Vibrot surfactants are chains of vibrots containing both types of handedness. Experiments demonstrate the affinity of double-stranded chains to interfaces, where they glide along and act as mixing agents. Simulations access larger systems in which single-stranded chains form spinning vesicles, termed rotelles. Rotelles are the chiral analogs of micelles. Rotelle formation is a ratchet mechanism catalyzed by the vorticity of the chiral fluid and only exist far from equilibrium.},

Crystallographic screening of 2533 diverse fragments resulted in 214 unique macrodomain-binders. An additional 60 molecules were selected from docking more than 20 million fragments, of which 20 were crystallographically confirmed. X-ray data collection to ultra-high resolution and at physiological temperature enabled assessment of the conformational heterogeneity around the active site. Several fragment hits were confirmed by solution binding using three biophysical techniques (differential scanning fluorimetry, homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence, and isothermal titration calorimetry).

However, detection of the interface stress embedded in organic optoelectronic devices is a long-standing problem, which causes the unknown relationship between interface stress and organic device stability (one key and unsettled issue for practical applications). In this study, a kind of previously unknown molecular conformation–induced stress is revealed at the organic embedded interface through sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy technique. This stress can be greater than 10 kcal/mol per nm 2 and is sufficient to induce molecular disorder in the organic semiconductor layer (with energy below 8 kcal/mol per nm 2 ), finally causing instability of the organic transistor. This study not only reveals interface stress in organic devices but also correlates instability of organic devices with the interface stress for the first time, offering an effective solution for improving device stability.},

Here, highly crystalline tellurium (Te) nanowires and two-dimensional nanosheets were synthesized by using chemical vapor deposition. The low-dimensional Te shows high hole mobility and broadband detection. The blackbody-sensitive infrared detection of Te devices was demonstrated. A high responsivity of 6650 A W −1 (at 1550-nm laser) and the blackbody responsivity of 5.19 A W −1 were achieved. High-resolution imaging based on Te photodetectors was successfully obtained.

We analyze hydrological modulation of seismicity in Taiwan using groundwater level data and GNSS time series. In western Taiwan, the seismicity rate reaches peak levels in February to April and drops to its lowest values in July to September, exhibiting a direct correlation with annual water unloading. The elastic hydrological load cycle may be the primary driving mechanism for the observed synchronized modulation of earthquakes, as also evidenced by deep earthquakes in eastern Taiwan. However, shallow earthquakes in eastern Taiwan (&lt;18 km) are anticorrelated with water unloading, which is not well explained by either hydrological loading, fluid transport, or pore pressure changes and suggests other time-dependent processes. The moderate correlation between stacked monthly trends of large historic earthquakes and present-day seismicity implies a modestly higher seismic hazard during the time of low annual hydrological loading.},

Electrospinning techniques offer scalability and compatibility with a wide arsenal of polymers, but typically lack precise three-dimensional (3D) control. We found that charge reversal during 3D jet writing can enable the high-throughput production of precisely engineered 3D structures. The trajectory of the jet is governed by a balance of destabilizing charge-charge repulsion and restorative viscoelastic forces. The reversal of the voltage polarity lowers the net surface potential carried by the jet and thus dampens the occurrence of bending instabilities typically observed during conventional electrospinning. In the absence of bending instabilities, precise deposition of polymer fibers becomes attainable. The same principles can be applied to 3D jet writing using an array of needles resulting in complex composite materials that undergo reversible shape transitions due to their unprecedented structural control.},

Simultaneously, a surge of micro/nanoarchitected materials have been demonstrated. Nevertheless, multiscale design and micro/nanoscale additive manufacturing have yet to be sufficiently integrated to achieve free-form, multiscale, biomimetic structures. We unify design and manufacturing of spatially varying, hierarchical structures through a multimicrostructure topology optimization formulation with continuous multimicrostructure embedding. The approach leads to an optimized layout of multiple microstructural materials within an optimized macrostructure geometry, manufactured with continuously graded interfaces. To make the process modular and controllable and to avoid prohibitively expensive surface representations, we embed the microstructures directly into the 3D printer slices. The ideas provide a critical, interdisciplinary link at the convergence of material and structure in optimal design and manufacturing.},

The G-form is more infectious in vitro and is associated with increased viral loads in the upper airways. To gain insight into the molecular-level underpinnings of these characteristics, we used microsecond all-atom simulations. We show that changes in the protein energetics favor a higher population of infection-capable states in the G-form through release of asymmetry present in the D-form inter-protomer interactions. Thus, the increased infectivity of the G-form is likely due to a higher rate of profitable binding encounters with the host receptor. It is also predicted to be more neutralization sensitive owing to enhanced exposure of the receptor binding domain, a key target region for neutralizing antibodies. These results are critical for vaccine design.},

Consequently, functional adaptations in exercise capacity, whole-body glycemic control, and vascular function were blunted. Furthermore, the sustained elevation of muscle perfusion after acute interval exercise was severely reduced when H 1 /H 2 receptors were pharmaceutically blocked. Our work suggests that histamine H 1 /H 2 receptors are important transducers of the integrative exercise training response in humans, potentially related to regulation of optimal post-exercise muscle perfusion. These findings add to our understanding of how skeletal muscle and the cardiovascular system adapt to exercise training, knowledge that will help us further unravel and develop the exercise-is-medicine concept.},

To better understand plasticity of signaling networks across tissues and developmental stages, we perform a comparative analysis of signaling networks between macrophages and endothelial cells across human adult and fetal tissues.

  abstract     = {The underlying mechanisms of thymocyte maturation remain largely unknown. Here, we report that serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) intrinsically regulates the late stage of thymocyte development. Conditional deletion of SRSF1 resulted in severe defects in maintenance of late thymocyte survival and a blockade of the transition of TCRβ hi CD24 + CD69 + immature to TCRβ hi CD24 − CD69 − mature thymocytes, corresponding to a notable reduction of recent thymic emigrants and diminished periphery T cell pool. Mechanistically, SRSF1 regulates the gene networks involved in thymocyte differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and type I interferon signaling pathway to safeguard T cell intrathymic maturation. In particular, SRSF1 directly binds and regulates Irf7 and Il27ra expression via alternative splicing in response to type I interferon signaling. Moreover, forced expression of interferon regulatory factor 7 rectifies the defects in SRSF1-deficient thymocyte maturation via restoring expression of type I interferon–related genes. Thus, our work provides new insight on SRSF1-mediated posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of thymocyte development.},

  abstract     = {Activity-dependent structural plasticity at the synapse requires specific changes in the neuronal transcriptome. While much is known about the role of coding elements in this process, the role of the long noncoding transcriptome remains elusive. Here, we report the discovery of an intronic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)—termed ADEPTR—that is up-regulated and synaptically transported in a cAMP/PKA-dependent manner in hippocampal neurons, independently of its protein-coding host gene. Loss of ADEPTR function suppresses activity-dependent changes in synaptic transmission and structural plasticity of dendritic spines. Mechanistically, dendritic localization of ADEPTR is mediated by molecular motor protein Kif2A. ADEPTR physically binds to actin-scaffolding regulators ankyrin (AnkB) and spectrin (Sptn1) via a conserved sequence and is required for their dendritic localization. Together, this study demonstrates how activity-dependent synaptic targeting of an lncRNA mediates structural plasticity at the synapse.},

Less well known is their influence on material chemistry. The severe lattice distortion at these defects drives solute segregation to them, resulting in strong, localized spatial variations in chemistry that determine microstructure and material behavior. Recent advances in atomic-scale characterization methods have made it possible to quantitatively resolve defect types and segregation chemistry. As shown here for a Pt-Au model alloy, we observe a wide range of defect-specific solute (Au) decoration patterns of much greater variety and complexity than expected from the Cottrell cloud picture. The solute decoration of the dislocations can be up to half an order of magnitude higher than expected from classical theory, and the differences are determined by their structure, mutual alignment, and distortion field. This opens up pathways to use dislocations for the compositional and structural nanoscale design of advanced materials.},

Here, we extend this concept to semimetals where, using LuSb as a model system, we show that quantum confinement lifts carrier compensation and differentially affects the mobility of the electron and hole-like carriers resulting in a strong modification in its large, nonsaturating magnetoresistance behavior. Bonding mismatch at the heteroepitaxial interface of a semimetal (LuSb) and a semiconductor (GaSb) leads to the emergence of a two-dimensional, interfacial hole gas. This is accompanied by a charge transfer across the interface that provides another avenue to modify the electronic structure and magnetotransport properties in the ultrathin limit. Our work lays out a general strategy of using confined thin-film geometries and heteroepitaxial interfaces to engineer electronic structure in semimetallic systems, which allows control over their magnetoresistance behavior and simultaneously provides insights into its origin.},

When gels exhibit a strong phase contrast and a low cross-linking level, the stress singularity around the crack tip is gradually eliminated with increasing fatigue cycles and this suppresses crack growth, beneficial for high fatigue resistance. On the contrary, the stress concentration persists in weakly phase-separated gels, resulting in low fatigue resistance. A material parameter, λ tran , is identified, correlated to the onset of non-affine deformation of the mesophase structure in a hydrogel without crack, which governs the slow-to-fast transition in fatigue crack growth. The detailed role played by the mesoscale structure on fatigue resistance provides design principles for developing self-healing, tough, and fatigue-resistant soft materials.},

We identified a modified form of the yeast TORC1 component Kog1/Raptor, which exhibits delayed growth exclusively during glucose and amino acid limitations. Using this, we found a necessary function for Kog1 in these conditions where TORC1 kinase activity is undetectable. Metabolic flux and transcriptome analysis revealed that Kog1 controls SNF1-dependent carbon flux apportioning between glutamate/amino acid biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis. Kog1 regulates SNF1/AMPK activity and outputs and mediates a rapamycin-independent activation of the SNF1 targets Mig1 and Cat8. This enables effective glucose derepression, gluconeogenesis activation, and carbon allocation through different pathways. Therefore, Kog1 centrally regulates metabolic homeostasis and carbon utilization during nutrient limitation by managing SNF1 activity.},

Netrin deficiency activates δ-secretase that specifically cuts UNC5C at N467 and N547 residues and enhances subsequent caspase-3 activation, additively augmenting neuronal cell death. Blockade of δ-secretase cleavage of UNC5C diminishes T835M mutant’s proapoptotic activity. Viral expression of δ-secretase–truncated UNC5C fragments into APP/PS1 mice strongly accelerates AD pathologies, impairing learning and memory. Conversely, deletion of UNC5C from netrin-1–depleted mice attenuates AD pathologies and rescues cognitive disorders.

We show that solvent evaporation from a suspension of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and l -(+)-tartaric acid [ l -(+)-TA] causes phase separation and precipitation, which, being coupled with a reaction/diffusion, results in rhythmic alternation of CNC-rich and l -(+)-TA–rich rings.

  abstract     = {Mirror symmetries are of particular importance because they are connected to fundamental properties and conservation laws. Spatial inversion and time reversal are typically associated to charge and spin phenomena, respectively. When both are broken, magnetoelectric cross-coupling can arise. In the optical regime, a difference between forward and backward propagation of light may result. Usually, this nonreciprocal response is small. We show that a giant nonreciprocal optical response can occur when transferring from linear to nonlinear optics, specifically second harmonic generation (SHG). CuB 2 O 4 exhibits SHG transmission changes by almost 100\% upon reversal of a magnetic field of just ±10 mT. The observed nonreciprocity results from an interference between magnetic-dipole and electric-dipole SHG. Although the former is inherently weaker than the latter, a resonantly enhanced magnetic-dipole transition has a comparable amplitude as a nonresonant electric-dipole transition, thus maximizing the nonreciprocity. Multiferroics and magnetoelectrics are an obvious materials platform to exhibit nonreciprocal nonlinear optical functionalities.},

  abstract     = {The avascular nature of cornea tissue limits its regenerative potential, which may lead to incomplete healing and formation of scars when damaged. Here, we applied micro- and ultrafine porcine urinary bladder matrix (UBM) particulate to promote type 2 immune responses in cornea wounds. Results demonstrated that UBM particulate substantially reduced corneal haze formation as compared to the saline-treated group. Flow cytometry and gene expression analysis showed that UBM particulate suppressed the differentiation of corneal stromal cells into α-smooth muscle actin–positive (αSMA + ) myofibroblasts. UBM treatments up-regulated interleukin-4 (IL-4) produced primarily by eosinophils in the wounded corneas and CD4 + T cells in draining lymph nodes, suggesting a cross-talk between local and peripheral immunity. Gata1 −/− mice lacking eosinophils did not respond to UBM treatment and had impaired wound healing. In summary, stimulating type 2 immune responses in the wounded cornea can promote proregenerative environments that lead to improved wound healing for vision restoration.},

We show that the LTP versus LTD decision is determined by complex cross-regulation of T286 and T305/306 autophosphorylation within the 12meric CaMKII holoenzyme, which enabled molecular computation of stimulus frequency, amplitude, and duration. Both LTP and LTD require T286 phosphorylation, but T305/306 phosphorylation selectively promoted LTD. In response to excitatory LTP versus LTD stimuli, the differential T305/306 phosphorylation directed CaMKII movement to either excitatory or inhibitory synapses, thereby coordinating plasticity at both synapse types. Fast T305/306 phosphorylation required prior T286 phosphorylation and then curbed CaMKII activity by two mechanisms: (i) a cis-subunit reaction reduced both Ca 2+ stimulation and autonomous activity and (ii) a trans-subunit reaction enabled complete activity shutdown and feed-forward inhibition of further T286 phosphorylation. These are fundamental additions to the long-studied CaMKII regulation and function in neuronal plasticity.},

In this work, we move beyond equilibrium physicochemical characterization of a virus system to study a stage of the infection process that is required for viral proliferation. Despite many biochemical and functional studies, the molecular mechanism of host cell entry by non-enveloped viruses remains largely unresolved. Flock House virus (FHV) is a model system for non-enveloped viruses and is the subject of the current study. FHV infects through the acid-dependent endocytic pathway, where low pH triggers externalization of membrane-disrupting (γ) peptides from the capsid interior. Using all-atom equilibrium and enhanced sampling simulations, the mechanism and energetics of γ peptide liberation and the effect of pH on this process are investigated. Our computations agree with experimental findings and reveal nanoscopic details regarding the pH control mechanism, which are not readily accessible in experiments.},

Above some critical spinning frequency, such particles generate localized 3D vortices and form composite “spinner-vortex” quasiparticles with nontrivial, yet robust dynamics. Such spinner-vortices are attracted and dynamically trapped near the boundaries, propagating along the wall of any shape similarly to “liquid wheels.” The propulsion velocity and the distance to the wall are controlled by the angular velocity of the spinner via the balance between the Magnus and wall repulsion forces.

Combining a novel framework with isotope tracer studies, we quantified POC and MAOC formation efficiencies (\% of C-inputs incorporated into each fraction). We found that rhizodeposition inputs have the highest MAOC formation efficiency (46\%) as compared to roots (9\%) or aboveground inputs (7\%). In addition, rhizodeposition unexpectedly reduced POC formation, likely because it increased decomposition rates of new POC. Conversely, root biomass inputs have the highest POC formation efficiency (19\%). Therefore, rhizodeposition and roots appear to play opposite but complementary roles for building MAOC and POC fractions.},

Yet, in apparent contradiction, RNA is a potent catalytic inhibitor of PRC2. Here, we show that intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions between the lncRNA HOTAIR and its targets can relieve RNA inhibition of PRC2. RNA bridging is promoted by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein B1, which uses multiple protein domains to bind HOTAIR regions via multivalent protein-RNA interactions. Chemical probing demonstrates that establishing RNA-RNA interactions changes HOTAIR structure. Genome-wide HOTAIR/PRC2 activity occurs at genes whose transcripts can make favorable RNA-RNA interactions with HOTAIR. We demonstrate that RNA-RNA matches of HOTAIR with target gene RNAs can relieve the inhibitory effect of a single lncRNA for PRC2 activity after B1 dissociation. Our work highlights an intrinsic switch that allows PRC2 activity in specific RNA contexts, which could explain how many lncRNAs work with PRC2.},

These problems are caused by labile DOC (LDOC) and not refractory DOC (RDOC) that resists degradation and is thus a carbon sink. For nearly a century, chemical oxygen demand (COD) has been widely used for assessment of organic pollution in aquatic systems. Here, we show through a multicountry survey and experimental studies that COD is not an appropriate proxy of microbial degradability of organic matter because it oxidizes both LDOC and RDOC, and the latter contributes up to 90\% of DOC in high-latitude forested areas. Hence, COD measurements do not provide appropriate scientific information on organic pollution in natural waters and can mislead environmental policies. We propose the replacement of the COD method with an optode-based biological oxygen demand method to accurately and efficiently assess organic pollution in natural aquatic environments.},

This paper explores the link between the selection for mutational robustness and the navigability of neutral networks. I show that sequences of neutral mutations follow a “maximal entropy random walk, ” a canonical Markov chain on graphs with nonlocal, nondiffusive dynamics. I revisit M. Smith’s word-game model of evolution in this light, finding that the likelihood of certain sequences of substitutions can decrease with the population size.

Recent studies uncovered a nine residue (“ACT”) domain important for Parkin activation, and we demonstrate that AMPK-dependent ULK1 rapidly phosphorylates conserved serine108 in the ACT domain in response to mitochondrial stress. Phosphorylation of Parkin Ser108 occurs maximally within five minutes of mitochondrial damage, unlike activation of PINK1 and TBK1, which is observed thirty to sixty minutes later. Mutation of the ULK1 phosphorylation sites in Parkin, genetic AMPK or ULK1 depletion, or pharmacologic ULK1 inhibition, all lead to delays in Parkin activation and defects in assays of Parkin function and downstream mitophagy events.

Cargo transport defects are recapitulated by treating neurons from healthy individuals with proline-arginine and glycine-arginine dipeptide repeats (DPRs) produced from the repeat expansion. Both arginine-rich DPRs similarly inhibit axonal trafficking in adult Drosophila neurons in vivo. Physical interaction studies demonstrate that arginine-rich DPRs associate with motor complexes and the unstructured tubulin tails of microtubules. Single-molecule imaging reveals that microtubule-bound arginine-rich DPRs directly impede translocation of purified dynein and kinesin-1 motor complexes.

We now describe a novel implementation of the Abd method with a cell-based intracellular antibody–guided screening method that we have applied to the chromosomal translocation protein LMO2. We have identified a chemical series of anti-LMO2 Abd compounds that bind at the same LMO2 location as the inhibitory anti-LMO2 intracellular antibody combining site.

Our experimental results are in quantitative agreement with a physical model of the graphene nonlinearity, describing the time-dependent thermodynamic balance maintained within the electronic population of graphene during interaction with ultrafast electric fields.

  abstract     = {Recent kinematic results, combined with model simulations, have provided support for the hypothesis that the human brain shapes motor patterns that use gravity effects to minimize muscle effort. Because many different muscular activation patterns can give rise to the same trajectory, here, we specifically investigate gravity-related movement properties by analyzing muscular activation patterns during single-degree-of-freedom arm movements in various directions. Using a well-known decomposition method of tonic and phasic electromyographic activities, we demonstrate that phasic electromyograms (EMGs) present systematic negative phases. This negativity reveals the optimal motor plan’s neural signature, where the motor system harvests the mechanical effects of gravity to accelerate downward and decelerate upward movements, thereby saving muscle effort. We compare experimental findings in humans to monkeys, generalizing the Effort-optimization strategy across species.},

We hypothesized that a shift in energy substrates during withdrawal may contribute to withdrawal severity and neurotoxicity in AUD and that a ketogenic diet (KD) may mitigate these effects. We found that inpatients with AUD randomized to receive KD ( n = 19) required fewer benzodiazepines during the first week of detoxification, in comparison to those receiving a standard American (SA) diet ( n = 14). Over a 3-week treatment, KD compared to SA showed lower “wanting” and increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) reactivity to alcohol cues and altered dACC bioenergetics (i.e., elevated ketones and glutamate and lower neuroinflammatory markers). In a rat model of alcohol dependence, a history of KD reduced alcohol consumption. We provide clinical and preclinical evidence for beneficial effects of KD on managing alcohol withdrawal and on reducing alcohol drinking.},

The occurrence of the shallow 2016 moment magnitude 7.1 supershear rupture earthquake and these deep microearthquakes indicate that although large earthquakes occur in the upper brittle lithosphere, a substantial amount of deformation is accommodated in the semibrittle mylonitic mantle that resides at depths below the 600°C isotherm.

This dynamic reciprocity mediates development and tumorigenesis. Currently, there is no method available to directly quantify single-cell forces and matrix remodeling in 3D. Here, we introduce a method to fulfill this long-standing need. We developed a high-resolution microfabricated sensor that hosts a 3D cell-ECM tissue formed by self-assembly. This sensor measures cell forces and tissue stiffness and can apply mechanical stimulation to the tissue. We measured single and multicellular force dynamics of fibroblasts (3T3), human colon (FET) and lung (A549) cancer cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF05) with 1-nN resolution. Single cells show notable force fluctuations in 3D. FET/CAF coculture system, mimicking cancer tumor microenvironment, increased tissue stiffness by three times within 24 hours.},

Here, we investigate the effect of ocean eddies on global mean sea-level rise (GMSLR) projections, using climate model simulations. Explicitly resolving ocean eddies leads to a more realistic Southern Ocean temperature distribution and volume transport. These quantities control the rate of basal melt, which eventually results in Antarctic mass loss. In a model with resolved ocean eddies, the Southern Ocean temperature changes lead to a smaller Antarctic GMSLR contribution compared to the same model in which eddies are parameterized. As a result, the projected GMSLR is about 25\% lower at the end of this century in the eddying model. Relatively small-scale ocean eddies can hence have profound large-scale effects and consequently affect GMSLR projections.},

Neutral cues can acquire motivational properties when paired with the positive emotional effects of drug intoxication to stimulate relapse. However, much less research has been devoted to cues that become conditioned to the aversive effects of opioid withdrawal. We argue that environmental stimuli promote motivation for opioids when cues are paired with withdrawal (conditioned withdrawal) and generate opioid consumption to terminate conditioned withdrawal (conditioned negative reinforcement). We review evidence that cues associated with pain drive opioid consumption, as patients with chronic pain may misuse opioids to escape physical and emotional pain. We highlight sex differences in withdrawal-induced stress reactivity and withdrawal cue processing and discuss neurocircuitry that may underlie withdrawal cue processing in dependent individuals. These studies highlight the importance of studying cues associated with withdrawal in dependent individuals and point to areas for exploration in OUD research.},

We use systems analysis to quantify the costs and life-cycle carbon footprints of virgin and chemically recycled polydiketoenamines (PDKs), next-generation polymers that depolymerize under ambient conditions in strong acid. The cost of producing virgin PDK resin using unoptimized processes is ~30-fold higher than recycling them, and the cost of recycled PDK resin ($1.5 kg −1 ) is on par with PET and HDPE, and below that of polyurethanes. Virgin resin production is carbon intensive (86 kg CO 2 e kg −1 ), while chemical recycling emits only 2 kg CO 2 e kg −1 .

By combining the advantage of the rapid responses to gases realized by LCs with the compactness of holographic metasurfaces, we develop ultracompact gas sensors without additional complex instruments or machinery to report the visual information of gas detection.

Mechanistically, GAT2 deficiency boosts the betaine/S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)/hypoxanthine metabolic pathway to inhibit transcription factor KID3 expression through the increased DNA methylation in its promoter region. KID3 regulates oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) via targeting the expression of OXPHOS-related genes and is also critical for NLRP3–ASC–caspase-1 complex formation. Likewise, GAT2 deficiency attenuates macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses in vivo, including lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis, infection-induced pneumonia, and high-fat diet-induced obesity. Together, we propose that targeting GABAergic system (e.g., GABA transporter) could provide previously unidentified therapeutic opportunities for the macrophage-associated diseases.},

Here, we show that in the neocortex and thalamus, neurons and astrocytes express shared region-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures. These signatures not only distinguish cells across these two brain regions but are also detected across substructures within regions, such as distinct thalamic nuclei, where clonal analysis reveals the existence of common nucleus-specific progenitors for neurons and astrocytes. Consistent with their shared molecular signature, regional specificity is maintained following astrocyte-to-neuron reprogramming.

However, despite extensive research, there is currently no mathematical proof indicating that Lévy walks are, in any manner, preferable strategies in higher dimensions than one. Here, we prove that in finite two-dimensional terrains, the inverse-square Lévy walk strategy is extremely efficient at finding sparse targets of arbitrary size and shape. Moreover, this holds even under the weak model of intermittent detection. Conversely, any other intermittent Lévy walk fails to efficiently find either large targets or small ones. Our results shed new light on the Lévy foraging hypothesis and are thus expected to affect future experiments on animals performing Lévy walks.},

  abstract     = {Electrides are an unusual family of materials that feature loosely bonded electrons that occupy special interstitial sites and serve as anions. They are attracting increasing attention because of their wide range of exotic physical and chemical properties. Despite the critical role of the anionic electrons in inducing these properties, their presence has not been directly observed experimentally. Here, we visualize the columnar anionic electron density within the prototype electride Y 5 Si 3 with sub-angstrom spatial resolution using differential phase-contrast imaging in a scanning transmission electron microscope. The data further reveal an unexpected charge variation at different anionic sites. Density functional theory simulations show that the presence of trace H impurities is the cause of this inhomogeneity. The visualization and quantification of charge inhomogeneities in crystals will serve as valuable input in future theoretical predictions and experimental analysis of exotic properties in electrides and materials beyond.},

  abstract     = {Treating osteoarthritis (OA) remains a major clinical challenge. Despite recent advances in drug discovery and development, no disease-modifying drug for knee OA has emerged with any notable clinical success, in part, due to the lack of valid and responsive therapeutic targets and poor drug delivery within knee joints. In this work, we show that the amount of secretory phospholipase A 2 (sPLA 2 ) enzyme increases in the articular cartilage in human and mouse OA cartilage tissues. We hypothesize that the inhibition of sPLA 2 activity may be an effective treatment strategy for OA. To develop an sPLA 2 -responsive and nanoparticle (NP)–based interventional platform for OA management, we incorporated an sPLA 2 inhibitor (sPLA 2 i) into the phospholipid membrane of micelles. The engineered sPLA 2 i-loaded micellar NPs (sPLA 2 i-NPs) were able to penetrate deep into the cartilage matrix, prolong retention in the joint space, and mitigate OA progression. These findings suggest that sPLA 2 i-NPs can be promising therapeutic agents for OA treatment.},

During the last few hundred years, chemists compiled the language of chemical synthesis inferring a series of “reaction rules” from knowing how atoms rearrange during a chemical transformation, a process called atom-mapping. Atom-mapping is a laborious experimental task and, when tackled with computational methods, requires continuous annotation of chemical reactions and the extension of logically consistent directives. Here, we demonstrate that Transformer Neural Networks learn atom-mapping information between products and reactants without supervision or human labeling. Using the Transformer attention weights, we build a chemically agnostic, attention-guided reaction mapper and extract coherent chemical grammar from unannotated sets of reactions. Our method shows remarkable performance in terms of accuracy and speed, even for strongly imbalanced and chemically complex reactions with nontrivial atom-mapping. It provides the missing link between data-driven and rule-based approaches for numerous chemical reaction tasks.},

For single-phase microstructures, they aim to achieve a particular average grain diameter to leverage stress hardening or softening. The stochastic nature of the recrystallization process generates a grain size distribution, and the randomness of the crystallographic orientation determines the anisotropy of a mechanical response. We developed a multiscale computational formalism to capture the collective mechanical response of polycrystalline microstructures at unprecedented length scales. We found that for an averaged grain size, the mechanical response is highly dependent on the grain size distribution. The simulations reveal the topological conditions that promote coherent grain texturization and grain growth inhibition during stress relaxation. We identify the microstructural features that are responsible for the appearance of stress hotspots. Our results provide the elusive evidence of how stress hotspots are ideal precursors for plastic and creep failure.},

However, how FOXA1 levels are regulated remains elusive and its therapeutic targeting proven challenging. Here, we report FOXA1 as a nonhistone substrate of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which methylates FOXA1 at lysine-295. This methylation is recognized by WD40 repeat protein BUB3, which subsequently recruits ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) to remove ubiquitination and enhance FOXA1 protein stability. They functionally converge in regulating cell cycle genes and promoting PCa growth. FOXA1 is a major therapeutic target of the inhibitors of EZH2 methyltransferase activities in PCa. FOXA1-driven PCa growth can be effectively mitigated by EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors, either alone or in combination with USP7 inhibitors. Together, our study reports EZH2-catalyzed methylation as a key mechanism to FOXA1 protein stability, which may be leveraged to enhance therapeutic targeting of PCa using enzymatic EZH2 inhibitors.},

We found that only ~12.1\% of studies compare distributional shifts across multiple directions, ~1.6\% distinguish observed patterns from random expectations, and ~19.66\% examine multicausal factors. Last, ~75.5\% of studies report sufficient data and results to allow replication. We show that despite gradual improvements over time, there is scope for raising standards in data and methods within reports of climate-change induced shifts in species distribution. Accurate reporting is important because policy responses depend on them. Flawed assessments can fuel criticism and divert scarce resources for biodiversity to competing priorities.},

The model, calibrated on French population, integrates demographic, contact and epidemiological information to describe exposure and transmission of COVID-19. We explored realistic levels of case detection, app adoption, population immunity, and transmissibility. Assuming a reproductive ratio R = 2.6 and 50\% detection of clinical cases, a ~20\% app adoption reduces peak incidence by ~35\%. With R = 1.7, &gt;30\% app adoption lowers the epidemic to manageable levels.

Our end-to-end deep learning model predicts physical fields like stress or strain directly from the material microstructure geometry, and reaches an astonishing accuracy not only for predicted field data but also for derivative material property predictions. Furthermore, the proposed approach offers extensibility by predicting complex materials behavior regardless of component shapes, boundary conditions, and geometrical hierarchy, providing perspectives of performing physical modeling and simulations.

Recently, the transition metal oxide terminations of delafossite oxides were found to exhibit a large Rashba spin splitting dominated by ISB. In this limit, the Fermi surface exhibits the same spin texture as for weak ISB, but the orbital texture is completely different, raising questions about the effect on quasiparticle scattering.

On the basis of these data, pathways and modification of water flowing into the cavity are identified.

Inflow of warm and outflow of melt-enriched waters are identified in two seafloor troughs to the north. Spatial property gradients highlight a previously unknown convergence zone in one trough, where different water masses meet and mix.

By combining empirical and modeling approaches, we show that the first representatives of marine phytoplankton exhibited an LDG from the beginning of the Cambrian, when most major phyla appeared. However, this LDG showed a single peak of diversity centered on the Southern Hemisphere, in contrast to the equatorial peak classically observed for most modern taxa. We find that this LDG most likely corresponds to a truncated bimodal gradient, which probably results from an uneven sediment preservation, smaller sampling effort, and/or lower initial diversity in the Northern Hemisphere. Variation of the documented LDG through time resulted primarily from fluctuations in annual sea-surface temperature and long-term climate changes.},

  abstract     = {Value is often associated with reward, emphasizing its hedonic aspects. However, when circumstances change, value must also change (a compass outvalues gold, if you are lost). How are value representations in the brain reshaped under different behavioral goals? To answer this question, we devised a new task that decouples usefulness from its hedonic attributes, allowing us to study flexible goal-dependent mapping. Here, we show that, unlike sensory cortices, regions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)—usually associated with value computation—remap their representation of perceptually identical items according to how useful the item has been to achieve a specific goal. Furthermore, we identify a coding scheme in the PFC that represents value regardless of the goal, thus supporting generalization across contexts. Our work questions the dominant view that equates value with reward, showing how a change in goals triggers a reorganization of the neural representation of value, enabling flexible behavior.},

Recently, graphene biosensors were successfully used for extracellular recording of action potentials in electrogenic cells; however, intracellular recordings remain beyond their current capabilities because of the lack of an efficient cell poration method. Here, we present a microelectrode platform consisting of out-of-plane grown three-dimensional fuzzy graphene (3DFG) that enables recording of intracellular cardiac action potentials with high signal-to-noise ratio. We exploit the generation of hot carriers by ultrafast pulsed laser for porating the cell membrane and creating an intimate contact between the 3DFG electrodes and the intracellular domain. This approach enables us to detect the effects of drugs on the action potential shape of human-derived cardiomyocytes. The 3DFG electrodes combined with laser poration may be used for all-carbon intracellular microelectrode arrays to allow monitoring of the cellular electrophysiological state.},

Despite recent progress in molecular design and engineering on single fluorophores, a systematic methodology to obtain multicolor emission in aggregated or solid states, which gives rise to practical implications, remains scarce. In this study, we present a general strategy to continuously tune the emission color of a single-fluorophore aggregate by polymerization-mediated through-space charge transfer (TSCT). Using a library of well-defined styrenic donor (D) polymers grown from an acceptor (A) fluorophore by controlled radical polymerization, we found that the solid-state emission color can be fine-tuned by varying three molecular parameters: (i) the monomer substituent, (ii) the end groups of the polymer, and (iii) the polymer chain length. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the color tunability originates from the structurally dependent TSCT process that regulates charge transfer energy.},

Most of the jovian polar cap is threaded by helical magnetic flux that closes within the planetary interior, extends into the outer magnetosphere, and piles up near its dawnside flank where fast differential plasma rotation pulls the field lines sunward. This unusual magnetic topology provides new insights into Jupiter’s distinctive auroral morphology.},

Here, we analyzed apparent Q 10 values derived from multiyear observations at 74 FLUXNET sites spanning diverse climates and biomes. We found warming-induced decline in Q 10 is stronger at colder regions than other locations, which is consistent with a meta-analysis of 54 field warming experiments across the globe. We predict future warming will shrink the global variability of Q 10 values to an average of 1.44 across the globe under a high emission trajectory (RCP 8.5) by the end of the century. Therefore, warming-induced carbon loss may be less than previously assumed because of Q 10 homogenization in a warming world.},

Here, we implicate intercellular bridges (ICBs) in this state transition. We used three-dimensional in toto imaging to map meiotic initiation in the mouse fetal ovary and revealed a radial geometry of this transition that precedes the established anterior-posterior wave. Our studies reveal that appropriate timing of meiotic entry across the ovary and coordination of mitotic-meiotic transition within a cyst depend on the ICB component Tex14 , which we show is required for functional cytoplasmic sharing. We find that Tex14 mutants more rapidly attenuate the pluripotency transcript Dppa3 upon meiotic initiation, and Dppa3 mutants undergo premature meiosis similar to Tex14 . Together, these results lead to a model that ICBs coordinate and buffer the transition from pluripotency to meiosis through dilution of regulatory factors.},

This strategy seamlessly unites surgical sutures, tough gel sheath, and various functional materials. Robust modification is demonstrated with strong interfacial adhesion (&gt;2000 J m −2 ). The surface stiffness, friction, and drag of the suture when interfacing with tissues can be markedly reduced, without compromising the tensile strength. Versatile functionalization of the suture for infection prevention, wound monitoring, drug delivery, and near-infrared imaging is then presented.

We image continuously evolving afterslip, along with aftershocks, on the San Andreas fault over a minutes-to-days postseismic time span. Our results reveal a multistage scenario, including immediate onset of afterslip following tens-of-seconds-long coseismic shaking, short-lived slip reversals within minutes, expanding afterslip within hours, and slip migration between subparallel fault strands within days. The early afterslip and associated stress changes appear synchronized with local aftershock rates, with increasing afterslip often preceding larger aftershocks, suggesting the control of afterslip on fine-scale aftershock behavior. We interpret complex shallow processes as dynamic signatures of a three-dimensional fault-zone structure. These findings highlight important roles of aseismic source processes and structural factors in seismicity evolution, offering potential prospects for improving aftershock forecasts.},

We quantified the long-term effects of large-scale afforestation for soil erosion and sandstorm prevention in semiarid China. We found that soil erosion was notably reduced by afforestation but surface runoff declined significantly, after a time lag of 18 years, limiting overall benefit. While forest area also increased, forest quality declined, interacting with reduced surface water runoff. Crucially, increased forest water consumption accelerated downstream groundwater depletion, thus intensifying conflicts over water use.

Here, we present unambiguous experimental evidence to firmly establish the cavitation mechanism in the fracture of glasses. We show that crack propagation in various glasses is dominated by the self-organized nucleation, growth, and coalescence of nanocavities, eventually resulting in the nanopatterns on the fracture surfaces. The revealed cavitation-induced nanostructured fracture morphologies thus confirm the presence of nanoscale ductility in the fracture of nominally brittle glasses, which has been debated for decades. Our observations would aid a fundamental understanding of the failure of disordered systems and have implications for designing tougher glasses with excellent ductility.},

As a diagnostic device, this smart contact lens enables real-time measurement of the concentration of matrix metalloproteinase-9, a biomarker for OSI, in tears using a graphene field-effect transistor. As a therapeutic device, we also fabricated a stretchable and transparent heat patch attachable on the human eyelid conformably.

Endovascular repair with tissue adhesives may reduce host tissue damage, but current bioadhesive designs do not support minimally invasive deployment. Voltage-activated tissue adhesives offer a new strategy for endoluminal repair. To facilitate the clinical translation of voltage-activated adhesives, an electroceutical patch (ePATCH) paired with a minimally invasive catheter with retractable electrodes (CATRE) is challenged against the repair of in vivo and ex vivo lumen defects. The ePATCH/CATRE platform demonstrates the sealing of lumen defects up to 2 millimeters in diameter on wet tissue substrates. Water-tight seals are flexible and resilient, withstanding over 20, 000 physiological relevant stress/strain cycles. No disruption to electrical signals was observed when the ePATCH was electrically activated on the beating heart.

Afterward, the resulting immune microenvironment favorably triggered osteogenic differentiation of murine mesenchymal stem cells in vitro and subsequent implant-to-bone osteointegration in vivo. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed that the minimal scale of TiO 2 honeycomb–like structure (90 nanometers) facilitated macrophage filopodia formation and up-regulated the Rho family of guanosine triphosphatases ( RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42 ), which reinforced the polarization of macrophages through the activation of the RhoA/Rho–associated protein kinase signaling pathway.},

Deep-sea niche segregation may evolve when predators target specific prey communities, but this hypothesis remains untested. We combined environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding with biologging to assess cephalopod community composition in the deep-sea foraging habitat of two top predator cetaceans. Risso’s dolphin and Cuvier’s beaked whale selectively targeted distinct epi/meso- and bathypelagic foraging zones, holding eDNA of 39 cephalopod taxa, including 22 known prey. Contrary to expectation, extensive taxonomic overlap in prey spectra between foraging zones indicated that predator niche segregation was not driven by prey community composition alone. Instead, intraspecific prey spectrum differences may drive differentiation for hunting fewer, more calorific, mature cephalopods in deeper waters. The novel combination of methods presented here holds great promise to disclose elusive deep-sea predator-prey systems, aiding in their protection.},

Here, we identified PD-1 as a direct target of tumor suppressor p53. Notably, p53 acetylation at K120/164 played a critical role in p53-mediated PD-1 transcription. Acetylated p53 preferentially recruited acetyltransferase cofactors onto PD-1 promoter, selectively facilitating PD-1 transcription by enhancing local chromatin acetylation. Reexpression of PD-1 in cancer cells inhibited tumor growth, whereas depletion of cancer cell–intrinsic PD-1 compromised p53-dependent tumor suppression. Moreover, histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activated PD-1 in an acetylated p53–dependent manner, supporting a synergistic effect by HDACi and p53 on tumor suppression via stimulating cancer cell–intrinsic PD-1. Our study reveals a mechanism for activating cancer cell–intrinsic PD-1 and indicates that p53-mediated PD-1 activation is critically involved in tumor suppression in an immunity-independent manner.},

Here, we realize coherent control of ensembles of boron vacancy centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Specifically, by applying pulsed spin resonance protocols, we measure a spin-lattice relaxation time of 18 microseconds and a spin coherence time of 2 microseconds at room temperature. The spin-lattice relaxation time increases by three orders of magnitude at cryogenic temperature. By applying a method to decouple the spin state from its inhomogeneous nuclear environment the optically detected magnetic resonance linewidth is substantially reduced to several tens of kilohertz. Our results are important for the employment of van der Waals materials for quantum technologies, specifically in the context of high resolution quantum sensing of two-dimensional heterostructures, nanoscale devices, and emerging atomically thin magnets.},

PBRM1 binds SETD2 methyl marks via BAH domains, recruiting PBAF components to the mitotic spindle. This read-write activity was required for normal mitosis: Loss of SETD2 methylation or pathogenic BAH domain mutations disrupt PBRM1 microtubule binding and PBAF recruitment and cause genomic instability. These data reveal PBRM1 functions beyond chromatin remodeling with domains that allow it to integrate chromatin and cytoskeletal activity via its acetyl-binding BD and methyl-binding BAH domains, respectively. Conserved coordinated activity of the epigenetic machinery on the cytoskeleton opens a previously unknown window into how chromatin remodeler defects can drive disease via both epigenetic and cytoskeletal dysfunction.},

However, these polaritons present a crucial limitation: their directional propagation is intrinsically determined by the crystal structure of the host material, imposing forbidden directions of propagation. Here, we demonstrate that directional polaritons (in-plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons) in a vdW crystal (α-phase molybdenum trioxide) can be directed along forbidden directions by inducing an optical topological transition, which emerges when the slab is placed on a substrate with a given negative permittivity (4H–silicon carbide). By visualizing the transition in real space, we observe exotic polaritonic states between mutually orthogonal hyperbolic regimes, which unveil the topological origin of the transition: a gap opening in the dispersion. This work provides insights into optical topological transitions in vdW crystals, which introduce a route to direct light at the nanoscale.},

A two-dimensional model of the pair potential predicts the salient experimental observations and reveals both attractions and repulsions, producing a potential minimum entirely a result of the solid domain rigidity and bending energy in the fluid membrane. The impact of vesicle inflation on domain separation in vesicles containing two solid domains was qualitatively consistent with observations in vesicles containing many domains. The behavior differs qualitatively from the pure repulsions between fluid membrane domains or interactions between nanoscopic inclusions whose repulsive or attractive character is not switchable.},

These iron values lie outside the range of known mantle compositions or expected reaction products at depth. This signature represents subducted iron from magnetite and/or Fe-Ni alloys precipitated during serpentinization of oceanic peridotite, a lithology known to carry unradiogenic osmium inherited from prior convection and melt depletion. These diamond-hosted inclusions trace serpentinite subduction into the mantle transition zone. We propose that iron-rich phases from serpentinite contribute a labile heavy iron component to the heterogeneous convecting mantle eventually sampled by oceanic basalts.},

  abstract     = {Observing others’ aversive experiences is central to know what is dangerous for ourselves. Hence, observation often elicits behavioral and physiological responses comparable to first-hand aversive experiences and engages overlapping brain activation. While brain activation to first-hand aversive experiences relies on connections to the spinal cord, it is unresolved whether merely observing aversive stimulation also involves responses in the spinal cord. Here, we show that observation of others receiving painful heat stimulation involves neural responses in the spinal cord, located in the same cervical segment as first-hand heat pain. However, while first-hand painful experiences are coded within dorsolateral regions of the spinal cord, observation of others’ painful heat stimulation involves medial regions. Dorsolateral areas that process first-hand pain exhibit negative responses when observing pain in others. Our results suggest a distinct processing between self and others’ pain in the spinal cord when integrating social information.},

Here, new imaging of the trilobite Triarthrus eatoni shows that dumbbell-shaped filaments in the upper limb branch are morphologically comparable with gill structures in crustaceans that aerate the hemolymph. In Olenoides serratus , the upper limb’s partial articulation to the body via an extended arthrodial membrane is morphologically comparable to the junction of the respiratory book gill of Limulus and differentiates it from the typically robust exopod junction in Chelicerata or Crustacea. Apparently limited mechanical rotation of the upper branch may have protected the respiratory structures. Partial attachment of the upper branch to the body wall may represent an intermediate state in the evolution of limb branch fusion between dorsal attachment to the body wall, as in Radiodonta, and ventral fusion to the limb base, as in extant Euarthropoda.},

We present the first high-resolution structure of an adenovirus with nonmammalian host: lizard atadenovirus LAdV-2. We find a large conformational difference in the internal vertex protein IIIa between mast- and atadenoviruses, induced by the presence of an extended polypeptide. This polypeptide, and α-helical clusters beneath the facet, likely correspond to genus-specific proteins LH2 and p32k. Another genus-specific protein, LH3, with a fold typical of bacteriophage tailspikes, contacts the capsid surface via a triskelion structure identical to that used by mastadenovirus protein IX, revealing a conserved capsid-binding motif and an ancient gene duplication event. Our data also suggest that mastadenovirus E1B-55 K was exapted from the atadenovirus-like LH3 protein. This work provides new information on the evolution of adenoviruses, emphasizing the importance of minor coat proteins for determining specific physicochemical properties of virions and most likely their tropism.},

The tight confinement of electromagnetic fields in the resonant nanostructure enhances the photoexcitation of spin-polarized surface states of topological insulator Bi 1.5 Sb 0.5 Te 1.8 Se 1.2 , leading to an 11-fold increase of the circular photogalvanic effect and a previously unobserved photocurrent dichroism (ρ circ = 0.87) at room temperature.

It consists of a stimuli-responsive material coated asymmetrically with an adaptive impermeable layer. Its ability to analyze the derivative is shown by experiments, numerical modeling, and theory (i.e., scaling between derivative and response). This class of freestanding stimuli-responsive materials is demonstrated to serve effectively as a derivative controller for controlled delivery and self-regulation. Its fast response realizes the same designed functionality and efficiency as complex industrial derivative controllers widely used in manufacturing.

Inhibition of the advanced glycation pathway, which generates Maillard reaction products within foods upon thermal processing, reversed kidney injury. Consequently, a processed diet leads to innate immune complement activation and local kidney inflammation and injury via the potent proinflammatory effector molecule complement 5a (C5a). In a mouse model of diabetes, a high resistant starch fiber diet maintained gut barrier integrity and decreased severity of kidney injury via suppression of complement.

While plastic deformation in this alloy is usually dominated by dislocation slip and deformation twinning, our in situ straining transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments reveal a crystalline-to-amorphous phase transformation in an ultrafine-grained Cantor alloy. We find that the crack-tip structural evolution involves a sequence of formation of the crystalline, lamellar, spotted, and amorphous patterns, which represent different proportions and organizations of the crystalline and amorphous phases. Such solid-state amorphization stems from both the high lattice friction and high grain boundary resistance to dislocation glide in ultrafine-grained microstructures. The resulting increase of crack-tip dislocation densities promotes the buildup of high stresses for triggering the crystalline-to-amorphous transformation. We also observe the formation of amorphous nanobridges in the crack wake. These amorphization processes dissipate strain energies, thereby providing effective toughening mechanisms for HEAs.},

In the three frontal areas studied, most spatially tuned neurons reflected either where attention was allocated or the planned saccade. Neurons modulated by both covert attention and the motor plan were in the minority. Such dual-purpose neurons were especially rare in premotor and prefrontal cortex but were more common just rostral to the arcuate sulcus. The existence of neurons that indicate where the monkey was attending but not its movement goal runs counter to the idea that the control of spatial attention is entirely reliant on the neuronal circuits underlying motor planning. Rather, the presence of separate neuronal populations for each cognitive process suggests that endogenous attention is under flexible control and can be dissociated from motor intention.},

Range adaptation can be seen as the result of an adaptive coding process aiming at increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. However, this hypothesis leads to a counterintuitive prediction: Decreasing task difficulty should increase range adaptation and, consequently, extrapolation errors. Here, we tested the paradoxical relation between range adaptation and performance in a large sample of participants performing variants of an RL task, where we manipulated task difficulty. Results confirmed that range adaptation induces systematic extrapolation errors and is stronger when decreasing task difficulty. Last, we propose a range-adapting model and show that it is able to parsimoniously capture all the behavioral results.},

The tissue-specific expression inferred from the blood transcriptome is almost as good as the actual measured tissue expression in predicting disease state for six different complex disorders, including hypertension and type 2 diabetes, substantially surpassing the blood transcriptome.

On the other hand, geological constraints firmly establish a severe carbon deficit in Earth, requiring the destruction of inherited carbonaceous organics in the majority of its building blocks. The carbon-poor nature of Earth thus implies carbon loss in its precursor material through sublimation within the first million years.},

One fundamental riddle is how these polymer additives interact with the eddies of different spatial scales existing in the turbulent flow and, in turn, alter the turbulence energy transfer. Here, we show how turbulent kinetic energy is transferred through different scales in the presence of the polymer additives. In particular, we observed experimentally the emerging of a previously unidentified scaling range, referred to as the elastic range, where increasing amount of energy is transferred by the elasticity of the polymers. In addition, the existence of the elastic range prescribes the scaling of high-order velocity statistics. Our findings have important implications to many turbulence systems, such as turbulence in plasmas or superfluids where interaction between turbulent eddies and other nonlinear physical mechanisms are often involved.},

However, the application of gene therapy to complex polygenic conditions has been limited. Down-regulation or dysfunction of receptor expression in the disease state or in the presence of excess ligand has been shown to compromise therapeutic efficacy. Here, we offer evidence that combined overexpression of both brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B, is more effective in stimulating axonal transport than either receptor administration or ligand administration alone. We also show efficacy in experimental glaucoma and humanized tauopathy models. Simultaneous administration of a ligand and its receptor by a single gene therapy vector overcomes several problems relating to ligand deficiency and receptor down-regulation that may be relevant to multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

  abstract     = {The interleukin-7 (IL-7) signaling pathway plays an important role in regulation of T cell function and survival. We detected overexpression of IL-7 in lesional skin from both humans and C3H/HeJ mice with alopecia areata (AA), a T cell–mediated autoimmune disease of the hair follicle. We found that exogenous IL-7 accelerated the onset of AA by augmenting the expansion of alopecic T cells. Conversely, blockade of IL-7 stopped the progression of AA and reversed early AA in C3H/HeJ mice. Mechanistically, we observed that IL-7Rα blockade substantially reduced the total number of most T cell subsets, but relative sparing of regulatory T cells (T regs ). We postulated that short-term anti–IL-7Rα treatment in combination with a low dose of T reg -tropic cytokines might improve therapeutic efficacy in AA. We demonstrated that short-term IL-7Rα blockade in combination with low doses of T reg -tropic cytokines enhanced therapeutic effects in the treatment of AA, and invite further clinical investigation.},

Transcriptional analyses in up to 300 patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) identified potential therapeutic targets mediating chronic inflammation. We found that ChemR23, a GPCR targeted by resolvin E1, is overexpressed in inflamed colon tissues of severe IBD patients unresponsive to anti-TNFα or anti-α4β7 therapies and associated with significant mucosal neutrophil accumulation. We also identified an anti-ChemR23 agonist antibody that induces receptor signaling, promotes macrophage efferocytosis, and reduces neutrophil apoptosis at the site of inflammation. This ChemR23 mAb accelerated acute inflammation resolution and triggered resolution in ongoing chronic colitis models, with a significant decrease in tissue lesions, fibrosis and inflammation-driven tumors. Our findings suggest that failure of current IBD therapies may be associated with neutrophil infiltration and that ChemR23 is a promising therapeutic target for chronic inflammation.},

  abstract     = {Humans and mice with natural red hair have elevated basal pain thresholds and an increased sensitivity to opioid analgesics. We investigated the mechanisms responsible for higher nociceptive thresholds in red-haired mice resulting from a loss of melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) function and found that the increased thresholds are melanocyte dependent but melanin independent. MC1R loss of function decreases melanocytic proopiomelanocortin transcription and systemic melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) levels in the plasma of red-haired ( Mc1r e/e ) mice. Decreased peripheral α-MSH derepresses the central opioid tone mediated by the opioid receptor OPRM1, resulting in increased nociceptive thresholds. We identified MC4R as the MSH-responsive receptor that opposes OPRM1 signaling and the periaqueductal gray area in the brainstem as a central area of opioid/melanocortin antagonism. This work highlights the physiologic role of melanocytic MC1R and circulating melanocortins in the regulation of nociception and provides a mechanistic framework for altered opioid signaling and pain sensitivity in red-haired individuals.},

Here, we describe condensation spherules found on top of Walnumfjellet in the Sør Rondane Mountains, Antarctica. Affinities with similar spherules found in EPICA Dome C and Dome Fuji ice cores suggest that these particles were produced during a single-asteroid impact ca. 430 thousand years (ka) ago. The lack of a confirmed crater on the Antarctic ice sheet and geochemical and 18 O-poor oxygen isotope signatures allow us to hypothesize that the impact particles result from a touchdown event, in which a projectile vapor jet interacts with the Antarctic ice sheet. Numerical models support a touchdown scenario. This study has implications for the identification and inventory of large cosmic events on Earth.},

Virtually nothing is known about the physiological pressures that would have initially favored osteocytic over anosteocytic bone. We apply focused ion beam–scanning electron microscopy tomography combined with machine learning for cell detection and segmentation to image fossil cell spaces. Novel three-dimensional high-resolution images reveal areas of low density around osteocyte lacunae and their canaliculi in osteostracan bone. This provides evidence for demineralization that would have occurred in vivo as part of osteocytic osteolysis, a mechanism of mineral homeostasis, supporting the hypothesis that a physiological demand for phosphorus was the principal driver in the initial evolution of osteocytic bone.},

  abstract     = {Huntington disease (HD) damages the corticostriatal circuitry in large part by impairing transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We hypothesized that improving vesicular transport of BDNF could slow or prevent disease progression. We therefore performed selective proteomic analysis of vesicles transported within corticostriatal projecting neurons followed by in silico screening and identified palmitoylation as a pathway that could restore defective huntingtin-dependent trafficking. Using a synchronized trafficking assay and an HD network-on-a-chip, we found that increasing brain palmitoylation via ML348, which inhibits the palmitate-removing enzyme acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1), restores axonal transport, synapse homeostasis, and survival signaling to wild-type levels without toxicity. In human HD induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cortical neurons, ML348 increased BDNF trafficking. In HD knock-in mice, it efficiently crossed the blood-brain barrier to restore palmitoylation levels and reverse neuropathology, locomotor deficits, and anxio-depressive behaviors. APT1 and its inhibitor ML348 thus hold therapeutic interest for HD.},

Limited understanding of the cellular mechanisms of CIAS hampers development of more effective treatments. We found that in subchronic phencyclidine (scPCP)–treated mice, an animal model that mimics CIAS, the reversal potential of GABA A currents in pyramidal neurons of the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (ILC) shifts from hyperpolarizing to depolarizing, the result of increased expression of the chloride transporter NKCC1. Further, we found that in scPCP mice, the NKCC1 antagonist bumetanide normalizes GABA A current polarity ex vivo and improves performance in multiple cognitive tasks in vivo. This behavioral effect was mimicked by selective, bilateral, NKCC1 knockdown in the ILC. Thus, we show that depolarizing GABA A currents in the ILC contributes to cognitive impairments in scPCP mice and suggest that bumetanide, an FDA-approved drug, has potential to treat or prevent CIAS and other components of the schizophrenia syndrome.},

Here, we identify a two-step metabolic pathway to cope with HHP stress in a piezotolerant bacterium. Myroides profundi D25 T , obtained from a deep-sea sediment, can take up trimethylamine (TMA) through a previously unidentified TMA transporter, TmaT, and oxidize intracellular TMA into trimethylamine N -oxide (TMAO) by a TMA monooxygenase, Mp Tmm. The produced TMAO is accumulated in the cell, functioning as a piezolyte, improving both growth and survival at HHP. The function of the TmaT- Mp Tmm pathway was further confirmed by introducing it into Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis . Encoded TmaT-like and Mp Tmm-like sequences extensively exist in marine metagenomes, and other marine Bacteroidetes bacteria containing genes encoding TmaT-like and Mp Tmm-like proteins also have improved HHP tolerance in the presence of TMA, implying the universality of this HHP tolerance strategy in marine Bacteroidetes.},

The additional conjugation of the Angiopep-2 targeting moiety enhanced nanoconjugate passage through the blood-brain barrier and modulated brain distribution with nanoconjugate accumulation in neurogenic areas, including the olfactory bulb. Nanoconjugate treatment effectively reduced neurotoxic β amyloid aggregate levels and rescued impairments to olfactory memory and object recognition in APP/PS1 transgenic AD model mice.

Here, we report a high-performance amphiphilic Ti PTL suitable for both FC and EC modes, thanks to alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic channels. To fabricate the amphiphilic PTL, we used a shadow mask patterning process using ultrathin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) brush as a hydrophobic surface modifier, which can change the Ti PTL’s surface polarity without decreasing its electrical conductivity. Consequently, performance improved by 4.3 times in FC (@ 0.6 V) and 1.9 times in EC (@ 1.8 V) from amphiphilic PTL.

More recent geodetic data indicate that this region is weakly coupled, and the geologic record shows little evidence of past large events. From July to October 2020, a series of earthquakes occurred in this region, raising the possibility of greater coupling. The initial M w 7.8 thrust faulting earthquake straddled the eastern edge of the Shumagin Gap and was followed by an M w 7.6 strike-slip earthquake within the Shumagin Gap. Stress modeling indicates that this strike-slip earthquake is in fact favored if the Shumagin Gap has low coupling, whereas a highly coupled Shumagin Gap inhibits that type and location of earthquake. The initial thrust earthquake and its afterslip enhanced the strike-slip loading within the subducting slab, helping to trigger the October event.},

  abstract     = {A dual-phase Cr 2 AlC material was synthesized using magnetron sputtering at a temperature of 648 K. A stoichiometric and nanocrystalline MAX phase matrix was observed along with the presence of spherical-shaped amorphous nano-zones as a secondary phase. The irradiation resistance of the material was assessed using a 300-keV Xe ion beam in situ within a transmission electron microscope up to 40 displacements per atom at 623 K: a condition that extrapolates the harmful environments of future fusion and fission nuclear reactors. At the maximum dose investigated, complete amorphization was not observed. Scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive x-ray revealed an association between swelling due to inert gas bubble nucleation and growth and radiation-induced segregation and clustering. Counterintuitively, the findings suggest that preexisting amorphous nano-zones can be beneficial to Cr 2 AlC MAX phase under extreme environments.},

  abstract     = {Teeth are composed of many tissues, covered by an inflexible and obdurate enamel. Unlike most other tissues, teeth become extremely cold sensitive when inflamed. The mechanisms of this cold sensation are not understood. Here, we clarify the molecular and cellular components of the dental cold sensing system and show that sensory transduction of cold stimuli in teeth requires odontoblasts. TRPC5 is a cold sensor in healthy teeth and, with TRPA1, is sufficient for cold sensing. The odontoblast appears as the direct site of TRPC5 cold transduction and provides a mechanism for prolonged cold sensing via TRPC5’s relative sensitivity to intracellular calcium and lack of desensitization. Our data provide concrete functional evidence that equipping odontoblasts with the cold-sensor TRPC5 expands traditional odontoblast functions and renders it a previously unknown integral cellular component of the dental cold sensing system.},

The structural tuning of first and second coordination spheres of complexes provides versatile strategies for optimizing the activities of heterogeneous molecular catalysts and appropriate model systems for investigating the mechanism of structural variations on the activity. In this review, we first discuss the variation of first spheres by tuning ligated atoms; afterward, the structural tuning of second spheres by appending adjacent metal centers, pendant groups, electron withdrawing/donating, and conjugating moieties on the ligands is elaborated. Overall, these structural tuning resulted in different impacts on the geometric and electronic configurations of complexes, and the improved activity is achieved through tuning the stability of chemisorbed reactants and the redox behaviors of immobilized complexes.},

To integrate such advantages of pen drawing in fabricating 3D objects, we developed a 3D fabrication technology that can directly transform pen-drawn 2D precursors into 3D geometries. 2D-to-3D transformation of pen drawings is facilitated by surface tension–driven capillary peeling and floating of dried ink film when the drawing is dipped into an aqueous monomer solution. Selective control of the floating and anchoring parts of a 2D precursor allowed the 2D drawing to transform into the designed 3D structure. The transformed 3D geometry can then be fixed by structural reinforcement using surface-initiated polymerization. By transforming simple pen-drawn 2D structures into complex 3D structures, our approach enables freestyle rapid prototyping via pen drawing, as well as mass production of 3D objects via roll-to-roll processing.},

Loss of 2′- O -methylation in Ftsj1 KO mouse selectively reduced the steady-state level of tRNA Phe in the brain, resulting in a slow decoding at Phe codons. Ribosome profiling showed that translation efficiency is significantly reduced in a subset of genes that need to be efficiently translated to support synaptic organization and functions. Ftsj1 KO mice display immature synaptic morphology and aberrant synaptic plasticity, which are associated with anxiety-like and memory deficits.

In magnetic materials, an anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) is possible in a zero magnetic field. We report a colossal ANE in the ferromagnetic metal UCo 0.8 Ru 0.2 Al, reaching 23 microvolts per kelvin. Uranium’s 5 f electrons provide strong electronic correlations that lead to narrow bands, a known route to producing a large thermoelectric response. In addition, uranium’s strong spin-orbit coupling produces an intrinsic transverse response in this material due to the Berry curvature associated with the relativistic electronic structure. Theoretical calculations show that in UCo 0.8 Ru 0.2 Al at least 148 Weyl nodes, and two nodal lines, exist within 60 millielectron volt of the Fermi level. This work demonstrates that magnetic actinide materials can host strong Nernst and Hall responses due to their combined correlated and topological nature.},

We demonstrate the deterministic control of electron and hole tunneling in interface-engineered Pt/BaTiO 3 /La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 ferroelectric tunnel junctions by reversal of tunneling electroresistance.

Here, we used protein correlation profiling to test for variability in apparent mass among thousands of orthologous proteins isolated from diverse species and cell types. Variants in protein complex size were unexpectedly common, in some cases appearing after relatively recent whole-genome duplications or an allopolyploidy event. In other instances, variants such as those in the carbonic anhydrase orthologous group reflected the neofunctionalization of ancient paralogs that have been preserved in extant species.

The experimental data and density functional theory simulations proved that the reactive oxygen species generated during dopamine polymerization catalyze the nucleophilic reactions of the COF, thus facilitating the counter-diffusion growth of thin COF layers. Notably, dopamine can eliminate the defects in the stacked COF by soldering the COF crystals, fortifying the mechanical properties of the ultrathin COF membranes.

Despite important variability in our dataset, we found latitudinal differences in the effect of litter functional diversity on decomposition, which we explained as evolutionary adaptations of litter-consuming detritivores to resource availability. Specifically, a balanced diet effect appears to operate at lower latitudes versus a resource concentration effect at higher latitudes.

The first and rate-limiting step of glutaminolysis involves the generation of glutamate from glutamine, catalyzed by glutaminase-1 (GLS1). Shortages of glutamine result in reductions in GLS1, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully known. Here, we characterize a long noncoding RNA, GIRGL (glutamine insufficiency regulator of glutaminase lncRNA), that is induced upon glutamine starvation. Manipulating GIRGL revealed a relationship between its expression and the translational suppression of GLS1. Cellular GIRGL levels are balanced by a combination of transactivation by c-JUN together with negative stability regulation via HuR/Ago2. Increased levels of GIRGL in the absence of glutamine drive formation of a complex between dimers of CAPRIN1 and GLS1 mRNA, serving to promote liquid-liquid phase separation of CAPRIN1 and inducing stress granule formation. Suppressing GLS1 mRNA translation enables cancer cells to survive under prolonged glutamine deprivation stress.},

  abstract     = {Calcium signaling regulated by the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) controls key life cycle transitions in the malaria parasite. However, how calcium is mobilized from intracellular stores in the absence of canonical calcium channels in Plasmodium is unknown. Here, we identify a multipass membrane protein, ICM1, with homology to transporters and calcium channels that is tightly associated with PKG in both asexual blood stages and transmission stages. Phosphoproteomic analyses reveal multiple ICM1 phosphorylation events dependent on PKG activity. Stage-specific depletion of Plasmodium berghei ICM1 prevents gametogenesis due to a block in intracellular calcium mobilization, while conditional loss of Plasmodium falciparum ICM1 is detrimental for the parasite resulting in severely reduced calcium mobilization, defective egress, and lack of invasion. Our findings suggest that ICM1 is a key missing link in transducing PKG-dependent signals and provide previously unknown insights into atypical calcium homeostasis in malaria parasites essential for pathology and disease transmission.},

  abstract     = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of various cellular processes and have been implicated in cancer. Previously, we reported the discovery of several dysregulated circRNAs including circPABPC1 (polyadenylate-binding protein 1) in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although their roles in HCC development remained unclear. Here, we show that circPABPC1 is preferentially lost in tumor cells from clinical samples and inhibits both intrahepatic and distant metastases in a mouse xenograft model. This tumor-suppressive function of circPABPC1 can be attributed to its inhibition of cell adhesion and migration through down-regulating a key member of the integrin family, ITGB1 (β 1 integrin). Mass spectrometry and biochemical evidence demonstrate that circPABPC1 directly links ITGB1 to the 26S proteasome for degradation in a ubiquitination-independent manner. Our data have revealed an uncanonical route for integrin turnover and a previously unidentified mode of action for circRNAs in HCC that can be harnessed for anticancer treatment.},

To address these questions, we produced genome-wide data for 111 ancient individuals retrieved from 39 archaeological sites from the first millennia BCE and CE across the Central Asian Steppe. We uncovered major admixture events in the Late Bronze Age forming the genetic substratum for two main Iron Age gene-pools emerging around the Altai and the Urals respectively. Their demise was mirrored by new genetic turnovers, linked to the spread of the eastern nomad empires in the first centuries CE. Compared to the high genetic heterogeneity of the past, the homogenization of the present-day Kazakhs gene pool is notable, likely a result of 400 years of strict exogamous social rules.},

Here, we develop a translational approach for exploiting this “lymphangiogenic potentiation” of immunotherapy in a cancer vaccine using lethally irradiated tumor cells overexpressing vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and topical adjuvants. Our “VEGFC vax” induced extensive local lymphangiogenesis and promoted stronger T cell activation in both the intradermal vaccine site and draining lymph nodes, resulting in higher frequencies of antigen-specific T cells present systemically than control vaccines. In mouse melanoma models, VEGFC vax elicited potent tumor-specific T cell immunity and provided effective tumor control and long-term immunological memory. Together, these data introduce the potential of lymphangiogenesis induction as a novel immunotherapeutic strategy to consider in cancer vaccine design.},

We studied how sensory information can be contextualized, by examining light-evoked locomotor responsiveness of Drosophila relative to time of day. We found that light elicits an acute increase in locomotion (startle) that is modulated in a time-of-day–dependent manner: Startle is potentiated during the nighttime, when light is unexpected, but is suppressed during the daytime. The internal daytime-nighttime context is generated by two interconnected and functionally opposing populations of circadian neurons—LNvs generating the daytime state and DN1as generating the nighttime state. Switching between the two states requires daily remodeling of LNv and DN1a axons such that the maximum presynaptic area in one population coincides with the minimum in the other. We propose that a dynamic model of environmental light resides in the shifting connectivities of the LNv-DN1a circuit, which helps animals evaluate ongoing conditions and choose a behavioral response.},

  abstract     = {Aerosols still present the largest uncertainty in estimating anthropogenic radiative forcing. Cloud processing is potentially important for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, a major aerosol component: however, laboratory experiments fail to mimic this process under atmospherically relevant conditions. We developed a wetted-wall flow reactor to simulate aqueous-phase processing of isoprene oxidation products (iOP) in cloud droplets. We find that 50 to 70\% (in moles) of iOP partition into the aqueous cloud phase, where they rapidly react with OH radicals, producing SOA with a molar yield of 0.45 after cloud droplet evaporation. Integrating our experimental results into a global model, we show that clouds effectively boost the amount of SOA. We conclude that, on a global scale, cloud processing of iOP produces 6.9 Tg of SOA per year or approximately 20\% of the total biogenic SOA burden and is the main source of SOA in the mid-troposphere (4 to 6 km).},

Mice infected with parasite strains that fail to sequester in WAT displayed reduced leptin production and protection from ECM. WAT sequestration and leptin induction were lost in CD36KO mice; however, ECM susceptibility revealed sexual dimorphism. Adipocyte leptin was regulated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and blocked by rapamycin. In humans, although Plasmodium falciparum infection did not increase circulating leptin levels, iRBC sequestration, tissue leptin production, and mTORC1 activity were positively correlated with CM in pediatric postmortem WAT. These data identify WAT sequestration as a trigger for leptin production with potential implications for pathogenesis of malaria infection, prognosis, and treatment.},

Introduction of an albumin-binding moiety extended the serum half-life of the engineered Alphabody to therapeutically relevant levels, and administration thereof in mouse tumor xenografts based on myeloma cell lines reduced tumor burden. Crystal structures of such a designed Alphabody in complex with MCL-1 and serum albumin provided the structural blueprint of the applied design principles.

The WO X /WSe 2 hetero-bilayer formed by monolithic oxidation of the WSe 2 bilayer exhibited the type I band alignment, facilitating as a building block for MQWs. A superlinear enhancement of photoluminescence with increasing the number of QWs was achieved. Furthermore, quantum-confined radiative recombination in MQWs was verified by a large exciton binding energy of 193 meV and a short exciton lifetime of 170 ps.

Exploiting the aggregative properties of platelets and high photothermal capacity, N+R@PLTs functioned as an arsenal by targeting defective tumor vascular endothelial cells, accumulating in a positive feedback aggregation cascade at sites of acute vascular damage induced by N-generated local hyperthermia, and subsequently secreting nanosized proplatelets (nPLTs) to transport active components to deep tumor tissue. The immunostimulator augmented the immunogenicity of antigens released from ablated tumors, inducing a stronger immunological response to attack residual, metastatic, and recurrent tumors. Following activation by low-power near-infrared light irradiation, the photothermal and immunological components synergistically provide exceptionally high therapeutic efficacy across nine murine models that mimicked a range of clinical requirements, and, most notably, a sophisticated model based on humanized mouse and patient-derived tumor xenograft.},

Highly voided metallic nanostructures with ordered vacancies are however energetically high lying and very difficult to synthesize. Here, we report a chemical method for synthesis of hierarchical Rh nanostructures (Rh NSs) composed of ultrathin nanosheets, composed of hexagonal close-packed structure embedded with nanodomains that adopt a vacated Barlow packing with ordered vacancies. The obtained Rh NSs exhibit remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Theoretical calculations reveal that the exceptional electrocatalytic performance of Rh NSs originates from their unique vacancy structures, which facilitate the adsorption and dissociation of H 2 O in the HER.},

  abstract     = {Polymicrogyria is a common malformation of cortical development whose etiology remains elusive. We conducted whole-exome sequencing for 124 patients with polymicrogyria and identified de novo ATP1A3 variants in eight patients. Mutated ATP1A3 causes functional brain diseases, including alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC), rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism (RDP), and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic nerve atrophy, and sensorineural deafness (CAPOS). However, our patients showed no clinical features of AHC, RDP, or CAPOS and had a completely different phenotype: a severe form of polymicrogyria with epilepsy and developmental delay. Detected variants had different locations in ATP1A3 and different functional properties compared with AHC-, RDP-, or CAPOS-associated variants. In the developing cerebral cortex of mice, radial neuronal migration was impaired in neurons overexpressing the ATP1A3 variant of the most severe patients, suggesting that this variant is involved in cortical malformation pathogenesis. We propose a previously unidentified category of polymicrogyria associated with ATP1A3 abnormalities.},

However, none of them have developed up to human-level translational studies. Here, we report a sticky polysaccharide that effectively promotes hemostasis from animal bleeding models to first-in-human hepatectomy. We found that the hemostatic material instantly generates a barrier layer that seals hemorrhaging sites. The barrier is created within a few seconds by in situ interactions with abundant plasma proteins. Therefore, as long as patient blood contains proper levels of plasma proteins, hemostasis should always occur even in coagulopathic conditions. To date, insufficient tools have been developed to arrest coagulopathic bleedings originated from genetic disorders, chronic diseases, or surgical settings such as organ transplantations. Mussel-inspired adhesion chemistry described here provides a useful alternative to the use of fibrin glues up to a human-level biomedical application.},

Although straightforward to implement for studying stable macromolecular complexes, using it to locate short-lived structures and events can be impractical. A combination of live-cell microscopy, correlative light and electron microscopy, and cryo-ET will alleviate this issue. We developed a workflow combining the three to study the ubiquitous and dynamic process of shedding in response to plasma membrane damage in HeLa cells. We found filopodia-like protrusions enriched at damage sites and acting as scaffolds for shedding, which involves F-actin dynamics, myosin-1a, and vacuolar protein sorting 4B (a component of the ‘endosomal sorting complex required for transport’ machinery). Overall, shedding is more complex than current models of vesiculation from flat membranes. Its similarities to constitutive shedding in enterocytes argue for a conserved mechanism. Our workflow can also be adapted to study other damage response pathways and dynamic cellular events.},

Then, we conceived an inspired strategy to combat the tumor drug resistance by exploiting the increased intracellular hypoxia that occurs as the cells develop drug resistance. Here, we constructed a hypoxia-amplifying DNA repair–inhibiting liposomal nanomedicine (denoted as HYDRI NM), which is formulated from a platinum(IV) prodrug as a building block and payloads of glucose oxidase (GOx) and hypoxia-activatable tirapazamine (TPZ). In studies on clinically relevant models, including patient-derived organoids and patient-derived xenograft tumors, the HYDRI NM is able to effectively suppress the growth of cisplatin-resistant tumors.

Here, we identified protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) as a direct binding partner of cGAS, and it catalyzed the arginine symmetrical dimethylation of cGAS at the Arg 124 residue. Further investigation demonstrated that methylation of cGAS by PRMT5 attenuated cGAS-mediated antiviral immune response by blocking the DNA binding ability of cGAS. Oral administration of PRMT5 inhibitors significantly protected mice from HSV-1 infection and prolonged the survival time of these infected mice. Therefore, our findings revealed an essential regulatory effect of PRMT5 on cGAS-mediated antiviral immune response and provided a promising potential antiviral strategy by modulating PRMT5.},

Antigen-specific B cells and antiviral antibodies were essential for the accelerated control of LCMV Cl13 infection following IFNAR1 blockade. IFNAR1 signaling in NK cells promoted NK cell function and general killing of antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells.

To address the unique cellular and temporal context of hiPSC differentiation, we perform a longitudinal comparison of the transcriptomic profiles of three hiPSC lines that display differential myogenic specification, one robust and two blunted. We detail temporal differences in mechanisms that lead to robust myogenic specification. We show gene expression signatures of putative cell subpopulations and extracellular matrix components that may support myogenesis. Furthermore, we show that targeted knockdown of ZIC3 at the outset of differentiation leads to improved myogenic specification in blunted hiPSC lines. Our study suggests that β-catenin transcriptional cofactors mediate cross-talk between multiple cellular processes and exogenous cues to facilitate specification of hiPSCs to mesoderm lineage, leading to robust myogenesis.},

These data provide the first demonstration of a pathological role for the vascular cyclooxygenase-1 pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

A two-dimensional (2D) perfect kagome lattice, whose geometrical frustration is a key to realizing quantum spin liquids, has been formed in the π − d conjugated 2D MOF [Cu 3 (C 6 S 6 )] n (Cu-BHT). The recent discovery of its superconductivity with a critical temperature T c of 0.25 kelvin raises fundamental questions about the nature of electron pairing.

A nonexponential temperature dependence of superfluid density is observed, indicating the possible presence of superconducting gap nodes. The magnitude of superfluid density is much smaller than those in conventional superconductors and follows the Uemura’s relation of strongly correlated superconductors. These results imply that the unconventional superconductivity in Cu-BHT originates from electron correlations related to spin fluctuations of kagome lattice.},

  abstract     = {Multiphoton fluorescence microscopy is a powerful technique for deep-tissue observation of living cells. In particular, three-photon microscopy is highly beneficial for deep-tissue imaging because of the long excitation wavelength and the high nonlinear confinement in living tissues. Because of the large spectral separation of fluorophores of different color, multicolor three-photon imaging typically requires multiple excitation wavelengths. Here, we report a new three-photon excitation scheme: excitation to a higher-energy electronic excited state instead of the conventional excitation to the lowest-energy excited state, enabling multicolor three-photon fluorescence imaging with deep-tissue penetration in the living mouse brain using single-wavelength excitation. We further demonstrate that our excitation method results in ≥10-fold signal enhancement for some of the common red fluorescent molecules. The multicolor imaging capability and the possibility of enhanced three-photon excitation cross section will open new opportunities for life science applications of three-photon microscopy.},

We succeeded in inducing the direct 3D-2D structural phase transition in (Pb 1− x Sn x )Se alloy epitaxial films by using a nonequilibrium growth technique. Reversible giant electronic property change was attained at x ~ 0.5 originating in the abrupt band structure switch from gapless Dirac-like state to semiconducting state.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer frequently metastasizes to bone, causing osteolytic lesions. However, how factors secreted by primary tumors affect the bone microenvironment before the osteolytic phase of metastatic tumor growth remains unclear. Understanding these changes is critical as they may regulate metastatic dissemination and progression. To mimic premetastatic bone adaptation, immunocompromised mice were injected with MDA-MB-231–conditioned medium [tumor-conditioned media (TCM)]. Subsequently, the bones of these mice were subjected to multiscale, correlative analysis including RNA sequencing, histology, micro–computed tomography, x-ray scattering analysis, and Raman imaging. In contrast to overt metastasis causing osteolysis, TCM treatment induced new bone formation that was characterized by increased mineral apposition rate relative to control bones, altered bone quality with less matrix and more carbonate substitution, and the deposition of disoriented mineral near the growth plate. Our study suggests that breast cancer–secreted factors may promote perturbed bone growth before metastasis, which could affect initial seeding of tumor cells.},

In mice, the 24-meric RBD-ferritin SApNP elicited a more potent neutralizing antibody (NAb) response than the RBD alone and the spike with two stabilizing proline mutations in S2 (S2P). S2GΔHR2 elicited twofold higher NAb titers than S2P, while S2GΔHR2 SApNPs derived from multilayered E2p and I3-01v9 60-mers elicited up to 10-fold higher NAb titers.

Overall figures of merit indicate that the data of both radiation sources are of equivalent quality. For both proteins, reasonable data statistics can be obtained with approximately 5000 room-temperature diffraction images irrespective of the radiation source. The direct comparability of SSX and SFX data indicates that the quality of diffraction data obtained from these samples is linked to the properties of the crystals rather than to the radiation source. Therefore, for other systems with similar properties, time-resolved experiments can be conducted at the radiation source that best matches the desired time resolution.},

We demonstrate here an approach to creating an inorganic, silica-based replica of 3D periodic DNA-NP structures with different lattice symmetries. The created ordered nanomaterials, through the precise 3D mineralization, maintain the spatial topology of connections between NPs by DNA struts and exhibit a controllable degree of the porosity. The formed silicated DNA-NP lattices exhibit excellent resiliency. They are stable when exposed to extreme temperatures (&gt;1000°C), pressures (8 GPa), and harsh radiation conditions and can be processed by the conventional nanolithography methods. The presented approach allows the use of a DNA assembly strategy to create organized nanomaterials for a broad range of operational conditions.},

These are primarily related to cardiovascular, bone growth, vision, hearing, and circadian functions. Among them, the giraffe FGFRL1 gene is an outlier with seven unique amino acid substitutions not found in any other ruminant. Gene-edited mice with the giraffe-type FGFRL1 show exceptional hypertension resistance and higher bone mineral density, both of which are tightly connected with giraffe adaptations to high stature. Our results facilitate a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism underpinning distinct giraffe traits, and may provide insights into the study of hypertension in humans.},

Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate two regimes, using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) or a Raman transition, for all-optical isolation with warm atoms. We achieve an isolation of 22.52 ± 0.10 dB and an insertion loss of about 1.95 dB for a genuine single photon, with bandwidth up to hundreds of megahertz. The Raman regime realized in the same experimental setup enables us to achieve high isolation and low insertion loss for coherent optical fields with reversed isolation direction. These realizations of single-photon isolation and coherent light isolation at room temperature are promising for simpler reconfiguration of high-speed classical and quantum information processing.},

Here, we show the link between individual anticipation and emergent pattern formation through our experiments of lane formation, where unidirectional lanes are spontaneously formed in bidirectional pedestrian flows. Manipulating the anticipatory abilities of some of the pedestrians by distracting them visually delayed the collective pattern formation. Moreover, both the distracted pedestrians and the nondistracted ones had difficulties avoiding collisions while navigating. These results imply that avoidance maneuvers are normally a cooperative process and that mutual anticipation between pedestrians facilitates efficient pattern formation.

Heteroplasmic variants that impair mitochondrial capacity cause disease, and the state of heteroplasmy itself is deleterious. However, mitochondrial heteroplasmy may provide an intermediate state in the emergence of novel mitochondrial haplogroups. We used genome-wide genotyping data from 982, 072 European ancestry individuals to evaluate variation in mitochondrial heteroplasmy and to identify the regions of the nuclear genome that affect it. Age, sex, and mitochondrial haplogroup were associated with the extent of heteroplasmy. GWAS identified 20 loci for heteroplasmy that exceeded genome-wide significance. This included a region overlapping mitochondrial transcription factor A ( TFAM ), which has multiple roles in mtDNA packaging, replication, and transcription.

The technology, termed catalytic amplification by transition-state molecular switch (CATCH), leverages DNA-enzyme hybrid complexes to form a molecular switch. By ratiometric tuning of its constituents, the multicomponent molecular switch is prepared in a hyperresponsive state—the transition state—that can be readily activated upon the binding of sparse RNA targets to turn on substantial enzymatic activity. CATCH thus achieves superior performance (~8 RNA copies/μl), direct fluorescence detection that bypasses all steps of PCR (&lt;1 hour at room temperature), and versatile implementation (high-throughput 96-well format and portable microfluidic assay).

  abstract     = {Tumor microenvironment–responsive therapy has enormous application potential in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The glutathione (GSH) level has been shown to be significantly increased in tumor tissues. Thus, GSH can be used as an effective endogenous molecule for diagnosis and tumor microenvironment–activated therapy. In this study, we prepared a tumor microenvironment–induced, absorption spectrum red-shifted, iron-copper co-doped polyaniline nanoparticle (Fe-Cu@PANI). The Cu(II) in this nanoparticle can undergo a redox reaction with GSH in tumors. The redox reaction induces a red shift in the absorption spectrum of the Fe-Cu@PANI nanoparticles from the visible to the near-infrared region accompanying with the etching of this nanoparticle, which simultaneously activates tumor photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy, thereby improving the accuracy of in vivo tumor imaging and the efficiency of photothermal therapy. The nanoparticle prepared in this study has broad application prospects in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.},

However, the roles of individual muscles in these changes and their evolutionary timings remain obscure. Using 13 three-dimensional musculoskeletal models of the hindlimbs of bird-line archosaurs, we quantify how the moment arms (i.e., leverages) of 35 locomotor muscles evolved. Our results support two hypotheses: From early theropod dinosaurs to birds, knee flexors’ moment arms decreased relative to knee extensors’, and medial long-axis rotator moment arms for the hip increased (trading off with decreased hip abductor moment arms). Our results reveal how, from the Triassic Period, bipedal theropod dinosaurs gradually modified their hindlimb form and function, shifting more from hip-based to knee-based locomotion and hip-abductor to hip-rotator balancing mechanisms inherited by birds. Yet, we also discover unexpected ancestral specializations in larger Jurassic theropods, lost later in the bird-line, complicating the paradigm of gradual transformation.},

Recent molecular phylogenetic studies have not consistently supported deuterostome monophyly. Here, we compare support for Protostomia and Deuterostomia using multiple, independent phylogenomic datasets. As expected, Protostomia is always strongly supported, especially by longer and higher-quality genes. Support for Deuterostomia, however, is always equivocal and barely higher than support for paraphyletic alternatives. Conditions that cause tree reconstruction errors—inadequate models, short internal branches, faster evolving genes, and unequal branch lengths—coincide with support for monophyletic deuterostomes. Simulation experiments show that support for Deuterostomia could be explained by systematic error. The branch between bilaterian and deuterostome common ancestors is, at best, very short, supporting the idea that the bilaterian ancestor may have been deuterostome-like. Our findings have important implications for the understanding of early animal evolution.},

  abstract     = {What covalent modifications control the temporal ubiquitination of ERα and hence the duration of its transcriptional activity remain poorly understood. We show that GREB1, an ERα-inducible enzyme, catalyzes O-GlcNAcylation of ERα at residues T553/S554, which stabilizes ERα protein by inhibiting association with the ubiquitin ligase ZNF598. Loss of GREB1-mediated glycosylation of ERα results in reduced cellular ERα levels and insensitivity to estrogen. Higher GREB1 expression in ERα +ve breast cancer is associated with greater survival in response to tamoxifen, an ERα agonist. Mice lacking Greb1 exhibit growth and fertility defects reminiscent of phenotypes in ERα-null mice. In summary, this study identifies GREB1, a protein with an evolutionarily conserved domain related to DNA-modifying glycosyltransferases of bacteriophages and kinetoplastids, as the first inducible and the only other (apart from OGT) O-GlcNAc glycosyltransferase in mammalian cytoplasm and ERα as its first substrate.},

Following a single administration of adeno-associated virus (AAV), either locally into the hippocampus or intravenously to enable whole-brain transduction, we selectively reduced tau messenger RNA and protein by 50 to 80\% out to 11 months, the longest time point studied. Sustained tau lowering was achieved without detectable off-target effects, overt histopathological changes, or molecular alterations. Tau reduction with AAV ZFP-TFs was able to rescue neuronal damage around amyloid plaques in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (APP/PS1 line). The highly specific, durable, and controlled knockdown of endogenous tau makes AAV-delivered ZFP-TFs a promising approach for the treatment of tau-related human brain diseases.},

To better understand why skin symptoms are so severe, we conducted a prospective immunophenotyping study on skin and blood. Mass cytometry results confirmed that effector memory polycytotoxic CD8 + T cells (CTLs) are the main leucocytes in TEN blisters at the acute phase. Deep T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing identified massive expansion of unique CDR3 clonotypes in blister cells. The same clones were highly expanded in patient’s blood, and the degree of their expansion showed significant correlation with disease severity. By transducing α and β chains of the expanded clonotypes into a TCR-defective cell line, we confirmed that those cells were drug specific. Collectively, these results suggest that the relative clonal expansion and phenotype of skin-recruited CTLs condition the clinical presentation of cutaneous adverse drug reactions.},

As body condition improved from 21 to 32\% fat and daylength declined from 16 to 10 hours, seals rested progressively earlier with respect to sunrise, sacrificing valuable nocturnal foraging hours to rest in the safety of darkness. Seals in superior body condition prioritized safety over energy conservation by resting &gt;100 meters deeper where it was 300× darker. Together, these results provide empirical evidence that marine mammals actively use the three-dimensional lightscape to optimize risk-reward trade-offs based on ecological and physiological factors.},

One major hurdle of this strategy is to retain the correct orientation of key side chains involved in protein surface recognition. Here, we show that the structural plasticity of a foldamer backbone may notably contribute to the required spatial adjustment for optimal interaction with the protein surface. By using oligoureas as α helix mimics, we designed a foldamer/peptide hybrid inhibitor of histone chaperone ASF1, a key regulator of chromatin dynamics. The crystal structure of its complex with ASF1 reveals a notable plasticity of the urea backbone, which adapts to the ASF1 surface to maintain the same binding interface. One additional benefit of generating ASF1 ligands with nonpeptide oligourea segments is the resistance to proteolysis in human plasma, which was highly improved compared to the cognate α-helical peptide.},

The artificial synapse is composed of an optoelectronic transistor based on graphene/MoS 2 heterostructure and an integrated triboelectric nanogenerator. By controlling the charge transfer/exchange in the heterostructure with triboelectric potential, the optoelectronic synaptic behaviors can be readily modulated, including postsynaptic photocurrents, persistent photoconductivity, and photosensitivity. The photonic synaptic plasticity is elaborately investigated under the synergistic effect of mechanical displacement and the light pulses embodying different spatiotemporal information. Furthermore, artificial neural networks are simulated to demonstrate the improved image recognition accuracy up to 92\% assisted with mechanical plasticization.

We have applied multiphoton in vivo imaging and holographic stimulation to examine single S1 neuron activity patterns and connectivity during sustained pain. Following pain induction, there is an increase in synchronized neuronal activity and connectivity within S1, indicating the formation of pain circuits. Artificially increasing neuronal activity and synchrony using DREADDs reduced pain thresholds. The expression of N-type voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channel subunits in S1 was increased after pain induction, and locally blocking these channels reduced both the synchrony and allodynia associated with inflammatory pain. Targeting these S1 pain circuits, via inhibiting N-type Ca 2+ channels or other approaches, may provide ways to reduce inflammatory pain.},

Immunohistological analysis confirmed increases in vascularity and neuronal cellularity, as well as reduced glial scar formation in response to treatment with EFF -nanotransfected fibroblasts.

  abstract     = {The hab1-1abi1-2abi2-2pp2ca-1 quadruple mutant ( Qabi2-2 ) seedlings lacking key negative regulators of ABA signaling, namely, clade A protein phosphatases type 2C (PP2Cs), show more apoplastic H + efflux in roots and display an enhanced root growth under normal medium or water stress medium compared to the wild type. The presence of low ABA concentration (0.1 micromolar), inhibiting PP2C activity via monomeric ABA receptors, enhances root apoplastic H + efflux and growth of the wild type, resembling the Qabi2-2 phenotype in normal medium. Qabi2-2 seedlings also demonstrate increased hydrotropism compared to the wild type in obliquely-oriented hydrotropic experimental system, and asymmetric H + efflux in root elongation zone is crucial for root hydrotropism. Moreover, we reveal that Arabidopsis ABA-insensitive 1, a key PP2C in ABA signaling, interacts directly with the C terminus of Arabidopsis plasma membrane H + -dependent adenosine triphosphatase 2 (AHA2) and dephosphorylates its penultimate threonine residue (Thr 947 ), whose dephosphorylation negatively regulates AHA2.},

As the force sensitivity is proportional to the lengths of the beam and thread, but inversely proportional to the fourth power of the diameter of the thread, nanomaterials should be ideal building blocks for torsion balances. Here, we report a torsional balance array on a chip with the highest sensitivity level enabled by using a carbon nanotube as the thread and a monolayer graphene coated with Al nanofilms as the beam and mirror. It is demonstrated that the femtonewton force exerted by a weak laser can be easily measured. The balances on the chip should serve as an ideal platform for investigating fundamental interactions up to zeptonewton in accuracy in the near future.},

In practice, different core-periphery algorithms are often applied interchangeably despite the fact that they can yield inconsistent descriptions of core-periphery structure. For example, two of the most widely used algorithms, the k -cores decomposition and the classic two-block model of Borgatti and Everett, extract fundamentally different structures: The latter partitions a network into a binary hub-and-spoke layout, while the former divides it into a layered hierarchy. We introduce a core-periphery typology to clarify these differences, along with Bayesian stochastic block modeling techniques to classify networks in accordance with this typology. Empirically, we find a rich diversity of core-periphery structure among networks. Through a detailed case study, we demonstrate the importance of acknowledging this diversity and situating networks within the core-periphery typology when conducting domain-specific analyses.},

Our analysis of actions proposed in four science-policy fora reveals that subsidy reform, valuation, food waste reduction, sustainability standards, life cycle assessments, sustainable diets, mainstreaming biodiversity, and strengthening governance can support more sustainable food production and consumption. By considering barriers and opportunities of implementing these actions in Peru and the United Kingdom, we derive potential targets and indicators for the post-2020 biodiversity framework. For targets to support transformation, genuine political commitment, accountability and compliance, and wider enabling conditions and actions by diverse agents are needed to shift food systems onto a sustainable path.},

However, the role of microglia in hippocampal neurogenesis and stress resilience remains unclear. We identified interleukin 4 (IL4)–driven microglia characterized by high expression of Arg1, which is critical in maintaining hippocampal neurogenesis and stress resistance. Decreasing Arg1 + microglia in the hippocampus by knocking down the microglial IL4R suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis and enhanced stress vulnerability. Increasing Arg1 + microglia in the hippocampus by enhancing IL4 signaling restored hippocampal neurogenesis and the resilience to stress-induced depression. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was found necessary for the proneurogenesis effects of IL4-driven microglia. Together, our findings suggest that IL4-driven microglia in the hippocampus trigger BDNF-dependent neurogenesis responding to chronic stress, helping protect against depressive-like symptoms. These findings identify the modulation of a specific microglial phenotype as a treatment strategy for mood disorders.},

Strong nonstationarities impede statistical convergence, precluding quantifying turbulence, for example, in terms of turbulence intensity or Reynolds number. Here, we show that by using deep neural networks, we can accurately estimate the Reynolds number within 15\% accuracy, from a statistical sample as small as two large-scale eddy turnover times. In contrast, physics-based statistical estimators are limited by the convergence rate of the central limit theorem and provide, for the same statistical sample, at least a hundredfold larger error. Our findings open up previously unexplored perspectives and the possibility to quantitatively define and, therefore, study highly nonstationary turbulent flows as ordinarily found in nature and in industrial processes.},

The effects of solute segregation and interfacial structural transitions are even more elusive. In this study, aberration-corrected electron microscopy is combined with atomic-resolution energy-dispersive x-ray and electron energy loss spectroscopy to investigate Ti-, V-, and Cr-segregated WC-Co interfaces as model systems. The experiments reveal the general anisotropic formation of reconstructed trilayer-like superstructures with segregant-specific compositional profiles that facilitate the transition from covalent to metallic electronic structures. Density functional theory calculations confirm the gradual increasing metallicity from WC to Co in the interfacial trilayers via increasing metallic solute concentration. This study uncovers unprecedented details of the sophisticated interfacial superstructures at metal-ceramic interfaces. It sheds light on how a metal transits to a ceramic at a “general” interface with strong segregation.},

Here, we demonstrate that addition polymerization, a general concept to polymerize olefins, can be extended to P═C double bonds. The polymerization of monomeric 2-phosphanaphthalenes is mediated by copper(I) halides and leads to polycarbophosphanes with an M n of 14 to 34 kDa. Each phosphorus is coordinated to Cu(I), which can be easily removed. Unlike long-term durable polyolefins, the metal-free polymers depolymerize rapidly back to monomers under sunlight or ultraviolet irradiation at λ = 365 nm. The monomers can be recycled for repolymerization, demonstrating a cradle-to-cradle life cycle for polycarbophosphanes.},

Addressing these questions must involve a better understanding of its photointermediates. Here, dynamic nuclear polarization–enhanced solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on cryo-trapped photointermediates shows that the K-state with 13- cis retinal directly interconverts into the subsequent L-state with distinct retinal carbon chemical shift differences and an increased out-of-plane twist around the C14-C15 bond. The retinal converts back into an all-trans conformation in the O-intermediate, which is the key state for sodium transport. However, retinal carbon and Schiff base nitrogen chemical shifts differ from those observed in the KR2 dark state all- trans conformation, indicating a perturbation through the nearby bound sodium ion. Our findings are supplemented by optical and infrared spectroscopy and are discussed in the context of known three-dimensional structures.},

The specialized metabolites from different cone snails are species-specific and structurally diverse, suggesting that the cones may adopt many different prey-hunting strategies enabled by small molecules. Predators sometimes attract prey using the prey’s own pheromones, in a strategy known as aggressive mimicry.

Last, specific loss of GIPR activity in α cells prevents glucagon secretion in response to a meal stimulus, limiting insulin secretion and driving glucose intolerance.

Speed- and trajectory-dependent firings were most prominent in neurons projecting to the retrosplenial cortex and nucleus accumbens, respectively. Place-related firing was uniformly observed in neurons targeting the retrosplenial cortex, nucleus accumbens, anteroventral thalamus, and medial mammillary body.

  abstract     = {In separation and catalysis applications, adsorption and diffusion are normally considered mutually exclusive. That is, rapid diffusion is generally accompanied by weak adsorption and vice versa. In this work, we analyze the anomalous loading-dependent mechanism of p -xylene diffusion in a newly developed zeolite called SCM-15. The obtained results demonstrate that the unique system of “continuum intersecting channels” (i.e., channels made of fused cavities) plays a key role in the diffusion process for the molecule-selective pathways. At low pressure, the presence of strong adsorption sites and intersections that provide space for molecule rotation facilitates the diffusion of p -xylene along the Z direction. Upon increasing the molecular uptake, the adsorbates move faster along the X direction because of the effect of continuum intersections in reducing the diffusion barriers and thus maintaining the large diffusion coefficient of the diffusing compound. This mechanism synergistically improves the diffusion in zeolites with continuum intersecting channels.},

Our method uses heterobifunctional cross-linkers to create mechanical boundary constraints that guide surface-directed sculpting of cell-laden extracellular matrix hydrogel constructs. Using this approach, we engineered linearly aligned tissues with structural and mechanical anisotropy. A multiscale in silico model of the sculpting process was developed to reveal that cell contractility increases as a function of principal stress polarization in anisotropic tissues. We also show that the anisotropic biophysical microenvironment of linearly aligned tissues potentiates soluble factor-mediated tenogenic and myogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. The application of our method is demonstrated by (i) skeletal muscle arrays to screen therapeutic modulators of acute oxidative injury and (ii) a 3D microphysiological model of lung cancer cachexia to study inflammatory and oxidative muscle injury induced by tumor-derived signals.},

Meiosis-specific Pds5 depletion mutants have shorter chromosome axes and lower homologous chromosome pairing and recombination frequency. However, it is poorly understood how Pds5 coordinately regulates these processes. In this study, we show that only ~20\% of wild-type level of Pds5 is required for homolog pairing and that higher levels of Pds5 dosage-dependently regulate axis length and crossover frequency. Moderate changes in Pds5 protein levels do not explicitly impair the basic recombination process. Further investigations show that Pds5 does not regulate chromosome axes by altering Rec8 abundance. Conversely, Rec8 regulates chromosome axis length by modulating Pds5. These findings highlight the important role of Pds5 in regulating meiosis and its relationship with Rec8 to regulate chromosome axis length and crossover frequency with implications for evolutionary adaptation.},

Inspired by the virtual water concept, we, herein, propose the concept of virtual biotic pollination flow as an indicator of countries’ mutual dependence on biodiversity-based ecosystem services and provide an online tool to visualize trade flow. Using information on 55 pollinator-dependent crop markets (2001–2015), we show that countries with higher development level demand high levels of biodiversity-based services to sustain their consumption patterns. Such patterns are supported by importation of virtual biotic pollination (up to 40\% of national imports of pollinator-dependent crops) from developing countries, stimulating cropland expansion. Quantifying virtual pollination flow can help develop new global socioeconomic policies to meet the interconnected challenges of biodiversity loss, ecosystem health, and social justice.},

Loss of function of the transcription factor Atoh7 , expressed in multipotent early neurogenic retinal progenitors leads to a selective and essentially complete loss of RGCs. Therefore, Atoh7 is considered essential for conferring competence on progenitors to generate RGCs. Despite the importance of Atoh7 in RGC specification, we find that inhibiting apoptosis in Atoh7- deficient mice by loss of function of Bax only modestly reduces RGC numbers. Single-cell RNA sequencing of Atoh7; Bax -deficient retinas shows that RGC differentiation is delayed but that the gene expression profile of RGC precursors is grossly normal. Atoh7; Bax -deficient RGCs eventually mature, fire action potentials, and incorporate into retinal circuitry but exhibit severe axonal guidance defects.

Upon virion release, protease-mediated Gag cleavage leads to a maturation event in which the immature lattice disassembles and the mature capsid assembles. The cellular metabolite inositiol hexakisphosphate (IP 6 ) and maturation inhibitors (MIs) both bind and stabilize immature Gag hexamers, but whereas IP 6 promotes virus maturation, MIs inhibit it. Here we show that HIV is evolutionarily constrained to maintain an immature lattice stability that ensures IP 6 packaging without preventing maturation. Replication-deficient mutant viruses with reduced IP 6 recruitment display increased infectivity upon treatment with the MI PF46396 (PF96) or the acquisition of second-site compensatory mutations. Both PF96 and second-site mutations stabilise the immature lattice and restore IP 6 incorporation, suggesting that immature lattice stability and IP 6 binding are interdependent. This IP 6 dependence suggests that modifying MIs to compete with IP 6 for Gag hexamer binding could substantially improve MI antiviral potency.},

Following muscle injury, muscle stiffness remained elevated after morphological regeneration was complete, accompanied by activated and proliferative MuSCs. To isolate the role of stiffness on MuSC behavior and determine the underlying mechanotransduction pathways, we cultured MuSCs on strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition hydrogels capable of in situ stiffening by secondary photocrosslinking of excess cyclooctynes. Using pre- to post-injury stiffness hydrogels, we found that elevated stiffness enhances migration and MuSC proliferation by localizing yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and WW domain–containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1; TAZ) to the nucleus. Ablating YAP and TAZ in vivo promotes MuSC quiescence in postinjury muscle and prevents myofiber hypertrophy, demonstrating that persistent exposure to elevated stiffness activates mechanotransduction signaling maintaining activated and proliferating MuSCs.},

This concept is motivated by developments in electron microscopy, which recently demonstrated quantum free-electron interactions with light in photonic cavities. Such electron microscopes provide platforms for shaping quantum states of light through a judicious choice of the input light and electron states. Specifically, we show how electron energy combs implement photon displacement operations, creating displaced-Fock and displaced-squeezed states. We develop the theory for consecutive electron-cavity interactions with a common cavity and show how to generate any target Fock state. Looking forward, exploiting the degrees of freedom of electrons, light, and their interaction may achieve complete control over the quantum state of the generated light, leading to novel light statistics and correlations.},

We repeatedly exposed invasive mammalian predators to unprofitable bird odors for 5 weeks before native shorebirds arrived for nesting and for 8 weeks thereafter. Chick production increased 1.7-fold at odor-treated sites over 25 to 35 days, with doubled or tripled odds of successful hatching, resulting in a 127\% increase in modeled population size in 25 years.

Thus, the MN-enabled transdermal codelivery of Cas9 RNP nanocomplexes and Dex nanoparticles result in the disruption of subcutaneous intracellular NLRP3 inflammasomes, which is demonstrated to be critical to alleviate skin inflammations and contributes to glucocorticoid therapy in mouse models of ISDs, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.

However, the cavity’s function and mechanism of formation have so far been obscure. Through investigating the cavity formation, we found that in the epiblast, the process of lumenogenesis is driven by reorganization of intercellular adhesion, vectoral fluid transport, and mitotic paracellular water influx from the blastocoel into the emerging proamniotic cavity. By experimentally blocking lumenogenesis, we found that the proamniotic cavity functions as a hub for communication between the early lineages, enabling proper growth and patterning of the postimplantation embryo.},

Using quantitative kinetics approaches, we show that dynamic nucleosome unwrapping regulates target accessibility to Cas12a and determines the extent to which both steps of binding—PAM recognition and R-loop formation—are inhibited by the nucleosome. Relaxing DNA wrapping within the nucleosome by reducing DNA bendability, adding histone modifications, or introducing target-proximal dCas9 enhances DNA cleavage rates over 10-fold. Unexpectedly, Cas12a readily cleaves internucleosomal linker DNA within chromatin-like, phase-separated nucleosome arrays. DNA targeting is reduced only ~5-fold due to neighboring nucleosomes and chromatin compaction. This work explains the observation that on-target cleavage within nucleosomes occurs less often than off-target cleavage within nucleosome-depleted genomic regions in cells. We conclude that nucleosome unwrapping regulates accessibility to CRISPR-Cas nucleases and propose that increasing nucleosome breathing dynamics will improve DNA targeting in eukaryotic cells.},

  abstract     = {No disease-modifying therapy is currently available for Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease. The long nonmotor prodromal phase of PD is a window of opportunity for early detection and intervention. However, we lack the pathophysiological understanding to develop selective biomarkers and interventions. By using a mutant α-synuclein selective-overexpression mouse model of prodromal PD, we identified a cell-autonomous selective Kv4 channelopathy in dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) neurons. This functional remodeling of intact DMV neurons leads to impaired pacemaker function in vitro and in vivo, which, in turn, reduces gastrointestinal motility, a common early symptom of prodromal PD. We identify a chain of events from α-synuclein via a biophysical dysfunction of a specific neuronal population to a clinically relevant prodromal symptom. These findings will facilitate the rational design of clinical biomarkers to identify people at risk for developing PD.},

We report the results of the largest genome-wide association study for eye color to date, involving up to 192, 986 European participants from 10 populations. We identify 124 independent associations arising from 61 discrete genomic regions, including 50 previously unidentified. We find evidence for genes involved in melanin pigmentation, but we also find associations with genes involved in iris morphology and structure. Further analyses in 1636 Asian participants from two populations suggest that iris pigmentation variation in Asians is genetically similar to Europeans, albeit with smaller effect sizes. Our findings collectively explain 53.2\% (95\% confidence interval, 45.4 to 61.0\%) of eye color variation using common single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Overall, our study outcomes demonstrate that the genetic complexity of human eye color considerably exceeds previous knowledge and expectations, highlighting eye color as a genetically highly complex human trait.},

Here, we report a wax-wetting sponge designed by conforming to the thermoresponsive microstructure of crude oil droplets. To address paraffin wax crystallization, we designed the sponge by coating a polyester polyurethane substrate with nanosilicon functionalized with paraffin-like octadecyl ligands. The wax-wetting sponge can adsorb oil droplets from wastewater between 5° and 40°C with 90 to 99\% removal efficacy for 10 cycles. Also, upon rinsing with heptol, the adsorbed oil is released within seconds. The proposed approach of sponges designed to conform with the temperature-dependent microstructure of the crude oils could enable cold water technologies and improve circular economy metrics in the oil industry.},

However, the magma ocean model remains difficult to validate because of the scarcity of geochemical tracers of lower mantle mineralogy. The Fe isotope compositions (δ 57 Fe) of ancient mafic rocks can be used to reconstruct the mineralogy of their mantle source regions. We present Fe isotope data for 3.7-Ga metabasalts from the Isua Supracrustal Belt (Greenland). The δ 57 Fe signatures of these samples extend to values elevated relative to modern equivalents and define strong correlations with fluid-immobile trace elements and tungsten isotope anomalies (μ 182 W). Phase equilibria models demonstrate that these features can be explained by melting of a magma ocean cumulate component in the upper mantle. Similar processes may operate today, as evidenced by the δ 57 Fe and μ 182 W heterogeneity of modern oceanic basalts.},

We investigated mechanistically whether lowering or preventing high-fat diet (HFD)–induced increase in apoCIII protects against the detrimental metabolic consequences. Mice, first fed HFD for 10 weeks and thereafter also given an antisense (ASO) to lower apoCIII, already showed reduced levels of apoCIII and metabolic improvements after 4 weeks, despite maintained obesity. Prolonged ASO treatment reversed the metabolic phenotype due to increased lipase activity and receptor-mediated hepatic uptake of lipids. Fatty acids were transferred to the ketogenic pathway, and ketones were used in brown adipose tissue (BAT). This resulted in no fat accumulation and preserved morphology and function of liver and BAT. If ASO treatment started simultaneously with the HFD, mice remained lean and metabolically healthy. Thus, lowering apoCIII protects against and reverses the HFD-induced metabolic phenotype by promoting physiological insulin sensitivity.},

Here, we present a glacial chronology for the Ethiopian Highlands in comparison with other East African Mountains. In the Ethiopian Highlands, glaciers reached their maximum 42 to 28 thousand years ago before the global Last Glacial Maximum. The local maximum was accompanied by a temperature depression of 4.4° to 6.0°C and a ~700-m downward shift of the afro-alpine vegetation belt, reshaping the human and natural habitats. The chronological comparison reveals that glaciers in Eastern Africa responded in a nonuniform way to past climatic changes, indicating a regionally varying influence of precipitation, temperature, and orography on paleoglacier dynamics.},

Using TBI mice, we identified that M2-like macrophage, microglia, and endothelial cell were major sources to produce M6T. Together with the in vivo tracking of mCherry+ macrophages in zebrafish models, we confirmed that M6T treatment accelerated blood-borne macrophage infiltration and polarization toward a subset of tissue repair macrophages that expressed similar genes as microglia for neuroprotection, angiogenesis and cell migration. M6T therapy in TBI mice and zebrafish improved neurological function while blocking M6T-exacerbated brain injury.

Here, we show that the inhibition of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) enzyme activity normalizes aberrant epigenetic control of gene expression in neurodevelopmental disorders. Maternal exposure to valproate or poly I:C caused sustained dysregulation of gene expression in the brain and ASD-like social and cognitive deficits after birth in rodents. Unexpectedly, a specific inhibitor of LSD1 enzyme activity, 5-((1 R , 2 R )-2-((cyclopropylmethyl)amino)cyclopropyl)- N -(tetrahydro-2 H -pyran-4-yl)thiophene-3-carboxamide hydrochloride (TAK-418), almost completely normalized the dysregulated gene expression in the brain and ameliorated some ASD-like behaviors in these models. The genes modulated by TAK-418 were almost completely different across the models and their ages. These results suggest that LSD1 enzyme activity may stabilize the aberrant epigenetic machinery in neurodevelopmental disorders, and the inhibition of LSD1 enzyme activity may be the master key to recover gene expression homeostasis. TAK-418 may benefit patients with neurodevelopmental disorders.},

Here, we report cryo-EM structures of hEAAT3 in several functional states where the transporter is empty, bound to coupled sodium ions only, or fully loaded with three sodium ions, a proton, and the substrate aspartate. The structures suggest that hEAAT3 operates by an elevator mechanism involving three functionally independent subunits. When the substrate-binding site is near the cytoplasm, it has a remarkably low affinity for the substrate, perhaps facilitating its release and allowing the rapid transport turnover. The mechanism of the coupled uptake of the sodium ions and the substrate is conserved across evolutionarily distant families and is augmented by coupling to protons in EAATs. The structures further suggest a mechanism by which a conserved glutamate residue mediates proton symport.},

In particular, we provide a direct evidence that e-h exchange interaction plays a dominant role in the fast valley depolarization within a few picoseconds, which is in excellent agreement with experiments. Moreover, there are bright-to-dark exciton transitions induced by e-ph scattering and SOI. Our study proves that e-h many-body effects are essential to understand the spin-valley exciton dynamics in transition metal dichalcogenides and the newly developed GW + rtBSE-NAMD method provides a powerful tool for exciton dynamics in extended systems with time, space, momentum, energy, and spin resolution.},

Our results revealed the structural rearrangements that mediate membrane fusion and details of the interactions among the fusion loops, the membrane-proximal region, transmembrane domain, and bound fusion inhibitor that stabilized gB in the prefusion state. The structure rationalizes known gB antigenic sites. By analogy to successful vaccine antigen engineering approaches for other viral pathogens, the high-resolution prefusion gB structure provides a basis to develop stabilized prefusion gB HCMV vaccine antigens.},

We explore the extended hydration shell structure of HA in water using femtosecond elastic second-harmonic scattering (fs-ESHS). HA enhances orientational water-water correlations. Angle-resolved fs-ESHS measurements and nonlinear optical modeling show that HA behaves like a flexible chain surrounded by extended shells of orientationally correlated water. We describe several ways to determine the concentration-dependent size and shape of a polyelectrolyte in water, using the amount of water oriented by the polyelectrolyte charges as a contrast agent. The spatial extent of the hydration shell is determined via temperature-dependent measurements and can reach up to 475 nm, corresponding to a length of 1600 water molecules. A strong isotope effect, stemming from nuclear quantum effects, is observed when light water (H 2 O) is replaced by heavy water (D 2 O), amounting to a factor of 4.3 in the scattered SH intensity.},

Here, we use echo-recording tags to show how wild hunting bats adjust their sensory strategies to their prey and natural environment. When searching, bats maximize the chances of detecting small prey by using large sensory volumes. During prey pursuit, they trade spatial for temporal information by reducing sensory volumes while increasing update rate and redundancy of their sensory scenes. These adjustments lead to very weak prey echoes that bats protect from interference by segregating prey sensory streams from the background using a combination of fast-acting sensory and motor strategies. Counterintuitively, these weak sensory scenes allow bats to be efficient hunters close to background clutter broadening the niches available to hunt for insects.},

Coronaviral non-structural proteins (nsps) form the replication-transcription complex (RTC). Nsp7 and nsp8 interact with and regulate the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and other enzymes in the RTC. However, the structural plasticity of nsp7+8 complexes has been under debate. Here, we present the framework of nsp7+8 complex stoichiometry and topology based on native mass spectrometry and complementary biophysical techniques of nsp7+8 complexes from seven coronaviruses in the genera Alpha- and Betacoronavirus including SARS-CoV-2. Their complexes cluster into three groups, which systematically form either heterotrimers or heterotetramers or both, exhibiting distinct topologies. Moreover, even at high protein concentrations, SARS-CoV-2 nsp7+8 consists primarily of heterotetramers.

However, efficiency and selectivity are often mutually antagonistic, so that high selectivity is accompanied by low efficiency and vice versa. Also, just increasing the temperature is very unlikely to change the reaction pathway. Here, by constructing hierarchical plasmonic nanoreactors, we show that nanoconfined thermal fields and energetic electrons, a combination of attributes that coexist almost uniquely in plasmonic nanostructures, can overcome the antagonism by regulating selectivity and promoting conversion rate concurrently. For propylene partial oxidation, they drive chemical reactions by not only regulating parallel reaction pathways to selectively produce acrolein but also reducing consecutive process to inhibit the overoxidation to CO 2 , resulting in valuable products different from thermal catalysis. This suggests a strategy to rationally use plasmonic nanostructures to optimize chemical processes, thereby achieving high yield with high selectivity at lower temperature under visible light illumination.},

The penetrated droplets can atomize into numerous much smaller (&lt;100 micrometer) droplets, which could remain airborne for a significant time. The possibility of secondary atomization of high-momentum cough droplets by hydrodynamic focusing and extrusion through the microscale pores in the fibrous network of the single/double-layer mask material needs to be considered in determining mask efficacy.

Our results localize the elemental fractionation process to the top of the chromosphere. The plasma confined closest to that region, where the coronal magnetic field strength is high (a few hundred Gauss), develops the SEP composition signature.

Here, we solved the structure of human Derlin-1 by cryo–electron microscopy. The structure shows that Derlin-1 forms a homotetramer that encircles a large tunnel traversing the ER membrane. The tunnel has a diameter of about 12 to 15 angstroms, large enough to allow an α helix to pass through. The structure also shows a lateral gate within the membrane, providing access of transmembrane proteins to the tunnel, and thus, human Derlin-1 forms a protein channel for translocation of misfolded proteins.

  abstract     = {Immunotherapies controlling the adaptive immune system are firmly established, but regulating the innate immune system remains much less explored. The intrinsic interactions between nanoparticles and phagocytic myeloid cells make these materials especially suited for engaging the innate immune system. However, developing nanotherapeutics is an elaborate process. Here, we demonstrate a modular approach that facilitates efficiently incorporating a broad variety of drugs in a nanobiologic platform. Using a microfluidic formulation strategy, we produced apolipoprotein A1–based nanobiologics with favorable innate immune system–engaging properties as evaluated by in vivo screening. Subsequently, rapamycin and three small-molecule inhibitors were derivatized with lipophilic promoieties, ensuring their seamless incorporation and efficient retention in nanobiologics. A short regimen of intravenously administered rapamycin-loaded nanobiologics (mTORi-NBs) significantly prolonged allograft survival in a heart transplantation mouse model. Last, we studied mTORi-NB biodistribution in nonhuman primates by PET/MR imaging and evaluated its safety, paving the way for clinical translation.},

  abstract     = {Humans have a remarkable ability to understand what is and is not being said by conversational partners. It has been hypothesized that listeners decode the intended meaning of a communicative signal by assuming speakers speak cooperatively, rationally simulating the speaker’s choice process and inverting it to recover the speaker’s most probable meaning. We investigated whether and how rational simulations of speakers are represented in the listener’s brain, by combining referential communication games with functional neuroimaging. We show that listeners’ ventromedial prefrontal cortex encodes the probabilistic inference of what a cooperative speaker should say given a communicative goal and context, even when such inferences are irrelevant for reference resolution. The listener’s striatum encodes the amount of update on intended meaning, consistent with inverting a simulated mental model. These findings suggest a neural generative mechanism, subserved by the frontal-striatal circuits, that underlies our ability to understand communicative and, more generally, social actions.},

Here, we used cryo–electron tomography to visualize synaptic complexes together with their native environment comprising interacting proteins and lipids on a 2- to 4-nm scale. Using template-free detection and classification, we showed that tripartite trans-synaptic assemblies (subcolumns) link synaptic vesicles to postsynaptic receptors and established that a particular displacement between directly interacting complexes characterizes subcolumns. Furthermore, we obtained de novo average structures of ionotropic glutamate receptors in their physiological composition, embedded in plasma membrane. These data support the hypothesis that synaptic function is carried by precisely organized trans-synaptic units. It provides a framework for further exploration of synaptic and other large molecular assemblies that link different cells or cellular regions and may require weak or transient interactions to exert their function.},

Thus, RLR activation should be tightly controlled to avoid detrimental effects. “DEAD-box RNA helicase 3, X-linked” (DDX3X) is a key adaptor in RLR signaling, but its regulatory mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF39 inhibits RLR pathways through mediating K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of DDX3X. Concordantly, Rnf39 deficiency enhances RNA virus–triggered innate immune responses and attenuates viral replication.

Using pH to vary the type and charge of the amino acids, we find distinct multimodal current fluctuations originating from the different host-guest interactions, consistent with theoretical calculations. These conductance data produce characteristic dwell times and shuttling rates for each amino acid, and allow accurate, statistical real-time, in situ measurements.

However, devices for continuous measurements of bilirubin have not been developed yet. Here, we established a wearable transcutaneous bilirubinometer that also has oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) and heart rate (HR) sensing functionalities. Clinical experiments with neonates demonstrated the possibility of simultaneous detection of bilirubin, SpO 2 , and HR. Moreover, our device could consistently measure bilirubin during phototherapy.

To overcome these limitations, we present a stomatopod-inspired sensor capable of snapshot hyperspectral and polarization sensing in a single pixel. The design consists of stacking polarization-sensitive organic photovoltaics (P-OPVs) and polymer retarders. Multiple spectral and polarization channels are obtained by exploiting the P-OPVs’ anisotropic response and the retarders’ dispersion. We show that the design can sense 15 spectral channels over a 350-nanometer bandwidth. A detector is also experimentally demonstrated, which simultaneously registers four spectral channels and three polarization channels.

Moreover, little is known about the structures and properties of the end member SrNiO 3 .

Two coexisting oxygen-deficient Ruddlesden-Popper phases, Sr 2 NiO 3 and SrNi 2 O 3 , are formed to balance the stoichiometry and stabilize the energetically preferred Ni 2+ cation. Our study sheds light on an unusual oxide thin-film nucleation process driven by the instability in perovskite structured SrNiO 3 and the tendency of transition metal cations to form their most stable valence (i.e., Ni 2+ in this case). The resulting metastable reduced Ruddlesden-Popper structures offer a testbed for further studying emerging phenomena in nickel-based oxides.},

An analysis of 40 tidal gauge records from U.S. coasts finds that, at 18 locations, NF increased due to tidal amplification, while decreases in tidal range suppressed NF at 11 locations. Estuaries show the largest changes in NF attributable to tide changes, and these can often be traced to anthropogenic alterations. Limited long-term measurements from estuaries suggest that the effects of evolving tides are more widespread than the locations considered here. The total number of NF days caused by tidal changes has increased at an exponential rate since 1950, adding ~27\% to the total number of NF events observed in 2019 across locations with tidal amplification.},

Here, we identify that dynamic regulation of the nicotinic cholinergic system is a key driver of attentional circuit maturation associated with top-down frontal neurons projecting to visual cortex. The top-down neurons receive robust cholinergic inputs, but their nicotinic tone decreases following adolescence by increasing expression of a nicotinic brake, Lynx1 . Lynx1 shifts a balance between local and long-range inputs onto top-down frontal neurons following adolescence and promotes the establishment of attentional behavior in adulthood. This key maturational process is disrupted in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome but was rescued by a suppression of nicotinic tone through the introduction of Lynx1 in top-down projections. Nicotinic signaling may serve as a target to rebalance local/long-range balance and treat cognitive deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders.},

By combining genetic, biochemical, and molecular biology approaches, we demonstrate that exonuclease VII (ExoVII) excises quinolone-induced trapped DNA gyrase, an essential prokaryotic type IIA topoisomerase. We show that ExoVII repairs trapped type IIA TOPcc and that ExoVII displays tyrosyl nuclease activity for the tyrosyl-DNA linkage on the 5′-DNA overhangs corresponding to trapped type IIA TOPcc. ExoVII-deficient bacteria fail to remove trapped DNA gyrase, consistent with their hypersensitivity to quinolones. We also identify an ExoVII inhibitor that synergizes with the antimicrobial activity of quinolones, including in quinolone-resistant bacterial strains, further demonstrating the functional importance of ExoVII for the repair of type IIA TOPcc.},

However, the efficacy of engineered CS (eCS) matrices in mediating structural and functional recovery chronically after sTBI has not been investigated. We report that neurotrophic factor functionalized acellular eCS matrices implanted into the rat M1 region acutely after sTBI significantly enhanced cellular repair and gross motor function recovery when compared to controls 20 weeks after sTBI. Animals subjected to M2 region injuries followed by eCS matrix implantations demonstrated the significant recovery of “reach-to-grasp” function. This was attributed to enhanced volumetric vascularization, activity-regulated cytoskeleton (Arc) protein expression, and perilesional sensorimotor connectivity. These findings indicate that eCS matrices implanted acutely after sTBI can support complex cellular, vascular, and neuronal circuit repair chronically after sTBI.},

  abstract     = {The underlying mechanisms contributing to injury-induced infection susceptibility remain poorly understood. Here, we describe a rapid increase in neutrophil cell numbers in the lungs following induction of thermal injury. These neutrophils expressed elevated levels of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and exhibited altered gene expression profiles indicative of a reparative population. Upon injury, neutrophils migrate from the bone marrow to the skin but transiently arrest in the lung vasculature. Arrested neutrophils interact with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on lung endothelial cells. A period of susceptibility to infection is linked to PD-L1 + neutrophil accumulation in the lung. Systemic treatment of injured animals with an anti–PD-L1 antibody prevented neutrophil accumulation in the lung and reduced susceptibility to infection but augmented skin healing, resulting in increased epidermal growth. This work provides evidence that injury promotes changes to neutrophils that are important for wound healing but contribute to infection susceptibility.},

Until effective vaccines are widely deployed, curbing COVID-19 will require carefully timed nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). A COVID-19 early warning system is vital for this. Here, we evaluate digital data streams as early indicators of state-level COVID-19 activity from 1 March to 30 September 2020. We observe that increases in digital data stream activity anticipate increases in confirmed cases and deaths by 2 to 3 weeks. Confirmed cases and deaths also decrease 2 to 4 weeks after NPI implementation, as measured by anonymized, phone-derived human mobility data. We propose a means of harmonizing these data streams to identify future COVID-19 outbreaks. Our results suggest that combining disparate health and behavioral data may help identify disease activity changes weeks before observation using traditional epidemiological monitoring.},

Mammals recognize microbe-associated molecules to initiate immune responses, but roles of bacterial d -amino acids ( d -aa) in mammalian immune systems remain largely unknown. Here, we report that amino acid chirality balanced by bacteria-mammal cross-talk modulates intestinal B cell fate and immunoglobulin A (IgA) production. Bacterial d -aa stimulate M1 macrophages and promote survival of intestinal naïve B cells. Mammalian intestinal d -aa catabolism limits the number of B cells and restricts growth of symbiotic bacteria that activate T cell–dependent IgA class switching of the B cells. Loss of d -aa catabolism results in excessive IgA production and dysbiosis with altered IgA coating on bacteria. Thus, chiral conversion of amino acids is linked to bacterial recognition by mammals to control symbiosis with bacteria.},

Exogenous EFs modulate neuronal activity, and their clinical applications are being profusely explored. However, whether endogenous EFs contribute to network synchronization remains unclear. We analyzed spontaneously generated slow-wave activity in the cerebral cortex network in vitro, which allowed us to distinguish synaptic from nonsynaptic mechanisms of activity propagation and synchronization. Slow oscillations generated EFs that propagated independently of synaptic transmission. We demonstrate that cortical oscillations modulate spontaneous rhythmic activity of neighboring synaptically disconnected cortical columns if layers are aligned. We provide experimental evidence that these EF-mediated effects are compatible with electric dipoles. With a model of interacting dipoles, we reproduce the experimental measurements and predict that endogenous EF–mediated synchronizing effects should be relevant in the brain. Thus, experiments and models suggest that electric-dipole interactions contribute to synchronization of neighboring cortical columns.},

Functional magnetic resonance imaging during encoding and recognition revealed task-based activation decreases in lateral prefrontal, as well as in parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortices in both memory athletes and participants after memory training, partly associated with better performance after 4 months. This was complemented by hippocampal-neocortical coupling during consolidation, which was stronger the more durable memories participants formed. Our findings advance knowledge on how mnemonic training boosts durable memory formation through decreased task-based activation and increased consolidation thereafter. This is in line with conceptual accounts of neural efficiency and highlights a complex interplay of neural processes critical for extraordinary memory.},

To overcome this obstacle, we have developed an approach for enriching mIHC images with single-cell RNA sequencing data, building upon recent experimental procedures for augmenting single-cell transcriptomes with concurrent antigen measurements. Spatially-resolved Transcriptomics via Epitope Anchoring (STvEA) performs transcriptome-guided annotation of highly multiplexed cytometry datasets. It increases the level of detail in histological analyses by enabling the systematic annotation of nuanced cell populations, spatial patterns of transcription, and interactions between cell types.

Moreover, we report that photoinhibition of 5HT-fDCN reduces dystonia in a1A tot/tot mice, a genetic model of stress-induced dystonia, and administration of a 5HT-2A receptor inverse agonist (MDL100907; 0.1 to 1 mg/kg) or shRNA-mediated knockdown of the ht2ar gene in fDCN can notably reduce the onset of dystonia in a1A tot/tot mice.

Here, we report the engineered LNPs for the targeted delivery of RNA into hepatocytes and LSECs. The effects of particle size and polyethylene glycol–lipid content in the LNPs were evaluated for the hepatocyte-specific delivery of mRNA by ApoE-mediated cellular uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors. Targeted delivery of RNA to LSECs was further investigated using active ligands. Incorporation of mannose allowed the selective delivery of RNA to LSECs, while minimizing the unwanted cellular uptake by hepatocytes.

The promotion of insulin signaling in AgRP neurons decreased meal size without altering total caloric intake, whereas the genetic ablation of the insulin receptor had the opposite effect. The promotion of insulin signaling also decreased the intake of sucrose-sweetened water or high-fat food over standard chow, without influencing food-seeking and hedonic behaviors. The ability of heightened insulin signaling to override the hedonistic consumption of highly palatable high-fat food attenuated the development of systemic insulin resistance, without affecting body weight. Our findings define an unprecedented mechanism by which insulin acutely influences glucose metabolism. Approaches that enhance insulin signaling in AgRP neurons may provide a means for altering feeding behavior in a nutrient-dense environment to combat the metabolic syndrome.},

This subunit contains a BLUF (sensors of blue light using FAD) domain that appears to directly modulate dynein activity in response to light. DYBLUP (dynein-associated BLUF protein) mediates the connection between the f/I1 motor domain and the tether complex that links the motor to the doublet microtubule. Chlamydomonas lacking the DYBLUP ortholog shows both positive and negative phototaxis but becomes acclimated and attracted to high-intensity blue light.

Early 20th century anatomical research supported the view that humans evolved from a suspensory ancestor bearing some resemblance to apes. However, the hand of the 4.4-million-year-old hominin Ardipithecus ramidus purportedly provides evidence that the hominin hand was derived from a more generalized form. Here, we use morphometric and phylogenetic comparative methods to show that Ardipithecus retains suspensory adapted hand morphologies shared with chimpanzees and bonobos. We identify an evolutionary shift in hand morphology between Ardipithecus and Australopithecus that renews questions about the coevolution of hominin manipulative capabilities and obligate bipedalism initially proposed by Darwin. Overall, our results suggest that early hominins evolved from an ancestor with a varied positional repertoire including suspension and vertical climbing, directly affecting the viable range of hypotheses for the origin of our lineage.},

  abstract     = {Multistable mechanical metamaterials are artificial materials whose microarchitectures offer more than two different stable configurations. Existing multistable mechanical metamaterials mainly rely on origami/kirigami-inspired designs, snap-through instability, and microstructured soft mechanisms, with mostly bistable fundamental unit cells. Scalable, tristable structural elements that can be built up to form mechanical metamaterials with an extremely large number of programmable stable configurations remains illusive. Here, we harness the elastic tensile/compressive asymmetry of kirigami microstructures to design a class of scalable X-shaped tristable structures. Using these structure as building block elements, hierarchical mechanical metamaterials with one-dimensional (1D) cylindrical geometries, 2D square lattices, and 3D cubic/octahedral lattices are designed and demonstrated, with capabilities of torsional multistability or independent controlled multidirectional multistability. The number of stable states increases exponentially with the cell number of mechanical metamaterials. The versatile multistability and structural diversity allow demonstrative applications in mechanical ternary logic operators and amplitude modulators with unusual functionalities.},

Here, we report a millisecond carbon gasification chemistry incorporating high density (&gt;10 12 cm −2 ) of functional oxygen clusters that then evolve in CO 2 -sieving vacancy defects under controlled and predictable gasification conditions. A statistical distribution of nanopore lattice isomers is observed, in good agreement with the theoretical solution to the isomer cataloging problem. The gasification technique is scalable, and a centimeter-scale membrane is demonstrated. Last, molecular cutoff could be adjusted by 0.1 Å by in situ expansion of the vacancy defects in an O 2 atmosphere.

An ample vestibule in the extracellular region is accessible laterally from the three side portals. The central pore contains multiple constrictions. A conserved lysine residue near the cytoplasmic end of the inner helix forms the presumed chloride ion selectivity filter. Unprecedentedly, the core structure and assembly closely resemble those of the epithelial sodium channel/degenerin family of sodium channels that are unrelated in amino acid sequence and conduct cations instead of anions. Together with electrophysiology, this work provides insights into ion conduction and gating for a new class of chloride channels that is architecturally distinct from previously characterized chloride channel families.},

A magnetic microswarm was formed and navigated near the boundary of vessels, where the reduced drag of blood flow and strong interactions between nanoparticles enable upstream and downstream navigation in flowing blood (mean velocity up to 40.8 mm/s). The microswarm-induced three-dimensional blood flow enables Doppler imaging from multiple viewing configurations and real-time tracking in different environments (i.e., stagnant, flowing blood, and pulsatile flow). We also demonstrate the ultrasound Doppler–guided swarm formation and navigation in the porcine coronary artery ex vivo.

Higher eukaryotes have evolved a mitotic catastrophe mechanism for eliminating mitosis-incompetent cells; however, the signaling cascade and its epigenetic regulation are poorly understood. Our analyses of human cancerous tissue revealed that the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT2 is up-regulated in early-stage carcinomas of various organs. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that SIRT2 interacts with and deacetylates the structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 1 (SMC1A), which then promotes SMC1A phosphorylation to properly drive mitosis. We have further demonstrated that inhibition of SIRT2 activity or continuously increasing SMC1A-K579 acetylation causes abnormal chromosome segregation, which, in turn, induces mitotic catastrophe in cancer cells and enhances their vulnerability to chemotherapeutic agents. These findings suggest that regulation of the SIRT2-SMC1A axis through deacetylation-phosphorylation permits escape from mitotic catastrophe, thus allowing early precursor lesions to overcome oncogenic stress.},

Our results uncover several magmatic events that fractionated the primordial sulfur isotope composition of the Moon: the segregation of the lunar core and the crystallization of the lunar magma ocean, which led to the formation of the heterogeneous sources of the lunar magmatism, followed by magma degassing during generation, transport, and eruption of the lunar lavas.

We recently discovered a β-hydroxybutyrate–mediated epigenetic pathway that couples metabolism to gene expression. However, its regulatory enzymes and substrate proteins remain unknown, hindering its functional study. Here, we report that the acyltransferase p300 can catalyze the enzymatic addition of β-hydroxybutyrate to lysine (Kbhb), while histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC2 enzymatically remove Kbhb. We demonstrate that p300-dependent histone Kbhb can directly mediate in vitro transcription. Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of Kbhb substrates in mammalian cells has identified 3248 Kbhb sites on 1397 substrate proteins. The dependence of histone Kbhb on p300 argues that enzyme-catalyzed acylation is the major mechanism for nuclear Kbhb. Our study thus reveals key regulatory elements for the Kbhb pathway, laying a foundation for studying its roles in diverse cellular processes.},

Preparatory activity can benefit reaction time and the quality of planned movements, but the neural mechanisms at work during preparation are unclear. For example, there are no overt changes in muscle force during preparation. Here, using an instructed-delay manual task, we demonstrate a decrease in human muscle afferent activity (primary spindles) when preparing to reach targets in directions associated with stretch of the spindle-bearing muscle. This goal-dependent modulation of proprioceptors began early after target onset but was markedly stronger at the latter parts of the preparatory period. Moreover, whole-arm perturbations during reach preparation revealed a modulation of stretch reflex gains (shoulder and upper arm muscles) that reflected the observed changes in spindle activity. We suggest that one function of central preparatory activity is to tune muscle stiffness according to task goals via the independent control of muscle spindle sensors.},

Glucocorticoid is an important hormone, roles, and mechanisms of which in cellular mechanotransduction remain unknown. Here, we report that glucocorticoid counteracted cellular mechanoresponses dependently on a novel long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), LINC01569 . Further, LINC01569 mediated glucocorticoid effects on mechanotransduction by destabilizing messenger RNA (mRNA) of mechanosensors including early growth response protein 1 ( EGR1 ), Cbp/P300-interacting transactivator 2 ( CITED2 ), and bone morphogenic protein 7 ( BMP7 ) in glucocorticoid receptor–mediated mRNA decay (GMD) manner. Mechanistically, LINC01569 directly bound to the GMD factor Y-box–binding protein 1 ( YBX1 ). Then, the LINC01569-YBX1 complex was guided to the mRNAs of EGR1 , CITED2 , and BMP7 through specific LINC01569 -mRNA interaction, thereby contributing to the successful assembly of GMD complex and triggering GMD. Our results uncovered roles of glucocorticoid in cellular mechanotransduction and novel lncRNA-dependent GMD machinery and provided potential strategy for early intervention in mechanical disorder–associated diseases.},

The resulting intrinsically stretchable organic light-emitting diode can emit light when exposed to strains as large as 80\%. The turn-on voltage is as low as 8 V, and the maximum luminance, which is a summation of the luminance values from both the anode and cathode sides, is 4400 cd m −2 . It can also survive repeated stretching cycles up to 200 times, and small stretching to 50\% is shown to substantially enhance its light-emitting efficiency.},

While the overall structures of hexon, penton base, and internal minor coat proteins IIIa and VIII are conserved, we observe partially ordered elements reinforcing the vertex region, which suggests their role in enhancing the physicochemical capsid stability of HAdV-F41. Unexpectedly, we find an organization of the external minor coat protein IX different from all previously characterized human and nonhuman mastadenoviruses.

Here, we investigate these processes in graphene-WS 2 heterostructures by complementarily probing the ultrafast terahertz photoconductivity in graphene and the transient absorption dynamics in WS 2 following photoexcitation. We observe that separated charges in the heterostructure following CT live extremely long: beyond 1 ns, in contrast to ~1 ps charge separation reported in previous studies. This leads to efficient photogating of graphene. Furthermore, for the CT process across graphene-WS 2 interfaces, we find that it occurs via photo-thermionic emission for sub-A-exciton excitations and direct hole transfer from WS 2 to the valence band of graphene for above-A-exciton excitations. These findings provide insights to further optimize the performance of optoelectronic devices, in particular photodetection.},

Upon injury, IAM progressively acquired overall reparative, yet diversified transcriptional profiles, each comprising four transcriptional subtypes with specialized tasks. Notably, IAM have both distinct and common gene signatures as compared to neurodegeneration-associated microglia, both engaging phagocytosis, autophagy, and TyroBP pathways. We also identified an immediate response microglia subtype serving as a source population for microglial transformation and a proliferative subtype controlled by the epigenetic regulator histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). Together, our data unveil diversification of myeloid and glial subtypes in SCI and an extensive influence of HDAC3, which may be exploited to enhance functional recovery.},

Here, we show that the impact of chromatin regulators on EMT interconversion is broader than that of kinases. By combining pharmacological modulation of EMT, synthetic genetic tracing, and CRISPR interference screens, we uncovered a minority of kinases and several chromatin remodelers, writers, and readers governing homeostatic EMT in lung cancer cells. Loss of ARID1A, DOT1L, BRD2, and ZMYND8 had nondeterministic and sometimes opposite consequences on epithelial-mesenchymal interconversion. Together with RNAPII and AP-1, these antagonistic gatekeepers control chromatin of active enhancers, including pan-cancer-EMT signature genes enabling supraclassification of anatomically diverse tumors. Thus, our data uncover general principles underlying transcriptional control of cancer cell plasticity and offer a platform to systematically explore chromatin regulators in tumor-state–specific therapy.},

These nanocarriers were encapsulated into an injectable hydrogel matrix (Gel@MSN/miR-21-5p) to enable controlled on-demand microRNA-21 delivery triggered by the local acidic microenvironment. In a porcine model of myocardial infarction, we demonstrated that the released MSN complexes notably inhibited the inflammatory response by inhibiting the polarization of M1 macrophage within the infarcted myocardium, while further microRNA-21-5p delivery by MSNs to endothelial cells markedly promoted local neovascularization and rescued at-risk cardiomyocytes.

The expression of these markers was associated with down-regulation of multiple genes in the insulin secretion pathway.

Here, we report that the PBN receives dense inputs from two discrete neuronal populations in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), an extended amygdala structure that encodes affective information. Using a series of complementary approaches, we identify opposing BNST-PBN circuits that modulate neuropeptide-expressing PBN neurons to control feeding and affective states.

Unexpectedly, atmospheric aging enhanced the ice activity for most types of fuels and aging schemes. The removal of organic carbon particle coatings that conceal the mineral-based ice-active sites by evaporation or oxidation then dissolution can increase the ice activity by greater than an order of magnitude. This represents a different framework for the evolution of INPs from biomass burning where BBA becomes more ice active as it dilutes and ages, making a larger contribution to the INP budget, resulting cloud microphysics, and climate forcing than is currently considered.},

We use high-resolution satellite and census data from India, the world’s largest consumer of groundwater, to quantify the impacts of groundwater depletion on cropping intensity, a crucial driver of agricultural production. Our results suggest that, given current depletion trends, cropping intensity may decrease by 20\% nationwide and by 68\% in groundwater-depleted regions. Even if surface irrigation delivery is increased as a supply-side adaptation strategy, which is being widely promoted by the Indian government, cropping intensity will decrease, become more vulnerable to interannual rainfall variability, and become more spatially uneven. We find that groundwater and canal irrigation are not substitutable and that additional adaptation strategies will be necessary to maintain current levels of production in the face of groundwater depletion.},

Parenthood explains most of the gender productivity gap by lowering the average short-term productivity of mothers, even as parents tend to be slightly more productive on average than nonparents. However, the size of productivity penalty for mothers appears to have shrunk over time.

  abstract     = {In many active matter systems, particle trajectories have a well-defined handedness or chirality. Whether such chiral activity can introduce stereoselective interactions between particles is not known. Here, we developed a strategy to tune the nature of chiral activity of three-dimensionally printed granular ellipsoids without altering their shape or size. In vertically agitated monolayers of these particles, we observed two types of dimers form depending on the chirality of the pairing monomers. Heterochiral dimers moved collectively as a single achiral active unit, while homochiral ones formed a translationally immobile spinner. In active racemic mixtures, the former was more abundant than the latter, indicating that interactions were stereoselective. Through dimer lifetime measurements, we further provide evidence for chiral self-recognition in mixtures of particles with different chiral activities. We lastly show that, at fixed particle number density, changing the net chirality of a dense active liquid fundamentally alters the nature of collective relaxation.},

  abstract     = {Systemic AAV (adeno-associated virus) gene therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of inborn errors of metabolism, but questions remain regarding its potency and durability. Tolerogenic ImmTOR nanoparticles encapsulating rapamycin have been shown to block the formation of neutralizing anti-capsid antibodies, thereby enabling vector re-administration. Here, we further demonstrate that ImmTOR admixed with AAV vectors also enhances hepatic transgene expression at the initial dose of AAV vector, independent of its effects on adaptive immunity. ImmTOR enhances AAV trafficking to the liver, resulting in increased hepatic vector copy numbers and transgene mRNA expression. Enhanced transgene expression occurs through a mechanism independent of the AAV receptor and cannot be replicated in vivo with free rapamycin or empty nanoparticles. The multipronged mechanism of ImmTOR action makes it an attractive candidate to enable more efficient transgene expression at first dose while simultaneously inhibiting adaptive responses against AAV to enable repeat dosing.},

Here, we show that chimpanzees from neighboring communities provide valuable resources to group members at personal cost, and that the magnitude of their prosocial behavior is group specific. Provided with a resource-donation experiment allowing free (partner) choice, we observed an increase in prosocial acts across the study period in most of the chimpanzees. When group members could profit (test condition), chimpanzees provided resources more frequently and for longer durations than when their acts produced inaccessible resources (control condition). Strikingly, chimpanzees’ prosocial behavior was group specific, with more socially tolerant groups acting more prosocially. We conclude that chimpanzees may purposely behave prosocially toward group members, and that the notion of group-specific sociality in nonhuman animals should crucially inform discussions on the evolution of prosocial behavior.},

Here, we generalize the broad family of commonly used vegetation indices by exploiting all higher-order relations between the spectral channels involved. This results in a higher sensitivity to vegetation biophysical and physiological parameters. The presented nonlinear generalization of the celebrated normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) consistently improves accuracy in monitoring key parameters, such as leaf area index, gross primary productivity, and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence. Results suggest that the statistical approach maximally exploits the spectral information and addresses long-standing problems in satellite Earth Observation of the terrestrial biosphere. The nonlinear NDVI will allow more accurate measures of terrestrial carbon source/sink dynamics and potentials for stabilizing atmospheric CO 2 and mitigating global climate change.},

In this study, we use a mouse model of primary familial brain calcification, Pdgfb ret/ret , to investigate the role of microglia in calcification of the NVU. We report that microglia enclosing vessel calcifications, coined calcification-associated microglia, display a distinct activation phenotype. Pharmacological ablation of microglia with the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622 leads to aggravated vessel calcification. Mechanistically, we show that microglia require functional TREM2 for controlling vascular calcification. Our results demonstrate that microglial activity in the setting of pathological vascular calcification is beneficial. In addition, we identify a previously unrecognized function of microglia in halting the expansion of vascular calcification.},

The device we realize implements entangled two-photon quantum walks on any five-vertex graph, with continuously tunable particle exchange symmetry and indistinguishability. We show how this simulates single-particle walks on larger graphs, with size and geometry controlled by tuning the properties of the composite quantum walkers. We apply the device to quantum walk algorithms for searching vertices in graphs and testing for graph isomorphisms. In doing so, we implement up to 100 sampled time steps of quantum walk evolution on each of 292 different graphs. This opens the way to large-scale, programmable quantum walk processors for classically intractable applications.},

We show that this differentiation method, which does not rely on the addition of exogenous growth factors to culture media, provides an artifact-free approach to identifying bioactive metabolites that specifically and potently induce osteogenesis. We first identify a highly specific metabolite, cholesterol sulfate, an endogenous steroid. Next, a screen of other small molecules with a similar steroid scaffold identified fludrocortisone acetate with both specific and highly potent osteogenic-inducing activity. Further, we implicate cytoskeletal contractility as a measure of osteogenic potency and cell stiffness as a measure of specificity.

Until recently, the impact of local depositional conditions on δ 34 S pyr has remained underappreciated, and stratigraphic variations in δ 34 S pyr were interpreted mostly to reflect global changes in biogeochemical cycling. We present two coeval δ 34 S pyr records from shelf and basin settings in a single sedimentary system. Despite their proximity and contemporaneous deposition, these two records preserve radically different geochemical signals. Swings of ~65‰ in shelf δ 34 S pyr track short-term variations in local sedimentation and are completely absent from the abyssal record. In contrast, a long-term ~30‰ decrease in abyssal δ 34 S pyr reflects regional changes in ocean circulation and/or sustained pyrite formation. These results highlight strong local controls on δ 34 S pyr , calling for reevaluation of the current practice of using δ 34 S pyr stratigraphic variations to infer global changes in Earth’s surface environment.},

Plasma cell abundance correlated with the density of mesenchymal cells in clinical specimens of HGSCs. Coculture of nonmesenchymal ovarian cancer cells and plasma cells induced a mesenchymal phenotype of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Phenotypic switch was mediated by the transfer of plasma cell–derived exosomes containing miR-330-3p into nonmesenchymal ovarian cancer cells. Exosome-derived miR-330-3p increased expression of junctional adhesion molecule B in a noncanonical fashion. Depletion of plasma cells by bortezomib reversed the mesenchymal characteristics of ovarian cancer and inhibited in vivo tumor growth.

Electroconvection, which originates from the coupling of the imposed electric field and a charged fluid near an electrode surface, is believed to be responsible for dendrite growth. However, few studies are performed at the scale of fidelity where root causes and effective strategies for controlling electroconvection and dendrite growth can be investigated in tandem. Using microfluidics, we showed that forced convection across the electrode surface (cross-flow) during electrodeposition reduced metal dendrite growth (97.7 to 99.4\%) and delayed the onset of electroconvective instabilities. Our results highlighted the roles of forced convection in reducing dendrite growth and electroconvective instabilities and provided a route toward effective strategies for managing the consequences of instability in electrokinetics-based processes where electromigration dominates ion diffusion near electrodes.},

  abstract     = {Coral reefs were traditionally perceived as productive hot spots in oligotrophic waters. While modern evidence indicates that many coral reef food webs are heavily subsidized by planktonic production, the pathways through which this occurs remain unresolved. We used the analytical power of carbon isotope analysis of essential amino acids to distinguish between alternative carbon pathways supporting four key reef predators across an oceanic atoll. This technique separates benthic versus planktonic inputs, further identifying two distinct planktonic pathways (nearshore reef-associated plankton and offshore pelagic plankton), and revealing that these reef predators are overwhelmingly sustained by offshore pelagic sources rather than by reef sources (including reef-associated plankton). Notably, pelagic reliance did not vary between species or reef habitats, emphasizing that allochthonous energetic subsidies may have system-wide importance. These results help explain how coral reefs maintain exceptional productivity in apparently nutrient-poor tropical settings, but also emphasize their susceptibility to future ocean productivity fluctuations.},

  abstract     = {The spike S of SARS-CoV-2 recognizes ACE2 on the host cell membrane to initiate entry. Soluble decoy receptors, in which the ACE2 ectodomain is engineered to block S with high affinity, potently neutralize infection and, because of close similarity with the natural receptor, hold out the promise of being broadly active against virus variants without opportunity for escape. Here, we directly test this hypothesis. We find that an engineered decoy receptor, sACE2 2 .v2.4, tightly binds S of SARS-associated viruses from humans and bats, despite the ACE2-binding surface being a region of high diversity. Saturation mutagenesis of the receptor-binding domain followed by in vitro selection, with wild-type ACE2 and the engineered decoy competing for binding sites, failed to find S mutants that discriminate in favor of the wild-type receptor. We conclude that resistance to engineered decoys will be rare and that decoys may be active against future outbreaks of SARS-associated betacoronaviruses.},

However, the two topologically robust electronic phases are typically incompatible owing to conflicting magnetic field requirements. Combined advances in the epitaxial growth of a nitride superconductor with a high critical temperature and a subsequent nitride semiconductor heterostructure of metal polarity enable the observation of clean integer quantum Hall effect in the polarization-induced two-dimensional (2D) electron gas of the high-electron mobility transistor. Through individual magnetotransport measurements of the spatially separated GaN 2D electron gas and superconducting NbN layers, we find a small window of magnetic fields and temperatures in which the epitaxial layers retain their respective quantum Hall and superconducting properties. Its analysis indicates that in epitaxial nitride superconductor/semiconductor heterostructures, this window can be significantly expanded, creating an industrially viable platform for robust quantum devices that exploit topologically protected transport.},

Vital intermediary steps are localized to mitochondria, but it remains unclear how one-carbon availability connects to mitochondrial function. Here, we show that the one-carbon metabolite and methyl group donor S -adenosylmethionine (SAM) is pivotal for energy metabolism. A gradual decline in mitochondrial SAM (mitoSAM) causes hierarchical defects in fly and mouse, comprising loss of mitoSAM-dependent metabolites and impaired assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Complex I stability and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis are directly controlled by mitoSAM levels, while other protein targets are predominantly methylated outside of the organelle before import. The mitoSAM pool follows its cytosolic production, establishing mitochondria as responsive receivers of one-carbon units. Thus, we demonstrate that cellular methylation potential is required for energy metabolism, with direct relevance for pathophysiology, aging, and cancer.},

We built multifunctional proteins integrating both transcriptional and posttranslational control, validated models for describing these mechanisms, implemented digital and analog processing, and effectively linked genetic circuits with sensors for multi-input evaluations. The functional modularity and compositional versatility of these parts enable one to satisfy a given design objective via multiple synonymous programs.

However, the quantitative study of this process remains difficult because it can be influenced by many mechanisms. Conflicting results on similar experimental systems are frequently obtained when the experimental conditions are not well controlled, which is mainly due to the fact that many mechanisms can be at work simultaneously. Moreover, it is often that macroscopic or empirical measures, which lack microscopic physical bases, are used to explain the experimental findings and therefore cannot provide an accurate and complete depiction of the overall process. Here, we carry out a detailed and systematic microscopic structure and dynamics study of a cyclically sheared granular system with rigorously controlled experimental conditions.

We systematically explore the influence of the kinetic energy and the irradiation fluence on the generation of luminescent centers. We find modifications of their density for both parameters, while a fivefold enhancement is observed with increasing fluence. Molecular dynamics simulations clarify the generation mechanism of these centers and their microscopic nature. We infer that V N C B and V B − are the most likely centers formed.

From a Drosophila screen of human NDD-associated risk genes, we identified the chromatin remodeler Imitation SWItch/SNF ( ISWI ) to be required for adult fly sleep. Loss of ISWI also results in disrupted circadian rhythms, memory, and social behavior, but ISWI acts in different cells and during distinct developmental times to affect each of these adult behaviors. Specifically, ISWI expression in type I neuroblasts is required for both adult sleep and formation of a learning-associated brain region. Expression in flies of the human ISWI homologs SMARCA1 and SMARCA5 differentially rescues adult phenotypes, while de novo SMARCA5 patient variants fail to rescue sleep. We propose that sleep deficits are a primary phenotype of early developmental origin in NDDs and point toward chromatin remodeling machinery as critical for sleep circuit formation.},

  abstract     = {Crown-like structures (CLSs) are adipose microenvironments of macrophages engulfing adipocytes. Their histological density in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) predicts metabolic disorder progression in obesity and is believed to initiate obesity comorbidities. Here, we use three-dimensional (3D) light sheet microscopy and deep learning to quantify 3D features of VAT CLSs in lean and obese states. Obese CLS densities are significantly higher, composing 3.9\% of tissue volume compared with 0.46\% in lean tissue. Across the states, individual CLS structural characteristics span similar ranges; however, subpopulations are distinguishable. Obese VAT contains large CLSs absent from lean tissues, located near the tissue center, while lean CLSs have higher volumetric cell densities and prolate shapes. These features are consistent with inefficient adipocyte elimination in obesity that contributes to chronic inflammation, representing histological biomarkers to assess adipose pathogenesis. This tissue processing, imaging, and analysis pipeline can be applied to quantitatively classify 3D microenvironments across diverse tissues.},

  abstract     = {Living tissues embody a unique class of hybrid materials in which active and thermal forces are inextricably linked. Mechanical characterization of tissues demands descriptors that respect this hybrid nature. In this work, we develop a microrheology-based force spectrum analysis (FSA) technique to dissect the active and passive fluctuations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models. In two different stromal models and a 3D breast cancer spheroid model, our FSA reveals emergent hybrid dynamics that involve both high-frequency stress stiffening and low-frequency fluidization of the ECM. We show that this is a general consequence of nonlinear coupling between active forces and the frequency-dependent viscoelasticity of stress-stiffening networks. In 3D breast cancer spheroids, this dual active stiffening and fluidization is tightly connected with invasion. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby breast cancer cells reconcile the seemingly contradictory requirements for both tension and malleability in the ECM during invasion.},

Although many types of stresses causing this differential regulation are known, it is unknown how changes over time of the same stressor regulate cell fate. Changes in extracellular osmolarity are critically involved in physiological and pathophysiological processes in several tissues. We observe that human cells survive gradual but not acute hyperosmotic stress. We find that stress, caspase, and apoptosis signaling do not activate during gradual stress in contrast to acute treatments. Contrary to the current paradigm, we see a substantial accumulation of proline in cells treated with gradual but not acute stresses. We show that proline can protect cells from hyperosmotic stress similar to the osmoprotection in plants and bacteria. Our studies found a cell fate switch that enables cells to survive gradually changing stress environments by preventing caspase activation and protect cells through proline accumulation.},

  abstract     = {Wnt/β-catenin signaling requires inhibition of a multiprotein destruction complex that targets β-catenin for proteasomal degradation. SOX9 is a potent antagonist of the Wnt pathway and has been proposed to act through direct binding to β-catenin or the β-catenin destruction complex. Here, we demonstrate that SOX9 promotes turnover of β-catenin in mammalian cell culture, but this occurs independently of the destruction complex and the proteasome. This activity requires SOX9’s ability to activate transcription. Transcriptome analysis revealed that SOX9 induces the expression of the Notch coactivator Mastermind-like transcriptional activator 2 (MAML2), which is required for SOX9-dependent Wnt/β-catenin antagonism. MAML2 promotes β-catenin turnover independently of Notch signaling, and MAML2 appears to associate directly with β-catenin in an in vitro binding assay. This work defines a previously unidentified pathway that promotes β-catenin degradation, acting in parallel to established mechanisms. SOX9 uses this pathway to restrict Wnt/β-catenin signaling.},

Here, we investigate the Floquet system of periodically driven 129 Xe gas under damping feedback and unexpectedly observe a multimode maser that oscillates at frequencies of transitions between Floquet states. Our findings extend maser techniques to Floquet systems and open avenues to probe Floquet phenomena unaffected by decoherence, enabling a previously unexplored class of maser sensors. As a first application, our maser offers the capability of measuring low-frequency (1 to 100 mHz) magnetic fields with subpicotesla-level sensitivity, which is substantially better than state-of-the-art magnetometers and can be applied to, for example, ultralight dark matter searches.},

Many oncogenic signaling pathways target the translation initiation stage to satisfy the increased anabolic demands of cancer cells. Using quantitative profiling of initiating ribosomes, we found that ribosomal pausing at the start codon serves as a “brake” to restrain the translational output. In response to oncogenic RAS signaling, the initiation pausing relaxes and contributes to the increased translational flux. Intriguingly, messenger RNA (mRNA) m 6 A modification in the vicinity of start codons influences the behavior of initiating ribosomes. Under oncogenic RAS signaling, the reduced mRNA methylation leads to relaxed initiation pausing, thereby promoting malignant transformation and tumor growth. Restored initiation pausing by inhibiting m 6 A demethylases suppresses RAS-mediated oncogenic translation and subsequent tumorigenesis. Our findings unveil a paradigm of translational control that is co-opted by RAS mutant cancer cells to drive malignant phenotypes.},

We found that tumor cells were stably residing in the BM with little evidence for recirculation. To elucidate the mechanism of depletion, we designed a dual fluorescent reporter to visualize phagocytosis and apoptosis. ADP by BM-associated macrophages was the primary mode of tumor elimination but was no longer active after one hour, resulting in partial depletion.

Active de novo synthesis of highly basic polyamines within TAMCs efficiently buffered low intracellular pH to support the survival of these immunosuppressive cells in the harsh acidic environment of solid tumors. Administration of difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a clinically approved inhibitor of polyamine generation, enhanced animal survival in immunocompetent mice by causing a tumor-specific reduction of polyamines and decreased intracellular pH in TAMCs. DFMO combination with immunotherapy or radiotherapy further enhanced animal survival.

While their migration mode as individual GnRH neurons has been extensively studied, the role of GnRH-GnRH cell communication during migration remains largely unexplored. Here, we show in awake zebrafish larvae that migrating GnRH neurons pause at the nasal-forebrain junction and form clusters that act as interhemisphere neuronal ensembles. Within the ensembles, GnRH neurons create an isolated, spontaneously active circuit that is internally wired through monosynaptic glutamatergic synapses into which newborn GnRH neurons integrate before entering the brain. This initial phase of integration drives a phenotypic switch, which is essential for GnRH neurons to properly migrate toward their hypothalamic destination.

  abstract     = {Drug abuse is a foremost public health problem. Cocaine is a widely abused drug worldwide that produces various reward-related behaviors. The mechanisms that underlie cocaine-induced disorders are unresolved, and effective treatments are lacking. Here, we found that an autophagy-related protein Becn2 is a previously unidentified regulator of cocaine reward behaviors. Becn2 deletion protects mice from cocaine-stimulated locomotion and reward behaviors, as well as cocaine-induced dopamine accumulation and signaling, by increasing presynaptic dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) autoreceptors in dopamine neurons. Becn2 regulates D2R endolysosomal trafficking, degradation, and cocaine-induced behaviors via interacting with a D2R-bound adaptor GASP1. Inactivating Becn2 by upstream autophagy inhibitors stabilizes striatal presynaptic D2R, reduces dopamine release and signaling, and prevents cocaine reward in normal mice. Thus, the autophagy protein Becn2 is essential for cocaine psychomotor stimulation and reward through regulating dopamine neurotransmission, and targeting Becn2 by autophagy inhibitors is a potential strategy to prevent cocaine-induced behaviors.},

Here, we report the experimental measurements of the onset of shear amorphization in single-crystal boron carbide by nanoindentation and transmission electron microscopy. We verified that rate-dependent loading discontinuity, i.e., pop-in, in nanoindentation load-displacement curves results from the formation of nanosized amorphous bands via shear amorphization. Stochastic analysis of the pop-in events reveals an exceptionally small activation volume, slow nucleation rate, and lower activation energy of the shear amorphization, suggesting that the high-pressure structural transition is activated and initiated by dislocation nucleation. This dislocation-mediated amorphization has important implications in understanding the failure mechanisms of superhard materials at stresses far below their theoretical strengths.},

Human CtIP promotes homology-mediated repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and protects stalled replication forks from nucleolytic degradation, thus representing an attractive candidate for targeted cancer therapy. Here, we establish a peptide mimetic of the CtIP tetramerization motif that inhibits CtIP activity. The hydrocarbon-stapled peptide encompassing amino acid residues 18 to 28 of CtIP (SP 18–28 ) stably binds to CtIP tetramers in vitro and facilitates their aggregation into higher-order structures. Efficient intracellular uptake of SP 18–28 abrogates CtIP localization to damaged chromatin, impairs DSB repair, and triggers extensive fork degradation. Moreover, prolonged SP 18–28 treatment causes hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and selectively reduces the viability of BRCA1 -mutated cancer cell lines. Together, our data provide a basis for the future development of CtIP-targeting compounds with the potential to treat patients with cancer.},

Here, we report a direct evaluation of the effect of quantum coherence on the efficiency of three natural complexes. An open quantum systems approach allows us to simultaneously identify their level of “quantumness” and efficiency, under natural physiological conditions. We show that these systems reside in a mixed quantum-classical regime, characterized by dephasing-assisted transport. Yet, we find that the change in efficiency at this regime is minute at best, implying that the presence of quantum coherence does not play a substantial role in enhancing efficiency. However, in this regime, efficiency is independent of any structural parameters, suggesting that evolution may have driven natural complexes to their parameter regime to “design” their structure for other uses.},

To investigate sequence encoding in cortex and hippocampus, we recorded from intracranial electrodes in human subjects as they were exposed to auditory and visual sequences containing temporal regularities. We find neural tracking of regularities within minutes, with characteristic profiles across brain areas. Early processing tracked lower-level features (e.g., syllables) and learned units (e.g., words), while later processing tracked only learned units. Learning rapidly shaped neural representations, with a gradient of complexity from early brain areas encoding transitional probability, to associative regions and hippocampus encoding ordinal position and identity of units.

The physical conditions within subglacial lakes are critical to evaluating how and where life may best exist. Here, we propose that Earth’s geothermal flux provides efficient stirring of Antarctic subglacial lake water. We demonstrate that most lakes are in a regime of vigorous turbulent vertical convection, enabling suspension of spherical particulates with diameters up to 36 micrometers. Thus, dynamic conditions support efficient mixing of nutrient- and oxygen-enriched meltwater derived from the overlying ice, which is essential for biome support within the water column. We caution that accreted ice analysis cannot always be used as a proxy for water sampling of lakes beneath a thin (&lt;3.166 kilometers) ice cover, because a stable layer isolates the well-mixed bulk water from the ice-water interface where freezing may occur.},

However, the specific molecular mechanisms driving immune suppression, as well as the capacity of immune cells to adapt to the suppressive environment, are not completely understood. Thus, here, we used an in vitro microfluidic tumor-on-a-chip platform to evaluate how NK cells respond to the tumor-induced suppressive environment. The results demonstrated that the suppressive environment created by the tumor gradually eroded NK cell cytotoxic capacity, leading to compromised NK cell surveillance and tumor tolerance. Further, NK cell exhaustion persisted for an extended period of time after removing NK cells from the microfluidic platform.

The masses and orbits of Venus, Earth, Theia (which later collided with Earth to form the Moon), and Mars are all consistent with pebble accretion onto protoplanets that formed around Mars’ orbit and migrated to their final positions while growing. The isotopic compositions of Earth and Mars are matched qualitatively by accretion of two generations of pebbles, carrying distinct isotopic signatures.

In addition, neurodevelopmental defects were also manifested in hMLOs carrying the mutations. Transcriptomic analyses followed by experimental validation revealed that defects in DNAJC6-mediated endocytosis impair the WNT-LMX1A signal during the mDA neuron development. Furthermore, reduced LMX1A expression during development caused the generation of vulnerable mDA neurons with the pathologic manifestations.

Restoring cortex cell size by cell type–specific KOR1 complementation, by isolating a genetic kor1 suppressor, and by lowering turgor pressure with hyperosmotic treatments abolished JA-Ile signaling. Conversely, hypoosmotic treatment activated JA-Ile signaling in wild-type plants. Furthermore, constitutive JA-Ile levels guided mutant roots toward greater water availability.

It is one of the very rare examples, if not the only one for the Paleolithic period, of a musical instrument fashioned from a large shell, and the first conch shell of this use thus far discovered. We already know that prehistoric people transformed many shells into portable ornaments and that they thus attributed substantial corporal symbolism to them. This seashell horn, with its unique sonority, both deep and strong with an enduring reverberation, sheds light on a musical dimension until now unknown in the context of Upper Paleolithic societies.},

  abstract     = {Liquid mixtures are ubiquitous. Miscibility and dielectric constant are fundamental properties that govern the applications of liquid mixtures. However, despite their importance, miscibility is usually predicted qualitatively based on the vaguely defined polarity of the liquids, and the dielectric constant of the mixture is modeled by introducing mixing rules. Here, we develop a first-principles theory for polar liquid mixtures using a statistical field approach, without resorting to mixing rules. With this theory, we obtain simple expressions for the mixture’s dielectric constant and free energy of mixing. The dielectric constant predicted by this theory agrees well with measured data for simple binary mixtures. On the basis of the derived free energy of mixing, we can construct a miscibility map in the parameter space of the dielectric constant and molar volume for each liquid. The predicted miscibility shows remarkable agreement with known data, thus providing a quantitative basis for the empirical “like-dissolves-like” rule.},

Given our inability to perform massive classical neutralization assays due to the scarce availability of BSL-3 facilities in the country, we developed and fully characterized an HIV-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype, which was used in a 96-well plate format to investigate NAb responses in samples from individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or treated with convalescent plasma. We also identified samples with decreased or enhanced neutralization activity against the D614G spike variant compared with the wild type, indicating the relevance of this variant in host immunity.

Here, we determined the crystal structure of the Mg 2+ -bound CorC TM domain dimer. Each protomer has a single Mg 2+ binding site with a fully dehydrated Mg 2+ ion. The residues at the Mg 2+ binding site are strictly conserved in both human CNNM2 and CNNM4, and many of these residues are associated with genetic diseases. Furthermore, we determined the structures of the CorC cytoplasmic region containing its regulatory ATP-binding domain. A combination of structural and functional analyses not only revealed the potential interface between the TM and cytoplasmic domains but also showed that ATP binding is important for the Mg 2+ export activity of CorC.},

While loop extrusion constitutes a fundamental building block of chromosomes, other factors may be equally important. Here, we show that yeast cohesin exhibits pronounced clustering on DNA, with all the hallmarks of biomolecular condensation. DNA-cohesin clusters exhibit liquid-like behavior, showing fusion of clusters, rapid fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and exchange of cohesin with the environment. Strikingly, the in vitro clustering is DNA length dependent, as cohesin forms clusters only on DNA exceeding 3 kilo–base pairs. We discuss how bridging-induced phase separation, a previously unobserved type of biological condensation, can explain the DNA-cohesin clustering through DNA-cohesin-DNA bridges. We confirm that, in yeast cells in vivo, a fraction of cohesin associates with chromatin in a manner consistent with bridging-induced phase separation. Biomolecular condensation by SMC proteins constitutes a new basic principle by which SMC complexes direct genome organization.},

However, this ideal situation has hitherto been infeasible for efficient fluorescent organic molecules. Here, we report a highly emissive metal-free purely organic fluorophore that enables thermal equilibration between singlet and triplet excited states. The key to this unconventional excitonic behavior is the exceptionally fast spin-flipping reverse intersystem crossing from the triplet to singlet excited states with a rate constant exceeding 10 8 per second, which is considerably higher than that of radiative decay (fluorescence) from the singlet excited state. The present fluorophoric system exhibits an emission lifetime as short as 750 nanoseconds and, therefore, allows organic light-emitting diodes to demonstrate external electroluminescence quantum efficiency exceeding 20\% even at a practical high luminance of more than 10, 000 candelas per square meter.},

Here, highly sensitive piezoelectric mobile acoustic sensor (PMAS) is demonstrated by exploiting an ultrathin membrane for biomimetic frequency band control. Simulation results prove that resonant bandwidth of a piezoelectric film can be broadened by adopting a lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) membrane on the ultrathin polymer to cover the entire voice spectrum. Machine learning–based biometric authentication is demonstrated by the integrated acoustic sensor module with an algorithm processor and customized Android app. Last, exceptional error rate reduction in speaker identification is achieved by a PMAS module with a small amount of training data, compared to a conventional microelectromechanical system microphone.},

We term these newly identified mitochondria-derived EVs “mitovesicles.” We demonstrate that brain-derived mitovesicles contain a specific subset of mitochondrial constituents and that their levels and cargo are altered during pathophysiological processes where mitochondrial dysfunction occurs, including in DS.

Stage 1 allows a quick decentralized readout for early isolation of presymptomatic or asymptomatic patients.

The same reaction products from potentially hundreds of thousands of samples can then be pooled and used in a highly multiplexed sequencing–based assay in stage 2. This second stage confirms the near-patient testing results and facilitates centralized data collection. The 95\% limit of detection is &lt;50 copies of viral RNA per reaction.

In this study, we use generalized synthesis variables for hydrogels that emphasize how changes in formulation affect the resulting network structure. We identify two independent linear correlations between these synthesis variables and swelling behavior. Analysis through recently updated swollen polymer network models suggests that synthesis-swelling correlations can be used to make a priori predictions of the stiffness and solute diffusivity characteristics of synthetic hydrogels. The same experiments and analyses performed on methacrylamide-modified gelatin hydrogels demonstrate that complex biopolymer structures disrupt the linear synthesis-swelling correlations.

Close examination of pathway expression in the top-performing, as well as other isolates, reveals the complexity of cellular metabolism and regulation, underscoring the need for precise optimization while integrating pathway genes into the chromosome.

  abstract     = {We report light-driven levitation of macroscopic polymer films with nanostructured surface as candidates for long-duration near-space flight. We levitated centimeter-scale disks made of commercial 0.5-micron-thick mylar film coated with carbon nanotubes on one side. When illuminated with light intensity comparable to natural sunlight, the polymer disk heats up and interacts with incident gas molecules differently on the top and bottom sides, producing a net recoil force. We observed the levitation of 6-mm-diameter disks in a vacuum chamber at pressures between 10 and 30 Pa. Moreover, we controlled the flight of the disks using a shaped light field that optically trapped the levitating disks. Our experimentally validated theoretical model predicts that the lift forces can be many times the weight of the films, allowing payloads of up to 10 milligrams for sunlight-powered low-cost microflyers at altitudes of 50 to 100 km.},

Here, we report a high-performance wearable TEG with superior stretchability, self-healability, recyclability, and Lego-like reconfigurability, by combining modular thermoelectric chips, dynamic covalent polyimine, and flowable liquid-metal electrical wiring in a mechanical architecture design of “soft motherboard-rigid plugin modules.” A record-high open-circuit voltage among flexible TEGs is achieved, reaching 1 V/cm 2 at a temperature difference of 95 K. Furthermore, this TEG is integrated with a wavelength-selective metamaterial film on the cold side, leading to greatly improved device performance under solar irradiation, which is critically important for wearable energy harvesting during outdoor activities. The optimal properties and design concepts of TEGs reported here can pave the way for delivering the next-generation high-performance, adaptable, customizable, durable, economical, and eco-friendly energy-harvesting devices with wide applications.},

Existing technologies use intravascular placement of glass fiber-optic catheters that pose risks of blood vessel damage, thrombosis, and infection. In addition, physical tethers to power supply systems and data acquisition hardware limit freedom of movement and add clutter to the intensive care unit. This report introduces a wireless, miniaturized, implantable optoelectronic catheter system incorporating optical components on the probe, encapsulated by soft biocompatible materials, as alternative technology that avoids these disadvantages. The absence of physical tethers and the flexible, biocompatible construction of the probe represent key defining features, resulting in a high-performance, patient-friendly implantable oximeter that can monitor localized tissue oxygenation, heart rate, and respiratory activity with wireless, real-time, continuous operation.

Using 1149 radiocarbon dates linked to 115 pottery styles recovered from 726 sites throughout the Congo rainforest and adjacent areas, we show that this is not the case. Two periods of more intense human activity, each consisting of an expansion phase with widespread pottery styles and a regionalization phase with many more local pottery styles, are separated by a widespread population collapse between 400 and 600 CE followed by major resettlement centuries later. Coinciding with wetter climatic conditions, the collapse was possibly promoted by a prolonged epidemic. Comparison of our data with genetic and linguistic evidence further supports a spread-over-spread model for the dispersal of Bantu speakers and their languages.},

Here, we reported that a semisynthetic sulfated chitosan (SCS) readily engaged anti-inflammatory macrophages and increased its secretion of endogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to induce angiogenesis in ischemia via a VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling pathway. The depletion of host macrophages abrogated VEGF secretion and vascularization in implants, and the inhibition of VEGF or VEGFR2 signaling also disrupted the macrophage-associated angiogenesis. In addition, in a macrophage-inhibited mouse model, SCS efficiently helped to recover the endogenous levels of VEGF and the number of CD31 hi Emcn hi vessels in ischemia. Thus, both sulfated group and pentasaccharide sequence in SCS played an important role in directing the therapeutic angiogenesis, indicating that this highly bioactive biomaterial can be harnessed to treat ischemic disease.},

PGE 2 through its receptor EP4 diminishes T reg -favorable commensal microbiota. Transfer of the gut microbiota that was modified by PGE 2 -EP4 signaling modulates mucosal T reg responses and exacerbates intestinal inflammation. Mechanistically, PGE 2 -modified microbiota regulates intestinal mononuclear phagocytes and type I interferon signaling. Depletion of mononuclear phagocytes or deficiency of type I interferon receptor diminishes PGE 2 -dependent T reg inhibition.

Sperm small RNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs) in particular, exhibit distinct expression profiles in F0 males of depression-like model and recapitulate paternal depressive-like phenotypes in F1 offspring. Neutralization of the abnormal miRNAs in zygotes by antisense strands rescues the acquired depressive-like phenotypes in F1 offspring born to F0 males of depression-like model. Mechanistically, sperm miRNAs reshape early embryonic transcriptional profiles in the core neuronal circuits toward depression-like phenotypes.

Cell lines from this subset expressed undetectable SCD, yet retained residual SCD enzymatic activity. Unexpectedly, these lines evolved to survive independent of SCD through unknown mechanisms. Cell lines that escaped such genetic and epigenetic alterations expressed higher levels of SCD and were highly dependent on SCD for survival. Last, we identify that SCD-dependent lines acquire resistance through a previously unknown FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (FOSB)–mediated mechanism.

Here, we show that methanogenesis was already present in the common ancestor of Euryarchaeota, TACK archaea, and Asgard archaea likely in the late Hadean or early Archean eon and that the ancestral methanogen was dependent on methylated compounds and hydrogen. Carbon dioxide–reducing methanogenesis developed later through the evolution of tetrahydromethanopterin S -methyltransferase, which linked methanogenesis to the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway for energy conservation. Multicarbon alkane metabolisms in Archaea also originated early, with genes coding for the activation of short- or even long-chain alkanes likely evolving from an ethane-metabolizing ancestor. These genes were likely horizontally transferred to multiple archaeal clades including Candidatus ( Ca .) Bathyarchaeota, Ca. Helarchaeota, Ca . Hadesarchaeota, and the methanogenic Ca.

However, confinement in soil can markedly reduce the ability of hydrogels to absorb water and swell, limiting their widespread adoption. Unfortunately, the underlying reason remains unknown. By directly visualizing the swelling of hydrogels confined in three-dimensional granular media, we demonstrate that the extent of hydrogel swelling is determined by the competition between the force exerted by the hydrogel due to osmotic swelling and the confining force transmitted by the surrounding grains. Furthermore, the medium can itself be restructured by hydrogel swelling, as set by the balance between the osmotic swelling force, the confining force, and intergrain friction. Together, our results provide quantitative principles to predict how hydrogels behave in confinement, potentially improving their use in agriculture as well as informing other applications such as oil recovery, construction, mechanobiology, and filtration.},

We conducted cell-based high-throughput screening to investigate time-of-day influences on the activity of known antitumor agents and found that many compounds exhibit daily rhythms of cytotoxicity concomitant with previously reported oscillations of target genes. Rhythmic action of HSP90 inhibitors was mediated by specific isoforms of HSP90, genetic perturbation of which affected the cell cycle. Furthermore, clock mutants affected the cell cycle in parallel with abrogating rhythms of cytotoxicity, and pharmacological inhibition of the cell cycle also eliminated rhythmic drug effects. An HSP90 inhibitor reduced growth rate of a mouse melanoma in a time-of-day–specific manner, but efficacy was impaired in clock-deficient tumors. These results provide a powerful rationale for appropriate daily timing of anticancer drugs and suggest circadian regulation of the cell cycle within the tumor as an underlying mechanism.},

EPCs consist of IFESC-derived Tbx3 + –basal cells (Tbx3 + -BCs) and their neighboring cells where Adam8–extracellular signal–regulated kinase signaling is activated. Clonal lineage tracing revealed that Tbx3 + -BC clones emerge in the abdominal epidermis during pregnancy, followed by differentiation after parturition. In the plantar epidermis, Tbx3 + -BCs are sustained as long-lived SCs to maintain EPCs invariably. We showed that Tbx3 + -BCs are vasculature-dependent IFESCs and identified mechanical stretch as an external cue for the vasculature-driven EPC formation. Our results uncover vasculature-mediated IFESC regulations, which explain how the epidermis adjusts its size in orchestration with dermal constituents in dynamic skin.},

  abstract     = {Cortical function can be shaped by sensory experience during a critical period. The onset of the critical period is thought to coincide with the onset of thalamocortical transmission to the thalamo-recipient layer 4 (L4). In early development, subplate neurons (SPNs), and not L4 neurons, are the first targets of thalamic afferents. SPNs are transiently involved in early development and are largely eliminated during development. Activation of L4 by thalamic afferents coincides with the opening of ear canal (~P11 in mice) and precedes the later critical period. Here, we show in mice that abolishing peripheral function or presenting sound stimuli even before P11 leads to bidirectionally altered functional connectivity of SPNs in auditory cortex. Thus, early sensory experience can sculpt subplate circuits before thalamocortical circuits to L4 are mature. Our results show that peripheral activity shapes cortical circuits in a sequential manner and from earlier ages than has been appreciated.},

Here, we report an effective additive strategy to grow 2-inch-sized high-quality FAMACs SCs. It is found that the judiciously selected reductant [formic acid (FAH)] effectively minimizes iodide oxidation and cation deprotonation responsible for phase segregation. Consequently, the FAMACs SC shows more than fivefold enhancement in carrier lifetimes, high charge mobility, long carrier diffusion distance, as well as superior uniformity and long-term stability, making it possible for us to design high-performance self-powered integrated circuit photodetector. The device exhibits large responsivity, high photoconductive gain, excellent detectivity, and fast response speed; all values are among the highest reported to date for planar-type single-crystalline perovskite photodetectors. Furthermore, an integrated imaging system is fabricated on the basis of 12 × 12 pixelated matrixes of the single-crystal photodetectors.},

The observations (from April 2018 to April 2019) sample a broad range of events on Mars, including a global dust storm, the evolution of water released from the southern polar cap during southern summer, the equinox phases, and a short but intense regional dust storm. In three instances, we observe water at very high altitudes (&gt;80 km), the prime region where water is photodissociated and starts its escape to space. Rayleigh distillation appears the be the driving force affecting the D/H in many cases, yet in some instances, the exchange of water reservoirs with distinctive D/H could be responsible.},

A recessive mutation in the USP11 gene is found in a rare neurodevelopmental disorder with intellectual disability, but its pathogenicity and molecular mechanism are unknown. Here, we show that mouse Usp11 is expressed highly in embryonic cerebral cortex, and Usp11 deficiency impairs layer 6 neuron production, delays late-born neuronal migration, and disturbs cognition and anxiety behaviors. Mechanistically, these functions are mediated by a previously unidentified Usp11 substrate, Sox11. Usp11 ablation compromises Sox11 protein accumulation in the developing cortex, despite the induction of Sox11 mRNA. The disease-associated Usp11 mutant fails to stabilize Sox11 and is unable to support cortical neurogenesis and neuronal migration. Our findings define a critical function of Usp11 in cortical development and highlight the importance of orchestrating protein stabilization mechanisms into transcription regulatory programs for a robust induction of cell fate determinants during early brain development.},

Immunocompetent mouse models and in vitro co-culture assays demonstrated that EPIC1 induces tumor immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy by suppressing tumor cell antigen presentation. Mechanistically, lincRNA EPIC1 interacts with the histone methyltransferase EZH2, leading to the epigenetic silencing of IFNGR1 , TAP1/2 , ERAP1/2 , and MHC-I genes. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 abolish EPIC1’s immune-related oncogenic effect and its suppression of interferon-γ signaling.

Computational modeling predicted reduced hypoxic stress and improved insulin secretion compared to static culture. Experimental validation via serial, high-content, and noninvasive assessments quantitatively confirmed that the MPS platform retained organoid viability and functionality for at least 10 days, in stark contrast to the acute decline observed overnight under static conditions.

We find that forest loss in the intermountain and Rocky Mountain West causes net planetary cooling but losses east of the Mississippi River and in Pacific Coast states tend toward net warming. Actual U.S. forest conversions from 1986 to 2000 cause net cooling for a decade but then transition to a large net warming over a century. Avoiding these forest conversions could have yielded a 100-year average annual global cooling of 0.00088°C. This would offset 17\% of the 100-year climate warming effect from a single year of U.S. fossil fuel emissions, underscoring the scale of the mitigation challenge.},

We find that a vaccine with effectiveness ≥50\% would be enough to substantially mitigate the ongoing pandemic, provided that a high percentage of the population is optimally vaccinated. When minimizing deaths, we find that for low vaccine effectiveness, irrespective of vaccination coverage, it is optimal to allocate vaccine to high-risk (older) age groups first. In contrast, for higher vaccine effectiveness, there is a switch to allocate vaccine to high-transmission (younger) age groups first for high vaccination coverage.

Because the STN is a major target of deep brain stimulation treatments for Parkinson’s disease, we tested the effect of selective stimulation of Pf-STN projections in a mouse model of PD. Bilateral dopamine depletion with 6-OHDA created complete akinesia in mice, but Pf-STN stimulation immediately and markedly restored a variety of natural behaviors. Our results therefore revealed a functionally novel neural pathway for the initiation of movements that can be recruited to rescue movement deficits after dopamine depletion.

  abstract     = {Streptophyte algae emerged as a land plant with adaptations that eventually led to terrestrialization. Land plants encounter a range of biotic and abiotic stresses that elicit anaerobic stress responses. Here, we show that acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of anaerobic stress, targets and generates ethyl adducts on aminoacyl-tRNA, a central component of the translation machinery. However, elongation factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu) safeguards l -aminoacyl-tRNA, but not d -aminoacyl-tRNA, from being modified by acetaldehyde. We identified a unique activity of archaeal-derived chiral proofreading module, d -aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase 2 (DTD2), that removes N -ethyl adducts formed on d -aminoacyl-tRNAs (NEDATs). Thus, the study provides the molecular basis of ethanol and acetaldehyde hypersensitivity in DTD2 knockout plants. We uncovered an important gene transfer event from methanogenic archaea to the ancestor of land plants. While missing in other algal lineages, DTD2 is conserved from streptophyte algae to land plants, suggesting its role toward the emergence and evolution of land plants.},

Thus, various kinds of machines specially designed for combinatorial optimization have recently been proposed and developed. Toward the realization of higher-performance machines, here, we propose an algorithm based on classical mechanics, which is obtained by modifying a previously proposed algorithm called simulated bifurcation. Our proposed algorithm allows us to achieve not only high speed by parallel computing but also high solution accuracy for problems with up to one million binary variables. Benchmarking shows that our machine based on the algorithm achieves high performance compared to recently developed machines, including a quantum annealer using a superconducting circuit, a coherent Ising machine using a laser, and digital processors based on various algorithms. Thus, high-performance combinatorial optimization is realized by massively parallel implementations of the proposed algorithm based on classical mechanics.},

Here, we show that the virulence factor Nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the host messenger RNA (mRNA) export receptor heterodimer NXF1-NXT1, which is responsible for nuclear export of cellular mRNAs. Nsp1 prevents proper binding of NXF1 to mRNA export adaptors and NXF1 docking at the nuclear pore complex. As a result, a significant number of cellular mRNAs are retained in the nucleus during infection. Increased levels of NXF1 rescues the Nsp1-mediated mRNA export block and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, antagonizing the Nsp1 inhibitory function on mRNA export may represent a strategy to restoring proper antiviral host gene expression in infected cells.},

Overall, a muted immune response was observed in COVID-19 relative to other infections (influenza, other seasonal coronaviruses, and bacterial sepsis), with paradoxical down-regulation of several key differentially expressed genes. Hospitalized patients and outpatients exhibited up-regulation of interferon-associated pathways, although heightened and more robust inflammatory responses were observed in hospitalized patients with more clinically severe illness. Two-layer machine learning–based host classifiers consisting of complete (&gt;1000 genes), medium (&lt;100), and small (&lt;20) gene biomarker panels identified COVID-19 disease with 85.1–86.5\% accuracy when benchmarked using an independent test set.

Compared to alum, immunization with AMP-CpG induced &gt;25-fold higher antigen-specific T cells that produced multiple T helper 1 (T H 1) cytokines and trafficked into lung parenchyma. Antibody responses favored T H 1 isotypes (IgG2c and IgG3) and potently neutralized Spike-2-ACE2 receptor binding, with titers 265-fold higher than natural convalescent patient COVID-19 responses; T cell and antibody responses were maintained despite 10-fold dose reduction in Spike antigen.

We validated the proposed method in 12 human disease datasets and performed an in-depth study of patients with mild and severe symptomatology of the coronavirus disease 2019 for predicting novel therapeutic targets. As a result, we identified the extracellular matrix protein versican and Toll-like receptor 2 as potential targets for modulating the inflammatory response.

Here, we illustrate (i) the disruptive potential of sulfate-chloride reactions in laboratory soil crust experiments, (ii) the formation of thin films of mixed ice-liquid water “slush” at −40° to −20°C on salty Mars analog grains, (iii) how mixtures of sulfates and chlorine salts affect their solubilities in low-temperature environments, and (iv) how these salt brines could be contributing to RSL formation on Mars. Our results demonstrate that interactions of sulfates and chlorine salts in fine-grained soils on Mars could absorb water, expand, deliquesce, cause subsidence, form crusts, disrupt surfaces, and ultimately produce landslides after dust loading on these unstable surfaces.},

While actomyosin networks are extensively studied, how interactions between actin and microtubules, ubiquitous in the cytoskeleton, influence actomyosin activity remains an open question. Here, we create a network of co-entangled actin and microtubules driven by myosin II. We combine dynamic differential microscopy, particle image velocimetry, and particle tracking to show that both actin and microtubules undergo ballistic contraction with unexpectedly indistinguishable characteristics. This contractility is distinct from faster disordered motion and rupturing that active actin networks exhibit. Our results suggest that microtubules enable self-organized myosin-driven contraction by providing flexural rigidity and enhanced connectivity to actin networks. Beyond the immediate relevance to cytoskeletal dynamics, our results shed light on the design of active materials that can be precisely tuned by the network composition.},

An unbiased proteomic approach to identify S-nitrosylated proteins in valve cells found enrichment of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and implicated S-nitrosylation of USP9X (ubiquitin specific peptidase 9, X-linked) in NOTCH regulation during calcification. Furthermore, S-nitrosylated USP9X was shown to deubiquitinate and stabilize MIB1 for NOTCH1 activation. Consistent with this, genetic deletion of Usp9x in mice demonstrated CAVD and human calcified aortic valves displayed reduced S-nitrosylation of USP9X. These results demonstrate a previously unidentified mechanism by which S-nitrosylation–dependent regulation of a ubiquitin-associated pathway prevents CAVD.},

Inhibition of plasminogen activation arrests parasite development early during sexual reproduction, before ookinete formation. We show that increased fibrinogen and fibrin in the blood bolus, which are natural substrates of plasmin, inversely correlate with parasite infectivity of the mosquito. Furthermore, we show that sporozoites, the parasite form transmitted by the mosquito to humans, also bind plasminogen and plasminogen activators on their surface, where plasminogen is activated into plasmin. Surface-bound plasmin promotes sporozoite transmission by facilitating parasite migration across the extracellular matrices of the dermis and of the liver.

The ion bombardment technique has been used to enhance the electrification capability of triboelectric polymer. Accordingly, TENG with a contact area of 4 cm 2 is capable of triggering discharge, leading to a compact system. In this skin-integrated ET interface, touching position and motion trace on the TENG surface can be precisely reproduced on skin.

It reveals resilience and stability to withstand external disturbances and environmental stresses. However, existing studies mainly focus on well-developed persistent patterns rather than transient patterns in self-organizing ecosystems. Here, combining models and experimental evidence, we show that transient fairy circle patterns in intertidal salt marshes can both infer the underlying ecological mechanisms and provide a measure of resilience. The models based on sulfide accumulation and nutrient depletion mechanisms reproduced the field-observed fairy circles, providing a generalized perspective on the emergence of transient patterns in salt marsh ecosystems. Field experiments showed that nitrogen fertilization mitigates depletion stress and shifts plant growth from negative to positive in the center of patches. Hence, nutrient depletion plays an overriding role, as only this process can explain the concentric rings. Our findings imply that the emergence of transient patterns can identify the ecological processes underlying pattern formation and the factors determining the ecological resilience of salt marsh ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Despite numerous journalistic accounts, systematic quantitative evidence on economic conditions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic remains scarce for most low- and middle-income countries, partly due to limitations of official economic statistics in environments with large informal sectors and subsistence agriculture. We assemble evidence from over 30, 000 respondents in 16 original household surveys from nine countries in Africa (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Sierra Leone), Asia (Bangladesh, Nepal, Philippines), and Latin America (Colombia). We document declines in employment and income in all settings beginning March 2020. The share of households experiencing an income drop ranges from 8 to 87\% (median, 68\%). Household coping strategies and government assistance were insufficient to sustain precrisis living standards, resulting in widespread food insecurity and dire economic conditions even 3 months into the crisis. We discuss promising policy responses and speculate about the risk of persistent adverse effects, especially among children and other vulnerable groups.},

  abstract     = {Genetic assimilation—the evolutionary process by which an environmentally induced phenotype is made constitutive—represents a fundamental concept in evolutionary biology. Thought to reflect adaptive phenotypic plasticity, matricidal hatching in nematodes is triggered by maternal nutrient deprivation to allow for protection or resource provisioning of offspring. Here, we report natural Caenorhabditis elegans populations harboring genetic variants expressing a derived state of near-constitutive matricidal hatching. These variants exhibit a single amino acid change (V530L) in KCNL-1, a small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel subunit. This gain-of-function mutation causes matricidal hatching by strongly reducing the sensitivity to environmental stimuli triggering egg-laying. We show that reestablishing the canonical KCNL-1 protein in matricidal isolates is sufficient to restore canonical egg-laying. While highly deleterious in constant food environments, KCNL-1 V530L is maintained under fluctuating resource availability. A single point mutation can therefore underlie the genetic assimilation—by either genetic drift or selection—of an ancestrally plastic trait.},

Here, we show that MCRs are highly suitable to generate libraries of electrophiles based on different scaffolds and three-dimensional shapes and highly compatible with multiple functional groups. According to the building block principle of MCR, acrylamide, acrylic acid ester, sulfurylfluoride, chloroacetic acid amide, nitrile, and α, β-unsaturated sulfonamide warheads can be easily incorporated into many different scaffolds. We show examples of each electrophile on 10 different scaffolds on a preparative scale as well as in a high-throughput synthesis mode on a nanoscale to produce libraries of potential covalent binders in a resource- and time-saving manner. Our operational procedure is simple, mild, and step economical to facilitate future covalent library synthesis.},

Vascular attrition precedes the appearance of cellular hallmarks of aging such as senescence. Endothelial VEGFR2 loss-of-function mice demonstrate that vascular perturbations are sufficient to stimulate cellular changes coupled with aging. Age-associated tissue-specific molecular changes in the endothelium drive vascular loss and dictate pericyte to fibroblast differentiation. Lineage tracing of perivascular cells with inducible PDGFRβ and NG2 Cre mouse lines demonstrated that increased pericyte to fibroblast differentiation distinguishes injury-induced organ fibrosis and zymosan-induced arthritis.

However, little is known about the reorganization of the temporal representation of time cells during changes in temporal structures of episodes. We investigated CA1 neuronal activity during temporal bisection tasks, in which the sets of time intervals to be discriminated were designed to be extended or contracted across the blocks of trials. Assemblies of neurons encoded elapsed time during the interval, and the representation was scaled when the set of interval times was varied. Theta phase precession and theta sequences of time cells were also scalable, and the fine temporal relationships were preserved between pairs in theta cycles. Moreover, theta sequences reflected the rats’ decisions on the basis of their time estimation. These findings demonstrate that scalable features of time cells may support the capability of flexible temporal representation for memory formation.},

  abstract     = {Most intracellular proteins lack hydrophobic pockets suitable for altering their function with drug-like small molecules. Recent studies indicate that some undruggable proteins can be targeted by compounds that can degrade them. For example, thalidomide-like drugs (IMiDs) degrade the critical multiple myeloma transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 by recruiting them to the cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase. Current loss of signal (“down”) assays for identifying degraders often exhibit poor signal-to-noise ratios, narrow dynamic ranges, and false positives from compounds that nonspecifically suppress transcription or translation. Here, we describe a gain of signal (“up”) assay for degraders. In arrayed chemical screens, we identified novel IMiD-like IKZF1 degraders and Spautin-1, which, unlike the IMiDs, degrades IKZF1 in a cereblon-independent manner. In a pooled CRISPR-Cas9–based screen, we found that CDK2 regulates the abundance of the ASCL1 oncogenic transcription factor. This methodology should facilitate the identification of drugs that directly or indirectly degrade undruggable proteins.},

Here, this is generalized to bulk complex Zintl semiconductors, exemplified by Eu 2 ZnSb 2 where the Zn vacancy ordering plays an essential role. Five Eu 2 ZnSb 2 structural models are proposed to guide transmission electron microscopy imaging. Zigzag vacancy ordering models show clear metallicity, while the armchair models are semiconducting with indirect bandgaps that monotonously increase with the relative distances between neighboring ZnSb 2 chains. Topological electronic structure changes based on cation ordering in a Zintl compound point toward tunable and possibly switchable topological behavior, since cations in these are often mobile. Thus, their orderings can often be adjusted by temperature, minor alloying, and other approaches. We explain the electronic structure of an interesting thermoelectric and point the way to previously unidentified types of topological electronic transitions in Zintl compounds.},

Our principal finding was that the neuroblastoma cancer cell resembled fetal sympathoblasts, but no other fetal adrenal cell type. The sympathoblastic state was a universal feature of neuroblastoma cells, transcending cell cluster diversity, individual patients, and clinical phenotypes. We substantiated our findings in 650 neuroblastoma bulk transcriptomes and by integrating canonical features of the neuroblastoma genome with transcriptional signals. Overall, our observations indicate that a pan-neuroblastoma cancer cell state exists, which may be attractive for novel immunotherapeutic and targeted avenues.},

How ASD-linked genes affect the intertwined aspects of observational learning and behavioral imitation is not known. Here, we examine how disrupted expression of the ASD gene FOXP1, which causes severe impairments in speech and language learning, affects the cultural transmission of birdsong between adult and juvenile zebra finches. FoxP1 is widely expressed in striatal-projecting forebrain mirror neurons. Knockdown of FoxP1 in this circuit prevents juvenile birds from forming memories of an adult song model but does not interrupt learning how to vocally imitate a previously memorized song. This selective learning deficit is associated with potent disruptions to experience-dependent structural and synaptic plasticity in mirror neurons. Thus, FoxP1 regulates the ability to form memories essential to the cultural transmission of behavior.},

Membrane tubulation is a hallmark of recycling endosomes (REs), mediated by KIF13A, a kinesin-3 family motor. Understanding the regulatory mechanism of KIF13A in RE tubulation and cargo recycling is of fundamental importance but is overlooked. Here, we report a unique mechanism of KIF13A dimerization modulated by Rab22A, a small guanosine triphosphatase, during RE tubulation. A conserved proline between neck coil–coiled-coil (NC-CC1) domains of KIF13A creates steric hindrance, rendering the motors as inactive monomers. Rab22A plays an unusual role by binding to NC-CC1 domains of KIF13A, relieving proline-mediated inhibition and facilitating motor dimerization. As a result, KIF13A motors produce balanced motility and force against multiple dyneins in a molecular tug-of-war to regulate RE tubulation and homeostasis. Together, our findings demonstrate that KIF13A motors are tuned at a single-molecule level to function as weak dimers on the cellular cargo.},

No immunological response was observed clinically under the applied FUS level in humans; however, selecting a higher level in animals resulted in prolonged immunostimulation, as confirmed preclinically by the recruitment of lymphocytes into the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a rat glioma model.

We use Global Positioning System and passive seismic records of the easily observed daily ice stream earthquake cycle of the Whillans Ice Plain, West Antarctica, to quantify the prevalence of migratory versus self-nucleation in a large-scale, natural stick-slip system. We find abundant and predominantly migratory precursory slip, whereas self-nucleation is nearly absent.

  abstract     = {What information animals derive from eavesdropping on interactions between conspecifics, and whether they assign value to it, is difficult to assess because overt behavioral reactions are often lacking. An inside perspective of how observers perceive and process such interactions is thus paramount. Here, we investigate what happens in the mind of marmoset monkeys when they hear playbacks of positive or negative third-party vocal interactions, by combining thermography to assess physiological reactions and behavioral preference measures. The physiological reactions show that playbacks were perceived and processed holistically as interactions rather than as the sum of the separate elements. Subsequently, the animals preferred those individuals who had been simulated to engage in positive, cooperative vocal interactions during the playbacks. By using thermography to disentangle the mechanics of marmoset sociality, we thus find that marmosets eavesdrop on and socially evaluate vocal exchanges and use this information to distinguish between cooperative and noncooperative conspecifics.},

  abstract     = {PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapies provide notable clinical benefits for patients with advanced cancers, but the factors influencing the effectiveness of the treatment remain incompletely cataloged. Here, the up-regulation of laminin γ2 (Ln-γ2) predicted the attenuated efficacy of anti–PD-1 drugs and was associated with unfavorable outcomes in patients with lung cancer or esophageal cancer. Furthermore, Ln-γ2 was transcriptionally activated by transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1) secreted from cancer-associated fibroblasts via JNK/AP1 signaling, which blocked T cell infiltration into the tumor nests by altering the expression of T cell receptors. Coadministration of the TGF-β receptor inhibitor galunisertib and chemotherapy drugs provoked vigorous antitumor activity of anti–PD-1 therapy in mouse tumor models. Therefore, Ln-γ2 may represent a useful biomarker to optimize clinical decisions and predict the response of cancer patients to treatment with anti–PD-1 drugs.},

We detected significant association of 32 traits with at least 1 (and up to 6) of 32 different genomic regions, more than doubling the number of robustly associated face morphology loci reported until now (from 11 to 23). These GWAS hits are strongly enriched in regulatory sequences active specifically during craniofacial development. The associated region in 1p12 includes a tract of archaic adaptive introgression, with a Denisovan haplotype common in Native Americans affecting particularly lip thickness. Among the nine previously unidentified face morphology loci we identified is the VPS13B gene region, and we show that variants in this region also affect midfacial morphology in mice.},

  abstract     = {Directed active motion of motor proteins is a vital process in virtually all eukaryotic cells. Nearly a decade ago, the discovery of directionality switching of mitotic kinesin-5 motors challenged the long-standing paradigm that individual kinesin motors are characterized by an intrinsic directionality. The underlying mechanism, however, remains unexplained. Here, we studied clustering-induced directionality switching of the bidirectional kinesin-5 Cin8. Based on the characterization of single-molecule and cluster motility, we developed a model that predicts that directionality switching of Cin8 is caused by an asymmetric response of its active motion to opposing forces, referred to as drag. The model shows excellent quantitative agreement with experimental data obtained under high and low ionic strength conditions. Our analysis identifies a robust and general mechanism that explains why bidirectional motor proteins reverse direction in response to seemingly unrelated experimental factors including changes in motor density and molecular crowding, and in multimotor motility assays.},

During the past decades, Europe has experienced a series of droughts that caused substantial socioeconomic losses and environmental impacts. A key question is whether there are some similar characteristics in these droughts, especially when compared to the droughts that occurred further in the past. Answering this question is impossible with traditional single-index approaches and also short-term and often spatially inconsistent records. Here, using a multidimensional machine learning–based clustering algorithm and the hydrologic reconstruction of European drought, we determine the dominant drought types and investigate the changes in drought typology. We report a substantial increase in shorter warm-season droughts that are concurrent with an increase in potential evapotranspiration. If shifts reported here persist, then we will need new adaptive water management policies and, in the long run, we may observe considerable alterations in vegetation regimes and ecosystem functioning.},

Most anthropogenic N 2 O emissions result from soil N fertilization, which is converted to N 2 O via oxic nitrification and anoxic denitrification pathways. Drought-affected soils are expected to be well oxygenated; however, using high-resolution isotopic measurements, we found that denitrifying pathways dominated N 2 O emissions during a severe drought applied to managed grassland. This was due to a reversible, drought-induced enrichment in nitrogen-bearing organic matter on soil microaggregates and suggested a strong role for chemo- or codenitrification. Throughout rewetting, denitrification dominated emissions, despite high variability in fluxes. Total N 2 O flux and denitrification contribution were significantly higher during rewetting than for control plots at the same soil moisture range. The observed feedbacks between precipitation changes induced by climate change and N 2 O emission pathways are sufficient to account for the accelerating N 2 O growth rate observed over the past decade.},

DLTPT displayed prolonged blood circulation time and efficiently accumulated at the tumor site due to the tumor-homing effect and negatively charged hyaluronic acid. Subsequently, the HA-DOX shell was degraded by extracellular hyaluronidase, resulting in decreased particle size and negative-to-positive charge reversal, which would increase tumor penetration and internalization. The degradation of HA-DOX further accelerated the release of DOX and exposed the positively charged LTPT core for rapid endosomal escape and mitochondria-targeted delivery of LND. Notably, when DLTPT was used in combination with anti–PD-L1, the tumor growth was inhibited, which induced immune response against tumor metastasis.},

Chloroplasts exhibit greater decay resistance than nuclei; pyrenoids are unlikely to be preserved, but their presence could be inferred from spaces within fossil chloroplasts.

This resulted in malnourishment of the pups and impaired insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling, leading to the consequential stunted growth. Our work provides a new understanding of how the microbiota regulates postnatal growth and an additional variable that must be considered when studying the regulation of maternal behavior.},

  abstract     = {Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) and related G protein–coupled receptors of the ghrelin family are clinically unexploited, and several mechanistic aspects of their activation and inactivation have remained unclear. Enabled by a new crystallization design, we present five new structures: apo-state NTSR1 as well as complexes with nonpeptide inverse agonists SR48692 and SR142948A, partial agonist RTI-3a, and the novel full agonist SRI-9829, providing structural rationales on how ligands modulate NTSR1. The inverse agonists favor a large extracellular opening of helices VI and VII, undescribed so far for NTSR1, causing a constriction of the intracellular portion. In contrast, the full and partial agonists induce a binding site contraction, and their efficacy correlates with the ability to mimic the binding mode of the endogenous agonist neurotensin. Providing evidence of helical and side-chain rearrangements modulating receptor activation, our structural and functional data expand the mechanistic understanding of NTSR1 and potentially other peptidergic receptors.},

Among others, we identified a previously unreported subpopulation of Abcb1b + cells involved in stress adaptation in the adrenal gland. We validated our findings in a mouse stress model, adrenal tissues from patients with Cushing’s syndrome, adrenocortical cell lines, and peripheral cortisol and genotyping data from depressed patients. This extensive dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians interested in the organism’s nervous and endocrine responses to stress and the interplay between these tissues.

To identify critical regulators of sarcoma CSCs, we performed a reporter-based genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen and uncovered Kruppel-like factor 11 (KLF11) as top candidate. In vitro and in vivo functional annotation defined a negative role of KLF11 in CSCs. Mechanistically, KLF11 and YAP/TEAD bound to adjacent DNA sites along with direct interaction. KLF11 recruited SIN3A/HDAC to suppress the transcriptional output of YAP/TEAD, which, in turn, promoted KLF11 transcription, forming a negative feedback loop. However, in CSCs, this negative feedback was lost because of epigenetic silence of KLF11, causing sustained YAP activation. Low KLF11 was associated with poor prognosis and chemotherapy response in patients with sarcoma. Pharmacological activation of KLF11 by thiazolidinedione effectively restored chemotherapy response. Collectively, our study identifies KLF11 as a negative regulator in sarcoma CSCs and potential therapeutic target.},

In crystals without inversion symmetry, it lifts the spin degeneracy and leads to many magnetic, spintronic, and topological phenomena and applications. In bulk materials, SOC strength is a constant. Here, we demonstrate SOC and intrinsic spin splitting in atomically thin InSe, which can be modified over a broad range. From quantum oscillations, we establish that the SOC parameter α is thickness dependent; it can be continuously modulated by an out-of-plane electric field, achieving intrinsic spin splitting tunable between 0 and 20 meV. Unexpectedly, α could be enhanced by an order of magnitude in some devices, suggesting that SOC can be further manipulated. Our work highlights the extraordinary tunability of SOC in 2D materials, which can be harnessed for in operando spintronic and topological devices and applications.},

Although recent works suggest the realization of broadband nanophotonic interfaces that can mitigate frequency dispersion, their usage for arbitrary polarization control remains elusively chromatic. Here, we present a general method to address broadband full-polarization properties of diffracted fields using an original superposition of circular polarization beams transmitted through metasurfaces.

In line with 11β-hydroxylase deficiency in human inflammatory skin disorders, genetic in vivo Cyp11b1 ablation and long-term GC deficiency in keratinocytes primed the murine skin immune system resulting in spontaneous skin inflammation. Deficient skin GC in experimental models for inflammatory skin disorders led to exacerbated contact hypersensitivity and psoriasiform skin inflammation accompanied by decreased regulatory T cells and the involvement of unconventional T cells.

We engineered these cells into living tissues that respond to mechanical loading by producing the anti-inflammatory biologic drug interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Chondrocyte TRPV4 is activated by osmotic loading and not by direct cellular deformation, suggesting that tissue loading is transduced into an osmotic signal that activates TRPV4.

  abstract     = {Demyelinating diseases involve loss of myelin sheaths and eventually lead to neurological problems. Unfortunately, the precise mechanisms remain unknown, and there are no effective therapies. To overcome these limitations, a reliable and physiologically relevant in vitro model is required. Here, we present a three-dimensional peripheral nervous system (PNS) microfluidic platform that recapitulates the full spectrum of myelination, demyelination, and remyelination using primary Schwann cells (SCs) and motor neurons (MNs). The platform enables reproducible hydrogel patterning and long-term stable coculture of MNs and SCs over 40 days in vitro based on three distinct design factors. Furthermore, the on-demand detachable substrate allows in-depth biological analysis. We demonstrated the possibility of mimicking segmental demyelination by lysophosphatidylcholine, and recovery of myelin structure by application of two drugs: benzatropine or methylcobalamin. This 3D PNS disease–on–a–chip may serve as a potential platform for understanding the pathophysiology of demyelination and screening drugs for remyelination.},

Approximately 0.6 billion unique transcripts were obtained from 118, 293 cells. We found that cytotoxic natural killer/T cells were dominant in the TME of SSN, and malignant cells in SSN undergo a strong metabolic reprogram and immune stress. In SSN, the subtype composition of endothelial cells was similar to that in mLUAD, while the subtype distribution of fibroblasts was more like that in nLung. Our study provides single-cell transcriptomic profiling of SSN and their TME. This resource provides deeper insight into the indolent nature of SSN and will be helpful in advancing lung cancer immunotherapy.},

This tabletop microscope can nondestructively probe surface topography, layer thicknesses, and interface quality, as well as dopant concentrations and profiles. High-fidelity imaging was achieved by implementing variable-angle ptychographic imaging, by using total variation regularization to mitigate noise and artifacts in the reconstructed image, and by using a high-brightness, high-harmonic source with excellent intensity and wavefront stability. We validate our measurements through multiscale, multimodal imaging to show that this technique has unique advantages compared with other techniques based on electron and scanning probe microscopies.},

OEIPs have successfully delivered γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that reduces neuronal excitations, in vitro, and in brain tissue to terminate induced epileptic seizures. However, during pumping, protons (H + ), which exhibit higher ionic mobility than GABA, are also delivered and may potentially cause side effects due to large local changes in pH. To reduce the proton transfer, we introduced proton traps along the selective channel membrane. The traps are based on palladium (Pd) electrodes, which selectively absorb protons into their structure. The proton-trapping Pd-OEIP improves the overall performance of the current state-of-the-art OEIP, namely, its temporal resolution, efficiency, selectivity, and dosage precision.},

This method preserves most of the lignin to act as a binder, providing a robust wood scaffold for polymer infiltration while greatly reducing the chemical and energy consumption as well as processing time. The obtained transparent wood (~1 mm in thickness) demonstrates a high transmittance (&gt;90\%), high haze (&gt;60\%), and excellent light-guiding effect over visible wavelength. Furthermore, we can achieve diverse patterns directly on wood surfaces using this approach, which endows transparent wood with excellent patternability.

Since adipose triglyceride composition corresponds to long-term dietary patterns, we performed a meta-analysis modeling the effect of obesity on severity of acute pancreatitis, in the context of dietary patterns of the countries from which the studies originated. Increased severity was noted in leaner populations with a higher proportion of unsaturated fat intake. In mice, greater hydrolysis of unsaturated visceral triglyceride caused worse organ failure during pancreatitis, even when the mice were leaner than those having saturated triglyceride. Saturation interfered with triglyceride’s interaction and lipolysis by pancreatic triglyceride lipase, which mediates organ failure. Unsaturation increased fatty acid monomers in vivo and aqueous media, resulting in greater lipotoxic cellular responses and organ failure. Therefore, visceral triglyceride saturation reduces the ensuing lipotoxicity despite higher adiposity, thus explaining the obesity paradox.},

Because of its impact on human health, understanding the molecular mechanism of C-type inactivation in hERG represents an advance of paramount importance. Here, long–time scale molecular dynamics simulations, free energy landscape calculations, and electrophysiological experiments are combined to address the structural and functional impacts of several disease-associated mutations. Results suggest that C-type inactivation in hERG is associated with an asymmetrical constricted-like conformation of the selectivity filter, identifying F627 side-chain rotation and the hydrogen bond between Y616 and N629 as key determinants. Comparison of hERG with other K + channels suggests that C-type inactivation depends on the degree of opening of the intracellular gate via the filter-gate allosteric coupling.},

We found that keratinocytes adapted to increasing matrix stiffness by forming a rigid, interconnected network of keratin bundles, in conjunction with F-actin stress fiber formation and increased cell stiffness. Disruption of keratin stability by overexpression of the dominant keratin 14 mutation R416P inhibited the normal mechanical response to substrate rigidity, reducing F-actin stress fibers and cell stiffness. The R416P mutation also impaired mechanotransduction to the nuclear lamina, which mediated stiffness-dependent chromatin remodeling. By contrast, depletion of the cytolinker plectin had the opposite effect and promoted increased mechanoresponsiveness and up-regulation of lamin A/C. Together, these results demonstrate that the keratin cytoskeleton plays a key role in matrix rigidity sensing and downstream signal transduction.},

A combination of density functional theory calculations and experimental studies revealed that residual water in the reaction system is crucial for the mild reaction conditions by functioning as a proton shuttle to assist carbon-silver bond protonation and C2─H deprotonation to generate the ammonium ylide. This reaction has a broad application scope. Besides the diverse substituents, N-fused azabicycles of various ring sizes are also easily accessed.

Here, we elucidated the x-ray crystal structure of the actin/twinfilin/capping protein complex to address the mechanisms of twinfilin uncapping of actin filaments. The twinfilin/capping protein complex binds to two G-actin subunits in an orientation that resembles the actin filament barbed end. This suggests an unanticipated mechanism by which twinfilin disrupts the stable capping of actin filaments by inducing a G-actin conformation in the two terminal actin subunits. Furthermore, twinfilin disorders critical actin-capping protein interactions, which will assist in the dissociation of capping protein, and may promote filament uncapping through a second mechanism involving V-1 competition for an actin-binding surface on capping protein. The extensive interactions with capping protein indicate that the evolutionary conserved role of twinfilin is to uncap actin filaments.},

We demonstrate this approach using a patient-derived cerebral MPS carrying the PD-causing A53T mutation, gaining two important findings: (i) that systemic interaction enhances features of in vivo–like behavior of cerebral MPSs, and (ii) that microbiome-associated short-chain fatty acids increase expression of pathology-associated pathways in PD.},

We show that material anisotropy behaves markedly different from particle anisotropy. The electrostatic potential and pair interactions decay with an anisotropic Debye screening length, contrasting the constant screening length for isotropic electrolytes. Charged dumpling-shaped near-spherical colloidal particles in a nematic medium are used as an experimental model system to explore the effects of anisotropic screening, demonstrating competing anisotropic elastic and electrostatic effective pair interactions for colloidal surface charges tunable from neutral to high, yielding particle-separated metastable states.

A thermal activation method is proposed to improve the efficiency of transdermal interstitial fluid (ISF) extraction, enabling extraction with a low current density to notably reduce skin irritation. An Na + sensor and a correction model are proposed to eliminate the effect of individual differences, which leads to fluctuations in the amount of ISF extraction. An electrochemical sensor with a 3D nanostructured working electrode surface is designed to enable precise in situ glucose measurement. A differential structure is proposed to eliminate the effect of passive perspiration, which leads to inaccurate blood glucose prediction. Fabrications of the epidermal biomicrofluidic device including formation of flexible electrodes, nanomaterial modification, and enzyme immobilization are fully realized by inkjet printing to enable facile manufacturing with low cost, which benefits practical production.},

Synthetic antimicrobial polymers are generally resistance resistant, having good activity with low resistance rates but usually with low therapeutic indices. Here, we report our solution to this problem by introducing dual-selective mechanisms of action to a short amidine-rich polymer, which can simultaneously disrupt bacterial membranes and bind to bacterial DNA. The oligoamidine shows unobservable resistance generation but high therapeutic indices against many bacterial types, such as ESKAPE strains and clinical isolates resistant to multiple drugs, including colistin. The oligomer exhibited excellent effectiveness in various model systems, killing extracellular or intracellular bacteria in the presence of mammalian cells, removing all bacteria from Caenorhabditis elegans , and rescuing mice with severe infections. This “dual mechanisms of action” approach may be a general strategy for future development of antimicrobial polymers.},

Here, we used a proteomic approach and found phospho r ibosyl pyrophosphate synthetases (PRPSs), the essential enzymes for nucleotide biosynthesis, as strong interacting partners of UBR7. UBR7 stabilizes PRPS catalytic subunits by mediating the polyubiquitination-directed degradation of PRPS-associated protein (PRPSAP), the negative regulator of PRPS. Loss of UBR7 leads to nucleotide biosynthesis defects. We define UBR7 as a transcriptional target of NOTCH1 and show that UBR7 is overexpressed in NOTCH1-driven T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Impaired nucleotide biosynthesis caused by UBR7 depletion was concomitant with the attenuated cell proliferation and oncogenic potential of T-ALL. Collectively, these results establish UBR7 as a critical regulator of nucleotide metabolism through the regulation of the PRPS enzyme complex and uncover a metabolic vulnerability in NOTCH1-driven T-ALL.},

By integrating the stringent target recognition, helicase activity, and trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a, a Cas12a autocatalysis-driven artificial reaction network is programmed to construct a positive feedback circuit with exponential dynamic in CONAN. Consequently, CONAN achieves one-enzyme, one-step, real-time detection of genomic DNA with attomolar sensitivity. Moreover, CONAN increases the intrinsic single-base specificity of Cas12a, and enables the effective detection of hepatitis B virus infection and human bladder cancer–associated single-nucleotide mutation in clinical samples, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for disease diagnostics.},

By inflaming the TME to favor CD8 + T cell immunity, radiation is now widely considered as a neoadjuvant for immunomodulation. Here, we observed that local irradiation enhances the infiltration of intratumoral eosinophils, and depletion of eosinophil dampens CD8 + T cell infiltration and diminishes the anti-tumor effectiveness of radiation. Retrospectively, we identified a strong correlation between eosinophilia and survival benefit in radiation-treated cancer patients. Experimentally, we further show that radiation enhances the intratumoral infiltration of adoptive transferred T cells therapy, bolstering eosinophils by intravenous interleukin-5 administration promotes the efficacy of radiation-induced abscopal effect. Together, these results suggest that eosinophil mobilization can be considered as a mechanistically relevant biomarker for predicting the effectiveness of pre-immunotherapy radiation, as well as a new strategy to enhance T cell-mediated immunotherapy against cancers.},

However, the mechanism underlying endothelial cell dropout is poorly defined. Here, we show a central role of the extracellular microenvironment in controlling endothelial cell survival and proliferation in CKD. When cultured on a decellularized kidney tissue scaffold (KTS) from fibrotic kidney, endothelial cells increased the expression of proapoptotic proteins. Proteomics profiling identified fibrillin-1 (FBN1) as a key component of the fibrotic KTS, which was up-regulated in animal models and patients with CKD. FBN1 induced apoptosis of endothelial cells and inhibited their proliferation in vitro. RNA sequencing uncovered activated integrin α v β 6 /transforming growth factor–β signaling, and blocking this pathway abolished FBN1-triggered endothelial injury. In a mouse model of CKD, depletion of FBN1 ameliorated renal fibrotic lesions and mitigated vascular rarefaction. These studies illustrate that FBN1 plays a role in mediating vascular rarefaction by orchestrating a hostile microenvironment for endothelial cells.},

Cellular studies indicate that heme is required for the REV-ERBs to bind the corepressor NCoR and repress transcription. However, fluorescence-based biochemical assays suggest that heme displaces NCoR; here, we show that this is due to a heme-dependent artifact. Using ITC and NMR spectroscopy, we show that heme binding remodels the thermodynamic interaction profile of NCoR receptor interaction domain (RID) binding to REV-ERBβ ligand-binding domain (LBD). We solved two crystal structures of REV-ERBβ LBD cobound to heme and NCoR peptides, revealing the heme-dependent NCoR binding mode. ITC and chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry reveals a 2:1 LBD:RID stoichiometry, consistent with cellular studies showing that NCoR-dependent repression of REV-ERB transcription occurs on dimeric DNA response elements. Our findings should facilitate renewed progress toward understanding heme-dependent REV-ERB activity.},

Our findings are beyond the purview of the standard theory of friction but consistent with a competing theory in which f is linked to the turbulent spectrum via the spectral exponent α: In 3D, α = 5/3 and the theory yields f ∝ r 1/3 ; in 2D, α = 3 and the theory yields f ∝ r .},

To reverse this effect, we generated an NKA-stabilizing monoclonal antibody, DR5-12D, against the DR region ( 897 DVEDSYGQQWTYEQR 911 ) of the NKAα1 subunit. We demonstrate that DR5-12D can ameliorate α-synuclein–induced TH loss and behavioral deficits by accelerating α-synuclein degradation in neurons. The underlying mechanism for the beneficial effects of DR5-12D involves activation of NKAα1-dependent autophagy via increased AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 pathway signaling. Cumulatively, this work demonstrates that NKA activity is neuroprotective and that pharmacological activation of this pathway represents a new therapeutic strategy for PD.},

Unexpectedly, embryonic tdp1 −/− zebrafish were not hypersensitive to Top1 poisons and did not exhibit increased Top1-DNA breaks. This is in contrast to the hypersensitivity of Tdp1-deficient vertebrate models reported to date. Tdp1 is dispensable in the zebrafish embryo with transcript levels down-regulated in response to Top1-DNA damage. In contrast, apex2 and ercc4 ( xpf ) transcripts were up-regulated. These findings identify the tdp1 −/− zebrafish embryo as the first vertebrate model that does not require Tdp1 to protect from Top1-DNA damage and identify apex2 and ercc4 ( xpf ) as putative players fulfilling this role.

In particular, we tune the quantum phase of a collectively excited nuclear state via transient magnons with a precision of 1 zs and a timing stability below 50 ys. These small temporal shifts are monitored interferometrically via quantum beats between different hyperfine-split levels.

  abstract     = {Comprehensive genomic analyses of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) have revealed frequent mutually exclusive genomic amplification of MYC family members. Hence, it has been long suggested that they are functionally equivalent; however, more recently, their expression has been associated with specific neuroendocrine markers and distinct histopathology. Here, we explored a previously undescribed role of L-Myc and c-Myc as lineage-determining factors contributing to SCLC molecular subtypes and histology. Integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses showed that L-Myc and c-Myc impart neuronal and non-neuroendocrine–associated transcriptional programs, respectively, both associated with distinct SCLC lineage. Genetic replacement of c-Myc with L-Myc in c-Myc–SCLC induced a neuronal state but was insufficient to induce ASCL1-SCLC. In contrast, c-Myc induced transition from ASCL1-SCLC to NEUROD1–SCLC characterized by distinct large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma–like histopathology. Collectively, we characterize a role of historically defined general oncogenes, c-Myc and L-Myc, for regulating lineage plasticity across molecular and histological subtypes.},

  abstract     = {The invasiveness and high immune suppression of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) produce poor survival of afflicted patients. Unfortunately, in the past decades, no therapeutic approach has remarkably improved the survival time of patients with GBM. Our analysis of the TCGA database and brain tumor tissue arrays indicated that CXCL1 and CXCL2 overexpression is closely associated with GBM’s aggressiveness. Our results showed that elevation of CXCL1 or CXCL2 facilitated myeloid cell migration and simultaneously disrupted CD8 + T cell accumulation at tumor sites, causing accelerated tumor progression. Yet, blockade of CXCL1/2 significantly prevented myeloid-derived suppressor cell migration and thereby increased CD8 + T cell accumulation in vitro and in vivo. CXCL1/2 also promoted the paracrine factor S100A9 and further activated Erk1/2 and p70S60k, whereas blocking CXCL1/2 down-regulated these prosurvival factors. The combination of targeting CXCL1/2 and standard temozolomide chemotherapy improved upon the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapy alone, extending the overall survival time in GBM.},

Simultaneous observations of plasma waves allow for the routine inference of total plasma number density, a parameter that is very difficult to measure directly. On the basis of long-term observations in 2015, we show that the underlying plasma density has a controlling effect over acceleration to ultrarelativistic energies, which occurs only when the plasma number density drops down to very low values (~10 cm –3 ). Such low density creates preferential conditions for local diffusive acceleration of electrons from hundreds of kilo–electron volts up to &gt;7 MeV. While previous models could not reproduce the local acceleration of electrons to such high energies, here we complement the observations with a numerical model to show that the conditions of extreme cold plasma depletion result in acceleration up to &gt;7 MeV.},

Prime candidates for these conditions are certain high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which have extraordinary work-hardening ability and toughness. By subjecting the equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi HEA to severe plastic deformation through swaging followed by either quasi-static compression or dynamic deformation in shear, we observe a dense structure comprising stacking faults, twins, transformation from the face-centered cubic to the hexagonal close-packed structure, and, of particular note, amorphization. The coordinated propagation of stacking faults and twins along {111} planes generates high-deformation regions, which can reorganize into hexagonal packets; when the defect density in these regions reaches a critical level, they generate islands of amorphous material. These regions can have outstanding mechanical properties, which provide additional strengthening and/or toughening mechanisms to enhance the capability of these alloys to withstand extreme loading conditions.},

We find that nearly all detections of small events at depths greater than 20 kilometers in the upper mantle fall below the reliability threshold. We find a modest number of small, shallower events in the crust that appear to align with the active Newport-Inglewood Fault. These events occur primarily at 15- to 20-kilometer depth near the base of the seismogenic zone. Localized seismicity under fault zones suggests that the deep extensions of active faults are localized and deforming, with stress concentration leading to a concentration of small events, near the seismic-aseismic transition.},

We systematically assess 400 ArM mutants for five bioorthogonal transformations involving different metals, reaction mechanisms, and reactants, which include novel ArMs for gold-catalyzed hydroamination and hydroarylation. Activity enhancements up to 15-fold highlight the potential of the systematic approach. Furthermore, we suggest smart screening strategies and build machine learning models that accurately predict ArM activity from sequence, which has crucial implications for future ArM development.},

We successfully delivered 1-mg payloads of human insulin and human growth hormone to the buccal cavity of swine within 30 s. In addition, we conducted a trial in 100 healthy volunteers to assess potential discomfort associated with MNs when applied in the oral cavity, identifying the hard palate as the preferred application site. We envisage that MN patches applied on buccal surfaces could increase medication adherence and facilitate the painless delivery of biologics and other drugs to many, especially for the pediatric and elderly populations.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen isotope speleothem records exhibit coherent variability over the pan-Asian summer monsoon (AM) region. The hydroclimatic representation of these oxygen isotope records for the AM, however, has remained poorly understood. Here, combining an isotope-enabled Earth system model in transient experiments with proxy records, we show that the widespread AM δ 18 O c signal during the last deglaciation (20 to 11 thousand years ago) is accompanied by a continental-scale, coherent hydroclimate footprint, with spatially opposite signs in rainfall. This footprint is generated as a dynamically coherent response of the AM system primarily to meltwater forcing and secondarily to insolation forcing and is further reinforced by atmospheric teleconnection. Hence, widespread δ 18 O p depletion in the AM region is accompanied by a northward migration of the westerly jet and enhanced southwesterly monsoon wind, as well as increased rainfall from South Asia (India) to northern China but decreased rainfall in southeast China.},

One approach used in Arabidopsis involves crossing plants expressing different forms of centromeric histone H3 (CENP-A/CENH3) and subsequent loss of genome with weaker centromeres. However, the method has been ineffective in crop plants. Here, we describe a greatly simplified method based on crossing maize lines that are heterozygous for a cenh3 null mutation. Crossing +/ cenh3 to wild-type plants in both directions yielded haploid progeny. Genome elimination was determined by the cenh3 genotype of the gametophyte, suggesting that centromere failure is caused by CENH3 dilution during the postmeiotic cell divisions that precede gamete formation. The cenh3 haploid inducer works as a vigorous hybrid and can be transferred to other lines in a single cross, making it versatile for a variety of applications.},

Here, relying on genomic constraint scores, we identify 10 patients with multiple congenital anomalies caused by hemizygous variants in OTUD5 , encoding a K48/K63 linkage–specific deubiquitylase. By studying these mutations, we find that OTUD5 controls neuroectodermal differentiation through cleaving K48-linked ubiquitin chains to counteract degradation of select chromatin regulators (e.g., ARID1A/B, histone deacetylase 2, and HCF1), mutations of which underlie diseases that exhibit phenotypic overlap with OTUD5 patients. Loss of OTUD5 during differentiation leads to less accessible chromatin at neuroectodermal enhancers and aberrant gene expression. Our study describes a previously unidentified disorder we name LINKED (LINKage-specific deubiquitylation deficiency–induced Embryonic Defects) syndrome and reveals linkage-specific ubiquitin cleavage from chromatin remodelers as an essential signaling mode that coordinates chromatin remodeling during embryogenesis.},

Cells within the ascites and tumor had pervasive metabolite differences, with a notable enrichment in 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) in T cells infiltrating the tumor compared with ascites. Despite the elevated levels of MNA in T cells, the expression of nicotinamide N -methyltransferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S -adenosylmethionine to nicotinamide, was restricted to fibroblasts and tumor cells. Functionally, MNA induces T cells to secrete the tumor-promoting cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha.

Chronic IFN-γ treatment of myobundles derived from multiple donors induced myofiber atrophy and contractile loss. E-stim altered the myobundle secretome, induced myofiber hypertrophy, and attenuated the IFN-γ–induced myobundle wasting and weakness, in part by down-regulating JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) signaling pathway amplified by IFN-γ. JAK/STAT inhibitors fully prevented IFN-γ–induced myopathy, confirming the critical roles of STAT1 activation in proinflammatory action of IFN-γ. Our results reveal a previously unknown mechanism of the cell-autonomous anti-inflammatory effects of muscle exercise and establish the utility of human myobundle platform for studies of inflammatory muscle disease and therapy.},

We found that the iridoid nepetalactol is the major component of silver vine that elicits this potent response in cats and other felids. Nepetalactol increased plasma β-endorphin levels in cats, while pharmacological inhibition of μ-opioid receptors suppressed the classic rubbing response. Rubbing behavior transfers nepetalactol onto the faces and heads of respondents where it repels the mosquito, Aedes albopictus . Thus, self-anointing behavior helps to protect cats against mosquito bites. The characteristic response of cats to nepetalactol via the μ-opioid system provides an important example of chemical pest defense using plant metabolites in nonhuman mammals.},

After screening thousands of compounds, we identified that aurora kinase inhibitors (AKIs) could reprogram the expression pattern of TIP genes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. AKIs treatments up-regulate expression of chemokine genes CXCL10 and CXCL11 through inhibiting aurora kinase A (AURKA)–signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway, which promotes effective T cells infiltrating into tumor microenvironment and improves anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) efficacy in preclinical models.

Here, we build three-dimensional musculoskeletal models of the pectoral appendage in Eusthenopteron , Acanthostega , and Pederpes and quantitatively examine changes in forelimb function across the fin-to-limb transition. Through comparison with extant fishes and tetrapods, we show that early tetrapods share a suite of characters including restricted mobility in humerus long-axis rotation, increased muscular leverage for humeral retraction, but not depression/adduction, and increased mobility in elbow flexion-extension. We infer that the earliest steps in tetrapod forelimb evolution were related to limb-substrate interactions, whereas specializations for weight support appeared later. Together, these results suggest that competing selective pressures for aquatic and terrestrial environments produced a unique, ancestral “early tetrapod” forelimb locomotor mode unlike that of any extant animal.},

An osteoid-inspired biomaterial—demineralized bone paper—directs osteoblasts to deposit structural mineralized bone tissue and subsequently acquire the resting-state bone lining cell phenotype. These cells activate and shift their secretory profile to induce osteoclastogenesis in response to chemical stimulation. Quantitative spatial mapping of cellular activities in resting and activated bone surface coculture showed that the resting-state bone lining cell network actively directs localized bone remodeling by means of paracrine signaling and cell-to-cell contact.

Our data provide evidence that metabolic precursor biosynthesis becomes restricted to the mother cell and that the forespore becomes reliant on mother cell–derived metabolites for protein synthesis. We further show that arginine is trafficked between the two cells and that proposed proteinaceous channels mediate small-molecule intercellular transport. Thus, sporulation entails the profound metabolic reprogramming of the forespore, which is depleted of key metabolic enzymes and must import metabolites from the mother cell.

  abstract     = {Genetic diversity and phylogenetic diversity reflect the evolutionary potential and history of species, respectively. However, the levels and spatial patterns of genetic and phylogenetic diversity of wildlife at the regional scale have largely remained unclear. Here, we performed meta-analyses of genetic diversity in Chinese terrestrial vertebrates based on three genetic markers and investigated their phylogenetic diversity based on a dated phylogenetic tree of 2461 species. We detected strong positive spatial correlations among mitochondrial DNA-based genetic diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and species richness. Moreover, the terrestrial vertebrates harbored higher genetic and phylogenetic diversity in South China and Southwest China than in other regions. Last, climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) had significant positive effects while altitude and human population density had significant negative impacts on levels of mitochondrial DNA-based genetic diversity in most cases. Our findings will help guide national-level genetic diversity conservation plans and a post-2020 biodiversity conservation framework.},

Photons are generated by electron impact onto a structured anode target, which is formed as an x-ray waveguide or waveguide array. Both emission of characteristic radiation and bremsstrahlung are affected by the changes in mode density induced by the waveguide structure. We investigate how the excited modal pattern depends on the positions of the metal atoms and the distance of the focused electron beam with respect to the waveguide exit side. We compare the results to synchrotron-excited fluorescence. We then discuss how x-ray generation in waveguides can be used to increase the brilliance and directional emission of tabletop x-ray sources, with a corresponding increase in the spatial coherence. On the basis of the Purcell effect, we lastly show that the gain of emission into waveguide modes is governed by the quality factor of the waveguide.},

Here, we investigate possible mechanisms responsible for the observed long-term trends by using a novel approach that features a full-fledged ocean carbonate chemistry model. Using a compilation of pCO 2 , pH, and calcite compensation depth (CCD) observational evidence and a suite of simulations, we reconcile long-term Cenozoic climate and CCD trends. We show that the CCD response was decoupled from changes in silicate and carbonate weathering rates, challenging the continental uplift hypothesis. The two dominant mechanisms for decoupling are shelf-basin carbonate burial fractionation combined with proliferation of pelagic calcifiers. The temperature effect on remineralization rates of marine organic matter also plays a critical role in controlling the carbon cycle dynamics, especially during the warmer periods of the Cenozoic.},

Therefore, we engineered extracellular vesicles (exosomes) to contain an NF-κB inhibitor, termed super-repressor (SR) IκBα. Treatment with SR exosomes (1 × 10 10 per intraperitoneal injection) after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge on gestation day 15 (E15) prolonged gestation by over 24 hours (PTB ≤ E18.5) and reduced maternal inflammation ( n ≥ 4). Furthermore, using a transgenic model in which fetal tissues express the red fluorescent protein tdTomato while maternal tissues do not, we report that LPS-induced PTB in mice is associated with influx of fetal innate immune cells, not maternal, into feto-maternal uterine tissues. SR packaged in exosomes provides a stable and specific intervention for reducing the inflammatory response associated with PTB.},

A broad understanding of the biological functions of membrane vesicles in bacteria remains elusive because of the imaging challenges during real-time in vivo experiments. Here, we provide a quantitative analysis of the motion of individual vesicles in living microbes using fluorescence microscopy, and we show that while vesicle free diffusion in the intercellular space is rare, vesicles mostly disperse along the bacterial surfaces. Most remarkably, when bacteria are challenged with low doses of antibiotics, vesicle production and traffic, quantified by instantaneous vesicle speeds and total traveled distance per unit time, are significantly enhanced. Furthermore, the enhanced vesicle movement is independent of cell clustering properties but rather is associated with a reduction of the density of surface appendages in response to antibiotics. Together, our results provide insights into the emerging field of spatial organization and dynamics of membrane vesicles in microcolonies.},

Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of this design for pentapeptides using a computational method capable of predicting helicity and fiber-forming tendency of stapled peptides containing noncoded amino acids. Experiments showed that the best candidates, which carried an aromatically substituted staple and phenylalanine analogs, displayed exceptional helicity and assembled into nanofibers via specific head-to-tail hydrogen bonding and packing between staple and noncoded side chains. The fibers exhibited sheet-of-helix structures resembling the recently found collapsed coiled coils whose formation was sensitive to side chain flexibility.

Investigating seismic anisotropy is one of a few viable technologies that can directly answer these questions. However, the detailed anisotropic structure of subduction zones is still unclear. Under a general hexagonal symmetry anisotropy assumption, we develop a tomographic method to determine a high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) P wave anisotropic model of the Japan subduction zone by inverting 1, 184, 018 travel time data of local and teleseismic events. As a result, the 3D anisotropic structure in and around the dipping Pacific slab is firstly revealed. Our results show that slab deformation plays an important role in both mantle flow and intraslab fabric, and the widely observed trench-parallel anisotropy in the forearc is related to the intraslab deformation during the outer-rise yielding of the subducting plate.},

This study demonstrates an effective route for maintaining lattice integrity during the combustion chemical vapor deposition of highly conductive boron-doped diamonds (BDDs) through laser vibrational excitation of a growth-critical radical, boron dihydride (BH 2 ). The improved diamond crystallinity is attributed to a laser-enabled, thermal nonequilibrium suppression of the relative abundance of boron hydrides (BH), whose excessive presence induces boron segregation and disturbs the crystallization. The BDDs show a boron concentration of 4.3 × 10 21 cm −3 , a film resistivity of 28.1 milliohm·cm, and hole mobility of 55.6 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , outperforming a commercial BDD. The highly conductive and crystalline BDDs exhibit enhanced efficiency in sensing glucose, confirming the advantages of laser excitation in producing high-performance BDD sensors.

Mechanistically, SUMOylated ANXA1 suppressed nuclear factor κB activation and the production of proinflammatory mediators. Further study revealed that SUMOylated ANXA1 targeted the IκB kinase (IKK) complex and selectively enhanced IKKα degradation. Simultaneously, we detected that SUMOylated ANXA1 facilitated the interaction between IKKα and NBR1 to promote IKKα degradation through selective autophagy. Further work revealed that the overexpression of SUMOylated ANXA1 in microglia/macrophages resulted in marked improvement in neurological function in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia.

Changes in native forest cover and its spatial distribution increased forest isolation in 36.4\% of the landscapes.

  abstract     = {Sleep is a highly conserved state, suggesting that sleep’s benefits outweigh the increased vulnerability it brings. Yet, little is known about how sleep fulfills its functions. Here, we used video tracking in tethered flies to identify a discrete deep sleep stage in Drosophila, termed proboscis extension sleep, that is defined by repeated stereotyped proboscis extensions and retractions. Proboscis extension sleep is accompanied by highly elevated arousal thresholds and decreased brain activity, indicative of a deep sleep state. Preventing proboscis extensions increases injury-related mortality and reduces waste clearance. Sleep deprivation reduces waste clearance and during subsequent rebound sleep, sleep, proboscis extensions, and waste clearance are increased. Together, these results provide evidence of a discrete deep sleep stage that is linked to a specific function and suggest that waste clearance is a core and ancient function of deep sleep.},

Until recently, these constraints had limited impact, and projected warming ranges were driven primarily by model outputs. Here, we use the newest climate model ensemble, improved observations, and a new statistical method to narrow uncertainty on estimates of past and future human-induced warming. Cross-validation suggests that our method produces robust results and is not overconfident. We derive consistent observationally constrained estimates of attributable warming to date and warming rate, the response to a range of future scenarios, and metrics of climate sensitivity. We find that historical observations narrow uncertainty on projected future warming by about 50\%. Our results suggest that using an unconstrained multimodel ensemble is no longer the best choice for global mean temperature projections and that the lower end of previous estimates of 21st century warming can now be excluded.},

We show that the protein SMCHD1 (structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain containing 1) is found in complexes with TET proteins and negatively regulates TET activities. Removal of SMCHD1 from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells induces DNA hypomethylation, preferentially at SMCHD1 target sites and accumulation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), along with promoter demethylation and activation of the Dux double-homeobox gene. In the absence of SMCHD1, ES cells acquire a two-cell (2c) embryo–like state characterized by activation of an early embryonic transcriptome that is substantially imposed by Dux . Using Smchd1 / Tet1 / Tet2 / Tet3 quadruple-knockout cells, we show that DNA demethylation, activation of Dux , and other genes upon SMCHD1 loss depend on TET proteins. These data identify SMCHD1 as an antagonist of the 2c-like state of ES cells and of TET-mediated DNA demethylation.},

Given the occurrence of electrochemical processes in Earth’s mantle and the high electrical conductivity of mantle melts and fluids, we have developed a model whereby localized electric fields play a central role in diamond formation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a diamond crystallization mechanism that operates under lithospheric mantle pressure-temperature conditions (6.3 and 7.5 gigapascals; 1300° to 1600°C) through the action of an electric potential applied across carbonate or carbonate-silicate melts. In this process, the carbonate-rich melt acts as both the carbon source and the crystallization medium for diamond, which forms in assemblage with mantle minerals near the cathode. Our results clearly demonstrate that electric fields should be considered a key additional factor influencing diamond crystallization, mantle mineral–forming processes, carbon isotope fractionation, and the global carbon cycle.},

One unanswered fundamental question is whether the perovskite films are grown from top (air side) to bottom (substrate side) or from bottom to top despite 10 years of development. Here, by using grazing incidence x-ray diffraction and morphology characterizations, we unveil that the perovskite films prepared by one-step solution processes, including antisolvent-assisted spin coating and blade coating, follow the downward growth from intermediate phase during thermal annealing. Such a top-to-bottom downward growth is initialized by the evaporation of residual solvent from the top surface of “wet” films and is less sensitive to perovskite compositions and the wettability of underlying substrates. Addressing this fundamental question is important to understand the heterogeneity of perovskite films along the vertical direction, which markedly affects the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells.},

We have used laboratory measurements of the UV spectroscopy of a set of candidate molecules and found a good fit to Rhea’s spectra with both hydrazine monohydrate and several chlorine-containing molecules. Given the radiation-dominated chemistry on the surface of icy satellites embedded within their planets’ magnetospheres, hydrazine monohydrate is argued to be the most plausible candidate for explaining the absorption feature at 184 nm. Hydrazine was also used as a propellant in Cassini’s thrusters, but the thrusters were not used during icy satellite flybys and thus the signal is believed to not arise from spacecraft fuel.

Here, we report a universal synthetic strategy for directing the site-specific growth of anisotropic seeds to prepare a library of designer nanostructures. This strategy leverages nucleation energy barrier profiles and the chemical potential of the growth solution to control the site-specific growth of NCs into exotic shapes and compositions. This strategy can be used to not only control where growth occurs on anisotropic seeds but also control the exposed facets of the newly grown regions. NCs of many shapes are synthesized, including over 10 here-to-fore never reported NCs and, in principle, many others are possible.},

Here, we devise a strategy for the ultrahigh-yield synthesis of circumcoronene molecules on Cu(111) via surface-assisted intramolecular dehydrogenation of the rationally designed precursor, followed by methyl radical-radical coupling and aromatization. An elegant electrostatic interaction between circumcoronenes and metallic surface drives their self-organization into an extended superlattice, as revealed by bond-resolved scanning probe microscopy measurements. Density functional theory and tight-binding calculations reveal that unique hexagonal zigzag topology of circumcoronenes, along with their periodic electrostatic landscape, confines two-dimensional electron gas in Cu(111) into a chiral electronic Kagome-honeycomb lattice with two emergent electronic flat bands. Our findings open up a new route for the high-yield fabrication of elusive nanographenes with zigzag topologies and their superlattices with possible nontrivial electronic properties.},

Contrary to the textbook model that cells arrest at the G 1 -S transition, cells triggering the DNA damage checkpoint in G 1 phase route back to quiescence, and this cellular rerouting can be initiated at any point in G 1 phase. Furthermore, we find that most of the cells receiving damage in G 1 phase actually fail to arrest and proceed through the G 1 -S transition due to persistent cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity in the interval between DNA damage and induction of the CDK inhibitor p21.

Despite great deal of effort to develop ferroelectric memory based on perovskite oxides on Si, formation of unwanted interfacial layer substantially compromises the performance of the ferroelectric memory. Furthermore, three-dimensional (3D) integration has been unimaginable because of high processing temperature, non-CMOS compatibility, difficulty in scaling, and complex compositions of perovskite oxides. Here, we demonstrate a unique strategy to tackle critical issues by applying hafnia-based ferroelectrics and oxide semiconductors. Thus, it is possible to avoid the formation of interfacial layer that finally allows unprecedented Si-free 3D integration of ferroelectric memory. This strategy yields memory performance that could be achieved neither by the conventional flash memory nor by the previous perovskite ferroelectric memories. Device simulation confirms that this strategy can realize ultrahigh-density 3D memory integration.},

  abstract     = {Researchers have documented race and gender inequality in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) for decades. Do lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) professionals face parallel experiences of disadvantage in STEM? Using representative survey data from 21 STEM professional societies ( N sample = 25, 324; N LGBTQ = 1006), this paper presents multidimensional and methodologically robust documentation of 5 dimensions of LGBTQ inequality in STEM. Controlling for variation by demographic, discipline, and job factors, LGBTQ STEM professionals were more likely to experience career limitations, harassment, and professional devaluation than their non-LGBTQ peers. They also reported more frequent health difficulties and were more likely to intend to leave STEM. These trends were similar across STEM disciplines and employment sectors. We found no differences by LGBTQ status in education level, work effort, or job commitment. These findings reveal LGBTQ status as a clear axis of inequality in STEM and motivate further research into the mechanisms producing such outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Timely restoration of blood supply following myocardial infarction is critical to save the infarcted myocardium, while reperfusion would cause additional damage. Strontium ions have been shown to promote angiogenesis, but it is unknown whether they can save the damaged myocardium. We report that myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)–induced functional deterioration and scar formation were notably attenuated by injection of strontium ion–containing composite hydrogels into murine infarcted myocardium at 20 minutes of reperfusion following 60 minutes of ischemia. These beneficial effects were accompanied by reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and increased angiogenesis. The effects of strontium ions were further confirmed by the enhanced viability of cardiomyocytes and stimulated angiogenesis in vitro. These findings are the first to reveal the cardioprotective effects of strontium ions against I/R injury, which may provide a new therapeutic approach to ischemic heart disease at a lower cost, with higher stability, and with potentially greater safety.},

We leverage the rich structural information and superior sensitivity in reflectance microscopy and show that digital labeling predicts accurate subcellular features after training on immunofluorescence images. We demonstrate up to three times improvement in the prediction accuracy over the state of the art. Beyond fluorescence prediction, we demonstrate that single cell–level structural phenotypes of cell cycles are correctly reproduced by the digital multiplexed images, including Golgi twins, Golgi haze during mitosis, and DNA synthesis. We further show that the multiplexed readouts enable accurate multiparametric single-cell profiling across a large cell population. Our method can markedly improve the throughput for imaging cytometry toward applications for phenotyping, pathology, and high-content screening.},

Although the decay envelope of triplet pairs within ferromagnetic materials is well studied, little is known about their decay in nonmagnetic metals and superconductors and, in particular, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we investigate devices in which singlet and triplet supercurrents propagate into the s-wave superconductor Nb. In the normal state of Nb, triplet supercurrents decay over a distance of 5 nm, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the decay of spin-singlet pairs due to the SOC. In the superconducting state of Nb, triplet supercurrents are not able to couple with the singlet wave function and are thus blocked by the absence of available equilibrium states in the singlet gap. The results offer insight into the dynamics between s-wave singlet and s-wave triplet states.},

Here, we use a specially designed experiment to directly measure the chemical composition and the concentration of nucleating clusters in various binary CO 2 -containing vapors. Our analysis suggests that CO 2 essentially catalyzes nucleation of the low vapor pressure component through the formation of transient, hetero-molecular clusters and thus provides alternative pathways for nucleation to proceed more efficiently. This work opens up new avenues for the quantitative assessment of nucleation mechanisms involving transient species in multicomponent vapors.},

The resonant absorption of materials induces not only the energy transfer from photons to quantum mechanical motion of electrons but also the momentum transfer between them, resulting in dissipative optical forces that drive the macroscopic mechanical motion of the particles. However, optical manipulation, according to the quantum mechanical properties of individual nanoparticles, is still challenging. Here, we demonstrate selective transportation of nanodiamonds with and without nitrogen-vacancy centers by balancing resonant absorption and scattering forces induced by two different-colored lasers counterpropagating along a nanofiber. Furthermore, we propose a methodology for precisely determining the absorption cross sections for single nanoparticles by monitoring the optically driven motion, which is called as “optical force spectroscopy.” This method provides a novel direction in optical manipulation technology toward development of functional nanomaterials and quantum devices.},

The FMRpolyG polyglycine domain has a prion-like property, preferentially binding to CGG-G4RNA. Treatment with 5-aminolevulinic acid, which is metabolized to protoporphyrin IX, inhibited RAN translation of FMRpolyG and CGG-G4RNA–induced FMRpolyG aggregation, ameliorating aberrant synaptic plasticity and behavior in FXTAS model mice.

We analyzed genome-wide data involving 78, 500 individuals using a polygenic risk score approach to identify the biological pathways and cell types involved in ALS. This data-driven approach identified multiple aspects of the biology underlying the disease that resolved into broader themes, namely, neuron projection morphogenesis, membrane trafficking, and signal transduction mediated by ribonucleotides. We also found that genomic risk in ALS maps consistently to GABAergic interneurons and oligodendrocytes, as confirmed in human single-nucleus RNA-seq data. Using two-sample Mendelian randomization, we nominated six differentially expressed genes ( ATG16L2 , ACSL5 , MAP1LC3A , MAPKAPK3 , PLXNB2 , and SCFD1 ) within the significant pathways as relevant to ALS. We conclude that the disparate genetic etiologies of this fatal neurological disease converge on a smaller number of final common pathways and cell types.},

Here, using a nanoheater/nanothermometer hybrid made of a polydopamine encapsulating a fluorescent nanodiamond, we measured the intracellular thermal conductivities of HeLa and MCF-7 cells with a spatial resolution of about 200 nm. The mean values determined in these two cell lines are both 0.11 ± 0.04 W m −1 K −1 , which is significantly smaller than that of water. Bayesian analysis of the data suggests there is a variation of the thermal conductivity within a cell. These results make the biological impact of transient temperature spikes in a cell much more feasible, and suggest that cells may use heat flux for short-distance thermal signaling.},

Numerous pathogenic mutations causative for neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer congregate in CKM subunits. However, the structure of the intact CKM and the mechanism by which Cdk8 is non-canonically activated and functionally affected by oncogenic CKM alterations are poorly understood. Here, we report a cryo–electron microscopy structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CKM that redefines prior CKM structural models and explains the mechanism of Med12-dependent Cdk8 activation. Med12 interacts extensively with CycC and activates Cdk8 by stabilizing its activation (T-)loop through conserved Med12 residues recurrently mutated in human tumors. Unexpectedly, Med13 has a characteristic Argonaute-like bi-lobal architecture. These findings not only provide a structural basis for understanding CKM function and pathological dysfunction, but also further impute a previously unknown regulatory mechanism of Mediator in transcriptional modulation through its Med13 Argonaute-like features.},

  abstract     = {A line defect with metallic characteristics has been found in optically transparent BaSnO 3 perovskite thin films. The distinct atomic structure of the defect core, composed of Sn and O atoms, was visualized by atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). When doped with La, dopants that replace Ba atoms preferentially segregate to specific crystallographic sites adjacent to the line defect. The electronic structure of the line defect probed in STEM with electron energy-loss spectroscopy was supported by ab initio theory, which indicates the presence of Fermi level–crossing electronic bands that originate from defect core atoms. These metallic line defects also act as electron sinks attracting additional negative charges in these wide-bandgap BaSnO 3 films.},

  abstract     = {Innate immune responses to pathogens are driven by co-presentation of multiple pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Combinations of PAMPs can trigger synergistic immune responses, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of synergy are poorly understood. Here, we used synthetic particulate carriers co-loaded with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and CpG as pathogen-like particles (PLPs) to dissect the signaling pathways responsible for dual adjuvant immune responses. PLP-based co-delivery of MPLA and CpG to GM-CSF–driven mouse bone marrow–derived antigen-presenting cells (BM-APCs) elicited synergistic interferon-β (IFN-β) and interleukin-12p70 (IL-12p70) responses, which were strongly influenced by the biophysical properties of PLPs. Mechanistically, we found that MyD88 and interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) were necessary for IFN-β and IL-12p70 production, while TRIF signaling was required for the synergistic response. Both the kinetics and magnitude of downstream TRAF6 and IRF5 signaling drove the synergy. These results identify the key mechanisms of synergistic Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–TLR9 co-signaling in mouse BM-APCs and underscore the critical role of signaling kinetics and biophysical properties on the integrated response to combination adjuvants.},

Necroptosis is activated in AD brain and is positively correlated with neuroinflammation and tau pathology. However, the links among altered O -GlcNAcylation, β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, and necroptosis are unclear. Here, we found that O -GlcNAcylation plays a protective role in AD by inhibiting necroptosis. Necroptosis was increased in AD patients and AD mouse model compared with controls; however, decreased necroptosis due to O -GlcNAcylation of RIPK3 (receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 3) was observed in 5xFAD mice with insufficient O -linked β- N -acetylglucosaminase. O -GlcNAcylation of RIPK3 suppresses phosphorylation of RIPK3 and its interaction with RIPK1. Moreover, increased O -GlcNAcylation ameliorated AD pathology, including Aβ burden, neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, and damaged mitochondria and recovered the M2 phenotype and phagocytic activity of microglia. Thus, our data establish the influence of O -GlcNAcylation on Aβ accumulation and neurodegeneration, suggesting O -GlcNAcylation–based treatments as potential interventions for AD.},

Specifically, the gas flow system includes microchannels and hydrophobic microslits, which facilitate both the introduction of gas into the droplet and droplet mixing. We installed this system into a parallel lipid bilayer device and subsequently demonstrated parts per billion–level (0.5 ppb) detection of 1-octen-3-ol in human breath. Therefore, this system extends the various applications of biological odorant sensing, including breath diagnosis systems and environmental monitoring.},

We find rich features of the Ising-like criticality in structure and slow dynamics at the ideal glass transition point ϕ 0 , showing the thermodynamic nature of glass transition at ϕ 0 . A dynamic criticality is found at the mode-coupling critical point ϕ c for the fast-moving clusters whose critical exponents increase linearly with fragility, reflecting a dynamic glass transition. These results cast light on the glass transition and explain the mystery that the dynamic correlation lengths diverge at two different temperatures.},

Although the basal transcriptomes of adipocyte-derived iMS cells and adipose tissue–derived mesenchymal stem cells were similar, there were changes in histone modifications and CpG methylation at cis-regulatory regions consistent with an epigenetic landscape that was primed for tissue development and differentiation. In a non-specific tissue injury xenograft model, iMS cells contributed directly to muscle, bone, cartilage, and blood vessels, with no evidence of teratogenic potential. In a cardiotoxin muscle injury model, iMS cells contributed specifically to satellite cells and myofibers without ectopic tissue formation.

Specifically, ABA is biosynthesized in both WT and dg1 leaves, but only WT caryopses accumulate leaf-derived ABA. Our demonstration that leaf-derived ABA activates starch synthesis genes explains the incompletely filled and floury seed phenotypes in dg1 . Both the DG1-mediated long-distance ABA transport efficiency and grain-filling phenotypes are temperature sensitive. Moreover, we extended these mechanistic insights to other cereals by observing similar grain-filling defects in a maize DG1 ortholog mutant. Our study demonstrates that rice uses a leaf-to-caryopsis ABA transport–based mechanism to ensure normal seed development in response to variable temperatures.},

IBMs comprise a four-residue, loose consensus sequence, and binding to IAPs requires an unmodified amino terminus. Closely related, IBM-like N termini are present in approximately 5\% of human proteins. We show that suppression of the N-alpha-acetyltransferase NatA turns these cryptic IBM-like sequences into very efficient IAP binders in cell lysates and in vitro and ultimately triggers cellular apoptosis. Thus, amino-terminal acetylation of IBM-like motifs in NatA substrates shields them from IAPs. This previously unrecognized relationship suggests that amino-terminal acetylation is generally protective against protein degradation in human cells. It also identifies IAPs as agents of a general quality control mechanism targeting unacetylated rogues in metazoans.},

Activation of ER stress or silencing of the ER chaperone BiP exacerbates or rescues the glycosylation defects, respectively, indicating that SSR3 and SSR4 enable N-glycosylation during ER stress. Protein levels of the SSR3 subunit are ER stress and UBE2J1 dependent, revealing a mechanism that coordinates upstream N-glycosylation proficiency with downstream ER-associated degradation and proteostasis.

Unfortunately, up to 70\% of patients with TNBC develop resistance to treatment. A known contributor to chemoresistance is dysfunctional mitochondrial apoptosis signaling. We set up a phenotypic small-molecule screen to reveal vulnerabilities in TNBC cells that were independent of mitochondrial apoptosis. Using a functional genetic approach, we identified that a “hit” compound, BAS-2, had a potentially similar mechanism of action to histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC). An in vitro HDAC inhibitor assay confirmed that the compound selectively inhibited HDAC6. Using state-of-the-art acetylome mass spectrometry, we identified glycolytic substrates of HDAC6 in TNBC cells. We confirmed that inhibition or knockout of HDAC6 reduced glycolytic metabolism both in vitro and in vivo.

  abstract     = {Devices that electrically modulate the deep brain have enabled important breakthroughs in the management of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Such devices are typically centimeter-scale, requiring surgical implantation and wired-in powering, which increases the risk of hemorrhage, infection, and damage during daily activity. Using smaller, remotely powered materials could lead to less invasive neuromodulation. Here, we present injectable, magnetoelectric nanoelectrodes that wirelessly transmit electrical signals to the brain in response to an external magnetic field. This mechanism of modulation requires no genetic modification of neural tissue, allows animals to freely move during stimulation, and uses nonresonant carrier frequencies. Using these nanoelectrodes, we demonstrate neuronal modulation in vitro and in deep brain targets in vivo. We also show that local subthalamic modulation promotes modulation in other regions connected via basal ganglia circuitry, leading to behavioral changes in mice. Magnetoelectric materials present a versatile platform technology for less invasive, deep brain neuromodulation.},

  abstract     = {The classic NF-κB pathway plays crucial roles in various immune responses and inflammatory diseases. Its key kinase, IKKβ, participates in a variety of pathological and physiological processes by selectively recognizing its downstream substrates, including p105, p65, and IκBα, but the specific mechanisms of these substrates are unclear. Hyperactivation of one of the substrates, p105, is closely related to the onset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Nfkb1 -deficient mice. In this study, we found that IKKβ ubiquitination on lysine-238 was substantially increased during inflammation. Using mass spectrometry, we identified USP16 as an essential regulator of the IKKβ ubiquitination level that selectively affected p105 phosphorylation without directly affecting p65 or IκBα phosphorylation. Furthermore, USP16 was highly expressed in colon macrophages in patients with IBD, and myeloid-conditional USP16-knockout mice exhibited reduced IBD severity. Our study provides a new theoretical basis for IBD pathogenesis and targeted precision intervention therapy.},

Ice flow and grounding line retreat are variably governed by the coupling between the ice and underlying terrain. We ask to what degree catchment-scale bed characteristics determine ice flow and retreat, drawing on paleo-ice sheet landform imprints from 99 sites on continental shelves worldwide. We find that topographic setting has broadly steered ice flow and that the bed slope favors particular styles of retreat. However, we find exceptions to accepted “rules” of behavior: Regional topographic highs are not always an impediment to fast ice flow, retreat may proceed in a controlled, steady manner on reverse slopes and, unexpectedly, the occurrence of ice streaming is not favored on a particular geological substrate. Furthermore, once grounding line retreat is under way, readvance is rarely observed regardless of regional bed characteristics.},

Here, we report that the Rab32 guanosine triphosphatase and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor BLOC-3 (biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex–3) are central components of a trafficking pathway that controls both bacterial and fungal intracellular pathogens. This host-defense mechanism is active in both human and murine macrophages and is independent of well-known antimicrobial mechanisms such as the NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate)–dependent oxidative burst, production of nitric oxide, and antimicrobial peptides. To survive in human macrophages, Salmonella Typhi actively counteracts the Rab32/BLOC-3 pathway through its Salmonella pathogenicity island-1–encoded type III secretion system. These findings demonstrate that the Rab32/BLOC-3 pathway is a novel and universal host-defense pathway and protects mammalian species from various pathogens.},

The hominoid-specific gene TBC1D3 displays robust capacity of promoting the generation and proliferation of neural progenitors (NPs), which are thought to contribute to cortical expansion. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that TBC1D3 interacts with G9a, a euchromatic histone lysine N -methyltransferase, which mediates dimethylation of histone 3 in lysine 9 (H3K9me2), a suppressive mark for gene expression. TBC1D3 displayed an inhibitory role in G9a’s histone methyltransferase activity. Treatment with G9a inhibitor markedly increased NP proliferation and promoted human cerebral organoid expansion, mimicking the effects caused by TBC1D3 up-regulation. By contrast, blockade of TBC1D3/G9a interaction to disinhibit G9a caused up-regulation of H3K9me2, suppressed NP proliferation, and impaired organoid development. Together, this study has demonstrated a mechanism underlying the role of a hominoid-specific gene in promoting cortical expansion.},

However, the development of nonviral platforms for prenatal delivery is nascent. We developed a library of ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for in utero mRNA delivery to mouse fetuses. We screened LNPs for luciferase mRNA delivery and identified formulations that accumulate within fetal livers, lungs, and intestines with higher efficiency and safety compared to benchmark delivery systems, DLin-MC3-DMA and jetPEI.

First, hematopoietic stem cells generate lineage-restricted progenitors that eventually develop into peripheral, postmitotic monocytes. Second, blood-circulating monocytes undergo differentiation into macrophages, which are specialized phagocytic cells capable of tissue infiltration. While monocytes mediate some level of inflammation and cell toxicity, macrophages boast the widest set of defense mechanisms against pathogens and elicit robust inflammatory responses. Here, we analyze the molecular determinants of monocytic and macrophagic commitment by profiling the EGR1 transcription factor. EGR1 is essential for monopoiesis and binds enhancers that regulate monocytic developmental genes such as CSF1R . However, differentiating macrophages present a very different EGR1 binding pattern. We identify novel binding sites of EGR1 at a large set of inflammatory enhancers, even in the absence of its binding motif. We show that EGR1 repressive activity results in suppression of inflammatory genes and is mediated by the NuRD corepressor complex.},

BsAb primarily targets CD8 T cells in the tumor and increases their proliferation and cytokine production. Among the CD8 T cell population in the tumor, 4-1BB is solely expressed on PD-1 + Tim-3 + “terminally differentiated” subset, and bsAb potentiates these cells for eliminating the tumor. Furthermore, the combination of bsAb and PD-1 blockade synergistically inhibits tumor growth accompanied by further increasing terminally differentiated CD8 T cells.

In dyskinesia, dopamine levels correlated well with l -DOPA levels in extrastriatal regions, such as hippocampus, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and cortical areas, but not in the striatum. Our results demonstrate that l -DOPA–induced dyskinesia is linked to a dysregulation of l -DOPA metabolism throughout the brain. The inability of extrastriatal brain areas to regulate the formation of dopamine during l -DOPA treatment introduces the potential of dopamine or even l -DOPA itself to modulate neuronal signaling widely across the brain, resulting in unwanted side effects.},

Counterintuitively, the species with low or moderate growth rates but diverse prey including diatoms caused red tides globally. The ability of these dinoflagellates to trade off growth for prey diversity is another genetic factor critical to formation of red tides across diverse ocean conditions. This finding has profound implications for explaining the global dominance of particular microalgae, their key eco-evolutionary strategy, and prediction of harmful red tide outbreaks.},

  abstract     = {The reaction C + + H 2 O → HCO + /HOC + + H is one of the most important astrophysical sources of HOC + ions, considered a marker for interstellar molecular clouds exposed to intense ultraviolet or x-ray radiation. Despite much study, there is no consensus on rate constants for formation of the formyl ion isomers in this reaction. This is largely due to difficulties in laboratory study of ion-molecule reactions under relevant conditions. Here, we use a novel experimental platform combining a cryogenic buffer-gas beam with an integrated, laser-cooled ion trap and high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer to probe this reaction at the temperature of cold interstellar clouds. We report a reaction rate constant of k = 7.7(6) × 10 −9 cm 3 s −1 and a branching ratio of formation η = HOC + /HCO + = 2.1(4). Theoretical calculations suggest that this branching ratio is due to the predominant formation of HOC + followed by isomerization of products with internal energy over the isomerization barrier.},

This device robustly quantified viral load over a broad linear range (1 to 10 5 copies/μl) and exhibited a limit of detection (0.38 copies/μl) below that of the RT-PCR reference assay.

Such trapping process endows unaddressable nonmagnetic species with efficient thermo-switchable magnetic response, which determines SMARS’ cross-species synchronized maneuverability. Benefiting from collective merits of hybrid components, SMARS can be configured into specific smart modules spanning from chain, vesicle, droplet, to ionic module, which can implement localized or distributed functions that are single-species unachievable.

We show that gene expression in B. subtilis can be synchronized in 24-hour light or temperature cycles and exhibit phase-specific characteristics of entrainment. Upon release to constant dark and temperature conditions, bacterial biofilm populations have temperature-compensated free-running oscillations with a period close to 24 hours.

Here, we report on an experimental demonstration of chiral edge states in gapped “nanomechanical graphene”—a honeycomb lattice of free-standing silicon nitride nanomechanical membranes with broken spatial inversion symmetry. These chiral edge states can emerge from the conventional flat-band edge states by tuning the on-site boundary potentials. We experimentally demonstrated that they are backscattering-immune against sharp bends and exhibit the “valley-momentum locking” effect. We further realized smooth transition between the chiral edge states and the well-known valley kink states.

The structure reveals extensive alterations to the virion exterior as compared to nonenteric HAdVs, including a unique arrangement of capsid protein IX. The structure also provides new insights into conserved aspects of HAdV architecture such as a proposed location of core protein V, which links the viral DNA to the capsid, and assembly-induced conformational changes in the penton base protein.

To control Zn electrodeposit morphology, we consider fundamental electrokinetic principles and the associated critical issues. It is found that the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on Zn has a similarly strong influence as for alkali metals at low current regimes, characterized by a moss-like morphology. Another key conclusion is that the unique crystal structure of Zn, featuring high anisotropy facets resulting from the hexagonal close-packed lattice with a c / a ratio of 1.85, imposes predominant influences on its growth. In our view, precisely regulating the SEI and the crystallographic features of the Zn offers exciting opportunities that will drive transformative progress.},

In this study, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening and identified TRIM26, an E3 ligase, as a critical HCV host factor. Deficiency of TRIM26 specifically impairs HCV genome replication. Mechanistic studies showed that TRIM26 interacts with HCV-encoded NS5B protein and mediates its K27-linked ubiquitination at residue K51, and thus promotes the NS5B-NS5A interaction. Moreover, mouse TRIM26 does not support HCV replication because of its unique six–amino acid insert that prevents its interaction with NS5B. Ectopic expression of human TRIM26 in a mouse hepatoma cell line that has been reconstituted with other essential HCV host factors promotes HCV infection. In conclusion, we identified TRIM26 as a host factor for HCV replication and a new determinant of host tropism. These results shed light on HCV-host interactions and may facilitate the development of an HCV animal model.},

Under excitation of surface acoustic wave (SAW), we find that a spin current flows orthogonal to the SAW propagation in nonmagnetic metals (NMs). The acoustic spin Hall effect manifests itself in a field-dependent acoustic voltage in NM/ferromagnetic metal bilayers. The acoustic voltage takes a maximum when the NM layer thickness is close to its spin diffusion length, vanishes for NM layers with weak SOI, and increases linearly with the SAW frequency. To account for these results, we find that the spin current must scale with the SOI and the time derivative of the lattice displacement. These results, which imply the strong coupling of electron spins with rotating lattices via the SOI, show the potential of lattice dynamics to supply spin current in strong spin-orbit metals.},

Here, we show that the coexistence of spin glass and antiferromagnetic order allows a novel mechanism to facilitate the switching of the antiferromagnet Fe 1/3 + δ NbS 2 , rooted in the electrically stimulated collective winding of the spin glass. The local texture of the spin glass opens an anisotropic channel of interaction that can be used to rotate the equilibrium orientation of the antiferromagnetic state.

Analyzing a total of just over 1.1 million responses collected daily between 4 April and 10 September reveals not only that partisanship is more important than public health concerns for explaining individuals’ willingness to stay at home and reduce social mobility but also that the effect of partisanship has grown over time—especially among Republicans. All else equal, the relative importance of partisanship for the increasing (un)willingness of Republicans to stay at home highlights the challenge that politics poses for public health.},

  abstract     = {Doppler cooling is a widely used technique to laser cool atoms, molecules, and nanoparticles by exploiting the Doppler shift associated with translational motion. The rotational Doppler effect arising from rotational coordinate transformation should similarly enable optical manipulation of the rotational motion of nanosystems. Here, we show that rotational Doppler cooling and heating (RDC and RDH) effects embody rich and unexplored physics, including an unexpected strong dependence on particle morphology. For geometrically constrained particles, cooling and heating are observed at red- or blue-detuned laser frequencies relative to particle resonances. In contrast, for nanosystems that can be modeled as solid particles, RDH appears close to resonant illumination, while detuned frequencies produce cooling of rotation. We further predict that RDH can lead to optomechanical spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, where an achiral particle under linearly polarized illumination starts spontaneously rotating. Our results open up new exciting possibilities to control the rotational motion of nanosystems.},

In particular, the pale-yellow region on hind wings, which correspondingly sends important putative signals for mimicry and mate preference, is different in shape and chemical features between nonmimetic and mimetic morphs. Recently, we found that mimetic-type doublesex [ dsx (H) ] causes mimetic traits; however, the control of dimorphic pale-yellow colors remains unclear. Here, we revealed that dsx (H) switched the pale-yellow colors from UV-excited fluorescent type (nonmimetic) to UV-reflecting type (mimetic), by repressing the papiliochrome II synthesis genes and nanostructural changes in wing scales. Photoreceptor reactivities showed that some birds and butterflies could effectively recognize mimetic and nonmimetic pale-yellow colors, suggesting that a genetic switch in the UV response of pale-yellow colors may play essential roles in establishing the dimorphic female-limited Batesian mimicry.},

Here, it is found that single-crystalline layers of α-(AlGa) 2 O 3 alloys spanning bandgaps of 5.4 to 8.6 eV can be grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The key step is found to be the use of m-plane sapphire crystal. The phase transition of the epitaxial layers from the α- to the narrower bandgap β-phase is catalyzed by the c-plane of the crystal. Because the c-plane is orthogonal to the growth front of the m-plane surface of the crystal, the narrower bandgap pathways are eliminated, revealing a route to much wider bandgap materials with structural purity. The resulting energy bandgaps of the epitaxial layers span a broad range, heralding the successful epitaxial stabilization of the largest bandgap materials family to date.},

To address this controversy, we use polarization-sensitive stimulated Raman scattering from fingerprint C═C stretching vibration to visualize AmB, ergosterol, and lipid in single fungal cells. Intracellular lipid droplet accumulation in response to AmB treatment is found. AmB is located in membrane and intracellular droplets. In the 16 strains studied, AmB residing inside cell membrane was highly ordered, and its orientation is primarily parallel to phospholipid acyl chains, supporting the ion channel model.

Efficient tuning of the bandgap and higher subbands in BP by modulation of the Fermi level or application of vertical electric fields has been previously demonstrated, allowing electrical control of its above-bandgap optical properties. Here, we report modulation of the optical conductivity below the bandgap (5 to 15 μm) by tuning the charge density in a two-dimensional electron gas induced in BP, thereby modifying its free carrier–dominated intraband response. With a moderate doping density of 7 × 10 12 cm −2 , we were able to observe a polarization-dependent epsilon-near-zero behavior in the dielectric permittivity of BP. The intraband polarization sensitivity is intimately linked to the difference in effective fermionic masses along the two crystallographic directions, as confirmed by our measurements. Our results suggest the potential of multilayer BP to allow new optical functions for emerging photonics applications.},

Our cryo–electron microscopy structures of the yeast class II HDAC ensembles show that the HDAC protomer comprises a triangle-shaped assembly of stoichiometry Hda1 2 -Hda2-Hda3, in which the active sites of the Hda1 dimer are freely accessible. We also observe a tetramer of protomers, where the nucleosome binding modules are inaccessible. Structural analysis of the nucleosome-bound complexes indicates how positioning of Hda1 adjacent to histone H2B affords HDAC catalysis. Moreover, it reveals how an intricate network of multiple contacts between a dimer of protomers and the nucleosome creates a platform for expansion of the HDAC activities. Our study provides comprehensive insight into the structural plasticity of the HDAC complex and its functional mechanism of chromatin modification.},

We adapt a closely lattice-matched MgO(001) substrate and report the successful growth of single-crystalline TiO(001) film using molecular beam epitaxy.

We observe a transition to the superconducting phase below 0.5 K close to that of Ti metal. Density functional theory (DFT) and a DFT-based tight-binding model demonstrate the extreme importance of direct Ti–Ti bonding in TiO, suggesting that similar superconductivity exists in TiO and Ti metal.

Here, we reveal a mechanism by which the nucleus mechanically generates migration paths for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in confining microenvironments. MSCs migrate robustly in nanoporous, confining hydrogels that are viscoelastic and plastic but not in hydrogels that are more elastic. To migrate, MSCs first extend thin protrusions that widen over time because of a nuclear piston, thus opening up a migration path in a confining matrix. Theoretical modeling and experiments indicate that the nucleus pushing into the protrusion activates mechanosensitive ion channels, leading to an influx of ions that increases osmotic pressure, which outcompetes hydrostatic pressure to drive protrusion expansion. Thus, instead of limiting migration, the nucleus powers migration by generating migration paths.},

During synovial tissue homeostasis, both monocyte-derived F4/80 int and self-renewing F4/80 hi tissue–resident, macrophage populations were identified. However, in HUPO mice, decreased synovial tissue–resident macrophages preceded chronic arthritis, opened a niche permitting the influx of activated monocytes, with impaired ability to differentiate into F4/80 hi tissue–resident macrophages. In contrast, Flip -replete monocytes entered the vacated niche and differentiated into tissue-resident macrophages, which suppressed arthritis. Genes important in macrophage tissue residency were reduced in HUPO F4/80 hi macrophages and in leukocyte-rich rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue monocytes. Our observations demonstrate that the macrophage tissue–resident niche is necessary for suppression of chronic inflammation and may contribute to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.},

Results showed that manuscripts written by women as solo authors or coauthored by women were treated even more favorably by referees and editors. Although there were some differences between fields of research, our findings suggest that peer review and editorial processes do not penalize manuscripts by women. However, increasing gender diversity in editorial teams and referee pools could help journals inform potential authors about their attention to these factors and so stimulate participation by women.},

PCC 7002), an engineered Proterozoic analog lacking a CO 2 -concentrating mechanism, and cyanobacterial mats. At mid-Proterozoic pH and p CO 2 values, carbon isotope fractionation by the wild-type β-cyanobacterium is fully consistent with the Proterozoic carbon isotope record, suggesting that cyanobacteria with CO 2 -concentrating mechanisms were apparently the major primary producers in the pelagic Proterozoic ocean, despite atmospheric CO 2 levels up to 100 times modern. The selectively permeable microcompartments central to cyanobacterial CO 2 -concentrating mechanisms (“carboxysomes”) likely emerged to shield rubisco from O 2 during the Great Oxidation Event.},

Most acoustic tweezers rely on acoustic radiation forces; however, the accompanying acoustic streaming often generates unpredictable effects due to its nonlinear nature and high sensitivity to the three-dimensional boundary conditions. Here, we demonstrate acoustohydrodynamic tweezers, which generate stable, symmetric pairs of vortices to create hydrodynamic traps for object manipulation. These stable vortices enable predictable control of a flow field, which translates into controlled motion of droplets or particles on the operating surface. We built a programmable droplet-handling platform to demonstrate the basic functions of planar-omnidirectional droplet transport, merging droplets, and in situ mixing via a sequential cascade of biochemical reactions. Our acoustohydrodynamic tweezers enables improved control of acoustic streaming and demonstrates a previously unidentified method for contact-free manipulation of bioanalytes and digitalized liquid handling based on a compact and scalable functional unit.},

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is integral to nearly all material and fuel electrosyntheses. However, very little is known about the structural evolution of the OER electrocatalyst, especially the amorphous layer that forms from the crystalline structure. Here, we investigate the interfacial transformation of the SrIrO 3 OER electrocatalyst. The SrIrO 3 amorphization is initiated by the lattice oxygen redox, a step that allows Sr 2+ to diffuse and O 2− to reorganize the SrIrO 3 structure. This activation turns SrIrO 3 into a highly disordered Ir octahedral network with Ir square-planar motif. The final Sr y IrO x exhibits a greater degree of disorder than IrO x made from other processing methods. Our results demonstrate that the structural reorganization facilitated by coupled ionic diffusions is essential to the disordered structure of the SrIrO 3 electrocatalyst.},

The GOLT’s basic tenet is that the surface area of the gills or other respiratory surfaces of WBE cannot, as two-dimensional structures, supply them with sufficient oxygen to keep up with the growth of their three-dimensional bodies. Thus, a lower relative oxygen supply induces sexual maturation, and later a slowing and cessation of growth, along with an increase of physiological processes relying on glycolytic enzymes and a declining role of oxidative enzymes. Because the “dimensional tension” underlying this argument is widely misunderstood, emphasis is given to a detailed refutation of objections to the GOLT. This theory still needs to be put on a solid quantitative basis, which will occur after the misconceptions surrounding it are put to rest.},

This is partly motivated, by the observation that the depletions in both the least and most refractory rare earth elements (REEs) in meteoritic group II calcium-aluminum–rich inclusions (CAIs) can be reproduced by thermodynamic models of solar nebula condensation. We measured the isotopic compositions of Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Er, and Yb in eight CAIs to test this scenario. Contrary to expectation for equilibrium condensation, we find light isotope enrichment for the most refractory REEs and more subdued isotopic variations for the least refractory REEs. This suggests that group II CAIs formed by a two-stage process involving fast evaporation of preexisting materials, followed by near-equilibrium recondensation. The calculated time scales are consistent with heating in events akin to FU Orionis– or EX Lupi–type outbursts of eruptive pre–main-sequence stars.},

They typically consist of organically functionalized inorganic nanoparticles arranged into periodic structures analogous to crystalline lattices, including superlattice imperfections induced by processing or mechanical loading. Although featuring a variety of promising functional properties, their lack of mechanical robustness and unknown deformation mechanisms hamper their implementation into devices. We show that supercrystalline materials react to indentation with the same deformation patterns encountered in single crystals. Supercrystals accommodate plastic deformation in the form of pile-ups, dislocations, and slip bands. These phenomena occur, at least partially, also after cross-linking of the organic ligands, which leads to a multifold strengthening of the nanocomposites. The classic shear theories of crystalline materials are found to describe well the behavior of supercrystalline nanocomposites, which result to feature an elastoplastic behavior, accompanied by compaction.},

In this study, we interrogate the molecular heterogeneity of AD by analyzing 1543 transcriptomes across five brain regions in two AD cohorts using an integrative network approach. We identify three major molecular subtypes of AD corresponding to different combinations of multiple dysregulated pathways, such as susceptibility to tau-mediated neurodegeneration, amyloid-β neuroinflammation, synaptic signaling, immune activity, mitochondria organization, and myelination. Multiscale network analysis reveals subtype-specific drivers such as GABRB2 , LRP10 , MSN , PLP1 , and ATP6V1A . We further demonstrate that variations between existing AD mouse models recapitulate a certain degree of subtype heterogeneity, which may partially explain why a vast majority of drugs that succeeded in specific mouse models do not align with generalized human trials across all AD subtypes. Therefore, subtyping patients with AD is a critical step toward precision medicine for this devastating disease.},

Here, using next-generation sequencing methods, we identified novel and ultrarare variants in adiponectin receptor 1 ( ADIPOR1 ) as risk factors for HCM. Biochemical studies showed that ADIPOR1 variants dysregulate glucose and lipid metabolism and cause cardiac hypertrophy through the p38/mammalian target of rapamycin and/or extracellular signal–regulated kinase pathways. A transgenic mouse model expressing an ADIPOR1 variant displayed cardiomyopathy that recapitulated the cellular findings, and these features were rescued by rapamycin.

Gene therapy was evaluated in a mouse model of TSC2 using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector carrying the complementary for a “condensed” form of human tuberin (cTuberin). Functionality of cTuberin was verified in culture. A mouse model of TSC2 was generated by AAV-Cre recombinase disruption of Tsc2 -floxed alleles at birth, leading to a shortened lifespan (mean 58 days) and brain pathology consistent with TSC. When these mice were injected intravenously on day 21 with AAV9-cTuberin, the mean survival was extended to 462 days with reduction in brain pathology. This demonstrates the potential of treating life-threatening TSC2 lesions with a single intravenous injection of AAV9-cTuberin.},

Although these approaches demonstrate that they record pH cf over different time scales, they reveal that both species can cope with OA under optimal temperatures (28°C) by elevating pH cf and aragonite saturation state (Ω cf ) in support of calcification. At 31°C, neither species elevated these parameters as they did at 28°C and, likewise, could not maintain substantially positive calcification rates under any pH treatment.

Here, we show that ITIH4 is cleaved by several human proteases within a protease-susceptible region, enabling ITIH4 to function as a protease inhibitor. This is exemplified by its inhibition of mannan-binding lectin–associated serine protease-1 (MASP-1), MASP-2, and plasma kallikrein, which are key proteases for intravascular host defense. Mechanistically, ITIH4 acts as bait that, upon cleavage, forms a noncovalent, inhibitory complex with the executing protease that depends on the ITIH4 von Willebrand factor A domain. ITIH4 inhibits the MASPs by sterically preventing larger protein substrates from accessing their active sites, which remain accessible and fully functional toward small substrates. Thus, we demonstrate that ITIH4 functions as a protease inhibitor by a previously undescribed inhibitory mechanism.},

The PBS has several peripheral rods and a central core that binds to the thylakoid membrane, allowing energy coupling with photosystem II (PSII) and PSI. Here, we have combined chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry with homology modeling to propose a tricylindrical cyanobacterial PBS core structure. Our model reveals a side-view crossover configuration of the two basal cylinders, consolidating the essential roles of the anchoring domains composed of the ApcE PB loop and ApcD, which facilitate the energy transfer to PSII and PSI, respectively. The uneven bottom surface of the PBS core contrasts with the flat reducing side of PSII. The extra space between two basal cylinders and PSII provides increased accessibility for regulatory elements, e.g., orange carotenoid protein, which are required for modulating photochemical activity.},

However, the current technologies constrain the geometries of hydrogel-polymer hybrid to laminates consisting of hydrogel with silicone rubbers. This greatly limits functionality and performance of hydrogel-polymer–based devices and machines. Here, we report a simple yet versatile multimaterial 3D printing approach to fabricate complex hybrid 3D structures consisting of highly stretchable and high–water content acrylamide-PEGDA (AP) hydrogels covalently bonded with diverse UV curable polymers. The hybrid structures are printed on a self-built DLP-based multimaterial 3D printer. We realize covalent bonding between AP hydrogel and other polymers through incomplete polymerization of AP hydrogel initiated by the water-soluble photoinitiator TPO nanoparticles. We demonstrate a few applications taking advantage of this approach. The proposed approach paves a new way to realize multifunctional soft devices and machines by bonding hydrogel with other polymers in 3D forms.},

A thick body wall and probable J-shaped gut are present within the cup, and the middle layer of the often-spinose skeleton and skeletal pores are selectively pyritized, supporting an organic-rich composition and tripartite construction with possible sensory punctae. These features suggest a total group lophotrochozoan affinity.

Consequently, traditional methods rely on phylogenetic reconstruction. Here, we propose a model-based approach to the problem through the analysis of language change as a stochastic process combining vertical descent, spatial interactions, and mutations in both dimensions. A notion of linguistic temperature emerges naturally from this analysis as a dimensionless measure of the propensity of a linguistic feature to undergo change. We demonstrate how temperatures of linguistic features can be inferred from their present-day geospatial distributions, without recourse to information about their phylogenies. Thus, the evolutionary dynamics of language, operating across thousands of years, leave a measurable geospatial signature. This signature licenses inferences about the historical evolution of languages even in the absence of longitudinal data.},

The SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein interacts with the human ACE2 receptor to mediate viral entry into host cells. We report the cryo-EM structures of a tightly closed SARS-CoV-2 S trimer with packed fusion peptide and an ACE2-bound S trimer at 2.7- and 3.8-Å resolution, respectively. Accompanying ACE2 binding to the up receptor-binding domain (RBD), the associated ACE2-RBD exhibits continuous swing motions. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer appears much more sensitive to the ACE2 receptor than the SARS-CoV S trimer regarding receptor-triggered transformation from the closed prefusion state to the fusion-prone open state, potentially contributing to the superior infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We defined the RBD T470-T478 loop and Y505 as viral determinants for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2. Our findings depict the mechanism of ACE2-induced S trimer conformational transitions from the ground prefusion state toward the postfusion state, facilitating development of anti–SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapeutics.},

Here, we show that the calcium-dependent cytokines S100A8 and S100A9 are recruited to numerous promoters and enhancers in a model of breast cellular transformation. This recruitment is associated with multiple DNA sequence motifs recognized by DNA binding transcription factors that are linked to transcriptional activation and are important for transformation. The cytokines interact with these transcription factors in nuclear extracts, and they activate transcription when artificially recruited to a target promoter. Nuclear-specific expression of S100A8/A9 promotes oncogenic transcription and leads to enhanced breast transformation phenotype. These results suggest that, in addition to its classical cytokine function, S100A8/A9 can act as a transcriptional coactivator.},

Using organotypic 3D cultures of primary human liver cells, we demonstrate that interferon-α2 increases ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in parenchymal cells by greater than fivefold. RNA-seq reveals gene response signatures associated with platelet activation, fully inhibited by baricitinib. Using viral load quantifications and superresolution microscopy, we found that baricitinib exerts activity rapidly through the inhibition of host proteins (numb-associated kinases), uniquely among antivirals. This reveals mechanistic actions of a Janus kinase-1/2 inhibitor targeting viral entry, replication, and the cytokine storm and is associated with beneficial outcomes including in severely ill elderly patients, data that incentivize further randomized controlled trials.},

The chromatin packing behavior of these domains exhibits a complex bidirectional relationship with active gene transcription.

Here, we show that triplication of homologous chromosome 21 genes aggravates neuroinflammation in combined murine DS-AD models. Overexpression of USP25 , a deubiquitinating enzyme encoded by chromosome 21, results in microglial activation and induces synaptic and cognitive deficits, whereas genetic ablation of Usp25 reduces neuroinflammation and rescues synaptic and cognitive function in 5×FAD mice. Mechanistically, USP25 deficiency attenuates microglia-mediated proinflammatory cytokine overproduction and synapse elimination. Inhibition of USP25 reestablishes homeostatic microglial signatures and restores synaptic and cognitive function in 5×FAD mice. In summary, we demonstrate an unprecedented role for trisomy 21 and pathogenic effects associated with microgliosis as a result of the increased USP25 dosage, implicating USP25 as a therapeutic target for neuroinflammation in DS and AD.},

An airflow pattern that travels across the cabin, farthest from the occupants, can potentially reduce the transmission risk.

Compared with two of the best-studied two-domain CuNiRs represented by the blue ( Ax NiR) and green ( Ac NiR) subclasses, Br 2D NiR, a blue CuNiR, shows a substantially lower catalytic efficiency despite a sequence identity of ~70\%. Advanced synchrotron radiation and x-ray free-electron laser are used to obtain the most accurate (atomic resolution with unrestrained SHELX refinement) and damage-free (free from radiation-induced chemistry) structures, in as-isolated, substrate-bound, and product-bound states. This combination has shed light on the protonation states of essential catalytic residues, additional reaction intermediates, and how catalytic efficiency is modulated.},

  abstract     = {Recent work has revealed that both plants and animals transfer genomes between cells. In plants, horizontal transfer of entire plastid, mitochondrial, or nuclear genomes between species generates new combinations of nuclear and organellar genomes, or produces novel species that are allopolyploid. The mechanisms of genome transfer between cells are unknown. Here, we used grafting to identify the mechanisms involved in plastid genome transfer from plant to plant. We show that during proliferation of wound-induced callus, plastids dedifferentiate into small, highly motile, amoeboid organelles. Simultaneously, new intercellular connections emerge by localized cell wall disintegration, forming connective pores through which amoeboid plastids move into neighboring cells. Our work uncovers a pathway of organelle movement from cell to cell and provides a mechanistic framework for horizontal genome transfer.},

To circumvent the problems associated with incomplete sampling, we have studied the immunogenetic features of one of the smallest known vertebrates, the cyprinid fish Paedocypris sp. “Singkep” (“minifish”). Despite its small size, minifish has the key genetic facilities characterizing the principal vertebrate lymphocyte lineages. As described for mammals, the frequency distributions of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor clonotypes exhibit the features of fractal systems, demonstrating that self-similarity is a fundamental property of antigen receptor repertoires of vertebrates, irrespective of body size. Hence, minifish achieve immunocompetence via a few thousand lymphocytes organized in robust scale-free networks, thereby ensuring immune reactivity even when cells are lost or clone sizes fluctuate during immune responses.},

Furthermore, we identified hotspots in TP53 , NOTCH1 , and GRM3 where mutations were significantly associated with UV exposure. In the normal skin from patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, we found that the cancer burden was associated with the UV-induced mutations, with the difference mostly conferred by the low-frequency CMs. These findings provide previously unknown information on UV’s carcinogenic effect and pave the road for future development of quantitative assessment of subclinical UV damage and skin cancer risk.},

The genome release of iflaviruses can be induced in vitro by exposure to acidic pH, implying that they enter cells by endocytosis. Genome release intermediates of iflaviruses have not been structurally characterized. Here, we show that conformational changes and expansion of iflavirus RNA genomes, which are induced by acidic pH, trigger the opening of iflavirus particles. Capsids of slow bee paralysis virus and sacbrood virus crack into pieces. In contrast, capsids of deformed wing virus are more flexible and open like flowers to release their genomes. The large openings in iflavirus particles enable the fast exit of genomes from capsids, which decreases the probability of genome degradation by the RNases present in endosomes.},

Here, we demonstrate that antimony (Sb), a pure metal, is optically distinguishable between two programmable states as nanoscale thin films. We show that these states, corresponding to the crystalline and amorphous phases of the metal, are stable at room temperature. Crucially from an application standpoint, we demonstrate both its optoelectronic modulation capabilities and switching speed using single subpicosecond pulses. The simplicity of depositing a single metal portends its potential for use in any optoelectronic application where metallic conductors with an actively tunable state are important.},

How and where in the brain are sensory inputs combined with state information to select an appropriate behavior? Here, we investigate how food deprivation affects olfactory behavior in Drosophila larvae. We find that certain odors repel well-fed animals but attract food-deprived animals and that feeding state flexibly alters neural processing in the first olfactory center, the antennal lobe. Hunger differentially modulates two output pathways required for opposing behavioral responses. Upon food deprivation, attraction-mediating uniglomerular projection neurons show elevated odor-evoked activity, whereas an aversion-mediating multiglomerular projection neuron receives odor-evoked inhibition. The switch between these two pathways is regulated by the lone serotonergic neuron in the antennal lobe, CSD. Our findings demonstrate how flexible behaviors can arise from state-dependent circuit dynamics in an early sensory processing center.},

One approach to overcoming this challenge involves treatment administration while BBB is transiently breached after injury. However, it offers a limited window for therapeutic intervention and is applicable to only a subset of injuries with substantially breached BBB. We report a nanoparticle platform for BBB pathophysiology–independent delivery of siRNA in TBI. We achieved this by combined modulation of surface chemistry and coating density on nanoparticles, which maximized their active transport across BBB. Engineered nanoparticles injected within or outside the window of breached BBB in TBI mice showed threefold higher brain accumulation compared to nonengineered PEGylated nanoparticles and 50\% gene silencing. Together, our data suggest that this nanoparticle platform is a promising next-generation drug delivery approach for the treatment of TBI.},

Here, we show that mice deficient for a muscle-specific enzyme of very-long-chain fatty acid synthesis display increased basal energy expenditure and protection against high-fat diet–induced obesity. Mechanistically, muscle-specific modulation of the very-long-chain fatty acid pathway was associated with a reduced content of the inner mitochondrial membrane phospholipid cardiolipin and a blunted coupling efficiency between the respiratory chain and adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) synthase, which was restored by cardiolipin enrichment. Our study reveals that selective increase of lipid oxidative capacities in skeletal muscle, through the cardiolipin-dependent lowering of mitochondrial ATP production, provides an effective option against obesity at the whole-body level.},

We found number tuning in a randomly initialized network originating from a combination of monotonically decreasing and increasing neuronal activities, which emerges spontaneously from the statistical properties of bottom-up projections.

Because SARS-CoV-2 can spread from individuals with presymptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic infections, the reopening of societies and the control of virus spread will be facilitated by robust population screening, for which virus testing will often be central. After infection, individuals undergo a period of incubation during which viral titers are too low to detect, followed by exponential viral growth, leading to peak viral load and infectiousness and ending with declining titers and clearance. Given the pattern of viral load kinetics, we model the effectiveness of repeated population screening considering test sensitivities, frequency, and sample-to-answer reporting time. These results demonstrate that effective screening depends largely on frequency of testing and speed of reporting and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity. We therefore conclude that screening should prioritize accessibility, frequency, and sample-to-answer time; analytical limits of detection should be secondary.},

  abstract     = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are fundamental molecular building blocks of fullerenes and carbonaceous nanostructures in the interstellar medium and in combustion systems. However, an understanding of the formation of aromatic molecules carrying five-membered rings—the essential building block of nonplanar PAHs—is still in its infancy. Exploiting crossed molecular beam experiments augmented by electronic structure calculations and astrochemical modeling, we reveal an unusual pathway leading to the formation of indene (C 9 H 8 )—the prototype aromatic molecule with a five-membered ring—via a barrierless bimolecular reaction involving the simplest organic radical—methylidyne (CH)—and styrene (C 6 H 5 C 2 H 3 ) through the hitherto elusive methylidyne addition–cyclization–aromatization (MACA) mechanism. Through extensive structural reorganization of the carbon backbone, the incorporation of a five-membered ring may eventually lead to three-dimensional PAHs such as corannulene (C 20 H 10 ) along with fullerenes (C 60 , C 70 ), thus offering a new concept on the low-temperature chemistry of carbon in our galaxy.},

Initially, we investigate the virus binding dynamics to validate the better binding performance of the heteromultivalent moieties as compared to homomultivalent ones. The heteromultivalent binding moieties are transferred to nanostructures with a bowl-like shape matching the viral spherical surface. Unlike the conventional homomultivalent inhibitors, the heteromultivalent ones exhibit a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 32.4 ± 13.7 μg/ml due to the synergistic multivalent effects and the topology-matched shape. At a dose without causing cellular toxicity, &gt;99.99\% reduction of virus propagation has been achieved. Since multiple binding sites have also been identified on the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), we envision that the use of heteromultivalent nanostructures may also be applied to develop a potent inhibitor to prevent coronavirus infection.},

However, the performance of widely used gene switches is limited due to low tissue penetrance and possible phototoxicity of the light stimulus. To overcome these limitations, we engineer optogenetic synthetic transcription factors to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in close spatial proximity to promoters. Phase separation of constitutive and optogenetic synthetic transcription factors was achieved by incorporation of intrinsically disordered regions. Supported by a quantitative mathematical model, we demonstrate that engineered transcription factor droplets form at target promoters and increase gene expression up to fivefold. This increase in performance was observed in multiple mammalian cells lines as well as in mice following in situ transfection. The results of this work suggest that the introduction of intrinsically disordered domains is a simple yet effective means to boost synthetic transcription factor activity.},

Practical applications, however, typically involve multiple parameters, for which the ultimate precision is much less understood. Here, by relating the precision limit directly to the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, we show that to achieve the highest precisions for multiple parameters at the same time requires the saturation of multiple Heisenberg uncertainty relations simultaneously. Guided by this insight, we experimentally demonstrate an optimally controlled multipass scheme, which saturates three Heisenberg uncertainty relations simultaneously and achieves the highest precisions for the estimation of all three parameters in SU(2) operators. With eight controls, we achieve a 13.27-dB improvement in terms of the variance (6.63 dB for the SD) over the classical scheme with the same loss. As an experiment demonstrating the simultaneous achievement of the ultimate precisions for multiple parameters, our work marks an important step in multiparameter quantum metrology with wide implications.},

However, since most FLIMs are based on point-to-point measurements, mechanical scanning of a focal spot is needed for forming an image, which hampers rapid imaging. Here, we demonstrate scan-less full-field FLIM based on a one-to-one correspondence between two-dimensional (2D) image pixels and frequency-multiplexed radio frequency (RF) signals. A vast number of dual-comb optical beats between dual optical frequency combs are effectively adopted for 2D spectral mapping and high-density frequency multiplexing in the RF region. Bimodal images of fluorescence amplitude and lifetime are obtained with high quantitativeness from amplitude and phase spectra of fluorescence RF comb modes without the need for mechanical scanning.

Vasculopathy has been reported in COVID-19, stressing the importance of probing pulmonary microstructure and function at the alveolar-capillary interface. While computed tomography (CT) detects structural abnormalities, little is known about the impact of disease on lung function. 129 Xe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a technique uniquely capable of assessing ventilation, microstructure, and gas exchange. Using 129 Xe MRI, we found that COVID-19 patients show a higher rate of ventilation defects (5.9\% versus 3.7\%), unchanged microstructure, and longer gas-blood exchange time (43.5 ms versus 32.5 ms) compared with healthy individuals. These findings suggest that regional ventilation and alveolar airspace dimensions are relatively normal around the time of discharge, while gas-blood exchange function is diminished. This study establishes the feasibility of localized lung function measurements in COVID-19 patients and their potential usefulness as a supplement to structural imaging.},

Age-dependent increased expression of NLRP3 in the ovary was observed in WT mice during reproductive aging. High expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1β was also observed in granulosa cells from patients with ovarian insufficiency. Ablation of NLRP3 improved the survival and pregnancy rates and increased anti-Müllerian hormone levels and autophagy rates in ovaries. Deficiency of NLRP3 also reduced serum FSH and estradiol levels. Consistent with these results, pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 using a direct NLRP3 inhibitor, MCC950, improved fertility in female mice to levels comparable to those of Nlrp3 −/− mice. These results suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome is implicated in the age-dependent loss of female fertility and position this inflammasome as a potential new therapeutic target for the treatment of infertility.},

Mechanistic analyses revealed that transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO, heat shock factor HSF-1, and nuclear receptor DAF-12/FXR functioned transgenerationally to implement the hormetic stress response. Histone H3K9me3 methyltransferases SET-25 and SET-32 and DNA N 6 -methyl methyltransferase DAMT-1 participated in transmitting high-temperature memory across generations.

Analyzing normal tissue transcriptomics data in the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, we quantify the extent of co-inactivation of cancer synthetic lethal (cSL) gene pairs and find that normal tissues with more down-regulated cSL gene pairs have lower and delayed cancer risk. Consistently, more cSL gene pairs become up-regulated in cells treated by carcinogens and throughout premalignant stages in vivo.

  abstract     = {Despite past extensive studies, the mechanisms underlying pulmonary fibrosis (PF) still remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that lungs originating from different types of patients with PF, including coronavirus disease 2019, systemic sclerosis–associated interstitial lung disease, and idiopathic PF, and from mice following bleomycin (BLM)–induced PF are characterized by the altered methyl-CpG–binding domain 2 (MBD2) expression in macrophages. Depletion of Mbd2 in macrophages protected mice against BLM-induced PF. Mbd2 deficiency significantly attenuated transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1) production and reduced M2 macrophage accumulation in the lung following BLM induction. Mechanistically, Mbd2 selectively bound to the Ship promoter in macrophages, by which it repressed Ship expression and enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling to promote the macrophage M2 program. Therefore, intratracheal administration of liposomes loaded with Mbd2 siRNA protected mice from BLM-induced lung injuries and fibrosis. Together, our data support the possibility that MBD2 could be a viable target against PF in clinical settings.},

  abstract     = {Fanconi anemia (FA), the most common inherited bone marrow failure and leukemia predisposition syndrome, is generally attributed to alterations in DNA damage responses due to the loss of function of the DNA repair and replication rescue activities of the FANC pathway. Here, we report that FANCA deficiency, whose inactivation has been identified in two-thirds of FA patients, is associated with nucleolar homeostasis loss, mislocalization of key nucleolar proteins, including nucleolin (NCL) and nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), as well as alterations in ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. FANCA coimmunoprecipitates with NCL and NPM1 in a FANCcore complex–independent manner and, unique among the FANCcore complex proteins, associates with ribosomal subunits, influencing the stoichiometry of the translational machineries. In conclusion, we have identified unexpected nucleolar and translational consequences specifically associated with FANCA deficiency that appears to be involved in both DNA damage and nucleolar stress responses, challenging current hypothesis on FA physiopathology.},

  abstract     = {Advances in optoelectronics require materials with novel and engineered characteristics. A class of materials that has garnered tremendous interest is metal-halide perovskites, stimulated by meteoric increases in photovoltaic efficiencies of perovskite solar cells. In addition, recent advances have applied perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) in light-emitting devices. It was found recently that, for cesium lead-halide perovskite NCs, their unusually efficient light emission may be due to a unique excitonic fine structure composed of three bright triplet states that minimally interact with a proximal dark singlet state. To study this fine structure without isolating single NCs, we use multidimensional coherent spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures to reveal coherences involving triplet states of a CsPbI 3 NC ensemble. Picosecond time scale dephasing times are measured for both triplet and inter-triplet coherences, from which we infer a unique exciton fine structure level ordering composed of a dark state energetically positioned within the bright triplet manifold.},

We aimed to investigate their levels and associations with Aβ burden and cognitive decline in AD in a cross-sectional cohort from China and a longitudinal cohort from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study. NAbs-Aβ levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were tested according to their epitopes. Levels of NAbs targeting the amino terminus of Aβ increased, and those targeting the mid-domain of Aβ decreased in both CSF and plasma in AD patients. Higher plasma levels of NAbs targeting the amino terminus of Aβ and lower plasma levels of NAbs targeting the mid-domain of Aβ were associated with higher brain amyloidosis at baseline and faster cognitive decline during follow-up. Our findings suggest a dynamic response of the adaptive immune system in the progression of AD and are relevant to current passive immunotherapeutic strategies.},

  abstract     = {The retreat and acceleration of Greenland glaciers since the mid-1990s have been attributed to the enhanced intrusion of warm Atlantic Waters (AW) into fjords, but this assertion has not been quantitatively tested on a Greenland-wide basis or included in models. Here, we investigate how AW influenced retreat at 226 marine-terminating glaciers using ocean modeling, remote sensing, and in situ observations. We identify 74 glaciers in deep fjords with AW controlling 49\% of the mass loss that retreated when warming increased undercutting by 48\%. Conversely, 27 glaciers calving on shallow ridges and 24 in cold, shallow waters retreated little, contributing 15\% of the loss, while 10 glaciers retreated substantially following the collapse of several ice shelves. The retreat mechanisms remain undiagnosed at 87 glaciers without ocean and bathymetry data, which controlled 19\% of the loss. Ice sheet projections that exclude ocean-induced undercutting may underestimate mass loss by at least a factor of 2.},

  abstract     = {We review recent advances in our understanding of magnetism in the solar nebula and protoplanetary disks (PPDs). We discuss the implications of theory, meteorite measurements, and astronomical observations for planetary formation and nebular evolution. Paleomagnetic measurements indicate the presence of fields of 0.54 ± 0.21 G at ~1 to 3 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun and ≳0.06 G at 3 to 7 AU until &gt;1.22 and &gt;2.51 million years (Ma) after solar system formation, respectively. These intensities are consistent with those predicted to enable typical astronomically observed protostellar accretion rates of ~10 −8 M ⊙ year −1 , suggesting that magnetism played a central role in mass transport in PPDs. Paleomagnetic studies also indicate fields &lt;0.006 G and &lt;0.003 G in the inner and outer solar system by 3.94 and 4.89 Ma, respectively, consistent with the nebular gas having dispersed by this time. This is similar to the observed lifetimes of extrasolar protoplanetary disks.},

  abstract     = {Proper formation of area identities of the cerebral cortex is crucial for cognitive functions and social behaviors of the brain. It remains largely unknown whether epigenetic mechanisms, including histone methylation, regulate cortical arealization. Here, we removed SETD2, the methyltransferase for histone 3 lysine-36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), in the developing dorsal forebrain in mice and showed that Setd2 is required for proper cortical arealization and the formation of cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits. Moreover, Setd2 conditional knockout mice exhibit defects in social interaction, motor learning, and spatial memory, reminiscent of patients with the Sotos-like syndrome bearing SETD2 mutations. SETD2 maintains the expression of clustered protocadherin ( cPcdh ) genes in an H3K36me3 methyltransferase–dependent manner. Aberrant cortical arealization was recapitulated in cPcdh heterozygous mice. Together, our study emphasizes epigenetic mechanisms underlying cortical arealization and pathogenesis of the Sotos-like syndrome.},
