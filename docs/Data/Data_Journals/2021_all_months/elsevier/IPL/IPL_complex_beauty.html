This strengthens the NP-hardness result of Li and Nikolov [9] for the exact version of the problem, and answers a question posed by them. Furthermore, since Li and Nikolov showed that the problem is contained in Π 2 Π2 , our result makes linear discrepancy another natural problem that is Π 2 Π2 -complete (to approximate).},

Let Q m Qm be a certain subcube of an n -dimensional hypercube Q n Qn , i.e., 1 ≤ m ≤ n 1≤m≤n , and let F F be a set of vertex-disjoint subcubes of Q m Qm . Then ( a ) Q m Qm -subcube connectivity κ s ( Q n ; Q m ) κs(Qn;Qm) of Q n Qn is the minimum cardinality over all F F &#39;s such that Q n − F Qn−F is disconnected; ( b ) Q m Qm -subcube fault-tolerant Hamiltonicity H s ( Q n ; Q m ) Hs(Qn;Qm) of Q n Qn is the maximum integer k such that Q n − F Qn−F is Hamiltonian for every F F with | F | ≤ k |F|≤k . In particular, if every element in F F is isomorphic to Q m Qm , then κ ( Q n ; Q m ) κ(Qn;Qm) (resp. H ( Q n ; Q m ) H(Qn;Qm) ) represents Q m Qm -cube connectivity (resp. Q m Qm -cube fault-tolerant Hamiltonicity ) of Q n Qn . Similarly, HL s ( Q n ; Q m ) HLs(Qn;Qm) (resp. HL ( Q n ; Q m ) HL(Qn;Qm) ) means Q m Qm -subcube (resp. Q m Qm -cube) fault-tolerant Hamilton laceability of Q n Qn . Our main results are as follows: (1) κ s ( Q n ; Q m ) = κ ( Q n ; Q m ) = n − m κs(Qn;Qm)=κ(Qn;Qm)=n−m for n − m ≥ 2 n−m≥2 , i.e., by deleting ( n − m − 1 n−m−1 ) m -dimensional hypercube Q m Qm or its subcubes from the n -dimensional hypercube Q n Qn , the resulting graph is still connected.

In general, those orderings and orientations are hard to compute, even approximately. In this note, we show that an inductive k -independence ordering can be computed in k -simplicial graphs, and a k -approximation (that is, a solution with approximation ratio at most k ) to the optimal inductive independence ordering can be computed in k -perfectly orientable graphs. As a result, we obtain a k -approximation (2 k -approximation) algorithm for maximum weight independent sets in k -simplicial ( k -perfectly orientable, respectively) graphs that runs in polynomial time independent of k without prior knowledge of the ordering.},

The parity of the vertex is 0 if the number of ones in its label is even, and is 1 if the number of ones is odd. Two vertices a and b are connected by an edge iff a and b differ in one position. If a and b differ in position i , then we say that the edge ( a , b ) (a,b) goes in dimension i and we define the parity of the edge as the parity of the end with 0 on the position i . It was already known that Q n Qn is not Hamiltonian if all edges going in one dimension and of the same parity are faulty. In this paper we show that if n ≥ 4 n≥4 then all other hypercubes are Hamiltonian. In other words, every cube Q n Qn , with n ≥ 4 n≥4 and disjoint faulty edges is Hamiltonian if and only if for each dimension there are two healthy crossing edges of different parity.},

(A 2-matching is any subset of the edges such that each vertex is incident to at most two of its edges.) Depending on the variant a restricted 2-matching means a 2-matching that is either triangle-free or square-free or both triangle- and square-free. Since computing a maximum weight square-free 2-matching in a subcubic graph is NP NP -hard, in the second and third variant we additionally assume that the edge-weights are vertex-induced on each square. While there exist polynomial time algorithms for the first two types of 2-matchings, they are quite complicated or use advanced methodology. For each of the three problems we present a simple reduction to the computation of a maximum weight b -matching. The reduction is conducted with the aid of half-edges . A half-edge of edge e is, informally speaking, a half of e containing exactly one of its endpoints. For a subset of triangles and/or squares of G , we replace each edge of such a triangle/square with two half-edges. Two half-edges of one edge e of weight w ( e ) w(e) may get different weights, not necessarily equal to 1 2 w ( e ) 12w(e) . In the metric setting when the edge weights satisfy the triangle inequality , this has a geometric interpretation connected to how an incircle partitions the edges of a triangle. Our algorithms are additionally faster than those known before. The running time of each of them is O ( n 2 log ⁡ n ) O(n2log⁡n) , where n denotes the number of vertices in the graph.},

In this paper, we present an O ( f 3 n ) O(f3n) -time exact algorithm, where n is the number of vertices in G and f is the feedback edge number of G . Our algorithm thus runs in truly subquadratic time for digraphs of f = O ( n 1 3 − ϵ ) f=O(n13−ϵ) for any ϵ &gt; 0 ϵ&amp;gt;0 , i.e., the number of edges is n plus O ( n 1 3 − ϵ ) O(n13−ϵ) , and is fully polynomial fixed parameter tractable , the notion of which was first introduced by Fomin et al.

Given a finite set P of input points in the Euclidean plane, the search for a simple polygon with vertex set P is a very well-known and studied computational problem, referred to as the simple polygonization . Its optimization version, that requires to find a simple polygon having either minimum or maximum area, is known to be NP-hard. Moreover, no bounded approximation algorithm is known for the minimization flavor, while the maximization one admits an algorithm guaranteeing 1 2 12 worst-case approximation ratio. In this work, we design a new algorithm to practically attack both the optimization problems, based on the genetic paradigm. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an extensive experimental evaluation that employs a reference test-bed set of input instances.},

  abstract     = {At EUROCRYPT 2015, Dinur et al. proposed cube-attack-like cryptanalysis on reduced-round Keccak. The process of recovering the key is divided into the preprocessing and the online phase. The preprocessing phase is setting a look-up table by computing the cube sum of involved key bits. The online phase is computing the cube sum of auxiliary variables and recording the matching values in the table as candidates. Auxiliary variables help balance the complexity of the two phases by reducing the number of involved key bits. Following this idea, a series of works has been presented, mainly focusing on a better selection of cube variables, auxiliary variables and involved key bits. We provide new methods to select auxiliary variables and involved key bits. The first step is to get a precise algebraic expression of each bit after one round permutation. Then, combined with the corresponding constraints on these variables, we can construct a Mixed-integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. Secondly, unlike the previous idea that auxiliary variables are chosen to satisfy the CP-kernel property just for the consideration of controlling diffusion, we cancel this restriction and adopt a more skilled selection of auxiliary variables. Based on these two steps, we improve the cube-attack-like cryptanalysis in terms of the complexity.},

Keller and Perles (2016) proved that the x-type of P can be reconstructed from the exchange graph G 0 ( P ) G0(P) of noncrossing spanning trees. In this paper, we show that the x-type of P can already be reconstructed from the compatible exchange graph G 1 ( P ) G1(P) , which is a subgraph of G 0 ( P ) G0(P) . The proof crucially relies on the analysis of maximal sets of pairwise noncrossing edges ( m snes) between two disjoint planar straight-line graphs. m snes are a bipartite analogue of triangulations of planar straight-line graphs; they correspond to maximal cliques in G 1 ( P ) G1(P) .},

  abstract     = {In the coupon collector&#39;s problem with group drawings, a collector buys independent, identically distributed subsets of fixed size s ≥ 2 s≥2 out of a totality of n coupons. Let W n , s Wn,s denote the number of such subsets necessary to obtain each coupon at least once. We prove that, among all distributions that act on the class of all ( n s ) (ns) subsets of size s of the coupons, the uniform distribution minimizes the expectation of W n , s Wn,s if s = n − 1 s=n−1 . However, if 3 ≤ s ≤ 100 3≤s≤100 and s + 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 s+2≤n≤500 , computer algebra shows that the uniform distribution does not minimize E ( W n , s ) E(Wn,s) . We conjecture that the latter property holds for each s ≥ 3 s≥3 and each n ≥ s + 2 n≥s+2 .},

Clique is a classical model of cohesive subgraph, but several alternative definitions have been given in the literature. In this paper we consider the γ -complete graph model, which is based on relaxing the degree constraint of the clique model, that is G [ S ] G[S] is a γ -complete graph, with γ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] γ∈(0,1] , if and only if every vertex of S has degree at least γ ( | S | − 1 ) γ(|S|−1) in G [ S ] G[S] . In this contribution, we investigate the complexity of the problem that asks for the γ -complete subgraph of maximum order (that is, maximum number of vertices). We show that the problem is W[1]-hard for 1 2 ≤ γ 12≤γ&amp;lt;1 when the parameter is order of the subgraph. Moreover, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the h -index of the input graph, thus solving an open question in the literature.},

In particular, given a graph with local crossing number either at most k ≥ 1 k≥1 or at least 2 k , we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether the local crossing number is at most k or at least 2 k . This algorithmic lower bound proves the non-existence of a ( 2 − ϵ ) (2−ϵ) -approximation algorithm for any fixed k ≥ 1 k≥1 . In addition, we analyze the sometimes competing relationship between the local crossing number (maximum number of crossings per edge) and crossing number (total number of crossings) of a drawing. We present results regarding the non-existence of drawings that simultaneously approximately minimize both the local crossing number and crossing number of a graph.},

In this paper we consider the single source Pareto problem in weighted point-availability time-dependent networks, which consists of computing, for any destination d , all Pareto optimal pairs ( t , c ) (t,c) , where t and c are the arrival time and the cost, respectively, of a path from the source to d (a pair ( t , c ) (t,c) is Pareto optimal if there is no path with arrival time smaller than t and cost no worse than c or arrival time no greater than t and better cost). We design and analyse a general algorithm for solving this problem, whose time complexity is O ( | E | log ⁡ P ) O(|E|log⁡P) , where E E is the set of temporal edges and P is the maximum number of Pareto optimal pairs for each node of the network. Our algorithm can be used to solve several different minimum cost path problems in weighted point-availability time-dependent networks with a vast variety of cost definitions, and it can be easily modified in order to deal with the single destination Pareto problem. All our results apply to directed networks, but they can be easily adapted to undirected networks with no edges with zero travel time.},

  abstract     = {In 1996, Neville Robbins proved the amazing fact that the coefficient of X n Xn in the Fibonacci infinite product ∏ n ≥ 2 ( 1 − X F n ) = ( 1 − X ) ( 1 − X 2 ) ( 1 − X 3 ) ( 1 − X 5 ) ( 1 − X 8 ) ⋯ = 1 − X − X 2 + X 4 + ⋯ ∏n≥2(1−XFn)=(1−X)(1−X2)(1−X3)(1−X5)(1−X8)⋯=1−X−X2+X4+⋯ is always either −1, 0, or 1. The same result was proved later by Federico Ardila using a different method. Meanwhile, in 2001, Jean Berstel gave a simple 4-state transducer that converts an “illegal” Fibonacci representation into a “legal” one. I show how to obtain the Robbins-Ardila result from Berstel&#39;s with almost no work at all, using purely computational techniques that can be performed by existing software.},

In order to formally define this requirement on the CVP CVP instance, we introduce a new computational problem called the Gap Closest Vector Problem with Bounded Minima. We adapt the proof of [1] to show a reduction from the Gap Closest Vector Problem with Bounded Minima to SIVP SIVP for any ℓ p ℓp norm for some constant approximation factor greater than 1. In a recent result, Bennett, Golovnev and Stephens-Davidowitz [2] showed that under Gap-ETH, there is no 2 o ( n ) 2o(n) -time algorithm for approximating CVP p CVPp up to some constant factor γ ≥ 1 γ≥1 for any 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ 1≤p≤∞ . We observe that the reduction in [2] can be viewed as a reduction from Gap - 3 - SAT Gap-3-SAT to the Gap Closest Vector Problem with Bounded Minima. This, together with the above mentioned reduction, implies that, under Gap-ETH, there is no randomised 2 o ( n ) 2o(n) -time algorithm for approximating SIVP p SIVPp up to some constant factor γ ≥ 1 γ≥1 for any 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ 1≤p≤∞ .},

It is a special case of the constrained sequence alignment problem and of the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem, which are both well-studied problems in the scientific literature. Finding similarities between sequences plays an important role in the fields of molecular biology, gene recognition, pattern matching , text analysis, and voice recognition , among others. The CLCS problem in particular represents an interesting measure of similarity for molecules that have a putative structure in common. This paper proposes an exact A ⁎ search algorithm for effectively solving the CLCS problem. This A ⁎ search is guided by a tight upper bound calculation for the cost-to-go for the LCS problem. Our computational study shows that on various artificial and real benchmark sets this algorithm scales better with growing instance size and requires significantly less computation time to prove optimality than earlier state-of-the-art approaches from the literature.},

  abstract     = {Given a set P of points in the plane, and a point r ∈ P r∈P identified as the root of P , the rooted y − Monotone Minimum Spanning Tree (rooted y −MMST) of P is the connected spanning geometric graph of P in which all the vertices are connected to the root by some y −monotone path and the sum of the Euclidean lengths of its edges is the minimum. We give a linear-time algorithm that draws any rooted tree as a rooted y −MMST. A corollary of the previous sentence is that for every natural number M there exists a rooted y −MMST of maximum degree M . We also show that there exist n -node rooted trees for which any grid drawing as a rooted y -MMST requires a grid of area exponential in n .},

We shed light on how the states of an S-continuous information system and the round ideal completion of an S-abstract basis form a stably continuous semi-lattice, respectively. Then we obtain two representation theorems for stably continuous semi-lattices. What is more, we show the equivalence of the categories corresponding to these three structures.},

A slightly different but analogous result holds for those words having no odd palindromic prefix. Using known results on borders, we get an asymptotic enumeration for the number of words having no even (resp., odd) palindromic prefix. We obtain an analogous result for words having no nontrivial palindromic prefix. Finally, we obtain similar results for words having no square prefix, thus proving a 2013 conjecture of Chaffin, Linderman, Sloane, and Wilks.},

  abstract     = {In parameterized string matching, a string comprises static and parameterized symbols. Two strings are said to be matched if there exists a one-to-one mapping of parameterized symbols onto itself such that it transforms one string into the other. Traditionally, to construct a full-text index for this problem, suffixes are transformed in a manner referred to as previous occurrence encoding. Although a space-efficient backward searching based data structure has been proposed recently, the data structure is specialized and complex owing to the nature of the encoding scheme. In this study, we demonstrate that a slight modification of the encoding scheme, by using ∞ instead of 0 to denote the first occurrences of each parameterized symbol, enables us to develop a much simpler FM-index for this problem, which only comprises two wavelet trees and one range maximum query index.},

  abstract     = {The complexity of computing the Fourier transform is a longstanding open problem. Very recently, Ailon (2013, 2014, 2015) showed in a collection of papers that, roughly speaking, a speedup of the Fourier transform computation implies numerical ill-condition. The papers also quantify this tradeoff. The main method for proving these results is via a potential function called quasi-entropy, reminiscent of Shannon entropy. The quasi-entropy method opens new doors to understanding the computational complexity of the important Fourier transformation. However, it suffers from various obvious limitations. This paper is motivated by one such limitation, related to the computation of near-orthogonal matrices that have the Fourier transform ‘hidden’ in low-order bits. While partly overcoming this limitation, the paper sheds light on new interesting, open problems on the intersection of computational complexity and group theory. The paper also explains why this research direction, if fruitful, has a chance of solving much bigger questions about the complexity of the Fourier transform.},
