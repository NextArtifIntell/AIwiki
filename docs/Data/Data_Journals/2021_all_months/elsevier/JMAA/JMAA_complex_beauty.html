A foam drainage equation was proposed by Goldfarb et al. [5] in 1988 in order to investigate the flow of liquid through channels (Plateau borders) and nodes (intersections of four channels) between the bubbles, driven by gravity and capillarity. Mathematical studies on a foam drainage equation so far are restricted within numerical and particular solutions; as for mathematical analysis of it there are only a few. This paper is aimed at proving that the initial boundary value problem for the forced foam drainage equation admits a unique global-in-time classical solution by the standard classical mathematical method, the maximum principle and comparison theorem. Moreover, the existence of its steady solution and its stability are shown. This is the first rigorous mathematical result for a series of researches on this equation.},

In the direct scattering problem, we discuss the analyticity , three symmetries and asymptotic behaviors of the Jost functions, scattering matrices and the distribution of discrete spectral. In the inverse scattering problem, the Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problem of cmKdV equation is first found by using the analyticity of the modified eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients. The reconstruction formulae solution with simple poles, trace formulae and asymptotic phase difference are obtained. Finally, we analyze soliton solutions for eight distinct wave structures of reflectionless potential in the RH problem, include one-kink, dark, bright solitons, novel periodic solutions and two-soliton solutions.},

This enables us to derive asymptotic results for orthogonal polynomials on [ − 1 , 1 ] [−1,1] with a new class of weight functions. In these cases, the weight functions are too badly behaved to allow a reformulation of the local parametrix problem to a global one with constant jump matrices.

  abstract     = {We make a connection between the structure of the bidisc and a distinguished subgroup of its automorphism group . The automorphism group of the bidisc, as we know, is of dimension six and acts transitively. We observe that it contains a subgroup that is isomorphic to the automorphism group of the open unit disc and this subgroup partitions the bidisc into a complex curve and a family of strongly pseudo-convex hypersurfaces that are non-spherical as CR-manifolds. Our work reverses this process and shows that any 2-dimensional Kobayashi-hyperbolic manifold whose automorphism group (which is known, from the general theory, to be a Lie group) has a 3-dimensional subgroup that is non-solvable (as a Lie group) and that acts on the manifold to produce a collection of orbits possessing essentially the characteristics of the concretely known collection of orbits mentioned above, is biholomorphic to the bidisc. The distinguished subgroup is interesting in its own right. It turns out that if we consider any subdomain of the bidisc that is a union of a proper sub-collection of the collection of orbits mentioned above, then the automorphism group of this subdomain can be expressed very simply in terms of this distinguished subgroup.},

  abstract     = {A pair of Banach spaces ( E , F ) (E,F) is said to have the weak maximizing property (WMP, for short) if for every bounded linear operator T from E into F , the existence of a non-weakly null maximizing sequence for T implies that T attains its norm. This property was recently introduced in a paper by R. Aron, D. García, D. Pelegrino and E. Teixeira, raising several open questions. The aim of the present paper is to contribute to the better knowledge of the WMP and its limitations. Namely, we provide sufficient conditions for a pair of Banach spaces to fail the WMP and study the behavior of this property with respect to quotients, subspaces, and direct sums, which open the gate to present several consequences. For instance, we deal with pairs of the form ( L p [ 0 , 1 ] , L q [ 0 , 1 ] ) (Lp[0,1],Lq[0,1]) , proving that these pairs fail the WMP whenever p &gt; 2 p&amp;gt;2 or q q&amp;lt;2 . We also show that, under certain conditions on E , the assumption that ( E , F ) (E,F) has the WMP for every Banach space F implies that E must be finite dimensional. On the other hand, we show that ( E , F ) (E,F) has the WMP for every reflexive space E if and only if F has the Schur property. We also give a complete characterization for the pairs ( ℓ s ⊕ p ℓ p , ℓ s ⊕ q ℓ q ) (ℓs⊕pℓp,ℓs⊕qℓq) to have the WMP by calculating the moduli of asymptotic uniform convexity of ℓ s ⊕ p ℓ p ℓs⊕pℓp and of asymptotic uniform smoothness of ℓ s ⊕ q ℓ q ℓs⊕qℓq when 1 1&amp;lt;p⩽s⩽q&amp;lt;∞ . We conclude the paper by discussing some variants of the WMP and presenting a list of open problems on the topic of the paper.},

The first one was obtained by Bu and Kranz in [4] and it asserts that a continuous linear operator between Banach spaces takes almost unconditionally summable sequences into Cohen strongly q -summable sequences for any q ≥ 2 q≥2 , whenever its adjoint is p -summing for some p ≥ 1 p≥1 . The second of them states that p -summing operators with hilbertian domain are Cohen strongly q -summing operators ( 1 1&amp;lt;p,q&amp;lt;∞ ), this result is due to Bu [3] . The third one is due to Kwapień [8] and it characterizes spaces isomorphic to a Hilbert space using 2-summing operators. We will show that these results are maintained replacing the hypothesis of the operator to be p -summing by almost summing. We will also give an example of an almost summing operator that fails to be p -summing for every 1 ≤ p 1≤p&amp;lt;∞ .},

We used Newton&#39;s method to linearize the equation of motion and employed the least-squares approach with systematic mesh refinements to flow past the square cylinder. The LSFEM offers a direct approximation of the extra stress tensor components, a symmetric positive definite system, and the openness of choosing finite element spaces. We proved that the least-squares approximation converges to linearized solutions of non-Newtonian fluid flows. We demonstrated that the numerical results using low-order basis functions agree with the theoretical estimates and presented the effects of different physical parameters on the physical attributes of the power-law model at a low Reynolds number, such as drag coefficients, viscosity, and velocity. These results agree with others published in the literature. Hence, the LSFEM in non-Newtonian fluid simulations can accomplish the identification of shear-thinning and shear-thickening characteristics.},

In addition, by solving the corresponding Fokker-Plauck equation, we obtain the explicit probability density function around the quasi-stable equilibrium of the transformed stochastic system without pollution. Finally, we use numerical tests to illustrate the main results and reveal some interesting biological phenomena, such as small white noise can reduce the risk of extinction, and the same toxin concentration has different effects on predators and their prey, etc.},

For p ≥ 1 p≥1 and convex bodies K , L K,L in R n Rn , the L p Lp -Shephard problem asks whether Π p K ⊆ Π p L ΠpK⊆ΠpL implies that | K | n − p ≤ | L | n − p |K|n−p≤|L|n−p ? Here | M | |M| is the volume of M . It has shown in [21] , [22] , [24] that the answer is affirmative when n ≤ 2 n≤2 and negative when n ≥ 3 n≥3 . In this paper, we consider a variant of the L p Lp -Shephard problem via ( p , q ) (p,q) -projection bodies, i.e., if Π p K ⊆ Π p , q ( M , Q ) ⊆ Π p L , ΠpK⊆Πp,q(M,Q)⊆ΠpL, for any fixed Q and q ∈ R q∈R , can we compare the volume of K , M K,M and L ?

This paper answers two parts of the question by connecting with L p Lp -projection body, and Lévy&#39;s embedding L p Lp .

  abstract     = {Game-theoretic upper expectations are joint (global) probability models that mathematically describe the behaviour of uncertain processes in terms of supermartingales ; capital processes corresponding to available betting strategies. Compared to (the more common) measure-theoretic expectation functionals, they are not bounded to restrictive assumptions such as measurability or precision, yet succeed in preserving, or even generalising many of their fundamental properties. We focus on a discrete-time setting where local state spaces are finite and, in this specific context, build on the existing work of Shafer and Vovk, the main developers of the framework of game-theoretic upper expectations. In a first part, we study Shafer and Vovk&#39;s characterisation of a local upper expectation and show how it is related to Walley&#39;s behavioural notion of coherence. The second part consists in a study of game-theoretic upper expectations on a more global level, where several alternative definitions, as well as a broad range of properties are derived, e.g. the law of iterated upper expectations, compatibility with local models, coherence properties, … Our main contribution, however, concerns the continuity behaviour of these operators. We prove continuity with respect to non-increasing sequences of so-called lower cuts and continuity with respect to non-increasing sequences of finitary functions. We moreover show that the game-theoretic upper expectation is uniquely determined by its values on the domain of bounded below limits of finitary functions, and show in addition that, for any such limit, the limiting sequence can be constructed in such a way that the game-theoretic upper expectation is continuous with respect to this particular sequence.},

In particular, an extremal rank characterisation is obtained which incorporates a multi-variable matrix-valued transfer function Ψ C ( z ) ΨC(z) defined on the product space C ⁎ d = ( C ﹨ { 0 } ) d C⁎d=(C﹨{0})d . In general the first-order flex space is the closed linear span of polynomially weighted geometric velocity fields whose geometric multi-factors in C ⁎ d C⁎d lie in a finite set. It is also shown that, paradoxically, a first-order rigid crystal framework may possess a nontrivial continuous motion. Examples of this phenomenon are given which are associated with aperiodic displacive phase transitions between periodic states.},

We establish the existence of classical sonic-supersonic solutions to its boundary value problem with data given on a smooth sonic curve. To deal with the sonic degeneracy, we first construct a smooth solution in a partial hodograph coordinate system by using the iteration method in a weighted metric space and then express the solution in terms of the original variables.},

It is shown that the MFRP is a martingale with respect to a suitable filtration. Its variance and covariance are obtained using which its long-range dependence property is established. Also, we show that its increments exhibit the short-range dependence property. Later, we consider a different fractional risk process based on the compound MFPP. We call it the mixed fractional risk process-II (MFRP-II) and it differs from the MFRP in terms of premium. For exponentially distributed claim sizes the probability density function of the ruin time of MFRP-II is obtained. An asymptotic behaviour of its finite time ruin probability is derived when the claim sizes are subexponentially distributed and the initial capital is arbitrarily large.},

First, we point out the connections between strong exponential dichotomy and other dichotomy concepts for discrete nonautonomous systems on the whole line. After that, we prove that the projection families for strong exponential dichotomy are unique and we deduce their structure. Next, we consider a natural admissibility concept relative to an input-output system associated to the initial system and we show that, by working with input and output spaces in two general classes of sequence spaces, the admissibility properties considered herein ensure a full description of the strong dichotomic behavior, in the uniform case. Moreover, we obtain that when one deduces the strong exponential dichotomy via admissibility, the projections are uniformly bounded by a constant which depends on the fundamental functions of admissible spaces and on the input-output operator. We present a complete study, providing input-output criteria applicable to discrete nonautonomous systems, without any restriction on their coefficients and without assuming any type of growth for the associated propagator . As an application, we deduce an interval of variation for the strong dichotomy radius whose upper and lower bounds are expressed in terms of norms and spectral radii of certain input-output operators. Moreover, we present an illustrative example in which we determine the strong dichotomy radius by applying the central results in this paper.},

  abstract     = {A long-standing question in the theory of measures of noncompactness is that for the Kuratowski measure of noncompactness α defined on a metric space M , and for every bounded subset B ⊂ M B⊂M , is there a countable subset B 0 ⊂ B B0⊂B such that α ( B 0 ) = α ( B ) α(B0)=α(B) ? In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to the question above. It is done by showing that for each nonempty set B of a Banach space , there is a countable subset B 0 ⊂ B B0⊂B so that B is strongly finitely representable in B 0 B0 , and that there is a free ultrafilter U U so that B is affinely isometric to a subset of the ultrapower [ co ( B 0 ) ] U [co(B0)]U of co ( B 0 ) co(B0) .},

It is shown that the Foulis approach is strictly more general and contains the Alfsen-Shultz approach as a special case. This is demonstrated on two types of examples: the JB-algebras which are Foulis spectral if and only if they are Rickart and the centrally symmetric state spaces, which may be Foulis spectral while not necessarily Alfsen-Shultz spectral.},

The problem of norms discretization is connected with the probabilistic question about the approximation with high probability of marginals of a high dimensional random vector by sampling. As a byproduct of our approach we refine the result of O. Guédon and M. Rudelson concerning the approximation of marginals. In particular, the obtained improvement recovers a theorem of J. Bourgain, J. Lindenstrauss, and V. Milman concerning embeddings of finite dimensional subspaces of L p [ 0 , 1 ] Lp[0,1] into ℓ p m ℓpm .

First, we show that (4NLS) is locally well-posed in H s ( R ) , s ≥ − 1 2 Hs(R),s≥−12 using the Fourier restriction norm method. Second, we show that (4NLS) is globally well-posed in H s ( R ) , s ≥ − 1 2 Hs(R),s≥−12 . To prove this, we use the I -method with the correction term strategy presented in Colliander-Keel-Staffilani-Takaoka-Tao [7] . Finally, we prove that (4NLS) is mildly ill-posed in the sense that the flow map fails to be locally uniformly continuous in H s ( R ) , s Hs(R),s&amp;lt;−12 . Therefore, these results show that s = − 1 2 s=−12 is the sharp regularity threshold for which the well-posedness problem can be dealt with an iteration argument.},

First, all low-order conservation laws are derived, including ones that arise for special powers p . The conservation laws comprise momenta, energy, and Galilean-type quantities, as well as topological charges . Their physical meaning and properties are discussed. The topological charges are shown to give rise to integral constraints on initial data for the Cauchy problem. Second, all line-soliton solutions are obtained in an explicit form. A parameterization is given using the speed and the direction angle of the line-soliton, and the allowed kinematic region is determined in terms of these parameters. Basic kinematical properties of the line-solitons are also discussed. These properties differ significantly compared to those for KP line-solitons and their p -power generalizations. A line-shock solution is shown to emerge when a special limiting case of the kinematic region is considered.},

The system dynamics are governed by a forward linear mean-field stochastic differential equation and the cost functional is quadratic. In order to facilitate some practical applications, the mean-field terms for the state process and control process are considered in both the system dynamics and cost functional. Using the classical calculus of variation and dual methods, the open-loop Nash equilibrium point can be expressed by introducing an auxiliary mean-field forward backward stochastic differential equation , which comprises one forward and two backward components. Due to some Riccati equations and ordinary differential equations that possess unique solutions , the Nash equilibrium point can also be represented in feedback form for several special cases under asymmetric information. The corresponding filtering equations are derived, and the existence and uniqueness of the solutions are proved. An investment problem in finance is discussed to demonstrate the good performance of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {For a parameter λ &gt; 0 λ&amp;gt;0 , we investigate greedy λ -energy sequences ( a n ) n = 0 ∞ (an)n=0∞ on the unit sphere S d ⊂ R d + 1 Sd⊂Rd+1 , d ≥ 1 d≥1 , satisfying the defining property that each a n an , n ≥ 1 n≥1 , is a point where the potential ∑ k = 0 n − 1 | x − a k | λ ∑k=0n−1|x−ak|λ attains its maximum value on S d Sd . We show that these sequences satisfy the symmetry property a 2 k + 1 = − a 2 k a2k+1=−a2k for every k ≥ 0 k≥0 . The asymptotic distribution of the sequence undergoes a sharp transition at the value λ = 2 λ=2 , from uniform distribution ( λ λ&amp;lt;2 ) to concentration on two antipodal points ( λ &gt; 2 λ&amp;gt;2 ). We investigate first-order and second-order asymptotics of the λ -energy of the first N points of the sequence, as well as the asymptotic behavior of the extremal values ∑ k = 0 n − 1 | a n − a k | λ ∑k=0n−1|an−ak|λ . The second-order asymptotics is analyzed on the unit circle. It is shown that this asymptotic behavior differs significantly from that of N equally spaced points on the unit circle, and a transition in the behavior takes place at λ = 1 λ=1 .},

As an analogue of Korn&#39;s inequality for these functions spaces is not available, the construction of an appropriate smoothing method proves to be difficult. Using a point-wise Poincaré inequality near the boundary of a bounded Lipschitz domain involving only the symmetric gradient, we construct a smoothing operator with convenient properties. In particular, this smoothing operator leads to several density results and, therefore, to a generalized formula of integration by parts with respect to time. Using this formula and the theory of maximal monotone operators , we prove an abstract existence result.},

Our method relies on partitioning the ambient space by using a suitable “tiling system”. We provide all relevant details for constructions in the case of M n ( R ) ⋊ GL n ( R ) Mn(R)⋊GLn(R) , although the methods discussed here are general and could be adapted to some other settings.

The nonlinear diffusion of farmers is determined by the density of farmers in a way that higher population density accelerates the migration. We establish a spreading-vanishing dichotomy and provide some sufficient conditions in a heterogeneous environment. Moreover, in a homogeneous environment, we achieve exact asymptotic convergence to the constant equilibrium . Thereby, we verify that a strong sedentary lifestyle of farmers is advantageous for the spreading of farmers.},

Such solutions for second-order linear differential equations without impulse effects, first appeared in [W. Leighton, M. Morse, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 40 (1936), 252–286]. In the present work we first establish the concept of principal and nonprincipal solutions for second-order linear impulsive differential equations, and then use them to prove the existence of solutions for a class of second-order nonlinear impulsive differential equations, with prescribed asymptotic behavior at infinity in terms of a linear combination of these principal and nonprincipal solutions. Examples and numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the obtained results.},

Then the observer and estimators are designed in terms of the measured error to recover the state of the auxiliary control system and estimate the unknown parameters. Secondly, we construct the second auxiliary control system in which the disturbance becomes collocated with the control. Finally, the regulator is proposed based on the backstepping method presented in [33] to make the state of the closed-loop system bounded and the tracking error asymptotically convergent to zero.},

We present a novel algorithm to rigorously compute contraction metrics, that combines the numerical solving of a first order partial differential equation with rigorous verification of the conditions for a contraction metric. Further, we prove that our algorithm is able to compute a contraction metric for any ordinary differential equation possessing an exponentially stable periodic orbit. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by computing contraction metrics for three systems from the literature.},

We show that, under our main hypothesis, whilst previous results concerning stochastic properties are improved, it is not possible to obtain comparison theorems concerning volume growth. Finally, we prove an analogue of the Bishop-Gromov&#39;s relative volume comparison theorem and present a series of examples related to various possible notions of curvature.},

In this paper, to understand this fact well, we consider the well-posedness problem of the Boussinesq system with velocity or thermal damping. Compared with the Boussinesq system, one can show that the mild solution of the Boussinesq system with damping exists globally in Lei-Lin space. Furthermore, by a similar argument, we found it possible to obtain the global well-posedness of mild solution to an Oldroyd-B type model as some parameters are sufficiently small.},

We consider a network with ⁎ N ∈ N ⁎ , N ≥ 2 N∈N⁎,N≥2 finite edges and one infinite edge. This network is subject to homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at the endpoints of the finite edges. At the internal vertex 0, we put the continuity condition and a balanced damping condition of the form ∑ j = 0 N ( ∂ x u j ( 0 , t ) − ∂ t u j ( 0 , t ) ) = 0 ∑j=0N(∂xuj(0,t)−∂tuj(0,t))=0 . By a spectral analysis technique, we prove that when the finite edges lengths are rationally proportional, the energy of the system becomes constant within a finite time T e Te . We also prove that for an equilateral network we have T e = 2 ℓ Te=2ℓ , where ℓ is the common edge length. This is a finite time stabilization result of the system to a state with constant energy. This finite time limit energy is given in terms of the initial data and computed for a generic network. The main idea is to calculate the resolvent and to prove that it is of finite exponential type on some subspace of the energy space.},

When the spatial environment is heterogeneous, we determine the asymptotic profile of endemic equilibria if the diffusion rate of the susceptible or infected population is either small or large. Our numerical results show that heterogeneity in the transmission rate enhances the persistence of infection and that the disease may persist even when the basic reproduction number of our model is less than 1, provided that the initial number of infectives is high enough.},

Motivated by our results, we introduce a class of finite sets of Fréchet space operators patterned after the partial differentiation operators, called backward multi-shifts, and show that any nonscalar operator in the commutant of such a finite set is supercyclic.

The main results are easily achieved through some new Korovkin-type theorems for composition operators and for functionals which are established in the context of function spaces defined on a metric space. Several applications are shown in the special cases of bounded and unbounded real intervals which involve the most common integrated means. Furthermore, some consequences concerning the convergence in distribution , and hence stochastic, of generalized means of vector-valued random variables are also presented. Finally the paper ends with an application related to the so-called box integral problem which refers to the problem to evaluate the limit behaviour as n → ∞ n→∞ of the average distance between two points of [ 0 , 1 ] n [0,1]n randomly chosen according to a given distribution on [ 0 , 1 ] n [0,1]n .},

  abstract     = {Very recently, motivated by the result of Bhatia and Šemrl which characterizes the Birkhoff-James orthogonality of operators on a finite dimensional Hilbert space in terms of norm attaining points, the Bhatia-Šemrl property was introduced. The main purpose of this article is to study the denseness of the set of multilinear maps with the Bhatia-Šemrl property which is contained in the set of norm attaining ones. Contrary to the most of previous results which were shown for operators on real Banach spaces , we prove the denseness for multilinear maps on some complex Banach spaces . We also show that the denseness of operators does not hold when the domain space is c 0 c0 for arbitrary range. Moreover, we find plenty of Banach spaces Y such that only the zero operator has the Bhatia-Šemrl property in the space of operators from c 0 c0 to Y .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the large time behavior of the Cauchy problem for the three-dimensional isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. The global existence of smooth solutions for the 3D compressible MHD equations has been proved by Chen–Tan [6] , under the condition that the initial data are close to the constant equilibrium state in the Sobolev space H 3 H3 . However, to our best knowledge, the decay estimate of the highest-order spatial derivatives of the solution to the compressible MHD equations has not been solved. The main goal in this paper is to give a positive answer to this problem. Exactly, under the assumption that the initial perturbation is small in H l ( R 3 ) ∩ B ˙ 2 , ∞ − s ( R 3 ) Hl(R3)∩B˙2,∞−s(R3) with l ⩾ 3 l⩾3 , s ∈ [ 0 , 5 2 ] s∈[0,52] , combining the spectral analysis on the semigroup generated by the linear system at the constant state and the energy method to the compressible MHD equations, then we get the optimal convergence rates of any order spatial derivatives (including the highest-order derivatives) of the solution. This result concern with the optimal time decay rates of the solutions, which extends the work obtained by Chen [5] for the compressible Navier–Stokes equations in R 3 R3 to the 3D compressible MHD equations. Moreover, we have expanded the range of s from ( 0 , 3 / 2 ] (0,3/2] to [ 0 , 5 / 2 ] [0,5/2] , compared with the previous results on optimal decay rates of global strong solutions for the 3D isentropic compressible MHD system.},

The spatial discretisations can feature infinite-range interactions, allowing us to consider neural field models. We construct travelling wave solutions to these fully discrete systems in the small time-step limit by viewing them as singular perturbations of the corresponding spatially discrete system. In particular, we refine the previous approach by Hupkes and Van Vleck for scalar fully discretised systems, which is based on a spectral convergence technique that was developed by Bates, Chen and Chmaj.},

  abstract     = {This article completes the more than a half a century old problem of finding the equivalences between generalized Riemann derivatives. The real functions case is studied in a recent paper by the authors. The complex functions case developed here is more general and comes with numerous applications. We say that a complex generalized Riemann derivative A A implies another complex generalized Riemann derivative B B if whenever a measurable complex function is A A -differentiable at z then it is B B -differentiable at z . We characterize all pairs ( Δ A , Δ B ) (ΔA,ΔB) of complex generalized Riemann differences of any orders for which A A -differentiability implies B B -differentiability, and those for which A A -differentiability is equivalent to B B -differentiability. We show that all m points based generalized Riemann difference quotients of order n that Taylor approximate the ordinary n th derivative to highest rank form a projective variety of dimension m − n m−n for which an explicit parametrization is given. One application provides an infinite number of equivalent ways to define analyticity . For example, a function f is analytic on a region Ω if and only if at each z in Ω, the limit lim h → 0 ⁡ f ( z + h ) + f ( z + i h ) − f ( z − h ) + f ( z − i h ) − 2 f ( z ) 2 h limh→0⁡f(z+h)+f(z+ih)−f(z−h)+f(z−ih)−2f(z)2h exists and is a finite number. Four more applications relate the classification of complex generalized Riemann derivatives to analyticity and the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and to the theory of best approximations.},

Some numerical results exhibiting the formation process of delta-shocks are also presented, verifying the theory being presented.

As a model, we consider a nonlinear second-order elliptic equation in divergence form holding in an annular domain coupled with the Laplace equation in the corresponding unbounded exterior region , together with transmission conditions on the interface and a suitable radiation condition at infinity. We first extend the classical Johnson &amp; Nédélec coupling procedure, which makes use of only one boundary integral equation, to our nonlinear model without assuming any restrictive smoothness requirement on the boundary but only Lipschitz-continuity. Next, we extend the applicability of a recently introduced modification of the Costabel &amp; Han coupling method, which employs the two boundary integral equations arising from the Green representation formula, to our nonlinear model as well. This new boundary-field equation method is based on the introduction of both Cauchy data on the boundary as independent unknowns. Primal and dual-mixed variational formulations are analyzed for each extension described above, and suitable hypotheses on the nonlinear coefficient of the elliptic equation allow to establish well-posedness of the corresponding continuous and discrete schemes by using monotone operator and nonlinear Babuška-Brezzi theories. Finally, a priori error estimates are established.},

  abstract     = {The spread of rumors will make a big influence on people&#39;s life. This paper aims to study the dynamic behavior of rumor propagation. We consider the effects of transmission rates between different groups and establish 2ISR rumor propagation models with diffusions and time delay in both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. In the homogeneous network model, we gain the basic reproduction number through the next generation matrix . The existence of two equilibrium points is discussed according to the basic reproduction number . Besides, based on the LaSalle&#39;s invariance principle , we obtain the global stability of two equilibrium points. In the heterogeneous network model, we further discuss the global stability of the rumor-free equilibrium point. Moreover, a set of useful rumor control strategies are put forward respectively in two systems. Finally, some necessary numerical simulations are displayed, which also suggest the effectiveness of theories.},

We formulate the model by a system of degenerated reaction-diffusion equations with heterogeneous parameters, where the movement of pathogens are ignored. The basic reproduction number , ℜ 0 ℜ0 , is defined to govern and it is shown to be a threshold determining whether or not the disease will be extinct or be persistent. We also confirm that disease will be extinct in the critical case ℜ 0 = 1 ℜ0=1 . By three examples of homogeneous cases in the sense that parameters are all constants, we obtain the specific formula for ℜ 0 ℜ0 , and explore the stability problems of the unique constant positive equilibrium by using the technique of Lyapunov function. Our theoretical results can also be potentially applied to explore the effect of the spatial heterogeneity on disease dynamics, and also evaluate the risk of disease transmission.},

Sci. 14 (6) (2016) 1477–1500] stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with smooth coefficient functions have been constructed which have an arbitrarily slowly converging modulus of continuity in the initial value. In these SDEs it is crucial that some of the first order partial derivatives of the drift coefficient functions grow at least exponentially and, in particular, quicker than any polynomial. However, in applications SDEs do typically have coefficient functions whose first order partial derivatives are polynomially bounded. In this article we study whether arbitrarily bad regularity phenomena in the initial value may also arise in the latter case and we partially answer this question in the negative. More precisely, we show that every additive noise driven SDE which admits a Lyapunov-type condition (which ensures the existence of a unique solution of the SDE) and which has a drift coefficient function whose first order partial derivatives grow at most polynomially is at least logarithmically Hölder continuous in the initial value.},

Moreover, the iterative sequence is also built for any given guess value and it is showed that it strongly converges to initial value. However, because the exponential stabilities of the error systems between the original systems and the forward∖backward observers play important roles in the involved algorithm, the exponential stability of some related system is firstly discussed. Furthermore, combining the theory of port-Hamiltonian system and the finite difference, the semi-discretization scheme of the finite difference with order reduction is given and the uniform exponential stability of the semi-discretization system is verified by the method paralleling to the continuous system. Finally, the convergence analysis of the finite difference scheme is given and the convergence of the solution of the mixed finite element scheme induced by the finite difference scheme with order reduction to the solution of the continuous counterpart is also presented.},

In 2006, Deutsch and Hundal studied extensions to convex sets in order to analyze convergence rates for the cyclic projections algorithm. In this work, we characterize the positivity of the minimal angle between two convex cones . We show the existence of, and necessary conditions for, optimal solutions of minimal angle problems associated with two convex subsets as well. Moreover, we generalize a result by Deutsch on minimal angles from linear subspaces to cones. This generalization yields sufficient conditions for the closedness of the sum of two closed convex cones . This also relates to conditions proposed by Beutner and by Seeger and Sossa. Furthermore, we investigate the relation between the intersection of two cones (at least one of which is nonlinear) and the intersection of the polar and dual cones of the underlying cones. It turns out that the two angles involved cannot be positive simultaneously. Various examples illustrate the sharpness of our results.},

It has been observed, and been proved rigorously, that phase-locking occurs if the coupling between oscillators is sufficiently strong i.e. is larger than a certain threshold value called the critical coupling. However, if the coupling is below the critical coupling, then many interesting dynamics can occur. In this paper, we study bifurcations in the Kuramoto model on a ring network using a novel vector flow. We derive criteria for certain bifurcations, including bifurcations involving stable phase-locked solutions, and construct concrete examples of arbitrary size. We also note that our examples can be used to demonstrate bistability in the Kuramoto model in some cases.},

  abstract     = {We consider symmetric multi-marginal Kantorovich optimal transport problems on finite state spaces with uniform-marginal constraint. Hereby the symmetry of the problem refers to an assumption on the cost function as well as a corresponding restriction of the set of admissible trial states where the former enables the latter. Note that the symmetry of this setting forces us to pick for each of the considered marginals one and the same probability measure. The said problems consist of minimizing a linear objective function over a high-dimensional polytope , here referred to as Kantorovich polytope . The presented results are of split nature, computational and theoretical. Within the computational part only small numbers of marginals N and marginal sites ℓ are considered. This restriction allows us to computationally determine all extreme points of the Kantorovich polytope and investigate how many of them are in compliance with the in optimal transport typical Monge ansatz. Singling out the results for ℓ = 3 ℓ=3 discretization points and pairwise symmetric cost functions enables us to visually compare Kantorovich&#39;s to Monge&#39;s ansatz space for a varying number of marginals. Finally we present a necessary support-condition for optimizers which is inspired by the insights the said model problem on three sites provided. This result is not limited to the case of ℓ = 3 ℓ=3 sites and applies to symmetric pair-costs whose diagonal entries lie above a cost-specific threshold. In case N and ℓ display certain relationships the discussed condition provides an optimizer in Monge-form and implies its uniqueness as a solution of the considered Kantorovich optimal transport problem.},

  abstract     = {In the present work we reconsider the evolutionary game theoretic models by Antoci et al. (2016, 2018) describing the dynamic outcomes arising from the interactions between patients and physicians, whose behavior is subject to clinical and legal risks. In particular, Antoci et al. (2016) analyzed the case of positive defensive medicine, while Antoci et al. (2018) dealt with the case of negative defensive medicine. We show that, when the models admit a nonisochronous center, it is possible to prove the existence of chaotic dynamics for the Poincaré map associated with those systems via the method of Linked Twist Maps (LTMs). To such aim we exploit in both frameworks, using a similar rationale, the periodic dependence on time of a model parameter influencing the position of the center and describing some risk associated with certain medical interventions, whose seasonal variation is empirically grounded. We also recall the ecological interpretation of the same model proposed by Harvie et al. (2007) and connected with intraspecific competition and environmental carrying capacity in predator-prey settings. In this case, it is sensible to assume a seasonal variation both for the carrying capacities and for the intrinsic growth rates of the two populations. Although such parameters influence the shape of the orbits, but do not affect the center position, we show that it is still possible to prove the existence of chaotic dynamics for the associated Poincaré map via the LTMs technique dealing with a different geometrical configuration for orbits in the phase plane.},

  abstract     = {In our paper we present a fractal analysis of canard cycles and slow-fast Hopf points in 2-dimensional singular perturbation problems under very general conditions. Our focus is on the orientable case (e.g. R 2 R2 ) and the non-orientable case (e.g. the Möbius band). Given a slow-fast system, we generate a sequence of real numbers using the so-called slow relation function and compute a fractal dimension of that sequence. Then the value of the fractal dimension enables us to determine the cyclicity and bifurcations of canard cycles in the slow-fast system. We compute the fractal dimension of a slow-fast Hopf point depending on its codimension . Our focus is on the box dimension, one-sided dimensions and the fractal zeta-function . We also find explicit fractal formulas of Cahen-type for the computation of the above fractal dimensions and use them to detect numerically the number of canard limit cycles.},

We prove that, the steady Euler-Poisson equations with sonic boundary possess a unique subsonic solution and at least one supersonic solution in the radial form. The adopted approach for proof is the energy method combining the compactness analysis. For the n -D radial supersonic solutions, since it is more challenging to get the crucial energy estimates due to the effect by the multiple dimensions and the restriction by the sonic boundary, we propose a brand new two-steps iteration scheme to build up the key energy estimates. This is the first attempt to study the n -D steady-states with the sonic boundary, and the results obtained essentially improve and develop the previous studies in the one-dimensional case.},

  abstract     = {Motivated to generalize the Fourier frame concept to Banach spaces we introduce (p, q)-Bessel/frame measures for a given finite measure on LCA groups . We also present a general way of constructing (p, q)-Bessel/frame measures for a given measure. Moreover, we prove that if a measure has an associated (p, q)-frame measure, then it must have a certain uniformity in the sense that the weight is distributed quite uniformly on its support. Next, we show that if the measures μ and λ without atoms whose supports form a packing pair, then ⁎ ⁎ μ ⁎ λ + δ g ⁎ μ μ⁎λ+δg⁎μ does not admit any (p, q)-frame measure. Finally, we analyze the stability of (p, q)-frame measures under small perturbations. We prove new theorems concerning the stability of (p, q)-frame measures under perturbation in both Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces .},

  abstract     = {We propose a new mathematical model for cholera transmission dynamics using a system of reaction-convection-diffusion equations. The model differs from previously published partial differential equations (PDEs) based cholera models in that the diffusion and convection processes are only incorporated into the bacterial dynamics, which are described by a general second-order differential operator . This feature allows us to perform a careful study on the movement and dispersal of the pathogenic bacteria in a heterogeneous aquatic environment and its impact on cholera transmission among human hosts. We rigorously analyze the well-posedness and stability of this partially diffusive system, and establish threshold results characterizing cholera transmission dynamics.},

The Baldwin-Lomax model is specifically designed to address the problem of a turbulent motion taking place in a bounded domain , with Dirichlet boundary conditions at solid boundaries. The main features of this model are the degeneracy of the operator at the boundary and a formulation in velocity/vorticity variables. The principal part of the operator is non-linear and it is degenerate, due to the presence (as a coefficient) of a power of the distance from the boundary: This fact makes the existence theory naturally set in the framework of appropriate weighted-Sobolev spaces.},

Here f 1 f1 is a convex energy density with linear growth and f 2 f2 is a convex energy density with superlinear growth, for instance given by an N -function or just bounded from below by an N -function. One motivation for this kind of problem located between the well-known splitting-type problems of superlinear growth and the splitting-type problems of linear growth (recently considered by M. Bildhauer and M. Fuchs (2020) [8] ) is the link to mathematical problems in plasticity (see R. Temam (2018) [29] ).

  abstract     = {This article is a contribution to the study of regularity theory for nonlinear elliptic equations . The aim of this article is to establish some global estimates for nonuniformly elliptic equations in divergence form as − div ( | ∇ u | p − 2 ∇ u + a ( x ) | ∇ u | q − 2 ∇ u ) = − div ( | F | p − 2 F + a ( x ) | F | q − 2 F ) , −div(|∇u|p−2∇u+a(x)|∇u|q−2∇u)=−div(|F|p−2F+a(x)|F|q−2F), which arises from double-phase functional problems. In particular, the main results provide the regularity estimates for the distributional solutions in terms of maximal and fractional maximal operators . This work extends that of Colombo and Mingione (2016) [23] and Byun and Oh (2017) [9] by dealing with the global estimates in Lorentz spaces . It also extends our recent result Tran and Nguyen (2020) [66] concerning new estimates of divergence elliptic equations using cutoff fractional maximal operators . For future research, the approach developed in this article will allow global estimates of distributional solutions to nonuniformly nonlinear elliptic equations to be obtained in the framework of other spaces.},

  abstract     = {We consider the imaginary time flow of a quadratic hyperbolic Hamiltonian on the symplectic plane, apply it to the Schrödinger polarization and study the corresponding evolution of polarized sections. The flow is periodic in imaginary time and the evolution of polarized sections has interesting features. On the time intervals for which the polarization is real or Kähler, the half–form corrected time evolution of polarized sections is given by unitary operators which turn out to be equivalent to the classical Segal-Bargmann transforms (which are usually associated to the quadratic elliptic Hamiltonian H = 1 2 p 2 H=12p2 and to the heat operator). At the right endpoint of these intervals, the evolution of polarized sections is given by the Fourier transform from the Schrödinger to the momentum representation. In the complementary intervals of imaginary time, the polarizations are anti–Kähler and the Hilbert space of polarized sections collapses to H = { 0 } H={0} . Hyperbolic quadratic Hamiltonians thus give rise to a new factorization of the Segal-Bargmann transform, which is very different from the usual one, where one first applies a bounded contraction operator (the heat kernel operator), mapping L 2 L2 –states to real analytic functions with unique analytic continuation , and then one applies analytic continuation. In the factorization induced by an hyperbolic complexifier, both factors are unbounded operators but their composition is, in the Kähler or real sectors, unitary. In another paper [24] , we explore the application of the above family of unitary transforms to the definition of new holomorphic fractional Fourier transforms .},

Perhaps the most important term is the one that couples the length and time scales and is often referred to as the diffusion coefficient a in u t − ∇ ( a ∇ u ) = f ut−∇(a∇u)=f . In this paper we seek the unknown a assuming that a = a ( u ) a=a(u) depends only on the value of the solution at a given point. Such diffusion models are the basic of a wide range of physical phenomena such as nonlinear heat conduction , chemical mixing and population dynamics. We shall look at two types of overposed data in order to effect recovery of a ( u ) a(u) : the value of a time trace u ( x 0 , t ) u(x0,t) for some fixed point x 0 x0 on the boundary of the region Ω; or the value of u on an interior curve Σ lying within Ω. As examples, these might represent a temperature measurement on the boundary or a census of the population in some subset of Ω taken at a fixed time T &gt; 0 T&amp;gt;0 . In the latter case we shall show a uniqueness result that leads to a constructive method for recovery of a . Indeed, for both types of measured data we shall show reconstructions based on the iterative algorithms developed in the paper.},

We introduce a variant of the Banach-Mazur distance suited for measuring the distance between reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, that quantifies how far two spaces are from being isometrically isomorphic as reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We introduce an analogous distance for multiplier algebras, that quantifies how far two algebras are from being completely isometrically isomorphic. We show that, in the setting of finite dimensional quotients of the Drury-Arveson space, two spaces are “close” to one another if and only if their multiplier algebras are “close”, and that this happens if and only if one of the underlying point sets is close to an image of the other under a biholomorphic automorphism of the unit ball. These equivalences are obtained as corollaries of quantitative estimates that we prove.},

We show that for each nonautonomous random perturbation of an autonomous semilinear problem with a hyperbolic equilibrium there exists a bounded random hyperbolic solution for the associated nonlinear nonautonomous random dynamical systems. Moreover, we show that these random hyperbolic solutions converge to the autonomous equilibrium.

The model is a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) coupled with a first-order partial differential equation (PDE) that describes transmission of malaria with time-since-vaccination structure for vaccinated humans. The existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system are established, the basic reproduction number ( R 0 R0 ) is calculated, and model stability analysis of equilibria is performed. The optimal control problem , subject to the model system, is formulated with the optimal vaccination rate that minimizes the cost of implementing the imperfect vaccination as well as the number of infected humans. The optimality system is solved numerically, and several optimal control scenarios which effectively control the disease are presented.},

The class of operators we consider is composed by a linear drift plus a Lévy operator that is comparable, in a suitable sense, with a possibly truncated stable operator. It includes for example, the relativistic, the tempered, the layered or the Lamperti stable operators. Our method does not assume neither the symmetry of the Lévy operator nor the invariance for dilations of the linear part of the operator. Thanks to our estimates, we prove in addition the well-posedness of the considered IPDE in suitable functional spaces. In the final section, we extend some of these results to more general operators involving non-linear, space-time dependent drifts.},

Many such studies are phenomenological and a mathematical appreciation has not attracted enough attention. In the paper, we explore the nature of hysteresis and study it from the dynamical system point of view by using the bifurcation and perturbation theories. We firstly make a classification of hysteresis according to the system behaviours transiting between different types of attractors. Then, we focus on a mathematically amenable situation where hysteretic movements between the equilibrium point and the limit cycle are initiated by a subcritical Hopf bifurcation and a saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles. We present a analytical framework by using the method of multiple scales to obtain the normal form up to the fifth order. Theoretical results are compared with time domain simulations and numerical continuation, showing good agreement. Although we consider the time-delayed FitzHugh-Nagumo neural system in the paper, the generalization should be clear to other systems or parameters. The general framework we present in the paper can be naturally extended to the notion of bursting activity in neuroscience where hysteresis is a dominant mechanism to generate bursting oscillations.},

Our result then provides a bound for the L 2 L2 -norm of such functions in terms of their L 2 L2 -norm on a thick subset with a constant explicit in the geometric and spectral parameters. This recovers previous results for functions on the whole space, hyperrectangles, and infinite strips with compact Fourier support and for finite linear combinations of Hermite functions and allows to extend them to other domains. The proof follows the approach by Kovrijkine and is based on Bernstein-type inequalities for the respective functions, complemented with a suitable covering of the underlying domain.},

Under this very general assumption on the behavior of g at infinity, we establish a relation between the decay rate of the solutions and the growth of g at infinity.

We discuss the relation of the geodesic distance with other known metrics when the mentioned finite subsets are singletons. We find estimates on the upper and lower eigenvalues of the unique self-adjoint operators which define the minimal geodesics, which can be made more precise when the underlying space is the Hardy space . Also for the Hardy space we discuss the existence of geodesics joining subspaces of functions vanishing on infinite subsets of the disk, and we investigate when the product of projections onto this type of subspaces is compact.},

It is known that extending quasi-copulas is a deeper challenge than extending copulas , so we need to develop new techniques to do that. Perhaps surprisingly, our method is at the same time elementary and universal – two seemingly contradicting properties that none of the known methods for extending copulas seem to possesses. We also give a construction of two quasi-copulas that unveil an interesting counterexample in imprecise probability theory .},

Necessary and sufficient conditions for a given truncated multisequence to have a signed representing measure with minimal cardinality of its support are given by the existence of a rank preserving extension of a multivariate Hankel matrix (built from the given truncated multisequence) such that the corresponding associated polynomial ideal is real radical. This result is a special case of a more general characterisation of truncated multisequences with a minimal complex representing measure whose support is symmetric with respect to complex conjugation (which we will call quasi-complex ). One motivation for our results is the fact that positive semidefinite truncated multisequences need not have a positive representing measure. Thus, our main result gives the potential for computing a signed representing measure μ with Jordan decomposition μ = μ + − μ − μ=μ+−μ− , where card μ − cardμ− is small. We will illustrate this point on concrete examples.},

  abstract     = {One of the obstacles that arises in the generalization of Sturm&#39;s oscillation theorem to the case of general linear Hamiltonian systems is the need to associate a sign with each crossing point, necessitating a signed count rather than a direct count of such points. It&#39;s known, however, that this difficulty does not arise for all system/boundary-condition combinations, and so it can be overcome in some cases by exchanging one boundary condition for another while also keeping track of any ancillary counts that accompany the exchange. The primary tool for making such an exchange is Hörmander&#39;s index, and in this analysis we develop a straightforward method for computing Hörmander&#39;s index, and employ our method to formulate oscillation-type theorems for linear Hamiltonian systems on both bounded and unbounded intervals.},

Several difficulties are faced when trying to generalize the arguments of the semilinear case, to this quasilinear problem. The main existence theorem is proved through a new version of the well known Mountain Pass Theorem to locally Lipschitz functionals, where it is considered the Cerami compactness condition rather than the Palais-Smale one. It is also proved that all bounded variation solutions which are regular enough, satisfy a Pohozaev type identity.},

In particular, both necessary and sufficient conditions on the inducing mappings for F -transitive and d F -transitive composition operators are presented, which includes both Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2 given in [1] in a more general frame. Moreover, we provide the characterizations of F -transitive and d F -transitive semigroups induced by semiflows on Lρp(X,K) . And as a result, the sufficient condition of d -transitive semigroups induced by semiflows on Lρp(Ω,K) appears to be necessary, which answers a recent question posed by Kostić in [16] . Further, we provide the characterizations on the weight function ρ for F -transitive translation semigroups on Lρp(Δ,K) , which extends the recent results in [10] and [13] . Some related examples of d F -transitive composition operators and C0 -semigroups that are the solution semigroups of certain Cauchy problems are provided. In particular, we present the properties of d F -transitive composition operators on Lp(T,B,λ) induced by automorphisms on the complex unit disk D and show the equivalence of d-transitivity and d-mixing property for these operators.},

A weighted sum of the partial mass densities of the chemical species is assumed to be constant, which expresses the incompressibility of the fluid, while accounting for different reference sizes of the involved molecules. This condition is different from the usual assumption of a constant total mass density, and it leads in particular to a non-solenoidal velocity field in the Navier-Stokes equations. In turn, the pressure gradient occurs in the diffusion fluxes, so that the PDE–system of mass transport equations and momentum balance is fully coupled. Another striking feature of such incompressible mixtures is the algebraic formula connecting the pressure and the densities, which can be exploited to prove a pressure bound in L 1 L1 . In this paper, we consider incompressible initial states with bounded energy and show the global existence of weak solutions with defect measure.},

We are mainly concerned with the 2 × 2 2×2 case, and in order to reduce the degrees of freedom in H as much as possible, we will first convert such systems into a complementary triangular form, which is a canonical form with a minimum number of free parameters.

  abstract     = {Horospheres, particular ellipsoids internally tangent to the boundary of the Euclidean unit ball B B of C n Cn , play a pivotal role in the Denjoy–Wolff theory of holomorphic self-mappings of B B . We use horospheres to introduce a new family of transforms on the class of normalized locally biholomorphic mappings of B B into C n Cn in a vein similar to the Koebe transforms with respect to automorphisms of B B . Like the Koebe transforms, these horosphere transforms preserve the property of convexity of a mapping. After studying the transforms with regard to convex mappings in particular, we give a broad characterization of all normalized holomorphic mappings that are invariant under the horosphere transforms. We also show that the notion of horosphere invariance for locally biholomorphic mappings is preserved by several commonly studied extension operators. We then apply our technique to provide a similar, simplified characterization of Koebe-invariant mappings. With these characterizations in hand, we show that, despite the existence of many mappings satisfying either type of invariance separately, the only normalized holomorphic mappings that enjoy both types of invariance are those mappings of the form f ( z ) = ( z 1 1 − z 1 + Q ( z ˆ ) ( 1 − z 1 ) 2 , z ˆ ( 1 − z 1 ) ) f(z)=(z11−z1+Q(zˆ)(1−z1)2,zˆ(1−z1)) for z = ( z 1 , z ˆ ) ∈ B z=(z1,zˆ)∈B , where z ˆ = ( z 2 , … , z n ) zˆ=(z2,…,zn) and Q : C n − 1 → C Q:Cn−1→C is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2.

Next, we assume that the sequence ( f n ) (fn) converges uniformly to a transitive map f , and we prove that if f is minimal or equicontinuous then F is either sensitive or equicontinuous, minimal and uniformly rigid. We also study chaos for F , and we prove that Devaney chaos implies Li-Yorke chaos.},

The existence of traveling wave solutions is established by Schauder&#39;s fixed point theorem , while the nonexistence of traveling wave solutions is proved by two-sided Laplace transform. From the results, we conclude the minimal wave speed, which is an important threshold to predict how fast the disease invades. Compared with the work in [35] , we obtain more accurate results about the existence and nonexistence of nontrivial traveling wave solutions. We prove that when the basic reproduction number R 0 &gt; 1 R0&amp;gt;1 , there exists a critical number ⁎ c 1 ⁎ &gt; 0 c1⁎&amp;gt;0 such that for each ⁎ c &gt; c 1 ⁎ c&amp;gt;c1⁎ , the system has a nontrivial traveling wave solution with speed c , while for ⁎ 0 0&amp;lt;c&amp;lt;c1⁎ the system admits no nontrivial traveling wave solution. When R 0 R0&amp;lt;1 , we show that there exists no nontrivial traveling wave solution. In addition, based on [24] , we obtain the existence of traveling waves with the critical speed ⁎ c = c 1 ⁎ c=c1⁎ under certain conditions.},

This yields an explicit expression for the Laplace transform of the Kendall-Ressel law in terms of the secondary branch of the Lambert function and it offers an alternative perspective on a recent treatment of the gamma process hitting time.

Afterwards, we will apply our results to several examples of bivariate orthogonal polynomials, namely product orthogonal polynomials, orthogonal polynomials on a parabolic domain and orthogonal polynomials on the triangle. We will focus on linear combinations of the Jacobi matrices generated by these polynomials and produce families of either continuous or discrete-time QBD processes.

In this phase, the endothelial cells produce matrix and adhesive chemicals, both of which could decay or be degraded. In addition to primary random motion of all the above-mentioned three components, the endothelial cells move up toward the concentration gradients of adhesive chemicals, and moreover the former and the latter undergo convection with the spreading of matrix. Since the endothelial cells remain completely within the domain, zero-flux boundary conditions are imposed for them. However, to some extent, there is leaking at the boundaries as matrix and adhesive chemicals spread out beyond the domain. For any given suitably regular initial data , it is shown that the corresponding inhomogeneous initial-boundary value problem possesses a unique classical solution that is global-in-time and uniformly bounded via homogenization and a priori estimates .},

  abstract     = {It is shown that even a weak multidimensional Suita conjecture fails for any bounded non-pseudoconvex domain with C 1 C1 boundary: the product of the Bergman kernel by the volume of the indicatrix of the Azukawa metric is not bounded below. This is obtained by finding a direction along which the Sibony metric tends to infinity as the base point tends to the boundary. The analogous statement fails for a Lipschitz boundary . For a general C 1 C1 boundary, we give estimates for the Sibony metric in terms of some directional distance functions. For bounded pseudoconvex domains, the Blocki-Zwonek Suita-type theorem implies growth to infinity of the Bergman kernel; the fact that the Bergman kernel grows as the square of the reciprocal of the distance to the boundary, proved by S. Fu in the C 2 C2 case, is extended to bounded pseudoconvex domains with Lipschitz boundaries.},

Firstly, global stability of two constant semi-trivial equilibria and global convergence of the coexistence equilibrium are derived by using the functional and energy method, which implies that strengths of nonlocal intraspecific competitions have great effects on these global dynamics but the nonlocal interspecific competitions not and extends global results of Gourley and Ruan (2003) [11] . Secondly, global attracting region of each constant semi-trivial equilibrium is limited by its environment capacity regardless of the distinction of local and nonlocal intraspecific competitions. Thirdly, in the weak competition case, the coexistence equilibrium becomes Turing unstable when the kernels are chosen as generally distributed delay functions in temporal and the nonlocal intraspecific competitions are suitably strong. Additionally, spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous periodic solutions are found numerically.},

  abstract     = {We investigate both the system of 1 D and 2 D spatial reaction-diffusion equations with zero Neumann boundary conditions on an spatially extended domain so as to physically model the connectivity between virus and host populations using a ratio-dependent functional response. Thus, using spatial dynamics with numerical support, our main focus is to survey the 1 D spatial solution patterns for the coexistent positive steady state. It is found that the Turing bifurcation is subcritical which gives rise to a localised pattern. A two-parameter phase diagram of homogeneous, periodic and localised patterns is achieved analytically and numerically. In particular, pattern formation is explored in the limit where the virus infected population diffuses much more slowly than that of the host population. Our study shows that there exists a localised structure region which is divided into two sub regions by the Belyakov-Devaney transition curve. Depending on the sub region, the generated solution pattern is either an isolated hole or a localised pattern. Under the control of certain system parameters, when an isolated hole pattern occurs an outbreak of a disease may occur. The numerical outcomes for the 2 D spatial system confirm the existence of the 1 D localised patterns within the corresponding parameter regions. However, in 2 D the solution patterns generated are a combination of isolated holes and stripes.},

The new aspect compared to ( − Δ ) a (−Δ)a is that L is nonsymmetric, having both an even and an odd part. Hence it satisfies a μ -transmission condition where generally μ ≠ a μ≠a . We present a complex method, relying on a factorization in factors holomorphic in ξ n ξn in the lower or upper complex halfplane , using order-reducing operators combined with a decomposition principle originating from Wiener and Hopf. This is in contrast to a real, computational method presented very recently by Dipierro, Ros-Oton, Serra and Valdinoci. Our method allows μ in a larger range than they consider. Another new contribution is the (model) study of “large” solutions of nonhomogeneous Dirichlet problems when μ &gt; 0 μ&amp;gt;0 . Here we deduce a “halfways Green&#39;s formula” for L : ⁎ ⁎ ∫ R + n L u v ¯ d x − ∫ R + n u L ⁎ v ‾ d x = c ∫ R n − 1 γ 0 ( u / x n μ − 1 ) γ 0 ( v ¯ / x n μ ⁎ ) d x ′ , ∫R+nLuv¯dx−∫R+nuL⁎v‾dx=c∫Rn−1γ0(u/xnμ−1)γ0(v¯/xnμ⁎)dx′, when u solves a nonhomogeneous Dirichlet problem for L , and v solves a homogeneous Dirichlet problem for ⁎ L ⁎ L⁎ ; ⁎ μ ⁎ = 2 a − μ μ⁎=2a−μ . Finally, we show a full Green&#39;s formula, when both u and v solve nonhomogeneous Dirichlet problems; here both Dirichlet and Neumann traces of u and v enter, as well as a first-order pseudodifferential operator over the boundary.},

  abstract     = {The problem of exponential tracking with a unstable high-dimensional wave equation in a cylindrical domain is considered. The signal to be tracked is assumed to be approximated by a Fourier polynomial or a polynomial of any degrees. The feedback controller for the tracking is applied on the top and lateral boundary of the cylindrical domain , while the feedforward controller is applied only on the top. To solve this problem, we introduce a straightforward method of translation of exogenous signal dependent equilibrium to the origin to convert it to a stabilization problem, decoupling the tracking problem into two separate problems: the wave regulator equations and the stabilization of the wave equation. The wave regulator equations are reduced to the classical Helmholtz&#39;s equations and then their solutions are explicitly expressed by using the solutions of the classical Helmholtz&#39;s equations . The feedforward controller is then synthesized from the solutions. On the other hand, the feedback controller is designed by the method of backstepping with the usual integral transformation used for the unstable heat equation. Since the convergence rate of the error is completely determined by the stabilized wave equation, which is completely decoupled from the wave regulator equations, it is independent of the structures of feedforward controllers. A numerical example is given to confirm our theoretical results.},

A key ingredient in the proof is a new compactness criterion of Aubin-Lions type which involves function spaces defined in terms of the integro-differential operator in time. Boundedness of the solution is obtained by the De Giorgi iteration technique. Sufficiently regular solutions are shown to be unique by means of an L1 -contraction estimate.},

  abstract     = {Given a discrete and countable inverse semigroup S one can study, in analogy to the group case, its geometric aspects. In particular, we can equip S with a natural metric, given by the path metric in the disjoint union of its Schützenberger graphs. This graph, which we denote by Λ S ΛS , inherits much of the structure of S . In this article we compare the C*-algebra R S RS , generated by the left regular representation of S on ℓ 2 ( S ) ℓ2(S) and ℓ ∞ ( S ) ℓ∞(S) , with the uniform Roe algebra over the metric space, namely ⁎ C u ⁎ ( Λ S ) Cu⁎(ΛS) . This yields a characterization of when ⁎ R S = C u ⁎ ( Λ S ) RS=Cu⁎(ΛS) , which generalizes finite generation of S . We have termed this by admitting a finite labeling (or being FL), since it holds when Λ S ΛS can be labeled in a finitary manner. The graph Λ S ΛS , and the FL condition, also allow to analyze large scale properties of Λ S ΛS and relate them with C*-properties of the uniform Roe algebra. In particular, we show that domain measurability of S (a notion generalizing Day&#39;s definition of amenability of a semigroup, cf., [6] ) is a quasi-isometric invariant of Λ S ΛS . Moreover, we characterize property A of Λ S ΛS (or of its components) in terms of the nuclearity and exactness of the corresponding C*-algebras. We also treat the special classes of F-inverse and E-unitary inverse semigroups from this large scale point of view.},

  abstract     = {The classical Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is one of the most fundamental results in statistics . It states that the standardized sample mean of a sequence of n mutually independent and identically distributed random variables with finite second moment converges in distribution to a standard Gaussian as n goes to infinity. In particular, pairwise independence of the sequence is generally not sufficient for the theorem to hold. We construct explicitly such a sequence of pairwise independent random variables having a common but arbitrary marginal distribution F (satisfying very mild conditions) and for which no CLT holds. We obtain, in closed form, the asymptotic distribution of the sample mean of our sequence, and find it is asymmetrical for any F . This is illustrated through several theoretical examples for various choices of F . Associated R codes are provided in a supplementary appendix online .},

Being different from the general Legendre-Galerkin method, the technique adopted in this study lies in diagonalization of the mass matrix by using Fourier-like basis functions to save the computing time and memory. Moreover, the detailed stability analysis and error estimates are provided in the weighted space-time norms. We also formulate the matrix forms of the fully discrete scheme. Finally, extensive numerical tests are implemented to verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of our method.},

We present a bifurcation analysis for the system that shows the existence of positive solutions at the steady state. We complement the theoretical results with numerical computations and compare our results with those obtained in the case of having linear diffusion for the prey movement. Our results show that both models, with linear and nonlinear diffusion for the prey, have the same bifurcation point and the positive solution curves are virtually the same in a neighborhood of this point, but they get drastically different as the bifurcation parameter approaches zero.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the authors present sharp bounds of the Hübner function M M , which is defined by (1.11) and has important applications in the theories of quasiconformal maps and Ramanujan&#39;s modular equations, by showing the monotonicity and concavity-convexity properties of certain combinations defined in terms of M M and elementary functions. By these results, several well-known results for M M including its bounds and logarithmic inequalities, the explicit quasiconformal Schwarz lemma and the estimates of the solutions to Ramanujan&#39;s classical modular equations are remarkably improved. A simpler and more concise proof of the series expansion of M ( r ) M(r) is given, too.},

  abstract     = {Choquet theorems (1954) on integral representation for capacities are fundamental to probability theory . They inspired a growing body of research into different approaches and generalizations of Choquet&#39;s results by many other researchers. Notably Mathéron&#39;s work (1975) on distributions over the space of closed subsets has led to further advancements in the theory of random sets. This paper was inspired by the work of Norberg (1989) who generalized Choquet&#39;s results to distributions over domains. While Choquet&#39;s original theorems were obtained for locally compact Hausdorff (LCH) spaces, both Mathéron&#39;s and Norberg&#39;s depend on the assumption of separability in their application of the Carathéodory&#39;s method. Our Radon measure approach differs from the work of Mathéron and Norberg, in that it does not require separability. This investigation naturally leads to the introduction of finite and locally finite valuations, which allows us to characterize finite and locally finite random sets in terms of capacities on the class of compact subsets . Finally, the treatment of Lévy exponent by Mathéron and Norberg is revisited, and the notion of exponential valuation is proposed for the representation of general Poisson processes.},

The closure of E E is denoted by E ‾ E‾ . A tetra-inner function is an analytic map x from the unit disc D D to E ‾ E‾ such that, for almost all points λ of the unit circle T T , lim r ↑ 1 ⁡ x ( r λ ) exists and lies in b E ‾ , limr↑1⁡x(rλ) exists and lies in bE‾, where b E ‾ bE‾ denotes the distinguished boundary of E ‾ E‾ . There is a natural notion of degree of a rational tetra-inner function x ; it is simply the topological degree of the continuous map x | T x|T from T T to b E ‾ bE‾ . In this paper we give a prescription for the construction of a general rational tetra-inner function of degree n . The prescription exploits a known construction of the finite Blaschke products of given degree which satisfy some interpolation conditions with the aid of a Pick matrix formed from the interpolation data. It is known that if x = ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) x=(x1,x2,x3) is a rational tetra-inner function of degree n , then x 1 x 2 − x 3 x1x2−x3 either is identically 0 or has precisely n zeros in the closed unit disc D ‾ D‾ , counted with multiplicity. It turns out that a natural choice of data for the construction of a rational tetra-inner function x = ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) x=(x1,x2,x3) consists of the points in D ‾ D‾ for which x 1 x 2 − x 3 = 0 x1x2−x3=0 and the values of x at these points.},

Any matrix is differentiable, however not all matrices are integrable. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the integrability property and characterize it within the class of diagonalizable matrices. In order to do this we study the relation between the spectrum of a diagonalizable matrix and its integrability and the diagonalizability of the integral. Finally, we apply our results to obtain a dual Schoenberg type inequality relating zeros of polynomials with their critical points.},

  abstract     = {A pioneering work of Aubin for mutational analysis was improved by Lorenz in that global Lipschitz continuity of transitions in time was weakened to local Lipschitz continuity and contractivity in state was replaced by an additional structural inequality. This inequality was recently eliminated by Kobayashi and the second author. Local Lipschitz continuity assumption is still restrictive in its application to semilinear equations in general Banach spaces and mutational equations with delay, and the previous results cannot be directly applied to mixed problems because they use transitions whose domains contain a common core. To overcome such situations, we introduce a new class of transitions whose domains vary in state and that do not necessarily satisfy local Lipschitz continuity, and a new structural condition for transitions by a family of metrics depending on state and time. Under this structural condition and a growth condition for transitions, the main theorem asserts that the so-called subtangential condition and a dissipativity condition with respect to a metric-like functional ensure that a given mutational equation is well-posed.},

A deep simplification of this property is to consider curves instead of grids, so considering functions which are non-crossing on lines (NCL). Since the NCL property is much easier to verify, it would be extremely positive if they actually coincide, while it is only obvious that NC implies NCL. We show that in general NCL does not imply NC, but the implication becomes true with the additional assumption that det ⁡ ( D u ) &gt; 0 det⁡(Du)&amp;gt;0 a.e., which is a very common assumption in nonlinear elasticity .},

We show that most of the newly known strongly hypercyclic operators satisfy the stronger condition of being hypermixing. For Banach space operators, we see that some suitable scalar multiples of any non-invertible strongly hypercyclic operator are hypermixing. We prove that on Banach spaces ℓ p ℓp and c 0 c0 , a weighted backward shift is supermixing if and only if it is mixing, but, a supermixing weighted backward shift is not necessarily hypermixing.},

Previously, it was shown that suboptimal strategies in the mean field type differential game can be constructed based on functions of time and probability satisfying the stability condition. This property realizes the dynamic programming principle for the constant control of one player. We present the infinitesimal form of this condition involving analogs of the directional derivatives . In particular, we obtain the characterization of the value function of the deterministic mean field type differential game in the terms of directional derivatives and the set of directions feasible by virtue of the dynamics of the game.},

  abstract     = {The truncated moment problem asks to characterize finite sequences of real numbers that are the moments of a positive Borel measure on Rn . Its tracial analog is obtained by integrating traces of symmetric matrices and is the main topic of this article. The solution of the bivariate quartic tracial moment problem with a nonsingular 7×7 moment matrix M2 whose columns are indexed by words of degree 2 was established by Burgdorf and Klep, while in our previous work we completely solved all cases with M2 of rank at most 5, split M2 of rank 6 into four possible cases according to the column relation satisfied and solved two of them. Our first main result in this article is the solution for M2 satisfying the third possible column relation, i.e., Y2=1+X2 . Namely, the existence of a representing measure is equivalent to the feasibility problem of certain linear matrix inequalities . The second main result is a thorough analysis of the atoms in the measure for M2 satisfying Y2=1 , the most demanding column relation. We prove that size 3 atoms are not needed in the representing measure, a fact proved to be true in all other cases. The third main result extends the solution for M2 of rank 5 to general Mn , n≥2 , with two quadratic column relations. The main technique is the reduction of the problem to the classical univariate truncated moment problem, an approach which applies also in the classical truncated moment problem. Finally, our last main result, which demonstrates this approach, is a simplification of the proof for the solution of the degenerate truncated hyperbolic moment problem first obtained by Curto and Fialkow.},

  abstract     = {The paper is devoted to a description of compact disjointness preserving homogeneous polynomials on quasi-Banach lattices. De Pagter and Wickstead found independently that a compact linear operator between Banach lattices is a lattice homomorphism if and only if it is representable as the sum of a norm convergent series of one-dimensional lattice homomorphisms with pairwise disjoint ranges. It is shown that this result also holds for a wider class of operators and spaces, namely, for compact disjointness preserving homogeneous polynomials acting from one quasi-Banach lattice into another. As an auxiliary result it is proved that a lattice homomorphism between quasi-Banach lattices dominated by a positive compact operator is compact.},

An important tool in the study of majorization for infinite dimensional spaces ℓ p ( I ) ℓp(I) are doubly stochastic operators. These operators are a generalization of doubly stochastic matrices . In this paper, we compare some properties of doubly stochastic operators in finite and infinite dimensions. We will see that if D : ℓ p ( I ) → ℓ p ( I ) D:ℓp(I)→ℓp(I) is a doubly stochastic operator then ‖ D ‖ ≤ 1 ‖D‖≤1 . Moreover, the existence of such an operator with ‖ D ‖ ‖D‖&amp;lt;1 is equivalent to 1 1&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;∞ and I is an infinite set. We discuss some other properties of doubly stochastic operators such as compactness and closedness and also, provide relevant applications of these operators in the existence of solutions for some infinite linear equations and functional equations.},

We also introduce a novel OPSVM algorithm based on Markov selective sampling (OPSVM-MSS). The experimental results based on benchmark repository display that the classifier induced by OPSVM-MSS algorithm not only has smaller misclassification rate, but also the sampling and training total time is shorter compared to the classifier induced by the classical OPSVM algorithm based on randomly independent sampling (OPSVM-RIS).},

  abstract     = {In this work, we investigate the shape identification and coefficient determination associated with two time-dependent partial differential equations in two dimensions . We consider the inverse problems of determining a convex polygonal obstacle and the coefficient appearing in the wave and Schrödinger equations from a single dynamical data. With the near-field data, we first prove that the sound speed of the wave equation together with its contrast support of convex-polygon type can be uniquely determined, then establish a uniqueness result for recovering an electric potential as well as its support appearing in the Schrödinger equation. As a consequence of these results, we demonstrate a uniqueness result for recovering the refractive index of a medium from a single far field pattern at a fixed frequency in the time-harmonic regime.},

Both drift and diffusion terms may involve the regular control variable. The regular control domain is postulated to be convex. Under certain assumptions, in the framework of the Malliavin calculus, we derive the pointwise second-order necessary conditions for stochastic SOC in the classical sense. This condition is described by two adjoint processes, a maximum condition on the Hamiltonian supported by an illustrative example. A new necessary condition for optimal singular control is obtained as well. Besides, as a by-product, a verification theorem for SOCs is derived via viscosity solutions without involving any derivatives of the value functions. It is worth pointing out that this theorem has wider applicability than the restrictive classical verification theorems. Finally, we focus on the connection between the maximum principle and the dynamic programming principle for such SOCs problem without the assumption that the value function is smooth enough.},

These turn out to depend not only on the Hausdorff and walk dimensions of the space but also on other invariants. In addition, we prove Morrey type inequalities and apply them to study the infimum of the exponents that ensure continuity of Sobolev functions. The results are illustrated in the case of fractals with the Vicsek set, whereas several conjectures are made for general nested fractals and the Sierpinski carpet.},

Consistency of the M -estimators of the change points is established and the rate of convergence is determined. The asymptotic normality of the M -estimators of the parameters of the within-segment distributions is established. Since the approaches used in the complete data models are not easily extended to multiple change-point models in the presence of censoring, we have used some general results of Kaplan-Meier integrals. We investigate the performance of the methodology for small samples through a simulation study.},

These operators can be seen as a generalization of the Bessel potentials in the p -adic context. We show that the family ( K α ) α &gt; 0 (Kα)α&amp;gt;0 of convolution kernels attached to generalized Bessel potentials A α Aα , α &gt; 0 α&amp;gt;0 , determine a convolution semigroup on Q p n Qpn . Imposing certain conditions we have that K α Kα , α &gt; 0 α&amp;gt;0 , is a probability measure on Q p n Qpn . Moreover, we will study certain properties corresponding to the Green function of the operator A α Aα and we show that heat equations, naturally associated to these operators, describes the cooling (or loss of heat) in a given region over time.},

  abstract     = {The characterization of path components in the space of composition operators acting in various settings has been a long-standing open problem. Recently Dai has obtained a characterization of when two composition operators acting on the weighted Hilbert-Bergman space on the unit disk are linearly connected, i.e., they are joined by a continuous “line segment” of composition operators induced by convex combinations of the maps inducing the two given composition operators. In this paper we consider composition operators acting on the weighted Bergman spaces over the half-plane. Since not all composition operators are bounded in this setting, we introduce a metric induced by the operator norm and study when (possibly unbounded) composition operators are linearly connected in the resulting metric space. We obtain necessary conditions that under a natural additional assumption are also sufficient. We also study the problem of when a composition operator is isolated. Complete results are obtained for composition operators induced by linear fractional self-maps of the half-plane. We show that the only such composition operators that are isolated are those induced by automorphisms of the half-plane. We also characterize when composition operators induced by linear fractional self-maps belong to the same path component. The characterization demonstrates that composition operators in the same path component may have inducing maps with different behavior at infinity. In contrast, when the setting is the disk the corresponding boundary behavior of the inducing maps must match.},

  abstract     = {A regenerative random composition of integer n is constructed by allocating n standard exponential points over a countable number of intervals, comprising the complement of the closed range of a subordinator S . Assuming that the Lévy measure of S is infinite and regularly varying at zero of index − α , α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) α∈(0,1) , we find an explicit threshold r = r ( n ) r=r(n) , such that the number K n , r ( n ) Kn,r(n) of blocks of size r ( n ) r(n) converges in distribution without any normalization to a mixed Poisson distribution . The sequence ( r ( n ) ) (r(n)) turns out to be regularly varying with index α / ( α + 1 ) α/(α+1) and the mixing distribution is that of the exponential functional of S . The result is derived as a consequence of a general Poisson limit theorem for an infinite occupancy scheme with power-like decay of the frequencies. We also discuss asymptotic behavior of K n , w ( n ) Kn,w(n) in cases when w ( n ) w(n) diverges but grows slower than r ( n ) r(n) . Our findings complement previously known strong laws of large numbers for K n , r Kn,r in case of a fixed r ∈ N r∈N . As a key tool we employ new Abelian theorems for Laplace–Stiletjes transforms of regularly varying functions with the indexes of regular variation diverging to infinity.},

This is an extension of the definition previously given for right-order-continuous sub martingales with the Doob-Meyer decomposition property. The more general definition of X S XS necessitates a new proof of Doob&#39;s optional sampling theorem, because the definition given earlier for sub martingales implicitly used Doob&#39;s theorem applied to martingales. We provide such a proof, thus removing the heretofore necessary assumption of the Doob-Meyer decomposition property in the result. Another advancement presented in this paper is our use of unbounded order continuity of a stochastic process, which properly characterizes the notion of continuity of sample paths almost everywhere, found in the classical theory.},

It is rigorously shown that non-homogeneous patterned vegetation states exist when the rainfall is at a lower level in which homogeneous vegetation state cannot survive. Even when the rainfall is very low, slow plant diffusion and fast water diffusion can support a vegetation state with vegetation concentrating on a small area.

The main analysis difficulty of this model is caused by the nonlinear dispersive term u ∂ x 3 u u∂x3u since the Kato smoothing effect of the solution to the linear fifth-order KdV equation with free source term can only improve two orders concerning the initial data . The Cauchy problem of this model has recently been proved to be globally well-posed in H − 1 ( R ) H−1(R) by Bringmann-Killip-Visan (2019). Under appropriate non-homogeneous boundary data, we prove that it is locally well-posed in H s ( 0 , L ) Hs(0,L) with s ∈ [ 0 , 3 2 ) s∈[0,32) and admits a unique local solution as s ≥ 3 2 s≥32 . As far as we know, this is the latest well-posedness result of the fifth-order KdV type equation with the nonlinear dispersive term when posed in any finite domain. The main innovation in this paper is that we construct a source term space which makes that the solution to the linear fifth-order KdV equation improves three orders on the source term.},

Then we perform the nonclassical symmetry analysis and compute several hidden symmetries. Using these nonclassical symmetries, we obtain some new exact solutions and discuss their physical behavior graphically.

Mr(f)=∑n=0∞|an||zn|=∑n=0∞|an|rn. Applying earlier results of Bohr and Rogosinski, the Bohr operator is used to readily establish the following inequalities: if f ( z ) = ∑ n = 0 ∞ a n z n f(z)=∑n=0∞anzn is subordinate (or quasi-subordinate) to h ( z ) = ∑ n = 0 ∞ b n z n h(z)=∑n=0∞bnzn in the unit disk, then M r ( f ) ≤ M r ( h ) , 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 / 3 . Mr(f)≤Mr(h),0≤r≤1/3. Further, each k -th section s k ( f ) = a 0 + a 1 z + ⋯ + a k z k sk(f)=a0+a1z+⋯+akzk satisfies | s k ( f ) | ≤ M r ( s k ( h ) ) , 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 / 2 , |sk(f)|≤Mr(sk(h)),0≤r≤1/2, and M r ( s k ( f ) ) ≤ M r ( s k ( h ) ) , 0 ≤ r ≤ 1 / 3 . Mr(sk(f))≤Mr(sk(h)),0≤r≤1/3. Both constants 1/2 and 1/3 cannot be improved. From these inequalities, a refinement of Bohr&#39;s theorem is obtained in the subdisk | z | ≤ 1 / 3 |z|≤1/3 . Also established are growth estimates in the subdisk of radius 1/2 for the k -th section s k ( f ) sk(f) of analytic functions f subordinate to a concave wedge-mapping. A von Neumann-type inequality is established for the class consisting of Schwarz functions in the unit disk.},

  abstract     = {This work focuses on functional differential equations subject to wideband noise perturbations. Modeling using a white noise is often an idealization of the actual physical process, whereas a wideband noise can be easily realized in applications and well approximates a white noise. Using functional derivatives together with the combined perturbed test function methods and martingale techniques, this paper demonstrates that when a small parameter tends to zero, the underlying process converges to a limit that is the solution of a stochastic functional differential equation. To illustrate, an integro-differential system with wideband noise perturbation is examined as an example. Not only are the results interesting from a mathematical point of view, but also they are of utility to a wide range of applications.},

  abstract     = {Planar piecewise linear systems with two linearity zones separated by a straight line and with a periodic orbit at infinity are considered. By using some changes of variables and parameters, a reduced canonical form with five parameters is obtained. Instead of the usual Bendixson transformation to work near infinity, a more direct approach is introduced by taking suitable coordinates for the crossing points of the possible periodic orbits with the separation straight line. The required computations to characterize the stability and bifurcations of the periodic orbit at infinity are much easier. It is shown that the Hopf bifurcation at infinity can have degeneracies of co-dimension three and, in particular, up to three limit cycles can bifurcate from the periodic orbit at infinity. This provides a new mechanism to explain the claimed maximum number of limit cycles in this family of systems. The centers at infinity classification together with the limit cycles bifurcating from them are also analyzed.},

In this paper we will investigate the case when the leading coefficient of the restoring is negative, we will show that saddle-node bifurcations, pitchfork bifurcations, Hopf bifurcations , homoclinic bifurcations, and heteroclinic bifurcations will occur through a global analysis and present a global bifurcation diagram with global phase portraits depicted in Poincaré disks.

The coefficients of each operator H ( k ) H(k) are periodic in the outlets of the cylinder; the structure of these periodic parts at different outlets can be different. We consider a point λ 0 ∈ R λ0∈R in the essential spectrum of the operator with several distant perturbations and assume that this point is not in the essential spectra of middle operators H ( k ) H(k) , k = 2 , … , n − 1 k=2,…,n−1 , but is an eigenvalue of at least one of H ( k ) H(k) , k = 1 , … , n k=1,…,n . Under such assumption we show that the operator with several distant perturbations possesses finitely many resonances in the vicinity of λ 0 λ0 . We find the leading terms in asymptotics for these resonances, which turn out to be exponentially small. We also conjecture that the made assumption selects the only case, when the distant perturbations produce finitely many resonances in the vicinity of λ 0 λ0 . Namely, as λ 0 λ0 is in the essential spectrum of at least one of operators H ( k ) H(k) , k = 2 , … , n − 1 k=2,…,n−1 , we do expect that infinitely many resonances emerge in the vicinity of λ 0 λ0 .},

It consists in a system of nonlinear evolution partial differential equations modeling the fluid-structure interaction associated to the dynamics of an elastic vesicle immersed in a moving incompressible viscous fluid . This system of equations couples a phase-field equation -for the interface between the fluid and the vesicle- to the alpha-Navier-Stokes equation -for the viscous fluid- with an extra nonlinear interaction term, namely the bending energy. The stochastic perturbation is an additive space-time noise of trace class on each equation of the system. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solution in classical spaces of L 2 L2 functions with estimates of non-linear terms and bending energy. It is based on a priori estimate about the regularity of solutions of finite dimensional systems, and tightness of the approximated solution.},

  abstract     = {Although many people infected with Zika virus do not get sick or only have mild symptoms, pregnant women infected with Zika virus may have babies with severe birth defects. To understand the transmission dynamics of Zika virus, we develop deterministic and stochastic models , taking into account mosquito-human transmission, sexual transmission, and the release of Wolbachia -infected male mosquitoes. For the deterministic model , we analyze the stability of the disease-free equilibrium and evaluate the impact of the parameters on the basic reproduction number by sensitivity analysis. We found the upper and lower bounds for the release rate of Wolbachia -infected male mosquitoes to be cost effective. Since the transmission of infectious diseases is affected by many stochastic factors, we incorporate the impact of environmental white noise on death rates of adult mosquitoes, mosquitoes at aquatic stages, and humans to develop a stochastic model for Zika. We proved that the stochastic model has a unique and bounded global solution and derived the sufficient conditions for the extinction of Zika. We also proved the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution of the solutions. Numerical simulations show that the stochasticity may drive the disease to extinction when the intensity of the white noise is large enough, and the release of Wolbachia -infected mosquitoes shortens the time it takes for the wild mosquitoes to become extinct.},

For such model, we prove existence and uniqueness of ground states at every mass when the nonlinearity power is L2 -subcritical and at a threshold value of the mass in the L2 -critical regime. The second family is obtained by adding a standard power nonlinearity to the previous setting. In this case, we prove existence and uniqueness at every mass in the doubly subcritical case, namely when both the powers related to the pointwise and the standard nonlinearity are subcritical. If only one power is critical, then existence and uniqueness hold only at masses lower than the critical mass associated to the critical nonlinearity. Finally, in the doubly critical case ground states exist only at critical mass, whose value results from a non-trivial interplay between the two nonlinearities.},

Under the assumption that the tumor is spherically symmetric, we first establish global well-posedness of this model by proving that it admits a unique global classical solution. Next we study large-time behavior of the solution. We prove that the tumor cannot expand unboundedly, and give sufficient conditions to guarantee the tumor finally vanishing or persisting. We also give sufficient conditions to ensure that the model has at least one stationary solution ( σ s ( r ) , β s ( r ) , R s ) (σs(r),βs(r),Rs) , and study asymptotic stability of the stationary solution.},

  abstract     = {Under non-periodic boundary conditions , we consider the long-term behavior of stochastic two-dimensional (2D) nematic liquid crystal flows with multiplicative noise . The structure of the corresponding stochastic model is different from that of the deterministic model . Noise destroys the basic balance law for the nematic liquid crystal flows, so we cannot employ the standard argument to obtain uniform a priori estimates of the solutions to this stochastic model . To overcome this problem, we use logarithmic energy estimates and the Itô formula in a Banach space to obtain uniform estimates that improve the previous result where the orientation field grows exponentially w.r.t. time t. In order to study the existence of a random attractor, we need to show that the solution is a stochastic flow. However, this is not obvious because of the particularly multiplicative noise in the orientation field. To show the flow property of the orientation field, we construct linear stochastic partial differential equations where the solutions are stochastic flows. After determining the relationship between these linear equations and the orientation field equation, we prove that each component of the orientation field is indeed a stochastic flow. The global well-posedness of the stochastic 2D nematic liquid crystal flows is only established for weak solutions, so the existence of the random attractor should be demonstrated in the weak solution space. Thus, using the standard method, we need to derive uniform a priori estimates in the strong solution space. However, the standard method fails because of the ill-posedness of the strong solution. We show that by proving the compactness property of the stochastic flow and using the regularity of the solutions, we can construct a compact absorbing ball in the weak solution space, which implies the existence of the random attractor. Finally, we show the existence of the invariant measure for the corresponding stochastic model, which is the first result for the long-term behavior of stochastic nematic liquid crystals under Dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity field and Neumann boundary conditions for the orientation field.},

  abstract     = {A locus of a complex polynomial is a minimal, with respect to inclusion, set that contains at least one point of every solution of the polarization of the polynomial. The notion of a locus of a complex polynomial was introduced in [2] , where several examples were shown for polynomials of degree three. The study of such objects allows one to improve upon known results about the location of zeros and critical points of complex polynomials, see for example [3] and [4] . One of the main results in [2] is Theorem 5.1, which constructs a locus of a polynomial of degree three inside the smallest disk containing its zeros. The proof of that theorem is very long and relies on intricate geometric constructions. It also relies on a specific positioning of the zeros of the polynomial. The goals of this paper are three-fold. First, we give a simpler and more transparent proof of that result. Then we extend it by constructing a locus holder of the polynomial, when its zeros are in arbitrary position. Finally, third, we answer an open question formulated at the end of Section 7 in [2] and by doing so discover a new locus of the polynomial z 3 + 1 z3+1 .},

Suppose that the heat operator e − t L e−tL satisfies the generalized Gaussian ( p 0 , p 0 ′ ) (p0,p0′) -estimates of order m for some 1 ≤ p 0 1≤p0&amp;lt;2 . It is known that the operator ( I + L ) − s e i t L (I+L)−seitL is bounded on L p ( X ) Lp(X) for s ≥ n | 1 / 2 − 1 / p | s≥n|1/2−1/p| and p ∈ ( p 0 , p 0 ′ ) p∈(p0,p0′) (see for example, [5] , [7] , [9] , [10] , [13] , [26] ).

We first give a representation of them as a result of a suitable ladder operator acting on a constant function. Then, inspired by recent work of A. Perotti, using techniques from slice regularity, we derive explicit expressions for zonal harmonics starting from the 2 and 3 dimensional cases. It turns out that all zonal harmonics in any dimension are related to the real part of powers of the standard Hermitian product in C C . At the end we compare formulas, obtaining interesting equalities involving the real part of positive and negative powers of the standard Hermitian product. In the two appendices we show how our computations are optimal compared to direct ones.},

Such critical curves are referred to as conformal timelike geodesics. The functional defining the variational problem is the Lorentz analogue of the conformal arclength functional in Möbius geometry. We compute the Euler–Lagrange equations and show that the trajectory of a conformal timelike geodesic is constrained into some totally umbilical Einstein universe of dimension 2, 3, or 4. The case of dimension 2 leads to orbits of 1-parameter groups of Lorentz Möbius transformations , while that of dimension 3 has been dealt with in [8] . In this paper, we discuss the case of conformal timelike geodesics in the 4-dimensional Einstein universe whose trajectories are not contained in any lower dimensional totally umbilical Einstein universe. It is shown that such curves can be explicitly integrated by quadratures and explicit expressions in terms of elliptic functions and integrals are provided.},

Here, Ω ⊂ R n Ω⊂Rn is bounded and the operator ( − Δ + m 2 − m ) (−Δ+m2−m) is defined in terms of spectral decomposition . In the authors&#39; previous paper [8] , it is shown the existence and nonexistence results for the least energy solutions, depending on the range of parameter p . This paper is devoted to study the asymptotic behavior of nontrivial solutions when the mass parameter m in the equation either goes to 0 + 0+ or diverges to infinity.},

Observations from numerical simulations show that in a certain range of parameters, the corresponding system of ordinary differential equations displays stable and robust oscillations. In this work, we use geometric singular perturbation theory and blow-up method to prove the existence of a strongly attracting limit cycle. This cycle corresponds to a relaxation oscillation of an auxiliary system, whose singular perturbation nature originates from the small Michaelis-Menten constants of the biochemical model. In addition, we give a detailed description of the structure of the limit cycle, and the timescales along it.},

  abstract     = {Hessenberg differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) of size ν with nonsmooth right-hand side functions are studied. Well-posedness theory established in this article includes consistent initialization robust to parametric perturbations, and local existence and uniqueness of solutions in the classical senses. The aforementioned results follow from “regularity” of initial data , which is stated in terms of participating functions determining a Lipschitz homeomorphism . Said regularity implies the nonsmooth Hessenberg DAEs have (local) generalized differentiation index ν , and can be verified with matrix-theoretic conditions involving, for example, Clarke Jacobian projections. Regular solutions on an interval of interest are shown to have maximal continuations and to be lexicographically smooth with respect to problem parameters. Consequently, lexicographic directional differentiation can be applied to yield an auxiliary, nonsmooth “high-index” sensitivity system whose solution characterizes generalized derivative information of the reference solution of interest with respect to parameters. This theory is computationally relevant as the parametric sensitivity functions can be evaluated in a tractable way due to recent progress in nonsmooth automatic/algorithmic differentiation, and can be supplied to dedicated nonsmooth numerical equation-solving or optimization methods. This allows for numerically implementable dynamic optimization methods; open-loop optimal control theory is given which provides subdifferential elements of objective functions via solving a nonsmooth equation system involving the parametric sensitivity functions. As a corollary of the results in this article, foundational theory for smooth Hessenberg DAEs having classical differentiation index ν is established in a rigorous manner.},

Furthermore, it is shown that if the Schwarzian derivative of a pluriharmonic mapping vanishes then the analytic part of this mapping is a Möbius transformation . Some observations are made related to the dilatation of pluriharmonic mappings and to the dilatation of their affine transformations, revealing differences between the theories in the plane and in higher dimensions .

While for a homogeneous medium Ω and for certain geometries nonlinear feedback is strong enough to derive uniform decay rates of the energy associated with the model, in contrast, in an inhomogeneous medium, and for general geometry of Ω, the problem requires a new approach. In the first case, the rays of the geometric optics are straight lines and the geometry is favorable. However, in the second one, more damping is required to well-known obtain a similar result. For this purpose, arguments of microlocal analysis are used instead of the multipliers technique.},

These principles generalise the classical uniform boundedness principles for sequences of continuous linear maps by coinciding with these principles when the filter F F equals the Fréchet filter of cofinite subsets of N N . We determine combinatorial properties for the filter F F which ensure that these uniform F F -boundedness principles hold for every Fréchet space. Furthermore, for several types of Fréchet spaces, we also isolate properties of F F that are necessary for the validity of these uniform F F -boundedness principles. For every infinite-dimensional Banach space X , we obtain in this way exact combinatorial characterisations of those filters F F for which the corresponding uniform F F -boundedness principles hold true for X .},

We first obtain a series of time-independent a priori estimates for the generalized solution of the described problem. Using the extension principle and already obtained local existence theorem, we show that this problem has a solution globally in time, i.e., that for every T ∈ R + T∈R+ , there exists a solution to the problem in the time domain [ 0 , T ] [0,T] .},

As another application, we determine the precise asymptotic volume ratio for 2-concave Orlicz spaces ℓ M d ℓMd . Our method rests on ideas from statistical mechanics and large deviations theory, more precisely the maximum entropy or Gibbs principle for non-interacting particles, and presents a natural approach and fresh perspective to such geometric and volumetric questions. In particular, our approach explains how the p -generalized Gaussian distribution occurs in problems related to the geometry of ℓ p d ℓpd -balls, which are Orlicz balls when the Orlicz function is M ( t ) = | t | p M(t)=|t|p .},

To understand the contrast between distinct choices of an isotropic Gauss map , here we study surfaces with a Gauss map whose coordinates are eigenfunctions of the surface Laplace-Beltrami operator. We take into account two choices, the so-called minimal and parabolic normals, and show that when applied to simply isotropic invariant surfaces the condition that the coordinates of the corresponding Gauss map are eigenfunctions leads to planes, certain cylinders, or surfaces with constant isotropic mean curvature . Finally, we also investigate (non-necessarily invariant) surfaces with harmonic Gauss map and show this characterizes constant mean curvature surfaces.},

TRF comprises moving average and harmonizable-type subclasses that are constructed by tempering (matrix-) homogeneous, matrix-valued kernels in time- and Fourier-domain stochastic integrals with respect to vector-valued, strictly operator-stable random measures. We establish the existence and fundamental properties of TRF. Assuming both Gaussianity and isotropy, we show the equivalence between certain moving average and harmonizable subclasses of TRF.

Using the spectral analysis and the perturbation method , we find a suitable exponential weighted space in which the semi-trivial wavefront ( u 0 ( ⋅ ; ε ) , 0 ) (u0(⋅;ε),0) is asymptotically stable for small enough | ε | |ε| . We apply the stability results to two examples as demonstration.},

By the local equi-attraction we mean that any local part of sections of a pullback attractor A = { A ( τ ) } τ ∈ R A={A(τ)}τ∈R are pullback attracting at the same rate, i.e., for any bounded (but arbitrarily large) interval I , lim t → ∞ ⁡ ( sup τ ∈ I ⁡ dist X ( U ( t , τ − t , B ) , A ( τ ) ) ) = 0 , ∀ B ⊂ X bounded , limt→∞⁡(supτ∈I⁡distX(U(t,τ−t,B),A(τ)))=0,∀B⊂Xbounded, where X is a metric space and U : R + × R × X → X U:R+×R×X→X is a process in X . Our technique makes use of the uniform attractor theory to consider in a dynamic way the time parameter τ involved in the pullback attractor. The analysis shows that, roughly, when a system has a uniform attractor, then the pullback attractor can be locally equi-attracting. As an example, the pullback attractor of 2D Navier-Stokes equation is studied, where the joint continuity in initial time and initial data of the solutions plays a key role. In addition, the continuity of the set-valued mapping τ ↦ A ( τ ) τ↦A(τ) in more regular spaces is also studied.},

This system arises in the modeling of two species work together in a mutualistic way, and each of them competes with the third species. In order to consider the bistable wave of this system easily, we first transform the traveling wave system into an integral system, then study a related truncated problem of such integral system, and finally obtain the existence and monotonicity of bistable wave by a limiting argument.},

  abstract     = {Coulson integral formula was initiated in the research of energy of graphs in 1940 by Coulson, which provides an efficient way to calculate the energy of graphs without knowing any eigenvalues of graphs. Recently, Qiao et al. generalized the concept of energy from graphs to polynomials, which is referred to as the general energy of polynomials. For a polynomial ϕ ( z ) ϕ(z) and a nonzero real number α , the general energy of polynomial ϕ ( z ) ϕ(z) , denoted by E α ( ϕ ) Eα(ϕ) , is defined as the sum of α th powers of absolute values of all (nonzero) roots of ϕ ( z ) ϕ(z) , i.e., E α ( ϕ ) = ∑ z k ≠ 0 | z k | α Eα(ϕ)=∑zk≠0|zk|α , where z k zk represents the nonzero roots of ϕ ( z ) ϕ(z) . In a series of three publications by Qiao et al., they gave some beautiful Coulson-type integral formulas for E α ( ϕ ) Eα(ϕ) when the roots of ϕ ( z ) ϕ(z) are all nonnegative numbers for any rational number α and any irrational number α with 0 0&amp;lt;|α|&amp;lt;1 , and when the roots of ϕ ( z ) ϕ(z) are all real numbers for any rational number α and any irrational number α with 0 0&amp;lt;|α|&amp;lt;2 . For the remaining α , their integral formulas are invalid. In this paper, we set up a research procedure covering all the nonzero real numbers α . That is to say, it not only combines all the Coulson-type integral formulas established by Qiao et al., but also involves in all the remaining unsolved α . As an extension and generalization of known integral formulas, the Coulson-type integral formulas for E α ( ϕ ) Eα(ϕ) , when the roots of ϕ ( z ) ϕ(z) are all pure imaginary numbers, are also presented, for any nonzero real number α . Moreover, we also give an alternative form of integral formulas expressed by the coefficients of polynomials.},

It is proved that C is weakly compact if, and only if, C has the generic fixed point property ( G G -FPP) for the class of L -bi-Lipschitz affine mappings for every L &gt; 1 L&amp;gt;1 . It is also proved that if X has Pełczyński&#39;s property ( u ), then either C is weakly compact , contains an ℓ 1 ℓ1 -sequence or a c 0 c0 -summing basic sequence. In this case, weak compactness of C is equivalent to the G G -FPP for the strengthened class of affine mappings that are uniformly bi-Lipschitz. We also introduce a generalized form of property ( u ), called property ( su ) (su) , and use it to prove that if X has property ( su ) (su) then either C is weakly compact or contains a wide-( s ) sequence which is uniformly shift equivalent. In this case, weak compactness in such spaces can also be characterized in terms of the G G -FPP for affine uniformly bi-Lipschitz mappings. It is also proved that every Banach space with a spreading basis has property ( su ) (su) , thus property ( su ) (su) is stronger than property ( u ).

The goal of this work is to characterize differentiable monsters that can be represented in such a “nice” way as those that are a difference of two increasing everywhere differentiable functions . We show that there are differentiable monsters that are not of bounded variation , so they clearly do not admit such “nice” representation. On the other hand, every differentiable monster f : J → R f:J→R contains many restrictions that admit “nice” representation: for every non-empty open U ⊆ J U⊆J , there is a non-trivial interval I ⊆ U I⊆U such that f ↾ I f↾I is a difference of two increasing differentiable maps , each with its derivative vanishing on a dense subset of I .},

  abstract     = {In this paper we use the Riemann–Hilbert problem, with jumps supported on appropriate curves in the complex plane, for matrix biorthogonal polynomials and apply it to find Sylvester systems of differential equations for the orthogonal polynomials and its second kind functions as well. For this aim, Sylvester type differential Pearson equations for the matrix of weights are shown to be instrumental. Several applications are given, in order of increasing complexity. First, a general discussion of non-Abelian Hermite biorthogonal polynomials on the real line, understood as those whose matrix of weights is a solution of a Sylvester type Pearson equation with coefficients first degree matrix polynomials , is given. All of these are applied to the discussion of possible scenarios leading to eigenvalue problems for second order linear differential operators with matrix eigenvalues. Nonlinear matrix difference equations are discussed next. Firstly, for the general Hermite situation a general non linear relation (non trivial because of the non commutativity features of the setting) for the recursion coefficients is gotten. In the next case of higher difficulty, degree two polynomials are allowed in the Pearson equation, but the discussion is simplified by considering only a left Pearson equation. In the case, the support of the measure is on an appropriate branch of a hyperbola . The recursion coefficients are shown to fulfill a non-Abelian extension of the alternate discrete Painlevé I equation. Finally, a discussion is given for the case of degree three polynomials as coefficients in the left Pearson equation characterizing the matrix of weights. However, for simplicity only odd polynomials are allowed. In this case, a new and more general matrix extension of the discrete Painlevé I equation is found.},

This improves the recent result of Araújo, Maia, Urbano [1] . For the Porous Medium Equation, unlike other known examples, the main difficulty is that the θ -parabolic geometry of the equation and the available regularity do not match. Despite this difficulty, considering γ as a function of m , our regularity result and the optimal local regularity of the associated homogeneous equation are comparable.},

Also we discuss a relationship between jumping flatness and subnormality of the Aluthge transform W ˜ α W˜α . Precisely, we show that if W α Wα is a nonsubnormal Hamburger-type weighted shift, then W α Wα has jumping flatness if and only if there exist positive real numbers ϕ , φ , ρ , p ϕ,φ,ρ,p , and q such that μ = ϕ δ − p + φ δ 0 + ρ δ q μ=ϕδ−p+φδ0+ρδq (or μ = ϕ δ − p + ρ δ q μ=ϕδ−p+ρδq ) and W ˜ α W˜α is subnormal, where δ x δx is the usual Dirac measure .},

The attention is paid to the case when the slowly varying parts of the coefficients are unbounded. In particular, using the presented oscillation test, we identify a very general type of conditionally oscillatory equations together with the threshold value of the coefficients (the critical setting on the border of oscillation and non-oscillation). Hence, our results supply a class of linear equations with solved oscillation behaviour which can be used as testing equations and as a starting point to the oscillation theory of the corresponding half-linear and more general non-linear and partial differential equations with unbounded coefficients.},

  abstract     = {We study the following question: if f is a nonzero measurable function on [ 0 , ∞ ) [0,∞) and m and n are distinct nonnegative integers , does the ratio f n ˆ / f m ˆ fnˆ/fmˆ of the Laplace transforms of the powers f n fn and f m fm of f uniquely determine f ? By the inverse Laplace transform , the answer is yes if m or n is zero. Under some assumptions on the smoothness of f , we show that the answer in the general case is also affirmative. The question arose from a problem in economics, specifically in auction theory, where f is the cumulative distribution function of a certain random variable. This is also discussed.},

We consider the case of regularization with the negative entropy with respect to the Lebesgue measure , which has attracted attention because it can be solved by the very simple Sinkhorn algorithm. We first analyze the regularized problem in the context of classical Fenchel duality and derive a strong duality result for a predual problem in the space of continuous functions . However, this problem may not admit a minimizer, which prevents obtaining primal-dual optimality conditions. We then show that the primal problem is naturally analyzed in the Orlicz space of functions with finite entropy in the sense that the entropically regularized problem admits a minimizer if and only if the marginals have finite entropy. We then derive a dual problem in the corresponding dual space, for which existence can be shown by purely variational arguments and primal-dual optimality conditions can be derived. For marginals that do not have finite entropy, we finally show Gamma-convergence of the regularized problem with smoothed marginals to the original Kantorovich problem.},

It requires less compatibility conditions than the previous result using Nash-Moser-Hörmander iteration scheme and linear energy estimates. It shows that maximum principle works for boundary layer equations so that the weighted L ∞ L∞ estimates on the lower order terms can be obtained.},

Furthermore, by the Hölder continuity of parameterized ambiguity set under the pseudo-metric, we demonstrate the quantitative stability results of the feasible set mapping, the optimal value function and the optimal solution mapping of the corresponding distributionally robust problem.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the fully discrete numerical method for solving the time-fractional diffusion equation: ∂ t α u − div ( A ∇ u ) = f ∂tαu−div(A∇u)=f , 0 0&amp;lt;α&amp;lt;1 . This numerical method is based on the L 1 difference approximation to ∂ t α u ∂tαu and the r -order finite element discretization on the spatial domain. We first establish a new error bound of O ( △ t β ) O(△tβ) -order for the L 1 formula where β ( 1 − α ≤ β ≤ 2 − α 1−α≤β≤2−α ) depends on the smoothness of function u ( t ) u(t) . Then, we show that this fully discrete scheme is H 1 H1 -unconditionally stable and the discrete solution admits the optimal H 1 H1 -error estimate of O ( △ t β + h r ) O(△tβ+hr) -order. When the exact solution u ( t ) u(t) is weakly singular at t = 0 t=0 , by using the graded time-meshes, we also derive the H 1 H1 -stability and the optimal H 1 H1 -error estimate. Moreover, by using the postprocessing technique, we derive an H 1 H1 -superconvergence estimate of O ( △ t β + h r + 1 ) O(△tβ+hr+1) -order. Numerical examples are provided to support our theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {In the new social media era, it is becoming increasingly important to explore the propagation rules for rumors in social networks. This article is concerned with investigating a diffusive susceptible-infected rumor propagation model with a nonlinear propagation function in a spatially heterogeneous environment. We establish the uniform persistence and analyze the asymptotic behavior of the rumor-spreading steady state for the spatially heterogeneous model when one of the diffusion coefficients tends to zero. Moreover, to better reflect the effect of a time delay on the process of rumor propagation, we establish a spatially homogeneous model with a time delay and prove the existence and local stability of the corresponding equilibrium point. Furthermore, the optimal control in the spatially homogeneous environment case is derived. Finally, several numerical simulations are performed to verify the theoretical results in both spatially heterogeneous and spatially homogeneous systems .},

This article has been retracted at the request of the Editors-in-Chief. A profound not fixable error has been found. The mistake is explained here below. Please note that this retraction notice has been updated in September 2021, as follows: The author claims to prove the following theorem that answers a challenging open problem from the book [L. Nirenberg, Topics in nonlinear functional analysis. Notes by R. A. Artino. New York: Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University (1974; Zbl 0286.47037 )]: let X be a real Hilbert space, T : X → X T:X→X be a continuous and α -expansive map such that T ( X ) T(X) has non-empty interior. Then T is surjective. Unfortunately, Step 1 of the proof essentially relies on the following erroneous “Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem for double sequences” (Theorem 6.5 from the paper [E. Habil, “Double sequences and double series”, IUG J. Nat. Stud. 14, 32 p. (2006)]): let ( p ( n , m ) ) n , m ∈ N (p(n,m))n,m∈N be a bounded double sequence of reals, then there are n 1 n1&amp;lt;n2&amp;lt;… and m 1 m1&amp;lt;m2&amp;lt;… such that the double sequence ( p ( n k , m j ) ) k , j ∈ N (p(nk,mj))k,j∈N converges. An easy counterexample to such a “Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem” appears if one takes p ( n , m ) = 0 p(n,m)=0 for n n&amp;lt;m and p ( n , m ) = 1 p(n,m)=1 for n ⩾ m n⩾m .

We show that the weighted mean dimension is not larger than the weighted metric mean dimension, which generalizes the classical result of Lindenstrauss and Weiss [16] . We also establish the relationship between the weighted mean dimension and the weighted topological entropy of dynamical systems , which indicates that each system with finite weighted topological entropy or small boundary property has zero weighted mean dimension.},

The motivation for this paper starts from the question that what if the usual exponential function in the generating function of a Sheffer sequence is replaced by degenerate exponential functions. The sequences thus defined are called λ -Sheffer sequences. It may be said that this question is very natural in view of the regained recent interests in degenerate special numbers and polynomials. It turns out that these correspond to replacing the linear functional and the differential operator respectively by λ -linear functionals and λ -differential operators. In this article, we give an account of λ -Sheffer sequences and degenerate Sheffer sequences, and illustrate them with many examples.},

Altogether, the results obtained are far beyond previous ones and required the development of a suitable mathematical framework. The entanglement of classical and quantum worlds is noteworthy, opening new theoretical perspectives, and is shown here to be a consequence of the highly non-local character of long-range, or mean-field, interactions.},

In an earlier work by the authors it was shown that there exists a bounded, harmonic (thus non-radial) symbol a such that T a Ta is not bounded in any space H v ∞ Hv∞ with an admissible weight v . Here, we show that a mild additional assumption on the logarithmic decay rate of a radial symbol a at the boundary of D D guarantees the boundedness of T a Ta . The sufficient conditions for the boundedness and compactness of T a Ta , in a number of variations, are derived from the general, abstract necessary and sufficient condition recently found by the authors. The results apply for a large class of weights satisfying the so called condition ( B ), which includes in addition to standard weight classes also many rapidly decreasing weights.},

The applied model comprises two additional terms: 1) a diffusion term for the conduction process of action potentials and 2) a delay term. The delay term is introduced because if a neuron excites a second neuron, the second neuron, in turn, excites or inhibits the first neuron. To probe the existence of traveling wave solutions , this study applies center manifold reduction and a normal form method, and the results demonstrate the existence of a heteroclinic orbit of a three-dimensional vector for dHR-type equations with RNF near a fold–Hopf bifurcation.

For this objective, the CNFE functional and matrix models and the existence, stability, and errors of the CNFE solutions of the uniform transmission line equation are first derived. Then a reduced-order extrapolated CNFE (ROECNFE) matrix model is established by means of a proper orthogonal decomposition technique, and the existence, stability, and error estimates of the ROECNFE solutions are demonstrated by matrix analysis, leading to an elegant theoretical development. Especially, our work shows that the basis functions and accuracy of the ROECNFE matrix model are the same as those of the CNFE matrix model. Finally, some numerical tests are illustrated to computationally experimentally confirm the validity and sharpness of the ROECNFE method.},

As a special case, we deduce tight two-sided inequalities for the mode of the variance-gamma (VG) distribution, and through a similar approach we also obtain tight two-sided inequalities for the mode of the McKay Type I distribution. The analogous problem for the median is more challenging, but we conjecture some monotonicity results for the median of the VG and McKay Type I distributions, from we which we conjecture some tight two-sided inequalities for their medians.

The existence of profiles is proved for appropriate (super– or sub– sonic) end states defining Lax shocks for the underlying Euler system formulated in terms of density and velocity without restrictions for the viscosity and dispersion parameters . On the other hand, the interplay of the dispersion and the viscosity plays a crucial role in proving the existence of oscillatory profiles, showing in this way how the dispersion plays a significant role in certain regimes. Numerical experiments are also provided to analyze the sensitivity of such profiles with respect to the viscosity/dispersion terms and with respect to the nearness to vacuum.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a single phytoplankton species which relies on the light for maintaining the metabolism of life in a periodically evolving environment, where the light intensity and the death rate depend on the water column depth triggered by seasonal variation. Based on the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 , a threshold type result on the dynamics of the model is established. Especially, various features of R 0 R0 with respect to the vertical turbulent diffusion rate, the buoyant or sinking rate, and the evolution rate of water column depth are derived. Our theoretical results and numerical simulations show that big evolution rate, vertical diffusion rate and water column depth all have an adverse effect on survival of phytoplankton.},

For a fixed continuous kernel K on the d -dimensional torus, we consider a generalization of the univariate sk -spline to the torus, associated with the kernel K. An estimate that provides the rate of convergence of a given function by its interpolating sk -splines is proved, in the norm of L q Lq for functions of the type ⁎ f = K ⁎ φ f=K⁎φ , where φ ∈ L p φ∈Lp and 1 ≤ p ≤ 2 ≤ q ≤ ∞ , 1 / p − 1 / q ≥ 1 / 2 1≤p≤2≤q≤∞,1/p−1/q≥1/2 .

  abstract     = {Reaction-diffusion equations are widely used to describe a variety of phenomena such as pattern formation and front propagation in biological, chemical and physical systems. In the one-dimensional model with a balanced bistable reaction function, it is well-known that there is persistence of metastable patterns for an exponentially long time, i.e. a time proportional to exp ⁡ ( C / ε ) exp⁡(C/ε) where C , ε C,ε are strictly positive constants and ε 2 ε2 is the diffusion coefficient . In this paper, we extend such results to the case when the linear diffusion flux is substituted by the mean curvature operator both in Euclidean and Lorentz–Minkowski spaces. More precisely, for both models, we prove existence of metastable states which maintain a transition layer structure for an exponentially long time and we show that the speed of the layers is exponentially small. Numerical simulations, which confirm the analytical results, are also provided.},

The results obtained are far beyond previous ones and require the development of a mathematical framework to accommodate the macroscopic long-range dynamics, which corresponds to an intricate combination of classical and short-range quantum dynamics. In this paper we focus on the classical part of the long-range, or mean-field, macroscopic dynamics, but we already introduce the full framework. The quantum part of the macroscopic dynamics is studied in a subsequent paper. We show that the classical part of the macroscopic dynamics results from self-consistency equations within the (quantum) state space. As is usual, the classical dynamics is driven by Liouville&#39;s equation .},
