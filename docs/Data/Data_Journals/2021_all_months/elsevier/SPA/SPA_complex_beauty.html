The leading term in the expansion is determined by the value of the diffusive coefficient at the beginning of the interval. The higher-order terms are determined by the jump compensator as well as the coefficients appearing in the diffusion dynamics. The result is applied to develop a nearly rate-efficient estimator of the leverage coefficient of an asset price, i.e., the coefficient in its volatility dynamics that appears in front of the Brownian motion that drives also the asset price.},

Such a process can be defined even in the non-standard case in which the reflection matrix is not completely- S S . We show in this case that the process has two possible behaviors: either it tends to infinity or it hits the corner (origin) in finite time. Given an arbitrary starting point ( u , v ) (u,v) in the quadrant, we consider the escape (resp. absorption) probabilities P ( u , v ) [ T = ∞ ] P(u,v)[T=∞] (resp. P ( u , v ) [ T P(u,v)[T&amp;lt;∞] ). We establish the partial differential equations and the oblique Neumann boundary conditions which characterize the escape probability and provide a functional equation satisfied by the Laplace transform of the escape probability. Asymptotics for the absorption probability in the simpler case in which the starting point in the quadrant is ( u , 0 ) (u,0) are then given. We proceed to show a geometric criterion on the parameters which characterizes the case in which the absorption probability has a product form and is exponential. We call this new criterion the dual skew symmetry condition due to its natural connection with the skew symmetry condition for the stationary distribution. We then obtain an explicit integral expression for the Laplace transform of the escape probability and conclude by presenting exact asymptotics for the escape probability at the origin.},

For the case V ( 0 ) = − c 2 V(0)=−c2 the singular component of the distribution of the maximum displays an unexpected cyclic behavior and depends only on c 1 c1 and c 2 c2 , but not on the current time t t . We obtain also the unconditional distribution of the maximum for either V ( 0 ) = c 1 V(0)=c1 or V ( 0 ) = − c 2 V(0)=−c2 and its expression has the form of series of Bessel functions . We also show that all the conditional distributions emerging in this analysis are governed by generalized Euler–Poisson–Darboux equations. We recover all the distributions of the maximum of the symmetric telegraph process as particular cases of the present paper. We underline that it rarely happens to obtain explicitly the distribution of the maximum of a process. For this reason the results on the range of oscillations of a natural process like the telegraph model make it useful for many applications.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the existence and first percolation properties of general stopped germ-grain models. They are defined via a random set of germs generated by a homogeneous planar Poisson point process in R 2 R2 . From each germ, a grain, composed of a random number of branches, grows. This grain stops growing whenever one of its branches hits another grain. The classical and historical example is the line segment model for which the grains are segments growing in a random direction in [ 0 , 2 π ) [0,2π) with random velocity. In the bilateral line segment model the segments grow in both directions. Other examples are considered here such as the Brownian model where the branches are simply given by independent Brownian motions in R 2 R2 . The existence of such dynamics for an infinite number of germs is not obvious and our first result ensures it in a very general setting. In particular the existence of the line segment model is proved as soon as the random velocity admits a moment of order 4 which extends the result by Daley et al. (Theorem 4.3 in Daley et al. (2014)) for bounded velocity. Our result covers also the Brownian dynamic model. In the second part of the paper, we show that the line segment model with random velocity admitting a super exponential moment does not percolate. This improves a recent result (Theorem 3.2 in Coupier et al .(2020)) in the case of bounded velocity.},

Self-Stabilization is the effect of including a mean-field interaction in addition to the state-dependent drift.

We show that the restart mechanism may change significantly the limiting distribution. We obtain a limit theorem with a novel type of limiting distribution, a mixture of an atomic distribution and an absolutely continuous distribution whose marginals, in turn, are mixtures of distributions of signed absolute values of normal random variables. In particular, we provide conditions for the limiting distribution to be normal, like in the case without restart mechanism.

  abstract     = {This work (Part (I)) together with its companion (Part (II)) develops a new framework for stochastic functional Kolmogorov equations , which are nonlinear stochastic differential equations depending on the current as well as the past states. Because of the complexity of the results, it seems to be instructive to divide our contributions to two parts. In contrast to the existing literature, our effort is to advance the knowledge by allowing delay and past dependence, yielding essential utility to a wide range of applications. A long-standing question of fundamental importance pertaining to biology and ecology is: What are the minimal necessary and sufficient conditions for long-term persistence and extinction (or for long-term coexistence of interacting species) of a population? Regardless of the particular applications encountered, persistence and extinction are properties shared by Kolmogorov systems. While there are many excellent treaties of stochastic-differential-equation-based Kolmogorov equations , the work on stochastic Kolmogorov equations with past dependence is still scarce. Our aim here is to answer the aforementioned basic question. This work, Part (I), is devoted to characterization of persistence, whereas its companion, Part (II) is devoted to extinction. The main techniques used in this paper include the newly developed functional Itô formula and asymptotic coupling and Harris-like theory for infinite dimensional systems specialized to functional equations. General theorems for stochastic functional Kolmogorov equations are developed first. Then a number of applications are examined covering, improving, and substantially extending the existing literature. Furthermore, our results reduce to that in the existing literature of Kolmogorov systems when there is no past dependence.},

Unlike with correctly specified models, the original maximum-likelihood-type estimator has an asymptotic bias under the misspecified setting and fails to achieve an optimal rate of convergence. To address this, we consider a new quasi-likelihood function that allows constructing a maximum-likelihood-type estimator that achieves the optimal rate of convergence. Study of misspecified models enables us to apply machine-learning techniques to the maximum-likelihood approach. With these techniques, we can efficiently study the microstructure of a stock market by using rich information of high-frequency data. Neural networks have particularly good compatibility with the maximum-likelihood approach, so we will consider an example of using a neural network for simulation studies and empirical analysis of high-frequency data from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. We demonstrate that the neural network outperforms polynomial models in volatility predictions for major stocks in Tokyo Stock Exchange.},

Our main result is that weak ( L 2 L2 ) solutions are renormalized solutions, that is, if ρ ρ is a weak solution, then the nonlinear composition S ( ρ ) S(ρ) is a weak solution as well, for any “reasonable” function S : R → R S:R→R . The proof consists of a systematic procedure for regularizing tensor fields on a manifold, a convenient choice of atlas to simplify technical computations linked to the Christoffel symbols , and several DiPerna–Lions type commutators ɛ C ɛ ( ρ , D ) Cɛ(ρ,D) between (first/second order) geometric differential operators D D and the regularization device ( ɛ ɛ ɛ is the scaling parameter). This work, which is related to the “Euclidean” result in Punshon-Smith (0000), reveals some structural effects that noise and nonlinear domains have on the dynamics of weak solutions.},

This maximal occupancy is allowed to randomly vary among sites, and partial exclusion occurs. Under the assumption of ergodicity under translation and uniform ellipticity of the environment, we derive a quenched hydrodynamic limit in path space by strengthening the mild solution approach initiated in Nagy (2002) and Faggionato (2007). To this purpose, we prove, employing the technology developed for the random conductance model, a homogenization result in the form of an arbitrary starting point quenched invariance principle for a single particle in the same environment, which is a result of independent interest. The self-duality property of the partial exclusion process allows us to transfer this homogenization result to the particle system and, then, apply the tightness criterion in Redig et al. (2020).},

  abstract     = {This article is devoted to the extension of the theory of rough paths in the context of Volterra equations with possibly singular kernels . We begin to describe a class of two parameter functions defined on the simplex called Volterra paths. These paths are used to construct a so-called Volterra-signature, analogously to the signature used in Lyon’s theory of rough paths. We provide a detailed algebraic and analytic description of this object. Interestingly, the Volterra signature does not have a multiplicative property similar to the classical signature, and we introduce an integral product behaving like a convolution extending the classical tensor product. We show that this convolution product is well defined for a large class of Volterra paths, and we provide an analogue of the extension theorem from the theory of rough paths (which guarantees in particular the existence of a Volterra signature). Moreover the concept of convolution product is essential in the construction of Volterra controlled paths, which is the natural class of processes to be integrated with respect to the driving noise in our situation. This leads to a rough integral given as a functional of the Volterra signature and the Volterra controlled paths, combined through the convolution product. The rough integral is then used in the construction of unique solutions to Volterra equations driven by Hölder noises with singular kernels. An example concerning Brownian noises and a singular kernel is treated.},

By using and adapting some results from Zhang (2008), together with the Garsia–Rodemich–Rumsey lemma, we obtain the convergence rates of the Euler scheme and Milstein scheme under the supremum norm .

We study the analytic properties of the semigroup it generates as well as its probability distribution. The asymptotic behavior of the wrapped process is also discussed in terms of circular Brownian motion. Besides, it is possible to derive a stochastic model for harmonic oscillators with random changes in direction and we give a diffusive approximation of this process. Furthermore, we introduce some extensions of the circular telegraph model in the asymmetric case and for non-Markovian waiting times as well.

More precisely, with the aim of approximating the solution of a quasilinear system of Itô’s SDEs, we consider for any finite partition of the time interval [ 0 , T ] a system of differential equations , where the multidimensional Brownian motion is replaced by its polygonal approximation and the product between diffusion coefficients and smoothed white noise is interpreted as a Wick product. We remark that in the one dimensional case this type of equations can be reduced, by means of a transformation related to the method of characteristics, to the study of a random ordinary differential equation . Here, instead, one is naturally led to the investigation of a semilinear hyperbolic system of partial differential equations that we utilize for constructing a solution of the Wong–Zakai approximated systems. We show that the law of each element of the approximating sequence solves in the sense of distribution a Fokker–Planck equation and that the sequence converges to the solution of the Itô equation, as the mesh of the partition tends to zero.},

In absence of the diffusions, the spin-flip dynamics can be thought of as a modification of the Curie–Weiss model. We study the mean field and the two-level hierarchical model, in the latter case restricting to a subcritical regime, corresponding to high temperatures, obtaining macroscopic limits at different spatio-temporal scales and studying the phase transitions in the system. We also formulate a generalization of our results to the k th level hierarchical case, for any k finite, in the subcritical regime.

Here, we study α α -long-range divisible sandpiles, similar to those introduced in Frómeta and Jara (2018). We show that, for α ∈ ( 0 , 2 ) α∈(0,2) , the limiting field is a fractional Gaussian field on the torus with parameter α / 2 α/2 . However, for α ∈ [ 2 , ∞ ) α∈[2,∞) , we recover the bi-Laplacian field. This provides an alternative construction of fractional Gaussian fields such as the Gaussian Free Field or membrane model using a diffusion based on the generator of Lévy walks. The central tool for obtaining our results is a careful study of the spectrum of the fractional Laplacian on the discrete torus. More specifically, we need the rate of divergence of the eigenvalues as we let the side length of the discrete torus go to infinity. As a side result, we obtain precise asymptotics for the eigenvalues of discrete fractional Laplacians . Furthermore, we determine the order of the expected maximum of the discrete fractional Gaussian field with parameter γ = min { α , 2 } γ=min{α,2} and α ∈ R + ∖ { 2 } α∈R+∖{2} on a finite grid.},

Interpreting the case q = 0 q=0 as τ = ∞ τ=∞ , the random variable V q , ξ , η Vq,ξ,η is a natural generalisation of the exponential functional ∫ 0 ∞ e − ξ s − d η s ∫0∞e−ξs−dηs , the law of which is well-studied in the literature as it is the stationary distribution of a generalised Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. In this paper we show that also the law of the killed exponential functional V q , ξ , η Vq,ξ,η arises as a stationary distribution of a solution to a stochastic differential equation , thus establishing a close connection to generalised Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes. Moreover, the support and continuity of the law of killed exponential functionals is characterised, and many sufficient conditions for absolute continuity are derived. We also obtain various new sufficient conditions for absolute continuity of ∫ 0 t e − ξ s − d η s ∫0te−ξs−dηs for fixed t ≥ 0 t≥0 , as well as for integrals of the form ∫ 0 ∞ f ( s ) d η s ∫0∞f(s)dηs for deterministic functions f f .

The drift of the process at each vertex is influenced by the states of that vertex and its neighbors, and the diffusion coefficient depends on the state of only that vertex. Such processes arise in a variety of applications including statistical physics, neuroscience, engineering and math finance. Under general conditions on the coefficients, we show that if the initial conditions form a second-order Markov random field on d d -dimensional Euclidean space, then at any positive time, the collection of histories of the processes at different vertices forms a second-order Markov random field on path space. We also establish a bijection between (second-order) Gibbs measures on ( R d ) V (Rd)V (with finite second moments) and a set of (second-order) Gibbs measures on path space, corresponding respectively to the initial law and the law of the solution to the stochastic differential equation. As a corollary, we establish a Gibbs uniqueness property that shows that for infinite graphs the joint distribution of the paths is completely determined by the initial condition and the specifications, namely the family of conditional distributions on finite vertex sets given the configuration on the complement. Along the way, we establish approximation and projection results for Markov random fields on locally finite graphs that may be of independent interest.},

We study the structure of optimal and near-optimal subsequences in a standardised planar Poisson framework. Following a long-standing suggestion by Bruss and Delbaen (2004), we prove a joint functional limit theorem for the transversal fluctuations about the diagonal of the running maximum and the length processes. The limit is identified explicitly with a Gaussian time-inhomogeneous diffusion. In particular, the running maximum converges to a Brownian bridge , and the length process has another explicit non-Markovian limit.},

Our approach differs from previous approaches in making use of the associated resolvent in order to represent the fluctuations as Skorokhod continuous mappings of weakly converging martingales. Since the Lipschitz properties of the resolvent are explicit, our analysis in principle also allows to derive approximation errors in terms of driving martingales.

We will show that the limiting process is a matrix-valued β β -stable Lévy process when the original process is symmetric β β -stable, while the limit is conditionally β β -stable in case of integrals with respect to locally β β -stable motions. These asymptotic results are mostly related to the work (Diop et al., 2013), which investigates the univariate version of the problem. Furthermore, we will show the implications for estimation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the quadratic variation matrix, which is a useful result for the principle component analysis.

Using the framework of stationary point processes in the Euclidean space , we pose it as a problem of an optimal stationary marking of a given stationary point process. The quality of a given marking is evaluated in terms of scores calculated in a covariant manner for all points as a function of the proposed marked configuration. In the absence of a total order of the configurations of scores, we identify intensity-optimality and local optimality as two natural ways for defining optimal stationary marking. We derive tightness and integrability conditions under which intensity-optimal markings exist and further stabilization conditions making them equivalent to locally optimal ones. We present examples motivating the proposed, general framework. Finally, we discuss various possible approaches leading to uniqueness results.},

Efficient numerical ‘cloning’ algorithms have been developed to estimate the scaled cumulant generating function, based on importance sampling via cloning of rare event trajectories. So far, attempts to study the convergence properties of these algorithms in continuous time have led to only partial results for particular cases. Adapting previous results from the literature of particle filters and sequential Monte Carlo methods , we establish a first comprehensive and fully rigorous approach to bound systematic and random errors of cloning algorithms in continuous time. To this end we develop a method to compare different algorithms for particular classes of observables, based on the martingale characterization of stochastic processes. Our results apply to a large class of jump processes on compact state space, and do not involve any time discretization in contrast to previous approaches. This provides a robust and rigorous framework that can also be used to evaluate and improve the efficiency of algorithms.},

However, the applicability of such studies is limited since a single parameter usually governs the randomness in these models. With this in mind, we focus here on the topology of the recently proposed multi-parameter random simplicial complex. In particular, we introduce a dynamic variant of this model and look at how its topology evolves. In this dynamic setup, the temporal evolution of simplices is determined by stationary and possibly non-Markovian processes with a renewal structure. Special cases of this setup include the dynamic versions of the clique complex and the Linial–Meshulam complex. Our key result concerns the regime where the face-count of a particular dimension dominates. We show that the Betti number corresponding to this dimension and the Euler characteristic satisfy a functional strong law of large numbers and a functional central limit theorem . Surprisingly, in the latter result, the limiting process depends only upon the dynamics in the smallest non-trivial dimension.},

In addition to mild assumptions on the distribution of the jumps for the driving process, the hypotheses for our main result are that the corresponding control system is dissipative, approximately controllable and solidly controllable. The solid controllability assumption is weaker than the well-known parabolic Hörmander condition and is only required from a single point to which the system is approximately controllable. Our analysis applies to Galerkin projections of stochastically forced parabolic partial differential equations with asymptotically polynomial nonlinearities and to networks of quasi-harmonic oscillators connected to different Poissonian baths.},

When the number of vertices n n tends to infinity and the parameter α α tends to zero, we find three scenarios according to whether α log n αlogn converges to zero, infinity or to some finite positive value: when the limit is zero, relaxation to stationarity occurs in two separate stages, the first due to mixing on the static digraph, and the second due to regeneration; when the limit is infinite, there is not enough time for the static digraph to mix and the relaxation to stationarity is dictated by the regeneration only; finally, when the limit is a finite positive value we find a mixed behavior interpolating between the two extremes.

The central quantity of interest is the runtime , that is, the number of rounds needed until every node has received the information. The push protocol and variations of it have been studied extensively. Here we study the case where the underlying graph is complete with n nodes. Even in this most basic setting, specifying the limiting distribution and statistics of it have remained open problems since the protocol was introduced. In our main result we describe the limiting distribution of the runtime. We show that it does not converge, and that it becomes, after the appropriate normalization, asymptotically periodic both on the log2n as well as on the lnn scale.

At any time instant, a decision-maker (DM) allocates the server’s effort to the customers. The DM’s goal is to minimize a convex holding cost that accounts for the ambiguity with respect to the model, i.e., the arrival and service rates. For this, we consider an adversary player whose role is to choose the worst-case scenario. Specifically, we assume that the DM has a reference probability model in mind and that the cost function is formulated by the supremum over equivalent admissible probability measures to the reference measure with two components, the first is the expected holding cost, and the second one is a penalty for the adversary player for deviating from the reference model. The penalty term is formulated by a general divergence measure. We show that although that under the equivalent admissible measures the critically-load condition might be violated, the generalized c μ cμ rule is asymptotically optimal for this problem.},

  abstract     = {A variety of paradigms have been proposed to speed up Markov chain mixing, ranging from non-backtracking random walks to simulated annealing and lifted Metropolis–Hastings. We provide a general characterization of the limits and opportunities of different approaches for designing fast mixing dynamics on graphs using the framework of “lifted Markov chains”. This common framework allows to prove lower and upper bounds on the mixing behavior of these approaches, depending on a limited set of assumptions on the dynamics. We find that some approaches can speed up the mixing time to diameter time, or a time inversely proportional to the graph conductance, while others allow for no speedup at all.},

  abstract     = {Comparing individual contributions in a strongly interacting system of stochastic growth processes can be a very difficult problem. This is particularly the case when new growth processes are initiated depending on the state of previous ones and the growth rates of the individual processes are themselves random. We propose a novel technique to deal with such problems and show how it can be applied to a broad range of examples where it produces new insight and surprising results. The method relies on two steps: In the first step, which is highly problem dependent, the growth processes are jointly embedded into continuous time so that their evolutions after initiation become approximately independent while we retain some control over the initiation times. Once such an embedding is achieved, the second step is to apply a Poisson limit theorem that enables a comparison of the state of the processes initiated in a critical window and therefore allows an asymptotic description of the extremal process. In this paper we prove a versatile limit theorem of this type and show how this tool can be applied to obtain novel asymptotic results for a variety of interesting stochastic processes. These include (a) the maximal degree in different types of preferential attachment networks with fitnesses like the well-known Bianconi–Barabási tree and a network model of Dereich, (b) the most successful mutant in branching processes evolving by selection and mutation, and (c) the ratio between the largest and second largest cycles in a random permutation with random cycle weights, which can also be interpreted as a disordered version of Pitman’s Chinese restaurant process.},

Based on this connection, we provide new criteria for the practical determination of the domain of definition, including specific results for the subfamilies of Gaussian, symmetric- α α -stable, generalized Laplace, and compound Poisson white noises.

The paper first focuses on studying the partial derivative of a function f : P 2 , 0 ( R d × E ) → R f:P2,0(Rd×E)→R defined on the space of probability measures μ μ over ( R d × E , B ( R d ) ⊗ E ) (Rd×E,B(Rd)⊗E) whose first marginal ≔ μ 1 ≔ μ ( ⋅ × E ) μ1≔μ(⋅×E) has a finite second order moment. This partial derivative is taken with respect to q ( d x , z ) q(dx,z) , where μ μ has the disintegration μ ( d x d z ) = q ( d x , z ) μ 2 ( d z ) μ(dxdz)=q(dx,z)μ2(dz) with respect to its second marginal μ 2 ( ⋅ ) = μ ( R d × ⋅ ) μ2(⋅)=μ(Rd×⋅) . Simplifying the language, we will speak of the derivative with respect to the law μ μ conditioned to its second marginal. Our results extend those of the derivative of a function g : P 2 ( R d ) → R g:P2(Rd)→R over the space of probability measures with finite second order moment by P.L. Lions (see Lions (2013)) but cover also as a particular case recent approaches considering E = R k E=Rk and supposing the differentiability of f f over P 2 ( R d × R k ) P2(Rd×Rk) , in order to use the derivative ∂ μ f ∂μf to define the partial derivative ( ∂ μ f ) 1 (∂μf)1 . The second part of the paper focuses on investigating a stochastic maximum principle, where the controlled state process is driven by a general mean-field stochastic differential equation with partial information. The control set is just supposed to be a measurable space , and the coefficients of the controlled system, i.e., those of the dynamics as well as of the cost functional, depend on the controlled state process X X , the control v v , a partial information on X X , as well as on the joint law of ( X , v ) (X,v) . Through considering a new second-order variational equation and the corresponding second-order adjoint equation, and a totally new method to prove the estimate for the solution of the first-order variational equation , the optimal principle is proved through spike variation of an optimal control and with the help of the tailor-made form of second-order expansion. We emphasize that in our assumptions we do not need any regularity of the coefficients neither in the control variable nor with respect to the law of the control process.},

The construction of such a system of annihilating Brownian motions (aBMs) is straightforward as long as we start with a finite number of particles, but is more involved for infinitely many particles. In particular, if we let the set of starting points become increasingly dense in the real line it is not obvious whether the resulting systems of aBMs converge and what the possible limit points (entrance laws) are. In this paper, we show that aBMs arise as the interface model of the continuous-space voter model. This link allows us to provide a full classification of entrance laws for aBMs. We also give some examples showing how different entrance laws can be obtained via finite approximations. Further, we discuss the relation of the continuous-space voter model to the stepping stone and other related models. Finally, we obtain an expression for the n n -point densities of aBMs starting from an arbitrary entrance law.},

The drift is estimated on a set A using an approximate regression equation by a least squares contrast, minimized over finite dimensional subspaces of L 2 ( A , d x ) L2(A,dx) . The novelty is that the set A is non compact and the diffusion coefficient unbounded. Risk bounds of a L 2 L2 -risk are provided where new variance terms are exhibited. A data-driven selection procedure is proposed where the dimension of the projection space is chosen within a random set contrary to usual selection procedures.},

The strength of the noise is measured by a small parameter ε &gt; 0 ε&amp;gt;0 (which we interpret as the temperature ), and we suppose that the strength of the interaction is given by J &gt; 0 J&amp;gt;0 . Choosing the empirical mean ( P : R N → R P:RN→R , P x = 1 ∕ N ∑ i x i Px=1∕N∑ixi ) as the macroscopic order parameter for the system, we show that the resulting macroscopic Hamiltonian has two global minima, one at − m ε ⋆ −mε⋆&amp;lt;0 and one at m ε ⋆ &gt; 0 mε⋆&amp;gt;0 . Following this observation, we are interested in the average transition time of the system to P − 1 ( m ε ⋆ ) P−1(mε⋆) , when the initial configuration is drawn according to a probability measure (the so-called last-exit distribution ), which is supported around the hyperplane P − 1 ( − m ε ⋆ ) P−1(−mε⋆) . Under the assumption of strong interaction, J &gt; 1 J&amp;gt;1 , the main result is a formula for this transition time, which is reminiscent of the celebrated Eyring–Kramers formula (see Bovier et al. (2004)) up to a multiplicative error term that tends to 1 as N → ∞ N→∞ and ε ↓ 0 ε↓0 . The proof is based on the potential-theoretic approach to metastability . In the last chapter we add some estimates on the metastable transition time in the high-temperature regime, where ε = 1 ε=1 , and for a large class of single-site potentials.},

We provide criteria for the existence of strong solutions under non-Lipschitz conditions of Yamada–Watanabe type without non-degeneracy assumption following the approach developed by Li and Mytnik (2011). The strong convergence rate of the propagation of chaos for the associated particle system and of the corresponding Euler–Maruyama scheme are also investigated.

Then, we demonstrate the importance and power of these results through an application to exponential functionals of Lévy processes . For a subordinator (a non-decreasing Lévy process) ( X s ) s ≥ 0 (Xs)s≥0 , we study its exponential functional , ∫ 0 t e − X s d s ∫0te−Xsds , evaluated at a finite, deterministic time t &gt; 0 t&amp;gt;0 . Our main result here is an explicit infinite convolution formula for the Mellin transform (complex moments) of the exponential functional up to time t t which is shown to be equivalent to an infinite series under very minor restrictions. Since exponential functionals of subordinators are part of a universal factorisation concerning all exponential functionals of Lévy processes we believe that this work may turn out to be a step towards a more in-depth study of general exponential functionals of Lévy processes on a finite time horizon.},

It has been previously shown that this model has various properties associated with complex networks, including a power-law degree distribution, “short distances” and a non-vanishing clustering coefficient . The model is specified using three parameters: the number of nodes n n , which we think of as going to infinity, and α , ν &gt; 0 α,ν&amp;gt;0 , which we think of as constant. Roughly speaking α α controls the power law exponent of the degree sequence and ν ν the average degree.

In this model, we have a finite or countable number of neurons which are vertices in some graph G G where the edges indicate the synaptic connection between them. We focus on metastability, understood as the property for the time of extinction of the network to be asymptotically memory-less, and we prove that this model exhibits two different behaviors depending on the nature of the specific underlying graph of interaction G G that is chosen. In this model the spiking activity of any given neuron is represented by a point process , whose rate fluctuates between 1 and 0 over time depending on whether the membrane potential is positive or null . The membrane potential of each neuron evolves in time by integrating all the spikes of its adjacent neurons up to the last spike of the said neuron, so that when a neuron spikes, its membrane potential is reset to 0 while the membrane potential of each of its adjacent neurons is increased by one unit. Moreover, each neuron is exposed to a leakage effect, modeled as an abrupt loss of membrane potential which occurs at random times driven by a Poisson process of some fixed rate γ γ . It was previously proven that when the graph G G is the infinite one-dimensional lattice, this model presents a phase transition with respect to the parameter γ γ . It was also proven that, when γ γ is small enough, the renormalized time of extinction (the first time at which all neurons have a null membrane potential) of a finite version of the system converges in law toward an exponential random variable when the number of neurons goes to infinity. The present article is divided into two parts. First we prove that, in the finite one-dimensional lattice, this last result does not hold anymore if γ γ is large enough, and in fact we prove that for γ &gt; 1 γ&amp;gt;1 the renormalized time of extinction is asymptotically deterministic. Then we prove that conversely, if G G is the complete graph, the result of metastability holds for any positive γ γ .},

  abstract     = {We study the following interacting particle system. There are ρ n ρn particles, ρ ρ&amp;lt;1 , moving clockwise (“right”), in discrete time, on n n sites arranged in a circle. Each site may contain at most one particle. At each time, a particle may move to the right-neighbor site according to the following rules. If its right-neighbor site is occupied by another particle, the particle does not move. If the particle has unoccupied sites (“holes”) as neighbors on both sides, it moves right with probability 1. If the particle has a hole as the right-neighbor and an occupied site as the left-neighbor, it moves right with probability 0 0&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;1 . (We refer to the latter rule as a “holdback” property.) From the point of view of holes moving counter-clockwise, this is a zero-range process. The main question we address is: what is the system steady-state flux (or throughput) when n n is large, as a function of density ρ ρ ? The most interesting range of densities is 0 ≤ ρ 0≤ρ&amp;lt;1∕2 . We define the system typical flux as the limit in n → ∞ n→∞ of the steady-state flux in a system subject to additional random perturbations, when the perturbation rate vanishes. Our main results show that: (a) the typical flux is different from the formal flux, defined as the limit in n → ∞ n→∞ of the steady-state flux in the system without perturbations, and (b) there is a phase transition at density h = p ∕ ( 1 + p ) h=p∕(1+p) . If ρ ρ&amp;lt;h , the typical flux is equal to ρ ρ , which coincides with the formal flux. If ρ &gt; h ρ&amp;gt;h , a condensation phenomenon occurs, namely the formation and persistence of large particle clusters; in particular, the typical flux in this case is p ( 1 − ρ ) p(1−ρ)&amp;lt;h&amp;lt;ρ , which differs from the formal flux when h h&amp;lt;ρ&amp;lt;1∕2 . Our results include both the steady-state analysis (which determines the typical flux) and the transient analysis. In particular, we derive a version of the Ballot Theorem, and show that the key “reason” for large cluster formation for densities ρ &gt; h ρ&amp;gt;h is described by this theorem.},

We strengthen their results which turn out to be also valid almost surely. Moreover, we extend them to band matrices . Sufficient conditions for convergence to the semicircle law both in probability and almost surely are provided. In contrast to convergence in probability , almost sure convergence seems to require a minimal growth rate for the bandwidth in the correlated case. Examples that fit our general setup include Curie–Weiss distributed, correlated Gaussian, and as a special case, independent entries.},
