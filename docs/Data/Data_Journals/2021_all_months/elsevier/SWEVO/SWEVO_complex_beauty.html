  abstract     = {Many real-world applications involve dealing with several conflicting objectives which need to be optimized simultaneously. Moreover, these problems may require the consideration of limitations that restrict their decision variable space. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are capable of tackling Multi-objective Optimization Problems (MOPs). However, these approaches struggle to accurately approximate a feasible solution when considering equality constraints as part of the problem due to the inability of EAs to find and keep solutions exactly at the constraint boundaries. Here, we present an indicator-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm (EMOA) for tackling Equality Constrained MOPs (ECMOPs). In our proposal, we adopt an artificially constructed reference set closely resembling the feasible Pareto front of an ECMOP to calculate the Inverted Generational Distance of a population, which is then used as a density estimator. An empirical study over a set of benchmark problems each of which contains at least one equality constraint was performed to test the capabilities of our proposed COnstrAined Reference SEt - EMOA (COARSE-EMOA). Our results are compared to those obtained by six other EMOAs. As will be shown, our proposed COARSE-EMOA can properly approximate a feasible solution by guiding the search through the use of an artificially constructed set that approximates the feasible Pareto front of a given problem.},

  abstract     = {Bio-inspired optimization (including Evolutionary Computation and Swarm Intelligence) is a growing research topic with many competitive bio-inspired algorithms being proposed every year. In such an active area, preparing a successful proposal of a new bio-inspired algorithm is not an easy task. Given the maturity of this research field, proposing a new optimization technique with innovative elements is no longer enough. Apart from the novelty, results reported by the authors should be proven to achieve a significant advance over previous outcomes from the state of the art. Unfortunately, not all new proposals deal with this requirement properly. Some of them fail to select appropriate benchmarks or reference algorithms to compare with. In other cases, the validation process carried out is not defined in a principled way (or is even not done at all). Consequently, the significance of the results presented in such studies cannot be guaranteed. In this work we review several recommendations in the literature and propose methodological guidelines to prepare a successful proposal, taking all these issues into account. We expect these guidelines to be useful not only for authors, but also for reviewers and editors along their assessment of new contributions to the field.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms rely on the population initialization strategy to determine a set of candidate solutions, which provide the preliminary knowledge of the problem landscape for the subsequent evolutionary process. However, the distribution of the initial population is rarely concerned in the multimodal evolutionary community. Moreover, a large initial population has not been attractive enough for evolutionary multimodal optimization, because it is difficult and challenging to achieve a balance between diversity and convergence within limited computing resources. As an extended version of our previous conference paper, this paper focuses on the construction of a large initial population that is beneficial for evolutionary multimodal optimization. First, we propose an improved density-based population initialization strategy to generate a uniform initial population with a certain degree of randomness. Then, after acquiring the raw fitness landscape of the problem, a fitness-weighted density-based population initialization strategy is proposed to explore potential global peaks. Finally, we design a multi-species cooperative coevolution algorithm for multimodal optimization, which balances the exploration and exploitation of such a population in the evolutionary process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is better than the mainstream algorithms on the CEC2013 multimodal optimization benchmark.},

To fill this gap, we develop a benchmark suite of Real-world Constrained Multi-objective Optimization Problems (RWCMOPs) for performance assessment of CMOMs. This benchmark suite includes 50 problems collected from various streams of research.

In this paper, we propose a novel inventory sharing algorithm that is based on a population game and evolutionary dynamics. In contrast with most existing sharing rules, In our approach, all claimants are involved in deciding on participating in a game. We set up a population game in which its players corespond to claimants, and available sharing rules are their actions. Then we find the asymptotically stable state of the game or Nash Equilibrium based on pairwise proportional imitation (replicator dynamics). Finally, we propose the founded equilibrium profile in the mentioned game as a novel sharing rule. According to the rationality principle in game theory, there is no profitable individual deviation from any claimants’ equilibrium profile. So, the NE profile is a self-enforcement agreement between all claimants. The implementation of our proposed algorithm in MATLAB confirms its effectiveness completely.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the geometrically nonlinear analysis of submerged arches by means of memetic Coral Reefs Optimization algorithms . The classic design of submerged arches is only focused on calculating the bending stress-less shape (funicular shape) of the structure. Nevertheless, recent works show that this funicular shape can be approached by using a parametric family curve, which also allows a multi-variable optimization of the arch’s geometry. Using this novel parametric set of curves, we propose a new Coral Reefs Optimization (CRO) algorithm based on a memetic approach to tackle the geometrically nonlinear design of submerged arches. Specifically, the proposed CRO approaches have been tested with different search procedures as exploration operators, and we also test a multi-method version of the algorithm, the Coral Reefs Optimization with Substrate Layers (CRO-SL), which considers several search procedures within the same evolutionary population. A local search to improve the solutions has been considered in all cases, to obtain powerful memetic operators for this problem. It is also shown how the different memetic versions of the CRO (specially those involving multi-methods and Differential Evolution search procedures), together with the parametric encoding, are able to obtain nearly-optimal geometries for underwater installations. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared with state-of-the-art algorithms for optimization: L-SHADE and HCLPSO. Statistical tests have carried out with the aim of comparing the results. It is shown that there is not significant differences between the proposed results by the three algorithms.},

Ensuring that team members of the swarm are optimally placed on these loads as well as able to resist disturbances from the environment during transport are current research challenges. In this paper, we present a decentralized behaviour based subsumption architecture for enabling a swarm of Quadcopters to explore an unfamiliar area, find a load and transport it to a target location cooperatively. In the architecture, three behaviours were used: an obstacle avoidance behaviour to avoid collisions with objects in the environment, a flocking behaviour to ensure swarm structure and a bacterium behaviour for exploration of the environment and to adapt to the mass profile of various detected loads. By adapting to the mass profile of a detected load, we show that our architecture ensures even energy distribution among Quadcopters while achieving robustness to disturbances from the environment. Our results show that a mass adapting swarm is able to conserve energy during payload transportation when compared to a swarm that does not adapt to a load’s profile. Furthermore, we do not use explicit communication between team members but instead rely on data from visual sensors attached to the Quadcopters. We experiment with simulations in a physics informed robot simulator called CoppeliaSim and demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture when utilized for cooperative transport of irregular loads.},

  abstract     = {Automatically searched architectures by neural architecture search (NAS) methods have shown promising performance in various visual recognition tasks. Among NAS methods, evolutionary neural architecture methods are popular because of their potential to find the global optimal convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These methods usually use an individual to represent a CNN, while often facing two challenges: 1) since a CNN has numerous encoded parameters and weights, the length of each individual is long, which causes a large search space, and 2) due to the unknown optimal depth of a CNN, it is necessary to deal with a variable-length optimization problem , which leads to the search in a messy way since search spaces with different dimensions may have different optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm with a simple encoding scheme (SEECNN) for evolving CNNs to address image classification problems. In our encoding scheme, the parameters and weights of each layer are encoded into an individual and the whole population represents an entire CNN. Over the course of evolution, three offspring subpopulations are separately produced by genetic operators on three subpopulations. In each subpopulation, the lengths of individuals are short and equal. Afterward, we design a stable search strategy to update the population based on the performance improvement, where we only insert, replace, and remove one individual to generate candidate populations. SEECNN is compared with 24 well-known algorithms on nine benchmark datasets and five state-of-the-art methods on a real-world skin disease image classification case. The results demonstrate its effectiveness.},

Due to the limited population size and the high dimensionality of many problems, there is little chance to cover the promising regions in the search space. From different perspectives, this paper compares the stochastic and deterministic population initialization techniques through comparing five of the well-known population initializers: Random number generator (RNG), Latin Hypercube , Sobol, Halton, and Kronecker . Due to the presence of many constraints in real-world applications, in this paper, we are focusing only on single-objective constrained optimization problems . Specifically, the goal is to investigate if there is a significant difference between these population initialization methods . In this paper, we explain theoretically and mathematically these different population initialization techniques. Moreover, different illustrative examples and visualizations are introduced to explain the behavior of each technique and compare different techniques from different perspectives. The results show that due to the high uniformity of the low-discrepancy sequences such as the Halton and Sobol sequences, the generated points using these sequences are more evenly distributed over the space than RNG, which is the commonly used technique for initializing the populations in EAs. Practically, using a set of benchmark functions , we investigate the use of each population initialization technique for initializing different population-based evolutionary algorithms . The results of our experiments prove that with sufficient numbers of iterations, the EAs are not sensitive to the initialization methods and there are no significant differences between the mentioned population initialization methods. Further, the low discrepancy methods enhance the exploration ability of EAs in early iterations.},

However, it is also well known that MOEAs need quite a few resources to compute a good approximation of the Pareto set/front. Even more, MOEAs may exhibit difficulties when dealing with highly constrained search spaces. A possible remedy is the hybridization of MOEAs with specialized local search operators; if the local search is based on mathematical programming techniques, gradient information is needed, resulting in relatively high computational cost in many problem instances. In this work, we propose an effective way of computing multi-objective descent directions seeking a compromise between feasibility and the decrement in the objective function values. Moreover, we can obtain this direction so that we do not have to explicitly compute the gradients but extract this information in the best fit manner out of the current population of the MOEA. We demonstrate two hybrid methods , each focused on certain types of problems. Numerical results on some benchmark problems support the benefits of the novel approach.},

However, some automatic method may be better as it could capture some characteristics of the problem that are not evident to the human eye. Furthermore, automatic methods could devise priority rules adapted to particular sets of instances of the problem at hand. In this paper we propose a Memetic Algorithm , which combines a Genetic Program and a Local Search algorithm , to evolve priority rules for the problem of scheduling a set of jobs on a machine with time-varying capacity. We propose a number of neighbourhood structures that are specifically designed to this problem. These structures were analyzed theoretically and also experimentally on the version of the problem with tardiness minimization, which provided interesting insights on this problem. The results of the experimental study show that a proper selection and combination of neighbourhood structures allows the Memetic Algorithm to outperform previous approaches to the same problem.},

As a sub-objective, the effects of different archive balance coefficient update strategies on the scaling ability of the MGPSO algorithm are investigated. The results indicate that the MGPSO algorithm scaled to many-objectives competitively compared to other state-of-the-art many-objective optimization algorithms, without requiring any specialized modifications to the MGPSO algorithm. The MGPSO algorithm utilizes multiple subswarms (one per objective) as well as multiple guides (personal best, neighbourhood best, and archive guides) to help balance and promote solution accuracy and solution diversity during the search process. The investigated dynamic archive balance coefficient update strategies did not improve the scalability of the MGPSO algorithm significantly.},

  abstract     = {Solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) is full of challenges due to the difficulties in balancing between feasibility, convergence and distribution. To remedy this issue, this paper proposes a multi-objective differential evolutionary algorithm based on partition selection (MODE-PS). Firstly, MODE-PS divides a CMOP into a series of optimization sub-problems by objective space partition to maintain the distribution. Then, to keep the feasibility of the subspaces, one feasible solution of each subspace is saved to a partition feasible solution set. Next, once there are feasible solutions in one subspace, the individual selection strategy of this subspace is changed from constraint search to non-constraint search. By this way, the convergence is accelerated. Finally, all the feasible solutions are archived and evolved together with the population by a mating-pool selection to balance the feasibility, convergence and distribution. Twenty-two benchmark test problems are used to test the performance of MODE-PS in comparison with five state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolution algorithms. Moreover, a real-world problem, i.e., bi-source compressed-air pipeline optimization, is used to test the performance of algorithms. The experimental results have demonstrated the high competitiveness of MODE-PS for solving CMOPs.},

Combining classic clustering and constraints leads to constrained clustering, a semi-supervised learning problem still unexplored in many aspects.

The application scheme of our proposal for the constrained clustering problem is scrutinized and compared to several state-of-the-art methods for 20 datasets with incremental levels of constraint-based information.

First and foremost, ‘new’ metaheuristics are being proposed at an alarmingly fast rate, rendering impossible to know them all. Moreover, it is necessary to determine a good enough set of parameters for the selected approach. Hence, this work proposes a strategy based on a hyper-heuristic model powered by Simulated Annealing for customising population-based metaheuristics. Our approach considers search operators from 10 well-known techniques as building blocks for new ones. We test this strategy on 107 continuous benchmark functions and in up to 50 dimensions. Besides, we analyse the performance of our approach under different experimental conditions. The resulting data reveal that it is possible to obtain good-performing metaheuristics with diverse configurations for each case of study and in an automatic fashion. In this way, we validate the potential of the proposed framework for devising metaheuristics that solve continuous optimisation problems with different characteristics, similar to those from practical engineering scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Quantification of the performance of algorithms that solve dynamic optimization problems (DOPs) is challenging, since the fitness landscape changes over time. Popular performance measures for DOPs do not adequately account for ongoing fitness landscape scale changes, and often yield a confounded view of performance. Similarly, most popular measures do not allow for fair performance comparisons across multiple instances of the same problem type nor across different types of problems, since performance values are not normalized. Many measures also assume normally distributed input data values, while in reality the necessary conditions for data normality are often not satisfied. The majority of measures also fail to capture the notion of performance variance over time. This paper proposes a new performance measure for DOPs, namely the relative error distance. The measure shows how close to optimal an algorithm performs by considering the multi-dimensional distance between the vector comprising the normalized performance scores for specific algorithm iterations of interest, and the theoretical point of best possible performance. The new measure does not assume normally distributed performance data across fitness landscape changes, is resilient against fitness landscape scale changes, better incorporates performance variance across fitness landscape changes into a single scalar value , and allows easier algorithm comparisons using established nonparametric statistical methods.},

It has brought great challenges to optimization methods due to the complicated search space that has both continuous and discrete variables. This paper considers the multi-objective constrained portfolio optimization problems that can be formulated as MINLP problems. Since each continuous variable is dependent to a discrete variable, we propose a Compressed Coding Scheme (CCS), which encodes the dependent variables into a continuous one. In this manner, we can reuse some existing search operators and the dependence among variables will be utilized while the algorithm is optimizing the compressed variables. CCS actually bridges the gap between the portfolio optimization problems and the existing optimizers, such as Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). The new approach is applied to two benchmark suites, involving the number of assets from 31 to 2235. The experimental results indicate that CCS is not only efficient but also robust for dealing with the multi-objective constrained portfolio optimization problems.},

Since VRPSPDTW is NP-hard and exact methods are only applicable to small-scale instances, heuristics and meta-heuristics are commonly adopted. In this paper we propose a novel M emetic A lgorithm with efficien T local search and E xtended neighborhood, dubbed MATE, to solve this problem. Compared to existing algorithms, the advantages of MATE lie in two aspects. First, it is capable of more effectively exploring the search space, due to its novel initialization procedure , crossover and large-step-size operators. Second, it is also more efficient in local exploitation, due to its sophisticated constant-time-complexity move evaluation mechanism. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that MATE outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms, and notably, finds new best-known solutions on 12 instances (65 instances in total). Moreover, a comprehensive ablation study is also conducted to show the effectiveness of the novel components integrated in MATE. Finally, a new benchmark of large-scale instances, derived from a real-world application of the JD logistics, is introduced, which can serve as a new and more challenging test set for future research.},

Two clustering methods , exclusion radius, and quantum particles are used to preserve population diversity.

In this paper, we present a theoretical study for the effectiveness of immune-inspired hypermutation operators in solving multi-objective optimization problems. We compare the expected runtime of a simple multi-objective evolutionary algorithm using four typical immune-inspired hypermutation operators and two classical mutation operators . The results on four bi-objective optimization problems widely used in theoretical analysis, namely LOTZ, COCZ, Plateau-MOP and PL, show that using immune-inspired hypermutation operators can always find the Pareto fronts in polynomial expected runtime, which is slower than the best known expected runtime of using classical mutation operators by at most a factor of n n . Particularly, on Plateau-MOP and PL, using immune-inspired hypermutation operators can be exponentially faster. This runtime analysis can enhance the understanding of immune-inspired hypermutation operators on solving multi-objective optimization problems, and might be helpful for designing efficient multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in practice.},

To address these two issues, we first propose a set of CMOPs with discontinuous feasible regions by introducing constraints into the widely used DTLZ test problems, and then a pioneer selection strategy is designed to handle these complex constrained optimization problems . The general idea of the proposed constraint handling strategy is simple, which selects some individuals in the population as the pioneer population, aiming to obtain some well-converged solutions without considering the constraints. By adjusting the ratio of the pioneer solutions during the evaluation, the quasi-optimal solutions are expected to approximate the Pareto optimal front . To investigate the performance of the proposed strategy, it is embedded in a classic evolutionary algorithm and compared with three state-of-the-art constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms .

  abstract     = {We have proposed a novel framework of in vivo computation, which is used for tumor sensitization and targeting (TST) in our previous investigations. In the framework, the process of nanorobots-assisted TST is rendered into an in vivo optimization problem , where nanorobots are utilized as computing agents; the tumor targeted can be seen as the global optimal solution ; the high-risk tissue plays the role of the search space; and the tumor-triggered biological gradient field (BGF) provides the aided knowledge for fitness evaluation. Our previous works have proposed the weak priority evolution strategy (WP-ES) to adapt to the actuating mode of the homogeneous magnetic field used in the state-of-the-art nanorobot control platforms. Though the previous works provide an optimal movement direction for the nanorobots at each update, the step size for each iteration, which is called the evolution mechanism in this paper, has not been studied. It is an important issue as the evolution mechanism of computing agents is a fundamental problem for both in vivo computation and mathematical optimization . To account for this issue, we propose an exponential evolution mechanism, which is used to adjust the step size of the nanorobots during each actuation period. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the evolution mechanism and choose the optimal parameter setting, we perform comprehensive simulation examples by introducing the mechanism into the WP-ES based swarm intelligence algorithms considering the realistic internal constraints. The performance is compared against that of the brute-force search, which represents the traditional systemic targeting method in terms of tumor targeting, and it is also compared against that of the WP-ES based swarm intelligence algorithms without the evolution mechanism. Results from the computational experiments verify the effectiveness of the exponential evolution mechanism for most of the representative BGF landscapes.},

The Lyapunov-based Control Scheme (LbCS) has derived the multiple Lyapunov functions that fall under the artificial potential field method of the classical approach. Interaction of the three main pillars of LbCS, which are safety, shortness, and smoothest path for motion planning, bring about cost and time effectiveness and efficiency of the velocity controllers. The switched controllers enable the UGVs to navigate autonomously via hierarchal landmarks in a cluttered workspace to their equilibrium state. The switched controllers give rise to a switched system whose stability is proven using Branicky’s stability criteria for switched systems based on multiple Lyapunov functions. Simulations results are presented to show the effectiveness of the nonlinear time-invariant controllers. Later, effects of noise are included in the velocity controllers to show system robustness.},

  abstract     = {As an important task in data mining , feature selection can improve the performance of classification by eliminating the redundant or irrelevant features in original data. It is mainly divided into filter method and wrapper method, and each one has its own advantages. To make full use of the advantages of two methods, in this paper, an interactive filter-wrapper multi-objective evolutionary algorithm , named GR-MOEA is proposed, where guiding and repairing strategies are used to select feature subsets with high quality. To be specific, a wrapper population and a filter population are evolved simultaneously in the proposed algorithm. To utilize the merits of two populations, an interactive scheme is designed, which includes a wrapper to filter guiding strategy and a filter to wrapper repairing strategy. The guide strategy is to use the good solutions in the wrapper population to steer the filter population towards a better direction. While in the repairing strategy, some features in the wrapper population are repaired by the useful information in filter population, which can avoid the trapping of local optimum in wrapper population. To further enhance the performance of GR-MOEA, two effective initialization strategies are also developed. Empirical studies are conducted by comparing the proposed algorithm with several state-of-the-art on different datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of GR-MOEA over the comparison methods in obtaining the feature subsets with higher qualities.},

  abstract     = {In most existing studies on dynamic multimodal optimization (DMMO), numerical simulations have been performed using the Moving Peaks Benchmark (MPB), which is a two-decade-old test suite that cannot simulate some critical aspects of DMMO problems . This study proposes the Deterministic Distortion and Rotation Benchmark (DDRB), a method to generate deterministic DMMO test problems that can simulate more diverse types of challenges when compared to existing benchmark generators for DMMO. DDRB allows for controlling the intensity of each type of challenge independently, enabling the user to pinpoint the pros and cons of a DMMO method. DDRB first develops an existing approach for generation of static multimodal functions in which the difficulty of global optimization can be controlled. Then, it proposes a scaling function to dynamically change the relative distribution, shapes, and sizes of the basins. A deterministic technique to control the regularity of the pattern in the change is also proposed. Using these components, a parametric test suite consisting of ten test problems is developed for DMMO. Mean Robust Peak Ratio for measuring the performance of DMMO methods is formulated to overcome the sensitivity of the conventional peak ratio indicator to the predefined threshold and niche radius. Numerical results of a successful multimodal optimization method, when augmented with a simple strategy to utilize previous information, are provided on the proposed test problems in different scenarios with the aim of serving as a reference for future studies.},

  abstract     = {Now-a-days researchers have diverted their attentions towards making stochastic algorithms deterministic. This is to reduce the fruitless exploration during the search process and to give direction to the search process. Lack of locality in the algorithms is the biggest hindrance in achieving this goal. Locality in GP is described as the correlation between the change in genotype and the semantics of its phenotype (solution). In strong locality, neighboring genotype and phenotype correspond to each other in a search space. It is believed that search algorithms exhibiting strong locality perform better than the algorithms with weak locality. Genetic Programming is among the best performing stochastic algorithms for solving challenging problems and is cursed with the same problem. This means, a small change in GP tree may result in a huge change in the behavior of the solution and vice versa. Unfortunately, this stochastic behavior stops GP from achieving its true potential. 30 years of research since GP’s inception has not solved this problem and even today it is among the biggest challenges faced by the GP community. In this paper we propose a partial derivative based technique for calculating impact of a sub tree on the output of a GP tree. This information is then used to define an impact aware crossover operator. This operator reduces semantic error of a GP tree by intelligently picking crossover points in the tree. Performance of the GP augmented with the new proposed crossover operator is compared with the state of the art techniques . The proposed technique is found efficient, reliable and outperforms the state of the art algorithms on all the tested problems.},

This paper proposes a novel way to optimize MQHOA to further improve its performance. The idea is to use the historical information in the evolutionary iterative process of the algorithm to derive a direction in the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) process and as a multi scale in the M process, then take the guidance information as the parameter to generate a new solution. The combination of these processes, i.e., MQHOA combined with the guidance information, is called GI-MQHOA. The experimental results show that the guidance information is of great significance for the exploration and exploitation of MQHOA. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on the CEC2014 test suite, and shown to be comparable to other state-of-the-art swarm intelligence and heuristic algorithms . The principle of using guiding information is simple and effective and can be easily transplanted to other heuristic algorithms.},

The lack of a functional container type for Pareto fronts and archives reduces their usefulness in multi-objective optimization, simulations in economics, decision making, data analysis, or any application that caches objects based on multiple criteria. Despite the existence of some frameworks for multi-objective optimization, there is no user-oriented solution focused exclusively on efficient implementations of dynamic fronts and archives as abstract data types with their fundamental operations for insertion, removal, searching, reference points, hyperbox queries, nearest points, and indicators. This paper describes such a library based on spatial data structures for Pareto fronts and archives with specialized algorithms to perform all of these operations with low asymptotic complexity . At a negligible integration cost, the results confirm this implementation achieves notable performance gains over naive methods for fronts of all sizes and dimensions.},

  abstract     = {In Markov games, playing against non-stationary opponents with learning ability is still challenging for reinforcement learning (RL) agents, because the opponents can evolve their policies concurrently. This increases the complexity of the learning task and slows down the learning speed of RL agents. This paper proposes efficient use of rough heuristics to speed up policy learning when playing against concurrent learners. Specifically, we propose an algorithm that can efficiently learn explainable and generalized action selection rules by taking advantage of representations of quantitative heuristics and an opponent model with an eXtended classifier system (XCS) in zero-sum Markov games. A neural network is used to model the opponent from their behaviors and the corresponding policy is inferred for action selection and classifiers evolution. Due to the condition representation and the matching mechanism of XCS, the quantitative heuristics and the opponent model can provide guidance for action selection in states with similar feature representations. Besides, in case of multiple heuristic policies, we introduce the concept of Pareto optimality to comprehensively consider all the heuristic policies for action selection. Moreover, we analyze the influence of heuristic policies on the convergence of the algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce accuracy-based eligibility traces to further speed up classifiers evolution, i.e., in the reinforcement part, classifiers that can match historical traces are reinforced according to their accuracy. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm over several benchmark algorithms in a soccer scenario and a thief-and-hunter scenario.},

Since the selection of global leaders in PSO is crucial for many-objective optimization, an approach is developed using the reference-lines-based framework to update these leaders. In the proposed approach, diversity is ensured first by making clusters of solutions for every reference line. Thereafter, only one solution from each cluster with minimum penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI) fitness is selected. In case any cluster of a line is empty, a solution with minimum PBI fitness with respect to the line is selected. This ensures the selection of isolated but sometimes dominated solutions. The proposed approach is then used for updating the archive of global leaders and for assigning them to particles in the swarm . The proposed algorithm, which is referred to as MaOPSO-DP, is tested on 3-, 5-, 8-, 10-, and 15-objective instances of DTLZ and WFG test problems.

  abstract     = {Earlier 1D histogram-based entropic methods for multilevel image thresholding suffer from the lack of contextual information. Subsequently, the idea was extended for 2D histogram-based methods, where neighbourhood pixels were considered to retain the contextual information. Nevertheless, 2D histogram-based entropic methods are computationally intensive. Moreover, these methods are based on the maximization of entropic functions using an optimizer, leading to less accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a context-sensitive entropy dependency (CSED) based multilevel thresholding method. A new optimizer called opposition equilibrium optimizer (OEO) is introduced. The opposition based learning and escaping strategy are incorporated to enhance exploration capability. Here, 31 test functions including 8 from standard testbed IEEE CEC 2014 are used for validation. The merits are – i) reduced complexity, ii) improved accuracy, iii) better stability and scalability, iv) enhanced exploration capability, v) well suited to random problems with changing dimensions, etc. The search history, trajectory, and average fitness history of the OEO are explicitly discussed. The Box plots and the convergence curves are presented to confirm its stability and faster convergence. Friedman&#39;s mean rank test, Bonferroni-Dunn test, and Holm&#39;s test are also carried out to ensure OEO superiority over others. Encouraging thresholding results on high dimensional colour satellite images from the Landsat image gallery are shown based on the suggested method (CSED-OEO). The quantitative measures (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio , Feature Similarity Index, and Structure Similarity Index) are used for validation. The CSED-OEO is compared with state-of-the-art methods and found better. It means, realistically, the method may be useful for segmentation-based analysis of colour images .},

Results suggest that the sampling mechanism provided by Treasure Hunt reduces the need for large population sizes, increasing cooperation between multiple evolving populations, which is specially important in problems with time-consuming fitness functions, due to superior quality of optimization obtained per time frame. Experiments distributing Treasure Hunt instances, in a cooperative network up to 96 processes, show that the robust scaling of the framework reduces the importance of using complex search algorithms on complex problems.},

Therefore, the solution of the CVRP was focused in this study. An improved simulated annealing algorithm with crossover operator , called ISA-CO, was proposed. A population based simulated annealing algorithm was used in the proposed algorithm. The solutions in the population were developed through the local search operators, including swap, scramble, insertion, and reversion. The improved 2-opt algorithm was used to develop the routes making up the solution. The partially mapped crossover (PMX) and the order crossover (OX) operators were applied to the solutions in the population to accelerate the convergence. A mix selection method was used to ensure the balance between exploitation and exploration. The ISA-CO was tested on 91 well-known benchmark instances. The results indicated that the method has a better performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods on many instances.},

  abstract     = {In energy disaggregation (ED), an accurate estimation of each appliance power consumption over time is crucial for practical applications. Most optimization-based ED approaches are single-objective and the disaggregated appliance power consumption profiles provided by them do not match the actual operational characteristics of the devices. In this paper, we propose a Multi-objective ED (MOED) framework considering two conflicting objectives - 1) minimizing the least square error between the measured and estimated aggregated signals; and 2) minimizing the temporal sparsity of appliance switching events. The multi-objective consideration results in a set of trade-off solutions where each solution represents a prospective disaggregation corresponding to the operation of different devices present. From the trade-off set, a disaggregated solution where the operational characteristics of appliances are close to practical operation is identified by evaluating statistical similarity. For each prospective solution, statistical similarity is evaluated with respect to a set of reference signals corresponding to the practical device operation provided by the device manufacturer. In addition, to effectively solve the MOED problem, an initialization based on Integer Programming (IP), problem-specific mutation and crossover operators are proposed. The performance of the proposed MOED framework is tested on real-world dataset from University of Victoria (UVic) and compared with other optimization approaches. On various indicators MOED shows better performance than conventional and improved Integer Programming based single-objective ED algorithms. In addition, the disaggregated signals provided by MOED are close to the practical operational characteristics of the respective appliances compared to disaggregated signals provided by the state-of-the-art ED approaches.},

Unlike most existing methods mainly capable of finding partial or approximated Pareto front , this paper focuses on calculating the complete Pareto front . This is achieved by taking advantage of the optimality principle in natural ripple-spreading phenomenon. Basically, the proposed RSA carries out a one-off ripple relay race in the route network, and then the complete Pareto front will be identified with guaranteed optimality by backtracking those Pareto non-dominated ripples (PNDRs) which reached the destination node . Theoretical analyses and comprehensive experiments show that all complete Pareto fronts of a one-to-all MOPOP can also be found in just a single run of ripple relay race, and the reported method can be further extended to calculate all Pareto optimal paths in dynamical networks, which have rarely been touched by existing MOPOP methods. Since many real-world application problems can be converted into MOPOP, the reported method has a great potential of applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with an interesting variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) called a profitable tour problem (PTP). Unlike TSP, in PTP there is no need to visit all the cities, and each city is associated with a profit which the salesman gets in case he visits that city. Like TSP, a travel cost is incurred in visiting a city that depends on the city visited last before visiting the city in consideration. The goal of the problem is to maximize the total profit minus total travel cost. In this paper, we have proposed three methods, viz. a multi-start hyper-heuristic (MSHH), a multi-start iterated local search (MS-ILS) and a multi-start general variable neighborhood search (MS-GVNS) to solve the PTP. MSHH uses eight different low level heuristics, whereas MS-ILS and MS-GVNS utilize variable neighborhood descent search over five different neighborhoods for local search. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches, a set of benchmark instances is generated based on the publicly available TSPLIB instances. Computational results on these instances show the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.},

In this study, a new dimension called family memory has been introduced to enhance PSO-based clustering&#39;s performance wherein not only the data were clustered but also the particles. Earlier studies on PSO-based clustering had used uniform distribution to create the particles&#39; coordinates. In contrast, a multi-normal distribution-based swarm initialization was proposed in this study wherein K-means clustering outcomes were used as an input, which ensured the relationship within a particle&#39;s coordinates. The performance improvement through each modification to the Conventional PSO (CPSO) algorithm was demonstrated, and the statistical tests proved the same. Based on the two proposed changes, a modified PSO (MPSO) algorithm was developed. To extend the validation, both the proposed changes were incorporated into four different PSO variants, and the performance improvements were tested. Further, the MPSO algorithm was compared with the four different clustering algorithms (three algorithms are evolutionary type, and one is a non-evolutionary type) present in the recent literature. Statistical tests for the same proved the MPSO’s significance. As an application, the MPSO algorithm was applied to Multi-criteria Inventory classification (MCIC) data. Its classification was compared with the nineteen recent inventory models’ classification using the total relevant cost, fill rate, total safety stock cost, and the validity indices. Besides, a new index has been developed to identify the most similar models to MPSO.},

However, hand-crafted neural networks often require human experts for elaborate designs, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Hence, neural architecture search (NAS) methods have been proposed to design model architecture automatically. The evolutionary NAS methods have achieved encouraging results due to the global search capability of evolutionary algorithms . Nevertheless, most existing evolutionary NAS methods use only the mutation operator to generate offspring architectures. Consequently, the generated architectures could be pretty different from their parent architectures, failing to inherit the modular information to accelerate the convergence rate. We propose an efficient evolutionary method using a tailored crossover operator to address this deficiency, which enables the offspring architectures to inherit from their parent architectures. Moreover, we combine it with mutation operators under the framework of the evolutionary algorithm. Experimental results on both the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 tasks show that our proposed evolutionary NAS method has achieved state-of-the-art results.},

Some symbols in the strings may be interpreted as instructions for simulation software. Thus, the sequence can be used to model the steps of a process. Currently, creating an L-system for a specific process is done by hand by experts through much effort. The inductive inference problem attempts to infer an L-system from such a sequence of strings generated by an unknown system; this can be thought of as an intermediate step to inferring from a sequence of images. This paper evaluates and analyzes different genetic algorithm encoding schemes and mathematical properties for the L-system inductive inference problem. A new tool, the Plant Model Inference Tool for Deterministic Context-Free L-systems (PMIT-D0L) is implemented based on these techniques. PMIT-D0L is successfully evaluated on 28 known L-systems created by experts with alphabets up to 31 symbols, and PMIT-D0L can successfully infer even the largest of these L-systems in less than a few seconds. It is also evaluated and can correctly infer any system in a larger test set of algorithmically created L-systems with much larger alphabets.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, multi-label learning becomes a trending topic in machine learning and data mining . This type of learning deals with data that each instance is associated with more than one label. Feature selection is a pre-processing method, which can significantly improve the performance of the multi-label classification. In this paper, we propose a new multi-label feature selection method based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The proposed method makes a significant difference among all ACO-based feature selection methods so that instead of using a static heuristic function , it uses a heuristic learning approach. Because heuristic functions influence the decision-making process of the ACO during the search process, using a heuristic learning approach can help the algorithm to search better in the search space. Here we propose a heuristic learning approach for the ACO heuristic function , which learns from experiences directly by using the Temporal Difference (TD) reinforcement learning algorithm. For heuristic learning, we need to model the ACO problem into a reinforcement learning problem. Thus, we model the feature selection search space into a Markovian Decision Process (MDP) where features represent the states ( S ), and selecting the unvisited features by each ant represents a set of actions ( A ). Reward signals ( R ) are composed of two criteria when ants take action. The ACO state transition rule, which is a combination of both probabilistic and greedy rules, forms the transition function ( T ) in MDP. In addition to the pheromone that is updated by the “global updating rule” in the ACO, the state-value function ( V ) is directly updated by the temporal difference formulation to form a learned heuristic function. We conduct various experiments on nine benchmark data and compare the classification performance over three multi-label evaluation measures against nine state-of-the-art multi-label feature selection methods. The results show that the proposed method outperforms competing methods significantly.},

Hence, they have inherent limitations on effectively optimizing the logistics network in real-life situations. In order to address these concerns, this paper proposes a novel optimization model based on the concept of effective distance. We first define the effective distance in logistics networks, and then implement the network optimization based on effective distance with a Physarum-inspired algorithm that overcomes the slow convergence rate of exact algorithms. The superiority of our proposed model is that suppliers can cooperate with each other to realize cost reduction, while products from different suppliers on each link remain differentiated. Numerical examples of a logistics network with multiple origin-destination pairs have shown that our proposed model (which considers both economies of scale and cooperation among suppliers in the distribution process) provides a reliable and effective cost minimization strategy. The computational performance of our proposed algorithm is also better than other algorithms such as the particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm , as indicated in our experiments.},

To resolve these challenges, Scalable Network Architecture with Dual Connectivity Application (SN-DCA) in control and data plane is proposed to improve data retention rates and minimize network usage by controlling unwanted access in the distributive clouds during transmission. Here, Two-stage control data plane splitting (TSCDP) is introduced to enhance network usage by optimizing unwanted access. It further improves the data retention rate during transmission. The analytical performance of the proposed techniques has been validated computationally and examined through simulation studies. The Simulation results show that these techniques achieve a higher performance ratio in the network with a minimum transmission delay and a high data retention rate.},

In spite of decades of historical advancements on the design and use of metaheuristics , large difficulties still remain in regards to the understandability , algorithmic design uprightness, and performance verifiability of new technical achievements. A clear example stems from the scarce replicability of works dealing with metaheuristics used for optimization, which is often infeasible due to ambiguity and lack of detail in the presentation of the methods to be reproduced. Additionally, in many cases, there is a questionable statistical significance of their reported results. This work aims at providing the audience with a proposal of good practices which should be embraced when conducting studies about metaheuristics methods used for optimization in order to provide scientific rigor, value and transparency. To this end, we introduce a step by step methodology covering every research phase that should be followed when addressing this scientific field. Specifically, frequently overlooked yet crucial aspects and useful recommendations will be discussed in regards to the formulation of the problem, solution encoding, implementation of search operators, evaluation metrics , design of experiments, and considerations for real-world performance, among others. Finally, we will outline important considerations, challenges, and research directions for the success of newly developed optimization metaheuristics in their deployment and operation over real-world application environments.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous and interactive healthcare applications exist for providing patients with customized services through user equipment (UE). For user interaction, these applications take the form of chatbots or physical robots. A user&#39;s request/query is fed as input for fetching and delivering user services. Due to the wide range of connectivity and application services, heavy data traffic can deteriorate the quality of application service. This paper proposes a relative traffic management scheme (RTMS) to address traffic issues in applications involving delicate healthcare data . The proposed scheme uses healthcare data flow and query processing to improve the responsiveness of autonomous robot-based services. Dilated traffic at any interconnecting edge is identified based on flow concentration; for this purpose, ant colony optimization (ACO) is used. The premature convergence issue in ACO is addressed by using a linear sigmoid function , which identifies the converging points based on the query processing factor to reinitiate the application service discovery and responsive deliveries. This helps to reduce both outages in healthcare service provisioning and processing time. It additionally improves response with controlled processing complexity.},

  abstract     = {Traditional multiobjective immune algorithms (MOIAs) widely use the domination relationship and crowding distance metric to run the cloning operator, which places more attention on nondominated solutions with larger crowding distance values. This “convergence-first” cloning principle may hamper population diversity. To better maintain population diversity in most traditional MOIAs, we propose a novel vertical distance-based clonal selection mechanism for MOIAs, called VD-MOIA in this paper, which arranges the cloning numbers for each solution based on the vertical distance value between the solution and its corresponding weight vector. First, the decomposition approach is used to decompose the target MOP into a set of subproblems, which are then optimized cooperatively and simultaneously. Second, the vertical distance-based clonal selection mechanism is performed, which puts more emphasis on the solutions with small vertical distance values. A large number of clones is allocated to the solutions that show good performance in terms of diversity, as these solutions are closer to their corresponding weight vectors than solutions that result in poor diversity. Moreover, the aggregated values quantified by the Chebyshev function are used to ensure convergence, while differential evolution (DE) is employed to strengthen the exploration ability of the algorithm, which further improves the population diversity as well. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, twenty-eight multiobjective benchmark problems are adopted with complicated Pareto-optimal sets and fronts. The experimental comparison results validate the superiority of our proposed VD-MOIA when compared with four competitive MOIAs and four state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Sensibly highlighting the hidden structures of many real-world networks has attracted growing interest and triggered a vast array of techniques on what is called nowadays community detection (CD) problem. Non-deterministic metaheuristics are proved to competitively transcending the limits of the counterpart deterministic heuristics in solving community detection problem. Despite the increasing interest, most of the existing metaheuristic based community detection (MCD) algorithms reflect one traditional language. Generally, they tend to explicitly project some features of real communities into different definitions of single or multi-objective optimization functions. The design of other operators, however, remains canonical lacking any intense interest to reflect the domain knowledge. Moreover, all the published reviews did not make any direct effort to link heuristic and metaheuristic based community detection approaches, rather, they simply state them separately. The review introduced in this paper attempts to address this issue. Mainly, we review the main heuristic and metaheuristic based community detection algorithms . Then, we introduce two new taxonomies for community detection algorithms : hybrid metaheuristic and hyper heuristic that can serve as common grounds for designing a collection of new and more effective MCD algorithms. To this end, we introduce four new systematic frameworks integrating both heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms , illustrating the possible issues that would fuel the desire for researchers to direct their future interest towards developing more effective community detection instances from the context of these frameworks.},

However, approximate FHT/RT analysis of randomized search heuristics (RSHs) is not flexible enough because polynomial FHT/RT is not always available for any given approximation ratio. In this paper, the error analysis , which focuses on estimation of the expected approximation error of RSHs, is proposed to accommodate the requirement of flexible analysis. By diagonalizing one-step transition matrix of the Markov chain model, a tight estimation of the expected approximation error can be obtained via estimation of the multi-step transition matrix . For both uni- and multi-modal problems, error analysis leads to precise estimations of approximation error instead of asymptotic results on fitness values, which demonstrates its competitiveness to FHT/RT analysis as well as the fixed budget analysis.},

This paper studies the distributed permutation flow shop scheduling problem with mixed no-idle constraints, which have important applications in practice.

A mixed-integer linear programming model is presented and an Adaptive Iterated Greedy (AIG) algorithm with the sample length changing according to the search process is designed. A restart strategy is also introduced to escape from local optima. Additionally, to further improve the performance of the algorithm, swap-based local search methods and acceleration algorithms for swap neighborhoods are proposed. Referenced Local Search (RLS), which shows better performance in solving scheduling problems, is also used in our algorithm. In the destruction stage, the job to be removed is selected according to the degree of influence on the total flowtime. In the initialization and construction phase, when a job is inserted, the jobs before and after the insertion position are removed and re-inserted into a better position to improve the algorithm search performance. A detailed design experiment is carried out to determine the best parameter configuration. Finally, large-scale experiments show that the proposed AIG algorithm is the best-performing one among all the algorithms in comparison.},

This paper accords a novel sparse representation based hierarchical evolutionary framework for classifying human activities . The main objective of this research is to propose a model for human action recognition that produces superior recognition results. This framework employs data from two inertial sensors namely an accelerometer and a gyroscope. Features like time and frequency-domain features were utilized in this work. This framework operates at multiple levels in the hierarchy, wherein, the output of one level is given as input to the next level in the hierarchy. A novel algorithm for deducing the hierarchical structure based on the input data called Hierarchical Architecture Design (HAD) algorithm is presented. We have also presented a novel Sparse Dictionary Optimization (SDO) algorithm for generating dictionaries that aid in the efficacious sparse representation-based classification. Finally, action recognition is done using the proposed Sparse Representation based Hierarchical (SRH) classifier. The performance analysis of the proposed system was conducted using University of Southern California Human Activity Dataset (USC HAD) and Human Activities and Postural Transitions (HAPT) Dataset. The proposed classification framework attained a very high F-score value of 98.01\% and 93.51\% for the USC HAD and HAPT datasets respectively.},

  abstract     = {Multi-task allocation, as a crucial issue on mobile crowdsensing (MCS), is to find the optimal participants-task pair under limited resource. The previous assignment methods normally maximize the benefit of participants or task requester, giving no consideration to the comprehensive interests of all parties in MCS. Besides, the sensing ability of a mobile user is commonly evaluated by the detection quality or the probability of covering the target area, causing the unqualified measurement with low spatial coverage degree or bad accuracy. To overcome these drawbacks, a comprehensive multi-task allocation model for MCS is formulated, in which maximizing the overall sensing quality of all tasks is the objective and three constraints come from the total budget shared by all tasks, the sensing quality of each task and the workload of each mobile user. An aggregative indicator that integrates the spatial coverage degree with the sensing accuracy is presented to estimate the overall quality of a mobile user. Following that, a large-scale evolutionary algorithm with problem-specific repair strategy and the new genetic operators is presented as a problem-solver. The former generates the superior feasible solutions for the overloaded participants and the unqualified tasks, while the latter introduces the new promising users to explore the high-dimension decision space, with the purpose of speeding up the convergence and avoiding falling into the local optimum. The experimental results based on 30 test instances indicate that the proposed evolutionary multi-task allocation method can generate the superior feasible assignments as more as possible, which outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

To appropriately distribute multiple populations to distinct areas of the search space and refine the best solution found by each population, an adaptive multi-swarm framework for dynamic optimization problems is proposed, in which several adaptations of multi-population approaches are developed for a better exploration/exploitation tradeoff. As the first intention, a basic adaptation is the combination of a group of active swarms and a group of inactive swarms. The group of active swarms are devoted to exploring new areas of the search space, and the group of inactive swarms are devoted to preserving useful experiences. One kind of swarm can be transformed into another. An active swarm becomes inactive after it converges. An inactive swarm will become active and search for new optima again when an environmental change occurs. For the second intention, another basic adaptation is the application of a local search to the best individual of a stagnated swarm. The experimental results on various moving peaks benchmarks show that the proposed framework is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods and more effective for dynamic environments under many peaks, severe changes, and high dimensionalities .},

  abstract     = {Over the ages, nature has constantly been a rich source of inspiration for science, with much still to discover about and learn from. Swarm Intelligence (SI), a major branch of artificial intelligence , was rendered to model the collective behavior of social swarms in nature. Ultimately, Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is arguably one of the most popular SI paradigms. Over the past two decades, PSO has been applied successfully, with good return as well, in a wide variety of fields of science and technology with a wider range of complex optimization problems , thereby occupying a prominent position in the optimization field. However, through in-depth studies, a number of problems with the algorithm have been detected and identified; e.g., issues regarding convergence, diversity, and stability. Consequently, since its birth in the mid-1990s, PSO has witnessed a myriad of enhancements, extensions, and variants in various aspects of the algorithm, specifically after the twentieth century, and the related research has therefore now reached an impressive state. In this paper, a rigorous yet systematic review is presented to organize and summarize the information on the PSO algorithm and the developments and trends of its most basic as well as of some of the very notable implementations that have been introduced recently, bearing in mind the coverage of paradigm, theory, hybridization, parallelization , complex optimization, and the diverse applications of the algorithm, making it more accessible. Ease for researchers to determine which PSO variant is currently best suited or to be invented for a given optimization problem or application. This up-to-date review also highlights the current pressing issues and intriguing open challenges haunting PSO, prompting scholars and researchers to conduct further research both on the theory and application of the algorithm in the forthcoming years.},

Also, this suite introduces challenging but rarely considered characteristics, including diverse features in fitness landscape (e.g. deception, multimodality, and bias) and complex trade-off geometries (e.g. convexity-concavity mixed geometry and disconnected geometry). Empirical studies have shown that the proposed benchmark poses reasonable challenges to DMOEAs in terms of convergence and diversity. Besides, a center matching strategy (CMS) is suggested to track random changes in these problems, which applies the history individual information in a global scope for population prediction.

By replacing reference points with weight intervals the method eliminates the need for any knowledge concerning expected solutions. Instead, decision maker reflects his context-independent policy regarding objectives. The proposed w-dominance was incorporated into selected multi-objective metaheuristics . Following this, three new metrics were designed. The metrics include prescreening true Pareto Front and final population according to w-dominance relation. Based on preliminary tests, Vector Angle Evolutionary Algorithm (VaEA) was selected as the best match for w-dominance. W-dominance-extended VAEA (wVAEA) was compared in a series of simulations with four state-of-the-art reference point-based multi-objective algorithms.

In an urban transportation network, traffic signals have a significant effect on reducing congestion, improving safety, and improving environmental pollution. In recent years, researchers have applied metaheuristic techniques for signal timing optimisation as one of the practical solutions to enhance the performance of the transportation networks. Theis study presents a comprehensive survey of such techniques and tools used in the optimisation of signals in transportation networks, providing a categorisation of approaches, discussion, and suggestions for future research.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth in the number of motor vehicles, traffic pollution has become an increasingly serious problem, due to high carbon emission and low load utilization rate. It is reasonable to plan vehicle driving routes on urban roads to deliver services, (i.e., to tackle the capacitated arc routing problem (CARP)). Previous studies on CARP have typically considered at most two objectives simultaneously; however, two objectives are not sufficient to solve the pollution problem. Consequently, a many-objective optimization model of multi-depot heterogeneous-vehicle CARP is constructed in this study that considers four objective functions: total cost, makespan, carbon emission and load utilization rate. Furthermore, based on the ideas of two-archive and information entropy, we propose a memetic algorithm based on Two_Arch2 (MATA) to tackle the constructed model. The experimental results show that MATA effectively optimizes the many-objective model and solves the problem.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in swarm inspired optimization algorithms have shown its extensive acceptance in solving a wide range of different real-world problems. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is one of the most explored nature-inspired population-based stochastic optimization algorithm. In this paper, a Multi-level Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) algorithm is proposed to find the architecture and hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) simultaneously. This automated learning will reduce the overhead of human experts to find these parameters through manual analysis and experiments. The proposed solution uses multiple swarms at two levels. The initial swarm at level-1 optimizes architecture and multiple swarms at level-2 optimize hyperparameters. The proposed method has used sigmoid like inertia weight to adjust the exploration and exploitation property of particles and avoid the PSO algorithm to prematurely converge into a local optimum solution. In this paper, we have explored an approach to suggest the best well-conditioned CNN architecture and its hyperparameters using MPSO in a specified search space. The complexity and performance of MPSO-CNN will depend on the dimension of the search space. The experimental results on 5 benchmark datasets of MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Convex Sets , and MDRBI have demonstrated one more effective application of PSO in learning a deep neural architecture.},

This work is targeted at a portfolio selection problem simultaneously considering five optimization objectives namely mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis , and entropy of return. An expert’s acknowledge-based fuzzy number variable, rather than a random variable , is used to model the return of a risk asset, such that a more accurate estimation of the return of a risky asset is achieved. An assistant reference point guided evolutionary algorithm (ARPGEA) is proposed to solve this five-objective portfolio problem. Assistant reference points are generated for the non-dominated solutions in all dimensions of the objective space. The generated reference points and a comprehensive fitness evaluation method are used to guide the search towards promising regions leading to well-distributed and well-converged solutions. ARPGEA is tested on publicly available data sets collected from six market indices including up to 1,203 assets. Experiment results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of ARPGEA in comparison with other five state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms.},

To address this issue, first, we modeled the problem by utilizing an integer programming method, wherein the makespan and energy consumptions during the machine process and crane transportation are optimized simultaneously. Afterward, a hybrid algorithm consisting of estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and variable neighborhood search (VNS) was proposed to solve the problem, where an identification rule of four crane conditions was designed to make fitness calculation feasible. In EDA component, the parameters in probability matrices are set to be self-adaptive for stable convergence to obtain better output. Moreover, a probability mechanism was applied to control the activity of the EDA component. In VNS component, five problem-specific neighborhood structures including global and local strategies are employed to enhance exploitation ability. The simulation tests results confirmed that the proposed hybrid EDA-VNS algorithm can solve the considered problem with high efficiency compared with other competitive algorithms, and the proposed improving strategies are verified to have significance in better performance.},

Considering energy efficiency and productivity, this problem could be treated as three sub-problems: job assignment among factories, job scheduling within each factory and deciding the amount of multi-machines upon each job.

In this paper, we tackle the reconstruction of the network topology from a set of target betweenness centrality values. This metric evaluates the participation of the vertices in the communication along the shortest paths of the network and it has been widely used as centrality measure in analyzing social networks. In this case, the network reconstruction task is formulated as an optimization problem whose search space consists of all possible subsets of edges linking a given set of vertices. It should be noted that the development of optimization algorithms for tackling combinatorial problems involving betweenness centrality is very challenging, because this measure is notoriously expensive to compute. That is why we have made two innovative design decisions (not explored previously in the literature): firstly, to address the problem by proposing an artificial bee colony algorithm , which is a potent swarm intelligence metaheuristic inspired in the foraging behavior of honeybees and secondly, to incorporate in this proposal recent betweenness centrality update techniques that substantially reduce the number of shortest paths which should be re-computed when a network is changed. Extensive experiments verify that our optimizer can achieve better solution quality than the state-of-the-art metaheuristic for this complex optimization problem and other competing algorithms.

  abstract     = {Real world optimization problems typically involve constraints that must be satisfied for a design to be viable. Such constraints could represent physical limitations on induced behavior such as stress, displacement, temperature etc., or other practical limitations such as cost, geometry, manufacturability, etc. Constraint handling is therefore an active area of research, and a number of approaches have been proposed in the literature to be used with evolutionary algorithms to solve constrained optimization problems. Most approaches assume that the objective and constraints are simultaneously evaluated, and counted together as one evaluation as far as computation budget is concerned. However, in practical applications, there could be situations where the constraints and the objective can be independently evaluated (e.g., using different analyses). Therefore, it is worthwhile exploring if one can forego evaluation of certain constraints or the objective to save computational cost without misleading the search owing to insufficient information. Towards this end, the main focus of this study is to deal with a partial evaluation paradigm. We propose a feasibility-ratio based sequencing for partial evaluation of solutions during the evolutionary search. A lexicographic ranking approach is used for ordering the partially evaluated solutions. To balance the evaluation cost and information gain near constraint boundaries, a dynamic feasibility control technique is incorporated. A number of variants are systematically constructed to demonstrate the efficacy of partial evaluation and proposed sequencing approach. An extensive numerical study is conducted to evaluate the approach on a range of constraint problems, which confirms its competence.},

  abstract     = {In multiobjective optimization , the relationship between decision space and objective space is generally assumed to be a one-to-one mapping, but it is not always the case. In some problems, different variables have the same or similar objective value, which means a many-to-one mapping. In this situation, there is more than one Pareto Set (PS) mapping to the same Pareto Front (PF) and these problems are called multimodal multiobjective problems . This paper proposes a multimodal multiobjective differential evolution algorithm to solve these problems. In the proposed method, the difference vector is generated taking the diversity in both decision and objective space into account. The way to calculate crowding distance is quite different from the others. In the crowding distance calculation process, all the selected individuals are taken into account instead of considering each Pareto rank separately. The crowding distance in decision space is replaced with the weighted sum of Euclidean distances to its neighbors. In the environmental selection process, not all the individuals in top ranks are selected, because some of them may be very crowded. Instead, the potential solutions in the bottom rank are given a chance to evolve. With these operations, the proposed algorithm can maintain multiple PSs of multimodal multiobjective optimization problems and improve the diversity in both decision and objective space. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve high comprehensive performance.},

Furthermore, in certain applications, the search environment is hostile in the sense that the agents, and/or their communication channels, could get disrupted during the search, thereby adversely impacting the search performance. Such disruptions change the communication topology of the agents and hence the information available to them, ultimately influencing the performance of the algorithm. Here, we present a study of the impact of loss of agents on performance as a function of the initial network configuration . We use particle swarm optimization to optimize an objective function with multiple sub-optimal regions in a hostile environment and study its performance for a range of network topologies with loss of agents. The results reveal interesting trade-offs between efficiency, robustness, and overall performance for different topologies that are analyzed to discover general features of networks that maximize performance.

The penalty boundary interaction (PBI) decomposition approach provides fixed selection pressures for the population, but fixed selection pressures are hard to solve feature selection problems with complicated Pareto fronts . This paper proposes a novel feature selection algorithm based on multi-objective particle swarm optimization with adaptive strategies (MOPSO-ASFS) to improve the selection pressures of the population. An adaptive penalty mechanism based on PBI parameter adjusts penalty values adaptively to enhance the selection pressures of the archive. An adaptive leading particle selection based on feature information combines the opposite mutation and the feature frequencies to improve the selection pressure of each particle. The proposed algorithm is compared with 6 related algorithms on 14 benchmark UCI datasets and 6 gene datasets. The experimental results show that MOPSO-ASFS can find optimal solutions with better convergence and diversity than comparison algorithms especially on the high dimensional datasets.},

With the development of autonomous driving technology, trucker groups will be replaced by driverless vehicles. At that point, a swarm of truckers will become a swarm robotics system . Therefore, considering the design and control of an efficient swarm robotics system , it is essential to investigate the properties and model the behaviors of a swarm of truckers in advance. In this study, we probe the characteristics of both individual truckers and a swarm of truckers using trajectory data of truckers. First, the trajectory data were map matched based on the geographic scale of cities and administrative regions. Then, the properties of the division of labor, pattern formation, and swarm synchronization were obtained through an analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of radius of gyration , travel distance, and the number of visited places. Because predicting the next visit locations of individuals of a swarm is a measure for modeling swarm behaviors, the prediction model can be used to predict future swarm robotics (driverless trucks) behaviors. Thus, we apply several machine learning models to predict the next locations of truckers. The results show that there are common characteristics and routines embodied in the behavior of the truckers; the swarm shows consistency and regularity. Moreover, the peak predictability of the entire group reached 94\%, indicating that our model can predict the behavior of groups and individuals. Our findings provide basis supporting to the future efficient swarm robotics system.},

  abstract     = {In the multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs), there may exist two or multiple equivalent Pareto optimal sets (PS) with the same Pareto Front (PF). The difficulty of solving MMOPs lies in how to locate more equivalent PS in decision space and maintain a promising balance between the diversity of Pareto optimal solutions in decision space and the convergence of Pareto optimal solutions in objective space at the same time. To address these issues, a grid search based multi-population particle swarm optimization algorithm (GSMPSO-MM) is proposed in this paper to handle MMOPs. Multi-populations based on the k-means clustering method is adopted to locate more equivalent PS in decision space, and a grid is applied to explore high-quality solutions in decision space in GSMPSO-MM. The environmental selection operator, including the removing inefficient solutions operator and the updating non-dominated solutions archive, aims to approach the true non-dominated solutions, where the updating non-dominated solution archive is responsible for developing the diverse solutions in both the decision and objective space, simultaneously. Besides, the purpose of removing inefficient solutions with inferior convergence in objective space is to maintain promising convergence solutions in objective space. GSMPSO-MM is compared with seven state-of-the-art algorithms on a well-known MMOPs benchmark function . Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithm in solving MMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal multi-objective optimization problems (MMMOPs) have multiple subsets within the Pareto-optimal Set, each independently mapping to the same Pareto-Front. Prevalent multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are not purely designed to search for multiple solution subsets, whereas, algorithms designed for MMMOPs demonstrate degraded performance in the objective space. This motivates the design of better algorithms for addressing MMMOPs. The present work identifies the crowding illusion problem originating from using crowding distance globally over the entire decision space. Subsequently, an evolutionary framework, called graph Laplacian based Optimization using Reference vector assisted Decomposition (LORD), is proposed, which uses decomposition in both objective and decision space for dealing with MMMOPs. Its filtering step is further extended to present LORD-II algorithm, which demonstrates its dynamics on multi-modal many-objective problems. The efficacies of the frameworks are established by comparing their performance on test instances from the CEC 2019 multi-modal multi-objective test suite and polygon problems with the state-of-the-art algorithms for MMMOPs and other multi- and many-objective evolutionary algorithms . The manuscript is concluded by mentioning the limitations of the proposed frameworks and future directions to design still better algorithms for MMMOPs.

  abstract     = {Cloud computing is a recently looming-evoked paradigm, the aim of which is to provide on-demand, pay-as-you-go, internet-based access to shared computing resources (hardware and software) in a metered, self-service, dynamically scalable fashion. A related hot topic at the moment is task scheduling , which is well known for delivering critical cloud service performance. However, the dilemmas of resources being underutilized (underloaded) and overutilized (overloaded) may arise as a result of improper scheduling, which in turn leads to either wastage of cloud resources or degradation in service performance, respectively. Thus, the idea of incorporating meta-heuristic algorithms into task scheduling emerged in order to efficiently distribute complex and diverse incoming tasks (cloudlets) across available limited resources, within a reasonable time. Meta-heuristic techniques have proven very capable of solving scheduling problems, which is fulfilled herein from a cloud perspective by first providing a brief on traditional and heuristic scheduling methods before diving deeply into the most popular meta-heuristics for cloud task scheduling followed by a detailed systematic review featuring a novel taxonomy of those techniques, along with their advantages and limitations. More specifically, in this study, the basic concepts of cloud task scheduling are addressed smoothly, as well as diverse swarm , evolutionary, physical, emerging, and hybrid meta-heuristic scheduling techniques are categorized as per the nature of the scheduling problem (i.e., single- or multi-objective), the primary objective of scheduling, task-resource mapping scheme, and scheduling constraint. Armed with these methods, some of the most recent relevant literature are surveyed, and insights into the identification of existing challenges are presented, along with a trail to potential solutions. Furthermore, guidelines to future research directions drawn from recently emerging trends are outlined, which should definitely contribute to assisting current researchers and practitioners as well as pave the way for newbies excited about cloud task scheduling to pursue their own glory in the field.},

  abstract     = {Data science becomes an emerging topic in developing computational and artificial intelligence techniques due to the rapid growth of information and data over past decade. Data-driven evaluation, through scanning data to validate the performance of a method, is the crux of effectively retrieving information. Ordinarily, the computational cost at data-driven evaluation is proportional to the volume, determined by the number of instances and the number of attributes, of the data. One straightforward way of reducing the volume of data is instance selection. Past studies have adopted evolutionary algorithm (EA) for instance selection, yet these studies are mainly based on k k nearest neighbors classifier due to the high computational cost at learning process. Leveraging EA to learn patterns, models, or classifiers forms a famous branch of learning method known as evolutionary learning (EL). Nevertheless, EL requires immense amount of data-driven fitness evaluations, which detracts EL from efficiency and causes slow convergence. The issue of high computational cost at data-driven evaluation restricts the capability of evolutionary learning and evolutionary instance selection. This study proposes a novel framework called cooperative evolutionary learning and instance selection (CELIS) for addressing the above issues. There are three main features in the proposed CELIS: 1) cooperative evolutionary learning and instance selection in an adaptive manner, 2) fast solution evaluation based on the selected subset of data for evolutionary learning, and 3) effective data evaluation of representativeness as per promising solution for evolutionary instance selection. This study conducts a series of experiments for testing the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CELIS on data mining , classification, and symbolic regression problems . The results show that the proposed method can significantly enhance the performance of state-of-the-art EAs on the three types of problems in terms of solution quality and convergence speed. Further analysis also validates that CELIS is able to gain a small and representative subset of data.},

The proposed algorithm consists of three mechanisms. First, we set up a modular neural network (MNN) and train it with historical population information. Some of the initial solutions are generated by the MNN when an environmental change is detected. Second, some solutions are predicted based on forward-looking center points. Finally, some solutions are generated randomly to maintain the diversity. With these mechanisms, when the new environment has been encountered before, initial solutions generated by MNN will have the same distribution characteristics as the final solutions that were obtained in the same environment last time. Because the initialization mechanism based on the MNN does not need the solutions in recent time, the proposed algorithm can also solve dynamic multi-objective optimization problems with a dramatically and irregularly changing Pareto set . The proposed algorithm is tested on a variety of test instances with different dynamic characteristics and difficulties. The comparisons of experimental results with other state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is promising for dealing with dynamic multi-objective optimization.},

To address these two challenges, an optima-identified framework (OIF) combined with brain storm optimization (BSO) algorithm is proposed in this paper, which can identify global optimal solutions found during the search process, and maintain these optima until the end of the run. First, a max-fitness clustering method (MCM) is applied to form different clusters and each cluster center is likely to become an extreme point. Then, a modified disruption strategy (MDS) is devised to distinguish and identify potential optima among these cluster centers. Finally, we introduce two kinds of redistribution strategies (RS) to make the most of the individuals in those clusters whose cluster centers have been identified as global optima. We validate the effectiveness of the OIF and compare the proposed OIF-BSO algorithm with other state-of-the-art multimodal optimization algorithms. The results indicate that our framework is feasible to maintain and utilize cluster centers over the course of search, and the proposed algorithm can outperform other algorithms.},

The stigmergic approach integrates the historical experience, while the probabilistic representation and the diversity preserving operators avoid premature convergence. The resulting Stigmergic Real-domain TLBO (S R TLBO) is applied to optimization problems with continuous variables. The proposed S R TLBO is evaluated on 40 standard benchmark functions , as well as in modeling the earthquake source and wave propagation in the East of Iran from actual data. Results indicate overall improved solutions of the S R TLBO algorithm when compared to several competing algorithms. In several cases, particularly those functions with a simpler structure, considerable improvement is also observed in the rate of convergence to the optimum solution.},

Currently, state-of-the-art comparison approaches involve user-preference-based selection of a single quality indicator or an ensemble of quality indicators as a comparison metric. Using these quality indicators, high-dimensional data is transformed into one-dimensional data. By doing this, information contained in the high-dimensional space can be lost, which will affect the results of the comparison. To avoid losing this information, we propose a novel ranking scheme that compares the distributions of high-dimensional data. Experimental results show that the proposed approach reduces potential information loss when statistical significance is not observed in high-dimensional data. Consequently, the selection of a quality indicator is required only in cases when statistical significance is observed in high-dimensional data. With this the cases that are affected by the user preference selection are reduced.},

In recent years, the full alternating current (AC) network model has been proposed to formulate the TNEP problem. Due to its complexity, more robust and efficient optimization techniques to solve the AC formulation are required. This paper proposes a new effcient hybrid metaheuristic technique to solve the TNEP problem. Additionally, it presents a comprehensive comparative study including different powerful conventional, emerging and hybrid optimization metaheuristics techniques applied to solve the static, long-term TNEP problem, using the AC model, considering both operating and reactive power compensation costs.

In the past decade, a family of non-revisiting stochastic search (NrSS) methods has been developed. Using the entire (or partial) search history to assist evolutionary computation can achieve not only the goal of duplicated solution prevention, but also other utilizations such as adaptive parameter-less local search and fitness landscape estimation. In this survey, the focus is on the memory-assisted stochastic search techniques that store the search history in a binary space partitioning (BSP) tree. First, the basic NrGA is reviewed. Then, the development of the family of NrSS is reviewed from three aspects: 1) the basic NrSS algorithms, 2) conceptual extension of non-revisit and usage of the search history as novel operators and estimators, and 3) application of NrSS to different problem types, such as multi-objective problems, dynamic problems , and multi-modal problems. A comprehensive classification of search history-assisted algorithms suggests that the cumulative historical search information can be developed in a more functional manner; for example, a BSP tree can be simultaneously used for revisit prevention, fitness landscape estimation, and adaptive operation. Both the application on real-world problems and the theoretical analysis of NrSS are reviewed. Possible future work suggestions include a deeper understanding of the non-revisiting scheme in theory, a more comprehensive functional usage of search history, and a closer cooperation with data-driven techniques.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been concerned and studied with great achievements in the last two decades. As a typical decomposition-based MOEA, MOEA/D aims to decompose a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) into several subproblems through a set of predefined weight vectors and then optimizes these problems simultaneously. However, performance degradation occurs when complex optimization problems with complicated Pareto Front shape (i.e., irregular and discontinuous PF) are handled. This paper proposes a decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with weight vector adaptation (WVA-MOEA/D) to adjust the weight vectors uniformly distribute in the solution space. The algorithm decomposes a MOP into several subproblems , the new environment selection mechanism defines several neighborhoods with weight vectors as the center of the circle, and elite solutions are selected based on the density of each neighborhood. Weight vector adaptation is employed to guide solution selection and obtain a set of uniformly distributed solutions. The proposed WVA-MOEA/D can improve the performance of MOEA/D on MOPs and many-objective problems with irregular PFs. Besides, the neighborhood adaptation strategy used in the algorithm aims to maintain the diversity solutions and decrease the selection pressure in many-objective optimization problems. Experimental results indicate that WVA-MOEA/D could further effectively solve MOPs with various types of Pareto Fronts for multi-objective and many-objective optimization compared with several state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms.},

In order to achieve this balance, it is necessary to improve its diversity capability. This article presents the studies that were carried out to strengthen the diversity and balanced search capabilities of the SFS algorithm. For this purpose, the diversity operator of the SFS algorithm was designed with a novel method called Fitness-Distance Balance (FDB), which more effectively mimics the way fractals occur in nature. Thus, the FDBSFS algorithm, which has a much stronger search performance, was developed. Comprehensive experimental studies were conducted to test and validate the developed FDB-based SFS algorithm (FDBSFS). Thirty-nine novel and powerful MHS algorithms, eighty-nine unconstrained test functions and five constrained engineering problems were used. Two nonparametric tests , the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the Friedman test , were used to analyze the results obtained from the experimental studies. The results of the analysis showed that the problem of premature convergence had been largely eliminated by the application of the FDB method and that the exploitation-exploration balance was also effectively provided. Moreover, the proposed FDBSFS algorithm ranked first among the thirty-nine competing algorithms.},

Three integrated strategies are designed to implement information interaction between the two stages. Different instances are constructed to verify the validity of the proposed methods. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed optimization method can effectively solve GMOIPPS problem. The proposed method has also been applied on a real-world case from a battery packaging machinery workshop in China. The results show that the proposed method can handle real-world cases effectively.},

  abstract     = {The PSO convergence analysis is mainly based on the constant attractor, however, the attractor of PSO algorithm in the evolutionary process is time-varying point. So, the objective of this study is to mainly discuss the random convergence analysis of the standard and improved particle swarm optimization with the time-varying attractor. Its mathematical PSO model with the time-varying attractor is provided to calculate the convergence condition and the corresponding convergence speed. Specifically speaking, spectral radii of the random transfer matrix and the product of two adjacency random transfer matrices are calculated to determine the convergence or the divergence, together with the corresponding convergence speed. Additionally, it also calculates the mean and variance of the first and second order particle swarm optimization system with time-varying attractor. Numerical results highlight that the spectral analysis on some benchmark optimization functions is described to show the effectiveness of the obtained results, while the corresponding analysis is closely related to the objective fitness, the convergence speed, the time-varying attractor, the spectral radius of M ( t ) M(t) and M ( t + 1 ) M ( t ) , M(t+1)M(t), and swarm convergence behavior in the evolutionary process.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new accurate Micro Genetic Algorithm ( μ μ GA) for multi-objective optimization problems that we call Micro-FAME (or μ μ FAME). The distinctive feature of μ μ FAME with respect to the other existing multi-objective algorithms in the literature is its high elitism and fast convergence, produced by the application of the evolution directly on the Pareto front approximation . This means that it has a bounded population of variable size, determined by the number of non-dominated solutions found so far. In μ μ FAME (and generally in μ μ GAs) the premature convergence problem acquires especial relevance, and generating and maintaining solutions diversity is of extreme importance to deal with it. This is especially significant in the multi-objective field, where the algorithm looks for a wide and diverse set of non-dominated solutions. In μ μ FAME, the diversity loss that high elitism usually produces is overcome by the decisions driven by the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), that chooses the most appropriate operators to apply during the evolution to promote both diversity and accuracy of solutions. The algorithm arises as a suitable solution for problems with a computationally heavy fitness function, because it is able to quickly achieve good quality local optimal solutions , but it is also highly competitive in long runs. Experiments reveal a great performance of μ μ FAME according to several convergence related metrics, when comparing against seven state-of-the-art algorithms on a large set of benchmark problems, as well as on a real-world engineering one with an expensive fitness function.},

The honeybee search algorithm combines concepts from the areas of evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence to solve optimization problems . This algorithm is mainly based on the foraging behavior of honeybees and the search power of evolution strategies, a type of evolutionary algorithm used for real-valued problems. This paper shows the integration between an automaton and the honeybee search algorithm to formalize the algorithm mathematically. The combination mentioned above is tested here with the innovative applications of three-dimensional scene reconstruction and video tracking. The experimental results for both applications show evidence that the honeybee search algorithm can be used to improve time costs in challenging computer vision tasks through controlled experiments and objective comparisons.

  abstract     = {Differential evolution (DE) is a simple and efficient global optimization algorithm . Benefitting from its concise structure and strong search ability, DE has been widely used in various fields. Generally, the convergence performance of DE largely depends on its mutation operation. Meanwhile, individuals’ positions, which are selected as base vectors or making up difference vectors, are very important in mutation strategy. In this paper, we propose a differential evolution algorithm with both fitness and diversity ranking-based mutation operator (FDDE). Different from methods that use fitness as the only index to measure the quality of individuals, FDDE aims to assign suitable position for each individual in the mutation strategy by together considering both individuals’ fitness and their diversity contribution. Firstly, a new method of estimating the individual diversity by fitness values has been proposed. Then, each individual&#39;s fitness ranking and diversity contribution are considered together to calculate a newly defined individual&#39;s final ranking. Finally, the final ranking are used in the mutation strategy. The newly improved mutation operator could be integrated with any classical or advanced DE variants with little additional time or space complexity. The proposed FDDE is compared with some DE variants based on numerical experiments over the CEC (Congress on Evolutionary Computation) 2005 benchmark sets, CEC 2013 benchmark sets and CEC 2014 benchmark sets. Experimental results clearly indicate that FDDE performs better on most test functions and improves the convergence performance of its competitors of jDE, rank-jDE, advanced SHADE, rank-SHADE and L -SHADE in both low and high dimensional problems.},

Specifically, it consists of two interdependent parts, i.e., a clustering-based reproduction operator and a utility dependent exploitation probability . At each evolutionary cycle , in accordance with the manifold structure of the Pareto optimal set, the reproduction operator employs Gaussian mixture clustering to establish the mating pool for each solution, where the parent candidates of each solution are paired to generate offsprings from the same cluster for exploitation or from its extended set for exploration in terms of the exploitation probability . Thereafter, the exploitation probability is updated adaptively leaned on the utility of reproduction operator, it is evaluated from proximity or diversity at different evolutionary stage. Moreover, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with AGS, named MEAGS, is proposed and compared with four state-of-the-art algorithms on several benchmarks.

  abstract     = {Many optimization problems in reality involve both continuous and discrete decision variables, and these problems are called mixed-variable optimization problems (MVOPs). The mixed decision variables of MVOPs increase the complexity of search space and make them difficult to be solved. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is easy to implement due to its simple framework and high speed of convergence , and has been successfully applied to many difficult optimization problems. Many existing PSO variants have been proposed to solve continuous or discrete optimization problems, which make it feasible and promising for solving MVOPs. In this paper, a new PSO algorithm for solving MVOPs is proposed, namely P S O m v , PSOmv, which can deal with both continuous and discrete decision variables simultaneously. To efficiently handle mixed variables, the P S O m v PSOmv employs a mixed-variable encoding scheme. Based on the mixed-variable encoding scheme, two reproduction methods respectively for continuous variables and discrete variables are proposed. Furthermore, an adaptive parameter tuning strategy is employed and a constraints handling method is utilized to improve the overall efficiency of the P S O m v PSOmv .The experimental results on 28 artificial MVOPs and two practical MVOPs demonstrate that the proposed P S O m v PSOmv is a competitive algorithm for MVOPs.},

Additionally, simulated annealing is embedded into each LLH to improve the local search ability.

In this paper we study a multi-objective artificial bee colony approach for the band selection problem of hyperspectral images. Firstly, a new multi-objective unsupervised band selection model is proposed by using both band correlation and information amount. Secondly, a multi-strategy integrated multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm (MABC-BS) is proposed to deal with the band selection model above. Several new operators, including the multi-direction search strategy, the x-space crowing degree-based search strategy, and the adaptive mutation, are developed to enhance the proposed algorithm.

However, distributed manufacturing with the non-identical factory is rarely researched. Meanwhile, scheduling can affect the sustainability of manufacturing. Thus, this paper is the first attempt to investigate a sustainable distributed permutation flow-shop scheduling problem with a non-identical factory (DPFSP-NF). We formulate a novel mathematical model of this DPFSP-NF with objectives of minimizing makespan, negative social impact ( NSI ), and total energy consumption ( TEC ). A knowledge-based multi-objective memetic optimization algorithm (KMMOA) is presented to address this DPFSP-NF. First, a new energy conservation strategy is designed and embedded in the model to reduce TEC criterion. Second, a cooperative initialization mechanism is presented to yield initial solutions with good diversity and convergence. Third, several properties of DPFSP-NF are investigated and utilized to develop the knowledge-based local search operator. The impact of parameter configuration on KMMOA is studied by the Taguchi method . Finally, we compare KMMOA to its variants and other well-known multi-objective optimization algorithms by performing a number of experiments. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of each improvement component of the KMMOA, and verify that KMMOA is an effective approach to deal with the DPFSP-NF.},

This paper proposes a novel Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) mathematical model for Green Inventory-Routing Problem with Time Windows (GIRP-TW) using a piecewise linearization method . The objective is to minimize the total cost including fuel consumption cost, driver cost, inventory cost and usage cost of vehicles taking into account factors such as the volume of vehicle load, vehicle speed and road slope. To solve the problem, three meta-heuristic algorithms are designed including the original and augmented Tabu Search (TS) algorithms and Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. In these algorithms, three heuristic methods of improved Clarke-Wright algorithm, improved Push-Forward Insertion Heuristic (PFIH) algorithm and heuristic speed optimization algorithm are also applied to deal with the routing structure of the problem. The performance of the proposed solution techniques is analyzed using some well-known test problems and algorithms in the literature. Furthermore, a statistical test is conducted to efficiently provide the required comparisons for large-sized problems. The obtained results demonstrate that the augmented TS algorithm is the best method to yield high-quality solutions.

  abstract     = {Selection in evolutionary algorithms (EAs) selects promising solutions from a set of candidates. Most selection strategies are fitness-driven, where each solution is selected based on its fitness value. This fitness-based strategy leads to a waste of fitness evaluations, since some unpromising solutions are thrown away without providing valuable search information while still being evaluated. Our intention is to reduce the number of fitness evaluations during the selection procedure. We treat selection as a one-class classification procedure so that the offspring solutions similar to the current population, which has the best solutions up to that point, are more likely to be selected. We use the classifier to predict the categories of newly generated solutions. Only those predicted ‘promising’ solutions can be selected for evaluation purposes. The efficiency of EAs can be greatly improved, since the procedure is based on the decision variables (features) before the fitness evaluations. Based on this consideration, we propose a One-class Classification-assisted Selection (OCAS) strategy for EAs. We apply the OCAS strategy to two EAs and study them on three test suites. Our experimental results reveal that the number of fitness evaluations can be clearly decreased by OCAS.},

This is especially true for large-scale optimization problems where typically a large amount of data is needed for constructing reliable surrogate models . To overcome the data deficiency, semi-supervised learning is introduced to the offline data-driven evolutionary optimization process, where tri-training, a co-training variant, is used to update surrogate models . In the proposed algorithm, a tri-training algorithm selects candidate solutions with high-confidence fitness prediction to enrich the training data for surrogate models. The results on benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm, compared with three most recent offline data-driven optimization algorithms , is competitive on the problems of up to 500 decision variables.},

  abstract     = {When solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems by evolutionary algorithm , the key challenge is how to achieve the balance among convergence, diversity, and feasibility. To deal with this challenge, a purpose-directed two-phase multiobjective differential evolution (PDTP-MDE) algorithm is developed in this paper. The main idea of PDTP-MDE is that the whole evolution process is divided into two sequential phases according to the expected purpose of each stage. To be specific, the first phase aims at keeping the balance between convergence and diversity, while the feasibility is taken as an auxiliary indicator. In this way, the population is capable of exploring different potential areas and avoiding to be trapped into local ones, thus providing more information about convergence and diversity for the later evolution process. Afterwards, the second phase mainly tends to maintain feasibility and diversity by selecting and using some promising infeasible solutions according to the population evolution status. In addition, an archive is maintained after each phase to preserve the superior feasible Pareto solutions found so far. By the above processes, the feasible Pareto front with well convergence and well diversity is obtained. The comprehensive experiments on 42 benchmark problems from three test suites demonstrate the superiority and competitiveness of the proposed PDTP-MDE, in comparison with other state-of-the-art constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.},

Traditionally, this computation has been addressed by means of the design of algorithms that find, by a clever exhaustive search , a linear combination of some generating matrix rows that provides a codeword with minimum weight. Therefore, as the dimension of the code or the size of the underlying finite field increase, so it does exponentially the run time. In this work, we prove that, given a generating matrix, there exists a column permutation which leads to a reduced row echelon form containing a row whose weight is the code distance. This result enables the use of permutations as representation scheme, in contrast to the usual discrete representation, which makes the search of the optimum polynomial time dependent from the base field. In particular, we have implemented genetic and CHC algorithms using this representation as a proof of concept . Experimental results have been carried out employing codes over fields with two and eight elements, which suggests that evolutionary algorithms with our proposed permutation encoding are competitive with regard to existing methods in the literature. As a by-product, we have found and amended some inaccuracies in the Magma Computational Algebra System concerning the stored distances of some linear codes.},

GGA is an extension to the traditional Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a representation scheme based on groups and variation operators adapted to work at the groups level. Since its emergence, GGA has been used to address several grouping problems with distinct traits. Therefore, at present, there are different variation operators developed to solve problems with diverse grouping constraints and conditions. This paper presents a review of variation operators included in GGAs solving NP-hard grouping problems. Three classifications are introduced, organizing the variation operators according to the variation-degree, the solutions encoding, and the parameter setting-level, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In terms of generating offspring solutions, simulated binary crossover (SBX) and differential evolution (DE) are two of the most representative reproduction operators in evolutionary multi-objective algorithms (EMOAs). However, they are found as less effective on multi-objective problems (MOPs) with complicated Pareto optimal set (PS). Under mild conditions, the PS of an MOP is an ( m − 1 ) (m−1) -dimensional piecewise continuous manifolds where m m is the number of objectives. Inspired from this regularity property , this study proposes a simple yet effective reproduction operator, namely, PCA-assisted reproduction (PCA-ar). Specifically, the PCA-ar first applies principal component analysis (PCA) method to construct a new decision space with reduced number of dimensions based on the information extracted from several well converged solutions. The PS is then estimated by a hyperplane in the new decision space. To this end, new offspring are sampled from the estimated PS, and then re-converted to the original decision space for fitness calculation. In order to systematically examine the effectiveness of the PCA-ar operator, we integrate it into NSGA-II and MOEA/D, and compare the derived algorithms, nNSGA-II and nMOEA/D, with their original versions (NSGA-II with SBX operator and MOEA/D with DE operator) as well as the regularity model based multi-objective estimated distribution algorithm (RM-MEDA) on the modified DTLZ benchmarks with up to 8 objectives. Experimental results show that nNSGA-II and nMOEA/D outperform the competitor EMOAs for most of problems, which indicate that the PCA-ar is effective. Lastly, the PCA-ar is also demonstrated to have good scalability to the number of decision variables.},

MCA is utilized as a new operator of GWO to improve its exploitation capability in addressing constraint satisfaction problems , particularly scheduling problems. GWO is one of the most efficient metaheuristic algorithms which mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. PSPSH is a problem of scheduling smart home appliances in accordance with a dynamic pricing scheme(s) to flatten users’ power consumption . PSPSH’s objectives are to reduce electricity bills, improve user comfort, and maintain power systems’ performance. PSPSH is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem to achieve all objectives simultaneously. GWO-MCA is tested by using up to 36 appliance operations for 7 days. To show the effect of MCA on the convergence behavior of optimization problems, MCA is utilized as a new operator on other five popular optimization methods: genetic algorithm , particle swarm optimization , wind-driven optimization, antlion optimizer, and enhanced differential evolution. Interestingly, MCA shows a high impact on the performance of such algorithms. In addition, GWO-MCA achieves a better schedule than all compared MCA-Based methods in tackling PSPSH. In addition, the results of GWO-MCA are compared with those of three state-of-the-art hybrid methods to verify the GWO-MCA performance. The GWO-MCA excels the other comparative methods in almost all datasets used. Besides, the GWO-MCA method is compared with 20 state-of-the-art methods using their datasets.

  abstract     = {Most of existing image segmentation algorithms are only based on the color feature . However, the spatial distribution of an image can not be well described by using the color feature alone. Thus, it is necessary to add additional features to design efficient segmentation algorithms . Although many researchers also try to use multiple features for image segmentation , it is extremely difficult to combine multiple features automatically. This paper proposes a multiojective multiple features fusion strategy for image segmentation. The basic idea is to convert the segmentation problem into a multiobjective optimization problem , in which each objective considers one feature. It contains three steps. First, the original image is split into a set of over-segmented regions by using Meanshift to preserve the spatial details and to simplify the segmentation problem. Second, both the color and texture features are extracted to describe the regions. And two similarity matrices are designed by computing the similarity between each pair of regions in two features respectively. Third, a multiobjective evolutionary clustering algorithm is applied to merge these over-segmented regions. In this stage, two objective functions are designed based on the color and texture features respectively. A region index encoding scheme is introduced to design the individual, which contains some cluster representative regions. Some evolutionary operators are proposed to generate the new population. In the final generation, the best solution is selected from nondominated solutions for subsequent segmentation. Experiment results show that the proposed method provides promising segmentation results in combining the color and texture features.},

Then, two criteria, one (called the Pareto criterion) emphasizing convergence and the other (called the crowding criterion) focusing on diversity, are collaboratively used to assist the selection of a suitable DE operator for the current solution, which aims to obtain a good balance between exploitation and exploration during the evolutionary search of each solution. Specifically, the Pareto criterion is used to decide whether exploration or exploitation is preferred for the current solution, which will help to select an operator pool. After that, from the selected operator pool, the crowding criterion is used to further assist the selection of the DE operator based on a binary tournament strategy. The experimental results show that our proposed B-AOS performs better than other existing state-of-the-art adaptive operator selection methods, and several MOEA/Ds embedded with B-AOS can significantly improve their performance on most of the benchmark problems adopted.},

  abstract     = {As a form of evolutionary computation, particle swarm optimization is less effective in large scale optimization since it is unable to effectively balance exploration and exploitation. To address this problem, first, a learning structure decoupling exploration and exploitation is proposed. This helps simultaneously and independently managing exploration and exploitation in different components. Second, following the proposed learning structure, two novel learning strategies are developed. On the one hand, a local sparseness degree measurement in fitness landscape is proposed to estimate the congestion and distribution of particles, based on which an exploration strategy is built by guiding particles to sparse areas. On the other hand, an adaptive exploitation strategy is developed which can effectively adjust the fitness differences between exemplars and updated particles during the optimization process by employing a multi-swarm strategy and an adaptive sub-swarm size adjustment. Finally, by embedding the two learning strategies into the proposed learning structure, an adaptive particle swarm optimizer with decoupled exploration and exploitation is proposed. Thanks to the novel balancing strategy of exploration and exploitation, the two functions in the proposed algorithm can be independently and simultaneously managed. Furthermore, theoretical analyses are put forward to prove the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Comprehensive experiments are conducted based on the large scale optimization benchmarks from CEC 2010 and CEC 2013 and six state-of-the-art large scale optimization evolutionary algorithms , the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed learning strategies and the competitive performance of the proposed algorithm.},

In this paper, a novel SAEA with an uncertainty grouping based infill criterion, called SAEA-UGC, is proposed, in which the uncertainty is treated as an indicator to select solutions for training the models. The selected solutions are adopted to train an ensemble surrogate model and a radial basis function model, which run the global search and local search respectively. After obtaining the predicted value and uncertainty for all solutions in global search, they are evenly grouped according to uncertainty and a best predicted solution from each group is selected to form a new population. The global search and local search are cooperative to find the optimal value for the target EOP, i.e., global search or local search will continually run if an improved value for the target EOP can be found in each iteration; otherwise, the switch between global search and local search will happen. The performance of SAEA-UGC is validated when tacking 20 widely used test problems with various properties. The experimental results confirm the superiority of SAEA-UGC over four representative SAEAs in solving a majority of test EOPs.},

  abstract     = {Many multi-objective optimization problems in reality are dynamic, requiring the optimization algorithm to quickly track the moving optima after the environment changes. Therefore, response strategies are often used in dynamic multi-objective algorithms to find Pareto optimal . In this paper, we propose a hybrid prediction strategy based on the classification of decision variables, which consists of three steps. After detecting the environment change, the first step is to analyze the influence of each decision variable on individual convergence and distribution in the new environment. The second step is to adopt different prediction methods for different decision variables. Finally, adaptive selection is applied to the solution set generated in the first and second steps, and solutions with good convergence and diversity are selected to make the initial population more adaptable to the new environment. The prediction strategy can help the solution set converge while maintaining its diversity. The experimental results and performance show that the proposed algorithm is capable of significantly improving the dynamic optimization performance compared with five state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms .},

Firstly, a matrix cube is designed to learn the valuable information from elites. Secondly, a matrix-cube-based probabilistic model with an effective sampling mechanism is developed to estimate the probability distribution of superior solutions and to perform the global exploration for finding promising regions. Thirdly, a problem-dependent variable neighborhood descent method is proposed to perform the local exploitation around these promising regions, and several speedup strategies for evaluating neighboring solutions are utilized to enhance the computational efficiency. Furthermore, the influence of the parameters setting is analyzed by using design-of-experiment technique, and the suitable parameters are suggested for different scale problems. Finally, a comprehensive computational campaign against the state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature, together with statistical analyses, demonstrates that the proposed MCEDA produces better results than the existing algorithms by a significant margin.

  abstract     = {For many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs), the proportion of non-dominated solutions in a population scales up sharply with the increase in the number of objectives. Besides, for an MaOP with a fixed number of objectives, the proportion of non-dominated solutions may also grow to a high level with the progressing of the evolutionary process, sometimes even reaching 100\%. Thus, a great challenge has been posed to traditional Pareto-dominance-based many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs). To address this issue, a new fractional dominance relation is proposed to distinguish non-dominated solutions for strengthening convergence. To be special, the number of objectives on which one solution is better than the other one is considered in the fractional dominance relationship. At the same time, the objective space decomposition approach is improved with a subspace selection mechanism to maintain the population diversity. Then, two new MaOEAs referred to as FDEA-I and FDEA-II are proposed on the basis of fractional dominance relation and the improved objective space decomposition strategy. The two algorithms first use fractional dominance relation to retain some solutions with promising performance, and then the improved objective space decomposition strategy is used to maintain diversity for the obtained population. Finally, to evaluate the performance of FDEA-I and FDEA-II, extensive experiments are conducted to compare them with six state-of-the-art MaOEAs on 72 many-objective benchmark instances taken from WFG and MaF test suites. The results show that FDEA-I and FDEA-II perform significantly better than the six comparative algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms have shown their promise in addressing multiobjective problems (MOPs). However, the Pareto dominance used in multiobjective optimization loses its effectiveness when addressing many-objective problems (MaOPs), which are defined as having more than three objectives. This is because the Pareto dominance loses its ability to distinguish between individuals. In this paper, a many-objective evolutionary algorithm based on rotation and decomposition is proposed (MaOEA-RD) to overcome the shortcoming of insufficient selection pressure caused by the Pareto dominance. First, the coordinates system is rotated and a hyperplane is established to distinguish between the nondominated individuals. Then, a novel individual selection mechanism incorporating decomposition is adopted to maintain the diversity of the population. In order to compensate for the deficiency of the predefined reference vectors, a reference vector adjustment mechanism is proposed. Experimental studies on several well-known benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm is competitive compared with nine state-of-the-art many-objective algorithms.},

Several researches are therefore documented to extend the node&#39;s survival time. While cluster-based routing has contributed significantly to address this issue, there is still room for improvement in the choice of the cluster head (CH) by integrating critical parameters. Furthermore, primarily the focus had been on either the selection of CH or the data transmission among the nodes. The meta-heuristic methods are the promising approach to acquire the optimal network performance. In this paper, the ‘CH selection’ and ‘sink mobility-based data transmission’, both are optimized through a hybrid approach that consider the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm respectively for each task. The robust behavior of GA helps in the optimized the CH selection, whereas, PSO helps in finding the optimized route for sink mobility. It is observed through the simulation analysis and results statistics that the proposed GAPSO-H (GA and PSO based hybrid) method outperform the state-of-art algorithms at various levels of performance metrics.},

In addition, the novel reference vectors generating method of MOEA/D-HP makes the final solutions no longer uniformly distributed in the ROI, instead the closer to the preference point, the denser the obtained solution.

Some heuristic methods , such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) have achieved great success, however, with the increase of feature quantity, the solution space is too large, resulting in lower search efficiency. Recent discretization-based FS methods map the search of feature domain into cut-point domain, which shrinks the solution space and improve the performances significantly. In this paper, considering the conflicts between different objectives, we proposed an evolutionary multi-objective optimization framework for discretization-based FS. To obtain the Pareto solutions , a flexible cut-point PSO (FCPSO) which can select an arbitrary number of cut-points for discretization is introduced to help better explore the relevant features. In FCPSO, a particle update and a novel adaptive mutation operator are alternatively used to effectively find the relevant features and remove the redundant features. At last, to select the best feature subset, a Pareto ensemble method is designed to generate a number of feasible solutions based on Pareto set followed by a hierarchical solution selection process. We implemented the proposed framework by using three representative multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and compared them with some state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on ten benchmark microarray gene datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms other methods in terms of test classification accuracy with a competitive size of feature subset.},

However, these mutation operators usually treat different decision variables without distinction and rarely consider the searching direction, which may easily lead to low search efficiency of the algorithms. To address this issue, a variable classification and elite individual based mutation strategy, namely VCEM, is proposed. It first divides decision variables into two categories, i.e., the convergence-related variables and the diversity-related variables. Then, for each generation, an elite individual with the best convergence and a set of elite individuals with good diversity are selected. The convergence-related variables and diversity related-variables of these two types of elite individuals are used to guide the mutation, respectively. The proposed mutation strategy is applied to develop a new algorithm, which is then compared with seven state-of-the-art MaOEAs on a number of benchmark problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more competitive than the compared algorithms. Moreover, VCEM is applied to four different algorithms to compare with the original algorithms, and it is also compared with five mutation operators based on a classical MaOEA. The results further verify the effectiveness and generality of VCEM.},

OBL is a machine learning concept to accelerate the convergence of soft computing algorithms, which consists of simultaneously calculating an original solution and its opposite. Recently, a stochastic OBL variant called BetaCOBL was proposed, which is capable of controlling the degree of opposite solutions, preserving useful information held by original solutions, and preventing the waste of fitness evaluations. While it has shown outstanding performance compared to several state-of-the-art OBL variants, the high computational cost of BetaCOBL may hinder it from cost-sensitive optimization problems . Also, as it assumes that the decision variables of a given problem are independent, BetaCOBL may be ineffective for optimizing inseparable problems. In this paper, we propose an improved BetaCOBL that mitigates all the limitations. The proposed algorithm called iBetaCOBL reduces the computational cost from O ( NP 2 · D ) to O ( NP · D ) ( NP and D stand for population size and a dimension, respectively) using a linear time diversity measure. Also, the proposed algorithm preserves strongly dependent variables that are adjacent to each other using multiple exponential crossover. We used differential evolution (DE) variants to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results of the performance evaluations on a set of 58 test functions show the excellent performance of iBetaCOBL compared to ten state-of-the-art OBL variants, including BetaCOBL.},

In this paper, a bi-objective vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (BO-VRPSD) was investigated, which aims to minimize total cost and customer dissatisfaction. Different from traditional vehicle routing problem (VRP) models, both the uncertainty in customer demands and the nature of multiple objectives make the problem more challenging. To cope with BO-VRPSD, a membrane-inspired multi-objective algorithm (MIMOA) was proposed, which is characterized by a parallel distributed framework with two operation subsystems and one control subsystem, respectively. In particular, the operation subsystems leverage a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with clustering strategy to reduce the chance of inferior solutions. Meanwhile, the control subsystem exploits a guiding strategy as the communication rule to adjust the searching directions of the operation subsystems. Experimental results based on the ten 120-node instances with real geographic locations in Beijing show that, MIMOA is more superior in solving BO-VRPSD to other classical multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) is a recently proposed meta-heuristic optimization method and demonstrates outstanding performance for solving numerous sciences and engineering problems. However, many studies have shown that TLBO has a strong bias towards converging to origin and poorly performs in the problems with shifted solutions. To conquer this problem, a novel self-adaptive hybrid self-learning based TLBO (SHSLTLBO) is proposed in this paper. By constructing a self-adaptive framework, the original TLBO is fused with the Gaussian distribution , and the novel updating law switches in two modes corresponding to the fitness during the searching process. Additionally, in order to avoid local convergence in the initialization, a self-learning phase is introduced, associated to the original teaching and learning phase. The performance of the proposed SHSLTLBO is tested in the numerical benchmark functions , where the comprehensive comparison carries out with the state-of-the-art TLBO variants and other meta-heuristic approaches. The results demonstrate superior advantages of the proposed algorithm at balancing along the evolutionary stages among the TLBO variants . In the experiments, the two well-performed meta-heuristic optimization methods, namely LSHADE and HCLPSO, are used as the comparative methods to SHSLTLBO, where their superior performances of them are shown on the shifted problems. With increasing dimensionality, the performance of TLBO goes down rapidly while LSHADE&#39;s relative ranking improves. Apart from these scenarios, the comparative results of different dimensional problems indicate that the proposed SHSLTLBO has the best convergence and stability in solving all 28 benchmarks with low dimension and shifted solutions.},

  abstract     = {Many practical productions are full of significant uncertainties. For example, the working environment may change, machines may breakdown, workers may become unstable, etc. In such an environment, job processing times should not be fixed numbers. In light of this situation, we investigate a single-machine problem with two-scenario-based processing times, where the goal is to minimize the maximum total completion times over two scenarios. When the uncertainty of the job processing times is confronted, the robust version of this problem is NP-hard, even for very restricted cases. To solve this problem, we derive some dominance rules and a lower bound for developing branch-and-bound algorithms to find optimal solutions. As for determining approximate solutions, we propose five heuristics, adopting combined two-scenario-based dependent processing times, to produce initial solutions and then improve each with a pairwise interchange. Further, we propose a simulated annealing hyper-heuristic incorporating the proposed seven low level heuristics to solve this problem as well. Finally, the performances of all proposed algorithms are tested and reported.},

  abstract     = {Production scheduling under time-of-use electricity tariffs has become an efficient way for energy-intensive industries to decrease energy costs. However, when production tasks are over-concentrated in one scheduling cycle , the effectiveness of time-of-use electricity tariffs is no longer significant. This makes the introduction of self-generation power plant appealing for energy-intensive industries. This paper addresses an integrated scheduling problem from an iron-steel plant equipped with self-generation equipment under time-of-use electricity tariffs. In this problem, time-of-use electricity tariffs, the self-generation cost, and the on-grid electrovalence influence the total electricity cost simultaneously. A multi-objective mathematical model with energy-awareness is developed to optimize the production schedules and electricity cost jointly. An improved SPEA2 based on the relationship propagation chain is tailored for the problem, including scheduling solution encoding, crossover and mutation. A real-life case study from a Chinese iron-steel plant equipped with self-generation equipment demonstrates that the proposed methods can provide a high-quality scheduling scheme and the total electricity cost can be significantly reduced.},

  abstract     = {Swarm Intelligence (SI) is a popular multi-agent framework that has been originally inspired by swarm behaviors observed in natural systems, such as ant and bee colonies. In a system designed after swarm intelligence, each agent acts autonomously, reacts on dynamic inputs, and, implicitly or explicitly, works collaboratively with other swarm members without a central control. The system as a whole is expected to exhibit global patterns and behaviors. Although well-designed swarms can show advantages in adaptability, robustness, and scalability, it must be noted that SI system have not really found their way from lab demonstrations to real-world applications, so far. This is particularly true for embodied SI, where the agents are physical entities, such as in swarm robotics scenarios. In this paper, we start from these observations, outline different definitions and characterizations, and then discuss present challenges in the perspective of future use of swarm intelligence. These include application ideas, research topics, and new sources of inspiration from biology, physics, and human cognition. To motivate future applications of swarms, we make use of the notion of cyber-physical systems (CPS). CPSs are a way to encompass the large spectrum of technologies including robotics, internet of things (IoT), Systems on Chip (SoC), embedded systems , and so on. Thereby, we give concrete examples for visionary applications and their challenges representing the physical embodiment of swarm intelligence in autonomous driving and smart traffic, emergency response, environmental monitoring, electric energy grids, space missions, medical applications, and human networks. We do not aim to provide new solutions for the swarm intelligence or CPS community, but rather build a bridge between these two communities. This allows us to view the research problems of swarm intelligence from a broader perspective and motivate future research activities in modeling, design, validation/verification, and human-in-the-loop concepts.},

  abstract     = {Crossover is a crucial operation for generating promising offspring solutions in evolutionary multi-objective optimization. Among various crossover operators , the simulated binary crossover (SBX) is the most widely used in evolutionary multi-objective optimization. Despite that SBX is effective in solving problems with regular Pareto sets, its performance degenerates dramatically on problems with rotated Pareto sets.To address this issue, we propose a modified SBX, named the rotation-based simulated binary crossover (RSBX), to improve the performance of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) on rotated problems whose Pareto sets are not parallel with the decision variables. The main idea is to introduce the rotation property into the SBX, and then an adaptive selection strategy is proposed to make use of both SBX and RSBX. The proposed method is embedded in three representative MOEAs, and they are compared with their original versions on some problems with rotated Pareto sets, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient in promoting the performance of conventional MOEAs for handling rotated multi-objective optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Cuckoo search (CS) algorithm, based on the brood parasitic behaviour of cuckoo species, since its inception, has proved its worth in various fields of research and can be considered as an efficient problem solver . Though CS is a very good algorithm, its performance degrades as the problem complexity increases. So a new version namely self-adaptive CS (SACS) is proposed to improve its performance. The algorithm employs adaptive parameters and hence no parameter tuning is required to be done. Here proportional population reduction based on the fitness of current best and previous best solution is followed. Secondly, in order to improve the exploration and exploitation tendencies, the Gaussian sampling mechanism known as bare-bones variant along with division of population and generations is added. The concept of Weibull distributed probability switching is also added to increase the balance between the exploration and exploitation processes. Further, CS as an extension of differential evolution (DE), genetic algorithm (GA), stability analysis with respect to Von Neumann’s stability criteria are also presented. For performance evaluation, the SACS algorithm is tested on CEC 2017 benchmark problems and compared with respect to self-adaptive DE (SaDE), JADE, success-history based adaptive DE (SHADE), SHADE with linear population size reduction (LSHADE), mean-variance mapping optimization (MVMO), cuckoo version 1.0 (CV1.0), cuckoo version new ( CV new ) and others. Experimental results and statistical analysis show that the proposed SACS algorithm performs better than SaDE, JADE, CV1.0, CV new and CS whereas comparable with respect to LSHADE, SHADE, and MVMO. Convergence profiles further validate the results.},

Most multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) try their best to maintain a balance between the two aspects, which poses a challenge to the convergence of MOEAs in the early evolutionary process. In this paper, a many-objective optimization algorithm based on staged coordination selection, which consists of the convergence and diversity stages, is proposed in which the two stages are considered separately in each iteration. In the convergence exploring stage, the decomposition method is adopted to rapidly make the population close to the true PF . In the diversity exploring stage, a diversity maintenance mechanism same to the archive truncation method of SPEA2 is used to push distributed individuals to the true PF . The convergence stage serves for the diversity stage, and the second stage turns into the first stage when it fails to reach the convergence requirement and so forth. Our algorithm is compared with eight state-of-the-art many-objective optimization algorithms on DTLZ, WFG and MaOP benchmark instances. Results show that our algorithm outperformed the comparison algorithms for most test problems.},
