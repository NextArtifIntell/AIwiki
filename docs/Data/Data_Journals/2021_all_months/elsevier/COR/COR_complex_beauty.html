  abstract     = {Recent trends towards larger and more complex systems necessitate the use of heterogeneous and flexible automated guided vehicles (AGVs) to fulfill the transport demand within a factory. To operate the fleet of AGVs efficiently, it is also important to consider their limited battery capacity. In this context, we tackle the problem of scheduling transport requests on multi-load and multi-ability AGVs with battery management. Each AGV can carry more than one load at a time and have specific capabilities such as lift loads, tow loads, or handle loads with a mounted robot arm. Each request consists of a pickup and a delivery task associated with an origin, a destination, a soft time window, and a priority. Each transport request may also require different AGV capabilities, and the AGV batteries can be recharged partially under consideration of a critical battery threshold. The decisions involve assigning transport and charging requests to AGVs, sequencing these requests, and determining the arrival times and charging duration. A mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated. A hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search with an integrated local search method is proposed to find a feasible schedule with the aim to minimize the tardiness costs of requests and travel costs of AGVs. We illustrate the efficacy of the hybrid algorithm with an industry case study using real-world data. The computational results reveal a 20\%–50\% cost reduction in current practice by using our hybrid algorithm, and around 50\% cost reduction with respect to a single-load AGV scheduling approach proposed in the literature.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces the transit time constrained fixed charge multi-commodity network design problem . Transit times are origin-to-destination time limits for the commodities, which appear for example in transport systems with perishable goods. We discuss how to model the problem and present three different formulations of it. The first formulation is an exponential size path formulation , which we solve with a branch-and-price algorithm. Several speed up techniques from the literature on fixed charge multi-commodity network design problems are implemented, such as lifted cover inequalities and the recently proposed deep dual-optimal inequalities . In an extensive set of computational experiments, we show that these inequalities significantly improve the performance of the algorithm. The other two formulations are of polynomial size: one uses path indices and the other uses time indices. While the branch-and-price algorithm outperforms solving the compact formulations with a general-purpose mixed-integer programming solver, the study of compact models helps better understand the problem, and we can use them as benchmarks. A detailed sensitivity analysis of the branch-and-price algorithm shows that longer transit times and an increased ratio of fixed charge to flow cost increase the difficulty of solving the problem whereas the arc capacity has less impact. We further discuss in-depth implementational details.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic routing occurs when customers are not known in advance, e.g. for real-time routing. Two heuristics are proposed that solve the balanced dynamic multiple travelling salesmen problem (BD-mTSP). These heuristics represent operational (tactical) tools for dynamic (online, real-time) routing. Several types and scopes of dynamics are proposed. Particular attention is given to sequential dynamics. The balanced dynamic closest vehicle heuristic (BD-CVH) and the balanced dynamic assignment vehicle heuristic (BD-AVH) are applied to this type of dynamics. The algorithms are applied to a wide range of test instances. Taxi services and palette transfers in warehouses demonstrate how to use the BD-mTSP algorithms in real-world scenarios. Continuous approximation models for the BD-mTSP’s are derived and serve as strategic tools for dynamic routing. The models express route lengths using vehicles, customers, and dynamic scopes without the need of running an algorithm. A machine learning approach was used to obtain regression models. The mean absolute percentage error of two of these models is below 3\%.},

To validate the proposed line search some well-known line searches, including Armijo, maximum nonmonotone and average nonmonotone line searches, were considered. In order to make a comprehensive comparison between the proposed line sereach and the aforementioned line searches two criteria are considered: the computational effort and quality of the approximated nondominated frontier. The results confirm the remarkable superiority of the proposed line search over the mentioned line searches. In addition, this line search preserves the quality of the obtained nondominated frontier.

  abstract     = {When solving hard multicommodity network flow problems using an LP-based approach, the number of commodities is a driving factor in the speed at which the LP can be solved, as it is linear in the number of constraints and variables. The conventional approach to improve the solve time of the LP relaxation of a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model that encodes such an instance is to aggregate all commodities that have the same origin or the same destination. However, the bound of the resulting LP relaxation can significantly worsen, which tempers the efficiency of aggregating techniques. In this paper, we introduce the concept of partial aggregation of commodities that aggregates commodities over a subset of the network instead of the conventional aggregation over the entire underlying network. This offers a high level of control on the trade-off between size of the aggregated MIP model and quality of its LP bound. We apply the concept of partial aggregation to two different MIP models for the multicommodity network design problem . Our computational study on benchmark instances confirms that the trade-off between solve time and LP bound can be controlled by the level of aggregation, and that choosing a good trade-off can allow us to solve the original large-scale problems faster than without aggregation or with full aggregation.},

Recent advances in learning theory clearly show that I-SVM allows a more effective control of the learning hypothesis space with a better generalization ability . In this paper, we propose a new method for optimizing the I-SVM to find the optimal separation hyperplane . The proposed approach provides a parallel block minimization framework for solving the dual I-SVM problem that exploits the advantages of the randomized primal–dual coordinate (RPDC) method, and every iteration-based sub-optimization RPDC routine has a simple closed-form. We also provide an upper limit τ ∗ τ∗ for the space control parameter τ τ by solving a Morozov regularization SVM (M-SVM) problem.

These factors can affect to the construction and operating costs, origin or destination of the supplied commodities, required demands or arc capacities. In this paper, some of these uncertain parameters are supposed to be continuous while others are clearly discrete in nature, giving rise to a mixed integer set of scenarios under which the system may be assessed. We explore how to design a robust distribution network when the uncertainty in the continuous parameters is modeled through polyhedral sets combined with other sources of uncertainty for the discrete parameters. The corresponding optimization problem is solved using a Benders decomposition framework. Finally, a computational experiment with specialized solvers is carried out in order to test the efficiency of our algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective (MO) optimization, i.e., the simultaneous optimization of multiple conflicting objectives, is gaining more and more attention in various research areas, such as evolutionary computation, machine learning (e.g., (hyper-)parameter optimization), or logistics (e.g., vehicle routing). Many works in this domain mention the structural problem property of multimodality as a challenge from two classical perspectives: (1) finding all globally optimal solution sets, and (2) avoiding to get trapped in local optima. Interestingly, these streams seem to transfer many traditional concepts of single-objective (SO) optimization into claims, assumptions, or even terminology regarding the MO domain, but mostly neglect the understanding of the structural properties as well as the algorithmic search behavior on a problem’s landscape. However, some recent works counteract this trend, by investigating the fundamentals and characteristics of MO problems using new visualization techniques and gaining surprising insights. Using these visual insights, this work proposes a step towards a unified terminology to capture multimodality and locality in a broader way than it is usually done. This enables us to investigate current research activities in multimodal continuous MO optimization and to highlight new implications and promising research directions for the design of benchmark suites, the discovery of MO landscape features, the development of new MO (or even SO) optimization algorithms, and performance indicators. For all these topics, we provide a review of ideas and methods but also an outlook on future challenges, research potential and perspectives that result from recent developments.},

For our BAP under a cooperative environment, we propose a mixed-integer programming model. Based on an assignment model with binary variables, our BAP can be reduced to the liner carrier clustering problem. To generate stable liner carrier clusters used in our assignment model, queueing theory and core theory are applied. A three-stage optimization method is proposed to solve our BAP. Namely, stage I proposes a queueing theory approach for various liner carrier clusters, and based on core theory stage II determines the stability of different liner carrier clusters. Based on the results obtained in stages I and II, stage III solves the liner carrier clustering problem. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Furthermore, a threshold needs to be satisfied, e.g., a minimum total order volume is given and orders can be placed only if they reach (or exceed) this volume. As a consequence, articles cannot be treated independently and, thus, we have to determine order volumes for all articles integratedly. The replenishment problem with multiple articles and an order threshold is formalized and its computational complexity is determined. We develop mixed-integer programming models and suited optimization approaches and apply them in static and dynamic problem settings.

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of jointly optimizing train stop plan and timetable for a set of trains on a railway corridor, with focus on time-dependent passenger demand: these are very relevant elements in railway operations, and closely related to the service quality provided to the passengers. The train stop planning problem requires to determine the stopping pattern for each train, while the train timetabling problem calls for finding departure and arrival times of each train at each visited station. The solution of both problems determines the train services available to the passengers, with the corresponding stops, the departure and arrival times, and the total travel time. To define train services that are convenient for the passengers, it is important to satisfy the passenger demand: in particular, we take into consideration the desired departure time intervals of passengers from their origin station towards their destination station. Our goal is to determine a solution to the integrated problem that includes these three aspects (stop plan, timetable, time-dependent passenger demand). The integrated problem is solved at the tactical level, and includes constraints imposing that the demand is satisfied in the desired time intervals, and the train capacity is respected. The solution of the problem defines the train services, by determining the passenger flow on trains and the time intervals in which passengers have to be served. We formulate an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model for this integrated problem, and solve it with the commercial optimization solver CPLEX on a real-world instance of the Wuhan–Guangzhou high-speed railway line in China, by considering different time interval lengths in which the demand must be satisfied. In addition, we compare the obtained results with those determined by solving a model that neglects the time-dependency of the passenger demand. The computational results show that the train stop plan and timetable are deeply influenced by the desired departure time intervals of the passengers, and that neglecting time-dependency results in more than 30\% of the passengers departing in a different time interval than the desired one.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of automated vehicles (AVs), new infrastructure planning concepts such as subnetworks of AV-ready roads have been proposed to improve the performance of transportation networks and to promote the adoption of AVs. However, these subnetworks should evolve over time in response to the growing AV demand, which necessitates a multi-stage modeling approach. In this study, we propose multi-stage deployment of AV-ready subnetworks and formulate it as a time-dependent network design problem, which is a bi-level mixed-integer programming problem. The lower level is a simultaneous travel mode and route choice equilibrium with continuous decision variables, and the upper level is a design problem including infrastructure investment decisions to determine which roads to upgrade and include in AV-ready subnetworks for mixed traffic. We use a case study of a real road network to demonstrate the concept. Since computational efficiency is a key factor for solving such large-scale problems, we develop two efficient and tailored evolutionary heuristics to solve the problem, and compare their performance to a computationally demanding Genetic-algorithm-based solution method. The results indicate that the proposed algorithms can efficiently solve this large-scale problem while satisfying constraints in all scenarios, and outperform Genetic algorithm, particularly in the scenario with larger number of stages. Moreover, in all scenarios, deployment of AV-ready subnetworks leads to improvements in network performance in terms of total travel time and cost. However, the improvements are always accompanied with increased total travel distance. The extent of changes depends on AV market penetration rate, AV-ready subnetwork density and timing of densification.},

  abstract     = {The distributed shop scheduling has gained a great deal of attention due to its high-efficient collaboration and production. This paper studies a distributed no-wait flexible flow shop scheduling problem (DNWFFSP) with the makespan criterion, where each factory includes an identical flexible flow shop with no-wait constraint that requires each job to be processed without any waiting time between consecutive stages. A mixed-integer linear programming model for the DNWFFSP is presented. A machine selection method based on the first earliest available machine rule is presented. Three greedy factory assignment rules incorporating NEH (Nawaz-Enscore-Ham) heuristic are developed to allocate jobs into factories. Fourteen dispatch rules involving simple sorting and decomposition method are developed to construct a priority sequence of jobs. Thus, several constructive heuristics are obtained by combining dispatch rules and factory assignment rules. Furthermore, a constructive heuristic version of variable neighborhood descend is designed to address the DNWFFSP. One of constructive heuristics is selected to generate an initial solution, and five neighborhood search methods are used as the local search procedure. A comprehensive numerical comparison and statistical analysis are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed approaches. The distributed NEH2 with smallest largest-medium rule obtains better results than other constructive heuristics for large-size instances.},

  abstract     = {Oil and gas companies are facing low output prices and are forced to focus on the development of mature fields. Relevant investment decisions for operators include lifetime-enhancing activities, such as drilling new wells or permanent shutdown. We study the problem of optimal timing of investments in mature oil and gas fields in the presence of price uncertainty, which is an example of a complex real options problem consisting of a portfolio of interdependent options. We formulate a multistage stochastic integer programming model that incorporates a detailed representation of the uncertain oil price, and demonstrate how such a complex real options problem can be efficiently solved using the Stochastic Dual Dynamic Integer Programming algorithm. The paper presents a numerical example based on realistic data and discusses our computational results. We find that only a small number of Markov states are required to represent the uncertain price process, while obtaining convergence of the lower and upper bounds of the objective function. The value of stochastic solution of 11\% is considerable in this example. It is concluded that the shutdown decision tends to be postponed as a result of high decommissioning costs, high discount rates, high price uncertainty and low operational expenditures , while it generally is accelerated if the decommissioning costs increase over time.},

Unlike most studies in the literature that assume a complete network with costs satisfying the triangle inequality to formulate the problem, we define the problem on non-complete networks and develop a modeling approach that does not require any specific cost and network structure. The proposed approach may provide more flexibility in modeling several characteristics of real-life hub networks. Moreover, the approach may produce better solutions than the classical approach, which may result from the differences in the selected hubs, the flow routes between origin–destination points, and the assignment of non-hub nodes to hub nodes. We solve the proposed model using CPLEX-based branch-and-bound algorithm and Gurobi-based branch-and-bound algorithm with Norel heuristic and develop Benders decomposition-based heuristic algorithms using two acceleration strategies, namely, strong cut generation and cut disaggregation. We conduct computational experiments using problem instances defined on non-complete networks with up to 500 nodes. The results indicate that the Benders-type heuristics are especially effective in finding good feasible solutions for large instances.},

The third-party logistics providers typically offer multiple shipping modes chosen by the manufacturers to deliver products, each shipping mode with a shipping time guarantee and a shipping cost function that is non-increasing in shipping time and sub-additive, non-decreasing in shipping quantity. The problem involves inventory holding costs which not only depend on the time that the products spend in temporary storage but also depend on customer types . The problem is to determine an integrated production and shipping schedule that satisfies the committed delivery due date limitations for the customers, such that the total cost of shipping and inventory holding is minimized. We investigate two cases with and without split delivery. For both cases, we first show that both of them are ordinarily NP-hard, prove that there exist no polynomial-time approximation algorithms with constant worst-case ratios, propose exact algorithms to solve them, and finally design column generation-based heuristic algorithms to find feasible solutions. The computational results demonstrate that the heuristic algorithms are capable of generating near-optimal solutions efficiently. We also consider two interesting practical variants of the problem.},

The main computational experiments were carried out on instances having between 302 and 1000 customers. Using initial solutions generated by some of the best available metaheuristics for the problem, POPMUSIC was able to obtain consistently better solutions for long runs of up to 32 h. Starting from the best known solutions available in CVRP library (CVRPLIB), POPMUSIC was able to find new best solutions for several instances, including some very large ones.

The risk-aversion level of strategic consumers affects their expected utility in both periods, which will determine their purchasing behaviour. Typically, firms implement either quantity commitment (QC), price commitment (PC) or rational-expectation equilibrium (REE) policies to plan for risk-averse strategic consumers’ purchasing behaviour. In this study, we develop and analyze a novel model on the sales policy, full price, and the initial inventory decisions in the above setting. Results show that the risk-aversion level of strategic consumers has structural implications on optimal policies . First, firms should implement QC when the risk-aversion level is higher than a critical threshold; otherwise, PC is better. Second, the critical threshold of risk aversion increases as the unit cost of a product and clearance price decrease and as the consumer valuation increases. This can affect the optimal policy (QC, PC or REE). Finally, PC is always optimal when strategic consumers are risk seeking. We also conclude that the optimal policy is significantly affected by the proportion of strategic consumers when we consider different kinds of consumers (e.g. myopic consumers).},

The travel cost depends on the proper routing of the service staff and the effective collection of closely located tasks into a single route. Priorities of tasks are defined by a function of their deadlines. Consumer satisfaction is a function of the number of missed appointments.

  abstract     = {The (environmental) selection procedure in Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Algorithms (EMOAs) can be interpreted as a subset selection problem, where the goal is to determine a subset of a given size that maximizes a quality indicator. The hypervolume indicator possesses desirable theoretical properties (e.g. monotonicity properties) that make it well-suited for indicator-based selection, and SMS-EMOA is a good example of this. In such a case, selection is viewed as a Hypervolume Subset Selection Problem ( HSSP ) that consists of selecting a subset of k k points from a set of n n points that maximizes the hypervolume indicator. However, apart from SMS-EMOA that considers the case of k = n − 1 k=n−1 , HSSP -based selection in EMOAs with more than 2 objectives and k k&amp;lt;n−1 is solved with approximation (greedy) algorithms. Although a few exact algorithms exist to compute the HSSP for these cases, faster algorithms are required to make its integration in EMOAs practical. This paper proposes a new integer linear programming formulation of the HSSP , named LHSSP , that relies on a decomposition of the dominated region based on the multivariate Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF). It is shown that, under this formulation, only part of the dominated region needs to be modeled to obtain an optimal solution to the HSSP . A new algorithm is proposed, named LayersC , which exploits this observation through incremental computations. Experimental studies with 3 objectives show that this algorithm considerably speeds up the computation of the HSSP in comparison to state-of-the-art algorithms, and makes HSSP -based selection in EMOAs amenable.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider a recycling facility location-routing planning problem with feedstock volume and composition uncertainty. A salient feature of the problem is that the feedstock condition (volume and composition) exhibits both ambiguity and ‘unobservability’. That is, the distribution of (future) feedstock condition cannot be known at the planning stage, which is regarded as ambiguity or ‘here-and-now uncertainty’. At the same time, the feedstock condition ( e.g. , the composition) also cannot be perfectly observed even at the implementation stage, which we term the ‘unobservability’ or ‘wait-and-see uncertainty’. This is different from the conventional two-stage adaptive optimization problems with uncertainty. To tackle jointly the unobservability and ambiguity of feedstock condition, we propose a structured paradigm of finitely adaptive distributionally robust optimization , which is developed with a learning machinery integrating clustering analysis and χ 2 χ2 -divergence-based distributional ambiguity set. In particular, the distributionally robust optimization framework is utilized to tackle the ambiguity, while the clustering-based adaptivity over the imperfect feedstock observations is tailored to achieve the unobservability mitigation. Technically, we show that the resulting recycling location optimization problem under the paradigm can be reformulated into a mixed integer second-order cone program which can be handled by off-the-shelf MIP solvers. We also prove that given the feedstock volume uncertainty and feedstock composition uncertainty separately, the optimal value of our model, under some partition condition, is able to converge to that of the fully adaptive distributionally robust optimization model. Finally, sufficient numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating the unobservability and ambiguity effects in recycling planning, also the scalability advantage of our approach could motivates its applications in other areas.},

A schedule is an assignment of a time interval of p j pj time units on m machines for each job j . The schedule is feasible if intervals on the same machine do not overlap, and jobs to be processed on the same machine are pairwise not conflicting. The aim is to find a feasible schedule that minimizes the maximum completion time of the jobs. The problem is NP-hard as it generalizes both the problem of scheduling jobs on identical parallel machines to the aim of minimizing the makespan ( P | | C max P||Cmax ) and the vertex coloring problem (VCP), two well-known NP-hard problems. We present the first stand-alone branch-and-price (BP) algorithm that works directly on the problem. In comprehensive computational experiments with benchmark instances, we prove that the new BP algorithm, even without using ad hoc primal heuristics and feasibility check algorithms, is competitive with the best exact solution algorithm proposed so far in the literature. These results are mainly achieved thanks to the branching scheme we propose.},

  abstract     = {We consider an online version of the orienteering problem, where stochastic service requests arise during a first time interval from customers located on the nodes of a graph. Every request must be accepted/rejected in real time. Later, a vehicle must visit the accepted customers during a second time interval. Each accepted request implies a prize, depending on the customer, and a service cost, depending on the routing decisions. Moreover, an accepted request implies a reduction of the routing time available for possible future requests. Each acceptance/rejection decision is made to maximize the expected profit, i.e., the difference between expected prices and expected service costs. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process and derive analytical expressions for the transition probabilities and the optimal policy. Since an exact policy computation is intractable, we design and test several heuristic approaches , including static approximation, simple greedy (non-anticipatory) methods, Sample Average Approximation (SAA) of the objective function using Monte Carlo sampling of future events. We perform extensive computational tests on the proposed algorithms and discuss the pros and cons of the different methods.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of upgrading an existent network in order to enhance its robustness to events involving multiple node failures. This problem is modeled as a bi-objective mixed linear integer formulation considering both the minimization of the cost of the added edges and the maximization of the robustness of the resulting upgraded network. As the robustness metric of the network, we consider the value of the Critical Node Detection (CND) problem variant which provides the minimum pairwise connectivity between all node pairs when a set of c critical nodes are removed from the network. We present a general iterative framework to obtain the complete Pareto frontier that alternates between the minimum cost edge selection problem and the CND problem. Two different approaches based on a cover model are introduced for the edge selection problem. Computational results conducted on different network topologies show that the proposed methodology based on the cover model is effective in computing Pareto solutions for graphs with up to 100 nodes, which includes four commonly used telecommunication networks.},

When considering split delivery, a customer can be served by more than one vehicle. The green variant takes into consideration the CO 2 emission. Our objective is to analyze the cost benefits obtained with the aggregation of split delivery and the reduction of CO 2 emission. Mathematical models are presented for each variant, and instances are solved with a branch-and-cut approach. We develop a tailored procedure to address the packing subproblem , including the computation of lower bounds, a constructive-based heuristic, and a constraint programming formulation. Computational experiments performed on literature instances and newly created ones show that the proposed approach can outperform previous results. Besides that, the green variant has solutions with low emissions of CO 2 . The variant with split delivery has solutions with lower cost but at the expense of higher computing time.},

It analyzes the coordination of one mothership with one drone to obtain optimal routes that have to visit some target objects modeled as general graphs. The goal is to minimize the overall weighted distance traveled by both vehicles while satisfying the requirements in terms of percentages of visits to targets. We discuss different approaches depending on the assumption made on the route followed by the mothership: i) the mothership can move on a continuous framework (the Euclidean plane), ii) on a connected piecewise linear polygonal chain or iii) on a general graph. In all cases, we develop exact formulations resorting to mixed integer second order cone programs that are compared on a testbed of instances to assess their performance. The high complexity of the exact methods makes it difficult to find optimal solutions in short computing time. For that reason, besides the exact formulations we also provide a tailored matheuristic algorithm that allows one to obtain high quality solutions in reasonable time.

While order sequencing has been studied in the literature, there is little work on rack scheduling, which also affects the picking efficiency. We formulate a mixed-integer linear programming model and propose a two-stage solution procedure to address the problem of joint optimization of order sequencing and rack scheduling in the RMFS. Our numerical studies show that jointly optimizing order sequencing and rack scheduling reduces the robotic tasks by up to 59.8\%, 50.8\%, 32.0\% compared with benchmark solutions, rack scheduling only, and order sequencing only, respectively.

The field of view of the spectrograph is divided in 55 contiguous and parallel spatial bands. Each band is associated with two opposite sliding bars that can be positioned to observe an astronomical object. The observation of an object requires the synchronized configuration of the bars in several contiguous bands to form a slitlet in the position of the object. A multi-slit pattern for the bars permits the simultaneous observation of several objects requiring bars of different bands. Each astronomer using this spectrograph propose a list of objects to observe. Since the instrument is quite demanded, the manager of the telescope imposes a time limitation to the astronomers, so they need to select a subset of objects from their lists. This paper describes and solves the selection problem. The problem must also find a sequence of configurations for the bars in each band to maximize the total priority of the selection, subject to some synchronization issues and the time limitation. We show three mathematical formulations. One of them is a set-partitioning model where a master problem manages the synchronization constraints and a subproblem generates columns satisfying the time limitation. We propose two branch-and-price-and-cut algorithms for solving the set-partitioning model, and discuss an extensive computational experiment showing the performance of the algorithms on two families of instances.},

However, features are usually correlated, a fact that violates the Naïve Bayes’ assumption of conditional independence , and may deteriorate the method’s performance. Moreover, datasets are often characterized by a large number of features, which may complicate the interpretation of the results as well as slow down the method’s execution. In this paper we propose a sparse version of the Naïve Bayes classifier that is characterized by three properties. First, the sparsity is achieved taking into account the correlation structure of the covariates . Second, different performance measures can be used to guide the selection of features. Third, performance constraints on groups of higher interest can be included. Our proposal leads to a smart search, which yields competitive running times, whereas the flexibility in terms of performance measure for classification is integrated. Our findings show that, when compared against well-referenced feature selection approaches, the proposed sparse Naïve Bayes obtains competitive results regarding accuracy, sparsity and running times for balanced datasets. In the case of datasets with unbalanced (or with different importance) classes, a better compromise between classification rates for the different classes is achieved.},

The total passenger demand satisfied by the electric buses can be considered as the value to be maximized.

In this paper we show that, if a graph is path ranking invariant, the solution of a large class of time-dependent vehicle routing problems can be obtained by solving suitably defined (and simpler) time-independent routing problems. We also show how this property can be checked by solving a linear program. If the check fails, the solution of the linear program can be used to determine a tight lower bound. In order to assess the value of these insights, the lower bounds have been embedded into an enumerative scheme.

We propose a novel timeslot formulation that schedules and sequences a set of trips to serve several demand locations. On each trip, a drone starts from an urban provider, visits one or more charging platforms (if required), serves a clinic in rural or suburban areas, and returns to the corresponding provider. The problem consists of selecting locations for charging stations, assigning clinics to providers, and scheduling and sequencing the trips such that the total completion time to serve all demand points is minimized. To improve the computational efficiency of the solution method, we use a preprocessing procedure to reduce the solution space by eliminating the dominated trips from the pool of trips. A set of numerical experiments is performed on simulated instances and on a case study in Louisville, KY. The results unveil interesting insights into the logistics of the proposed drone delivery system.},

Usually, these problems seek a set of individuals to be initially influenced by some content and will help to propagate the content to other individuals of the network. This work considers generalizations for the minimization and maximization versions of these problems. We propose binary linear models and Lagrangian relaxations that, for general cases, offer strictly better bounds than the linear relaxations. To efficiently solve our relaxations we design dynamic programming algorithms and embedded them in subgradient methods to find the best possible bounds. We also use the subgradient methods to construct feasible heuristic solutions and, to assess the effectiveness of our approaches, we run computational experiments on instances generated from real-world datasets. The experiments indicate that our heuristics obtain almost optimal solutions with good bounds in a very short time and, in some cases, they guarantee optimality for the constructed solutions.},

  abstract     = {We consider the (single-stage) stochastic bin packing problem (SBPP) which is based on a given list of items the sizes of which are represented by stochastically independent random variables . The SBPP requires to determine the minimum number of unit capacity bins needed to pack all the items, such that for each bin the probability of exceeding the capacity is bounded by a given constant. Such calculations are particularly relevant in the field of server consolidation , where (not precisely known) jobs have to be assigned to as few processing units as possible to keep the energy consumption and operational costs low. Although not being limited to this assumption, our theoretical investigations are only exemplified for normally distributed item sizes, especially since real-world characteristics can often be reasonably approximated by that type of distribution. From a mathematical point of view, such item characteristics are particularly challenging as the corresponding SBPP turns out to be a nonlinear integer program . For this scenario, we first derive several (improved) lower and upper bounds and study their worst-case performance metrics. Moreover, we describe various linearization techniques to overcome the drawback of nonlinearity. Finally, all approaches are tested based on extensive computational experiments, involving both randomly generated and real-world instances.},

The objective is to maximize the profit of the system operator. A multi-layer time–space network flow technique is adopted to describe the movement of EVs in the system. We develop a mixed integer linear programming model for optimal fleet allocation in EV-sharing systems based on the multi-layer time–space network. This study applies robust optimization and chance-constrained techniques to deal with the fleet deployment problem with uncertain and stochastic demands, respectively. While small-scale instances of the problem can be optimally solved using commercial software such as Gurobi, a network decomposition-based mathheuristic is developed to efficiently solve large-scale instances. A set of computational experiments were conducted based on the data provided by the operator of the EV-sharing system deployed in Sun Moon Lake National Park in Nantou, Taiwan. The results show the proposed models and the heuristic are able to effectively and efficiently generate optimal fleet allocations under deterministic, uncertain or stochastic demand scenarios. Two measures of effectiveness, robust price and hedge value, are examined to verify the price-paid and value-gained by applying the robust solution. The proposed approach can be used as a decision support tool to assist operators of EV-sharing systems in effectively determining the deployment of their fleets to stations considering uncertain or stochastic demands.},

We first propose two mixed–integer linear programming models for the train timetabling problem under the TSM with and without capacity constraints. Next, we develop two mixed–integer nonlinear programming models under the ELM with and without “overtaking”; thus, a total of four optimization models are proposed. The objective is to minimize the passenger travel time (PTT). Owing to the NP–hardness of the studied problem, we propose an adaptive genetic algorithm (A–GA) that can efficiently solve the four proposed models. The A–GA is customized to solve the train timetabling problem with train capacity, overtaking, and other operational constraints, reducing the PTT. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conduct numerical experiments on 60 randomly generated realistic instances and a real–world case study based on Shanghai Metro Line 16. The computational results for the realistic instances indicate that our A–GA can obtain near–optimal solutions with significantly less computation time than an established commercial solver. The computational results from the real-world case study quantify the benefits of considering the combination of the ELM and overtaking strategies in train timetabling. Furthermore, we perform a sensitivity analysis on key parameters of our mathematical formulations. The results provide insights to railway managers on how to set key parameters when applying the proposed formulations and solution methodology in practice.},

  abstract     = {Decision making needs to take an uncertain environment into account. Over the last decades, robust optimization has emerged as a preeminent method to produce solutions that are immunized against uncertainty. The main focus in robust discrete optimization has been on the analysis and solution of one- or two-stage problems, where the decision maker has limited options in reacting to additional knowledge gained after parts of the solution have been fixed. Due to its computational difficulty, multistage problems beyond two stages have received less attention. In this paper we argue that multistage robust discrete problems can be seen through the lens of quantified integer programs , where powerful tools to reduce the search tree size have been developed. By formulating both integer and quantified integer programming formulations, it is possible to compare the performance of state-of-the-art solvers from both worlds. Using selection, assignment, lot-sizing and knapsack problems as a testbed , we show that problems with up to nine stages can be solved to optimality in reasonable time.},

In the defined problem, we simultaneously focus on the decision-making of the GPO and all the retailers. Accordingly, a multi-level mathematical programming model is presented that determines the decisions of the GPO that are related to pricing policy and dealing with the suppliers, and the decisions of the retailers that are relevant to using the GPO services and contracting with the suppliers. To solve the developed model, a new solution procedure is established that surpasses the existing methods in the literature, with the help of which interesting results are obtained and managerial analyses are performed. Besides, the prevalent challenges about the functioning of the GPO and its efficiencies are examined and definitive responses are provided to critics of GPOs.},

  abstract     = {Reasonable job shop scheduling can improve the production efficiency and product delivery and reduce the costs and energy consumption. The quality of a scheduling scheme mainly depends on the performance of the used algorithm. Therefore, several researchers have attempted to improve the performance of algorithms used for solving the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSSP). Currently, the genetic algorithm (GA) is one of the most widely used algorithms for solving the FJSSP. However, it has a low convergence speed and accuracy. To overcome these limitations of the GA, a novel variable neighbourhood descent hybrid genetic algorithm (VND-hGA) is proposed here. In this algorithm, a barebones particle swarm optimisation (BBPSO)-based mutation operator , a hybrid heuristic initialisation strategy, and VND based on an improved multilevel neighbourhood structure are integrated into the standard GA framework to improve its convergence performance and solution accuracy. Furthermore, a real-number-based chromosome representation, coding, decoding, and crossover method is proposed for maximising the advantages of BBPSO . The proposed algorithm was tested on benchmark cases, and the results were compared with those of existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm exhibited superior solution accuracy and convergence performance than those of existing ones.},

  abstract     = {The gravity fed water distribution network design (WDND) optimization problem consists in determining the pipe diameters of a water network such that hydraulic constraints are satisfied and the total cost is minimized. Traditionally, such design decisions are made on the basis of expert experience. When networks increase in size, however, rules of thumb will rarely lead to near optimal decisions. Over the past thirty years, a large number of techniques have been developed to tackle the problem of optimally designing a water distribution network. In this paper, we tackle the NP-hard WDND optimization problem in a multi-period setting where time varying demand patterns occur. We propose a new enhanced simulation-based iterated local search (ILS) metaheuristic which further explores the structure of the problem in an attempt to obtain high quality solutions. More specifically, four novelties are proposed: (a) a local search strategy to smartly dimension pipes in the shortest paths between the reservoirs and the nodes with highest demands; (b) a technique to speed up convergence based on an aggressive pipe diameter reduction scheme; (c) a novel concentrated perturbation mechanism to allow escaping from very restrained local optima solutions; and (d) a pool of solutions to achieve a good compromise between intensification and diversification. Computational experiments show that our approach is able to improve over a state-of-the-art metaheuristic for most of the performed tests. Furthermore, it converges much faster to low cost solutions and demonstrates a more robust performance in that it obtains smaller deviations from the best known solutions.},

  abstract     = {Parameter uncertainty is common to several optimization problems , especially in health care where patients’ conditions and service times are highly uncertain. Moreover, in Home Health Care services , where patients are treated over a long time horizon, their clinical condition may change and result in uncertain but also highly time-correlated service times. To include time-correlated uncertain parameters is a difficult task in robust optimization . It has been only marginally addressed, especially in the health care management literature. In this paper, we address the nurse-to-patient assignment problem in Home Health Care services under three types of continuity of care, focusing on uncertain and time-correlated service times. In the literature, this problem has been tackled with stochastic programming , robust optimization , and heuristics; however, service times at different time periods have been treated as independent so far. We propose a robust assignment model that accounts for the time-dependency of patients’ service times, with either constant or increasing overtime cost, and an approach based on the implementor-adversary framework to solve it. Service times are modeled as stochastic parameters and time-correlation is included by limiting the difference in the service time requested by the same patient in two consecutive time periods. The goals are to minimize the cost of staff overtime and the number of reassignments that impair patients’ continuity of care. Results from a relevant realistic case show that the approach does not always converge, but the robust solutions provided, under suitable parameters for the uncertainty description, always outperform the deterministic ones even without full convergence.},

  abstract     = {Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms have originally been designed for static optimization problems , where the input data is known in advance and is not subject to changes over time. Later, the long term memory of ACO proved effective for reoptimization over environment changes when extended to deal with dynamic combinatorial optimization problems (DCOPs). Among the major proposals of this kind, several adaptations of ACO procedures to improve information reuse can be identified, as well as a population-based ACO algorithm (P-ACO) specifically designed for DCOPs. Indeed, P-ACO drew the attention of the research community due to its ability to faster process pheromone information, but the few works assessing the effectiveness of the adapted ACO procedures and also P-ACO are not enough to reach more general conclusions on the current state-of-the-art in ACO for dynamic optimization. In this work, we conduct an extensive experimental campaign to evaluate the most common ACO procedure adaptations identified in the literature, using as underlying algorithms the state-of-the-art in ACO for static optimization ( MAX MAX - MIN MIN Ant System, MM AS ) MMAS) and the most relevant ACO algorithm proposed for dynamic optimization (P-ACO). A variant of the traveling salesman problem with dynamic demands (DTSP) is used as test benchmark, similarly to most investigations on ACO for combinatorial optimization . Besides the carefully designed experimental setup we adopt, our work represents a significant contribution for, at least, three reasons. First, our work is the first to acknowledge that DCOPs require custom-configured parameter settings, and also the first to use automatic configuration tools for this task. Concretely, we show how the hypervolume indicator can be used to evaluate and configure the anytime behavior of algorithms for DCOPs. Second, we directly compare MM AS MMAS and P-ACO, isolating local search as an experimental factor. While P-ACO proves indeed effective in the absence of local search, MM AS MMAS is able to consistently outperform it when local search is adopted. Finally, we conduct an experimental investigation on the DCOP-specific components proposed for ACO, once again isolating local search. Results show that those components contribute very little to performance when algorithms are allowed to use local search, but are remarkably effective in its absence. In fact, coupled with DCOP components, MM AS MMAS outperforms P-ACO for a large part of our experimental setup.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by a real situation arising in the Brazilian sugarcane industry , this paper addresses the integrated planning of harvesting and transport operations over a multi-period planning horizon. The aim is to develop a tactical plan for the deployment of harvesting and transport equipment that sets the periods for the execution of the harvesting operations on the sugarcane fields and the type of harvesting machines and road haulage vehicles to be operated. These decisions are made subject to multiple constraints related to the projected crop yield, resource availability, demand for sugarcane at the mills and further technical requirements specific to the harvesting operations. The tactical plan to be determined minimizes the total cost incurred by the equipment used and the total time required to harvest all the fields. We propose a bi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming model for this new problem. A computational study is conducted for test instances capturing the characteristics of a Brazilian milling company. Pareto-optimal solutions are identified by the Progressive Bounded Constraint method that is extended to the problem at hand. A comparative analysis highlights the trade-offs between economic performance and harvesting efficiency, thereby supporting the decision maker in making a more informed choice of the preferred tactical plan. Useful managerial insights are also provided into the profile of the harvesting and transport resources that should be used under different weather conditions and work schedules.},

While order acceptance and scheduling feature of the problem includes the joint decision of which orders to accept and how to schedule them due to the limited capacity in production environment and due to the order delivery time requirements for the customers, logistics aspect of the problem entails the decision of how to batch the accepted orders for the delivery in conjunction with the production scheduling. The objective is to maximize the net revenue in line with the literature of order acceptance and scheduling problem. We first present a mixed integer linear programming and a constraint programming model for this problem. To tackle large size problem instances in which these models fail, we propose an iterated local search algorithm using a new local search scheme. To evaluate the performance of the proposed local search scheme, a variant of this algorithm is developed which replaces the relevant scheme with tabu search. Computational results show that the proposed models achieve small optimality gaps for the small size problems, but their performances deteriorate significantly as the problem size enlarges. For the large size problem instances, the iterated local search algorithm using the proposed local search scheme achieves smaller optimality gaps compared to the one with the tabu search algorithm.},

This paper proposes a coal management model that combines modified weighted russell directional distance model and pattern matching to help coal-fired power plants improve their operation while finding more potential for energy saving and emission abatement. An operational strategy base is established by using efficiency evaluation results for unit daily operational data, and feasible coal blending schemes are accordingly located in the strategy base for different load conditions. The model measures the improvement potential from three perspectives: coal blending, coal input and load dispatching. The daily operational data of four units (two units with circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers and two sub-critical units) in a typical coal-fired power plant were collected for case study, and the results indicate that our model can provide effective decision support in plants’ operational management to achieve efficiency improvement.},

The proposed approach is based on a data-driven inverse optimization (IO) method, which is highly nonlinear. To overcome such a caveat, we use a two-step estimation procedure which requires solving two convex programs . Both programs depend on penalty parameters that can be adjusted by using grid search. In addition, we propose the use of kernel regression to account for the nonlinear relationship between the behavior of the pool of EVs and the explanatory variables , i.e., the past electricity prices and EV fleet’s driving patterns. Unlike any other forecasting method, the proposed IO framework also allows the aggregator to derive a bid/offer curve, i.e. the tuple of price-quantity to be submitted to the electricity market, according to the market rules. We show the benefits of the proposed method against the machine-learning techniques that are reported to exhibit the best forecasting performance for this application in the technical literature.},

MMACP is of interest in VLSI design and graph visualization, especially when dealing with very large graphs.

Our algorithm exploits good data structures , efficient neighborhood search schemes, and a carefully defined ejection chain scheme. Effectively embedding these basic structures within an iterated local search framework, our algorithm produced superior outcomes. In particular, the algorithm produced new solutions improving the best-known results for 154 out of the 301 benchmark instances available in the public domain. As a result, our paper enhances the state-of-the-art knowledge in graph drawing and arc crossing minimization.

  abstract     = {Extended technical precedence constraints (ETPC) in dynamic job shop scheduling problem (DJSP) are the precedence constraints existing between different jobs instead of the conventional technical precedence constraints existing in the operations of the same job. This paper presents the mathematical programming model of the DJSP with ETPC to minimize the mean weighted tardiness of the jobs. The mathematical model contributes to the solution and modelling of the DJSP with ETPC and it is used to solve small-sized problems to optimality . To solve industry-sized problems, a constructive heuristic called the dispatching rule (DR) is employed. This paper investigates the use of genetic programming (GP) as a hyper-heuristic in the automated generation of the problem-specific DRs for solving the problem under consideration. The genetic programming-based hyper heuristic (GPHH) approach constructs the DRs which are learned from the training instances and then verified on the test instances by the simulation experiments. To enhance the efficiency of the approach when evolving effective DRs to solve the problem, the approach is improved with strategies which consist of a problem-specific attribute selection for GP and a threshold condition mechanism for fitness evaluation. The simulation results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the evolved DRs to the problem under consideration by comparing against the existing classical DRs. The statistical analysis of the simulation results shows that the evolved DRs outperform the selected benchmark DRs on the problem under study. The sensitivity analysis also shows that the DRs generated by the GPHH approach are robust under different scheduling performance measures. Moreover, the effects of the model parameters, including the percentage of jobs with ETPC and the machine utilization, on the performance of the DRs are investigated.},

Thus, appropriate optimization tools are needed to efficiently manage the operation of modern power systems. This paper considers the unit commitment problem of power systems under high wind energy penetration. To mitigate the potential negative effects of inaccurate wind energy forecast, a chance constrained model is employed to guarantee that supply and demand for energy be balanced at each time period over a finite planning horizon. As joint chance constraint is known to be difficult to handle analytically, two approximation approaches, namely quantile- and p p -efficiency-based, are proposed and benchmarked against the well-known scenario-based approximation. The results indicate that the proposed schemes provide feasible solutions and tight lower bounds of the true operation cost within a much shorter time frame than the scenario-based counterpart.},

PARPs have arcs associated with collectable prizes along with travelling costs.

A TD-PARP is to find a travelling route that maximises the profit i.e. total collected prizes minus total travelling costs. TD-PARPs have two facets: selecting a subset of arcs to be travelled and scheduling the selected arcs in the travelling route. TD-PARPs have not been studied much although they are more realistic and generic. In this paper, we first propose a set of deterministic heuristic search algorithms that range from a simple procedure producing quite good results in a fraction of a CPU second to a more extensive procedure producing high-quality results but at the expense of slightly extra CPU time. In this paper, we then propose a meta-heuristic based scatter search (SS) algorithm for TD-PARPs. For the improvement method in the SS algorithm, we propose a multi-operator algorithm that incorporates various neighbourhood operators to diversify the local exploration. For the combination method in the SS algorithm, we propose a 2-level path relinking procedure, which explores combinations of visited and unvisited arcs using two different operators. To control the diversity of the solutions in the SS algorithm, we propose a new effective distance measurement. The experimental results on standard benchmark problems indicate that the proposed SS algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The vehicle routing problem with an incompatible loading constraint and splitting deliveries by order is an extension of the well-known capacitated vehicle routing problem. Some orders cannot be transported alongside others due to some type of products in them or their special requirements on transportation condition. Additionally, splitting delivery by order is an effective method for enhancing vehicle efficiency since a customer might have many orders, and order is a set of compatible products. However, split delivery inevitably creates order receipt complexities and contributes to the significant complications of the problem in terms of formulating not only the model, but also the solution method. This study examines an innovative vehicle routing problem characterized by splitting deliveries by order, and addresses the inconvenience of order receipts and incompatibility among orders when fulfilling practical logistics requirements. We formulate this problem as an integer programming model, and the goal is to minimize the sum of routing cost and receipt cost. Then, two hybrid heuristic algorithms called MCWS-LS and S-ALNS are proposed to solve this problem. Furthermore, we conduct a series of experiments over existing vehicle routing problem instances, as well as analyze them under a realistic background to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the single-item capacitated lot sizing problem considering a 1-breakpoint all-units quantity discount. Assuming the fixed ordering cost and the undiscounted unit purchase price to be non-increasing over the periods, the lot sizing problem under study is a special case of that with piecewise concave production cost function investigated by Koca et al. (2014) . Koca’s DP algorithm solves our problem with a time complexity of O(T 7 ) , where T denotes the number of periods. It, however, fails in the case of large-sized instances in acceptable runtimes due to its higher complexity. Hence, the present study is a response to the need for more efficient algorithms to overcome this shortcoming. First, some properties of the optimal solution are proved. Second, these properties are exploited in an implicit enumeration exact algorithm. Third, certain speed-up techniques are employed to reduce the time complexity of the proposed algorithm from O(T 5 ) to O(T 4 ) . Finally, a heuristic algorithm is presented for the problem. The proposed algorithms are compared with Koca’s DP algorithm and the commercial solver used to solve some test problems. Based on the runtimes observed, the exact algorithms proposed in this study are found to outperform both Koca’s DP one and the commercial solver. Moreover, the heuristic algorithm developed herein is found to be faster than both the exact algorithms in finding optimal solutions to most problem instances.},

This reality forced many companies to become sensitive in dealing with this situation through rescheduling processes. While efficiency criteria are used to assess the performance of a scheduling system, in dynamic environments, stability criteria measure the impact of job deviation. Differently from previous works, this paper investigates a new performance measure to simultaneously assess schedule efficiency by the total weighted waiting times, and schedule stability by the weighted completion time deviation. This mix could be a very helpful and significant criterion in industrial and health care environments. The studied problem considers an identical parallel machine rescheduling with jobs arriving over time. Based on a predictive-reactive strategy, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model (MILP) is developed, as well as an iterative methodology for dealing with the online part. At last, numerical results are presented, discussing the impact of the efficiency-stability coefficient on the system performance, as well as the computing time to solve the described problem.},

  abstract     = {The inventory routing problem (IRP) is an integrated inventory and transportation planning problem that jointly determines the replenishment schedules for a given set of retailers, and the routing decisions for a supplier that distributes a product to the retailers over a finite planning horizon typically consisting of multiple periods. In the classical IRP, retailers are assumed to accept deliveries at any time during a given period. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. Although the supplier is the central decision maker, the retailers may also have operational restrictions preventing them from receiving deliveries at arbitrary times. With this motivation, we study the IRP with time windows and develop an exact algorithm to solve it. In particular, we propose a formulation and a branch-price-and-cut algorithm, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first exact approach specifically designed for solving the IRPTW. Our formulation involves both arc and route based variables to obtain an easier structure in the pricing problems. We use valid inequalities – originally derived for the lot sizing problem – to strengthen our formulation. The results of a computational study conducted on a set of newly generated benchmark instances demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, which is capable of identifying optimal or fairly good solutions to medium and large problem instances in reasonable computation times.},

A Bitcoin network is comprised of two interactive parties: individual miners and mining pool managers, each of which strives to maximize its own utility. In particular, individual miners choose which mining pool to join and decide on how much mining power to commit under limited constraints on the mining budget and mining power capacity; managers of mining pools determine how to allocate the mining reward and how to adjust the membership fee. In this work we investigate the miners’ and mining pool managers’ decisions in repeated Bitcoin mining competitions by building a Monte-Carlo discrete-event simulation model. Our simulation model (i) captures the behavior of these two parties and how their decisions affect each other, and (ii) characterizes the system-level dynamics of the blockchain in terms of the mining difficulty level and total mining power. In addition, we study the sensitivity of system performance metrics with respect to various control parameters.

The demand and return processes follow independent compound Poisson processes. We assume a random shelf life, a random lead time and early losses. Our objective is to find a replenishment level S , a reorder level s , and a threshold cancellation level ℓ ℓ that minimizes the total expected cost per time unit under lost sales. The cost structure includes variable and fixed costs for an order, a holding cost, a penalty cost, a handling cost for returns, a relocation cost, and costs for end of life and early loss. Via Markovian framework, we derive the steady-state probabilities for the inventory level, and construct closed-form expressions for the average cost functions. Using a numerical study, we investigate how the best S , s S,s and ℓ ℓ , are impacted by the system’s parameters, such as returns, demands (rate, mean and variability), and order cancellations. We illustrate the impact of the return flow on the best policy and the cost, and show that ignoring returns may yield a substantial loss. Consequently, we compare our model to a relatively simple one with no returns but with less demand, and specify when the latter model can be used as a good approximation. Finally, we identify situations where an earlier-cancellation policy is more cost effective. Our framework is completed by providing two efficient search algorithms for numerically finding the optimal parameters. We show that both algorithms significantly reduce the computational effort compared to the basic algorithm.},

In the ASVRP, there is a set of fish farms located in the sea, where each fish farm has one or more service tasks to be performed by a given heterogeneous fleet of service vessels with different capabilities. Some service tasks require simultaneous operation of more than one vessel and might also have time windows and precedence requirements. Furthermore, varying weather conditions make the sailing times and the service times of the tasks time dependent. The objective of the ASVRP is to maximize the value of the service tasks performed within a given planning horizon. We propose a time discrete optimization model for the ASVRP, formulated as a time dependent, prize collecting vehicle routing problem with synchronization constraints and time windows. Furthermore, we present an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) heuristic for solving the problem. Results on a number of test instances based on real world data show that both the ALNS heuristic and a commercial solver are able to find high quality solutions for small problem instances, while the ALNS heuristic is superior when the problem size increases.},

We assume that these two distributions are ambiguous, and only their mean values and ranges are known. Therefore, we construct a scenario-wise ambiguity set with two scenarios corresponding to the demand’s two distinct distributions. Then, we formulate a distributionally robust facility location (DRFL) model that seeks to find the number and locations of facilities to open that minimize the fixed cost of opening facilities and the worst-case (maximum) expectation of transportation and unmet demand costs. We take the worst-case expectations over all possible demand distributions residing in the scenario-wise ambiguity set. We propose a decomposition-based algorithm to solve our min–max DRFL model and derive lower bound inequalities that accelerate the algorithm’s convergence. In a series of numerical experiments, we demonstrate our approach’s superior computational and operational performance compared with the stochastic programming approach and a distributionally robust approach that does not consider the demand’s bimodality.

More precisely, given a database workload, each query must be served by at most one predefined set of indexes (named configuration ) to maximize the net gain in terms of time. This gain is made up of the time gain obtained to serve the queries through the configurations minus the fixed time needed to create and maintain those configurations. The clustering of indexes into configurations and the limited amount of memory available to store the indexes characterize our variant of the problem. At the same time, established approaches in the literature have only considered those two aspects separately. We model this setting as a generalization of the Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem with budget constraint and propose an Integer Linear Programming formulation for it. Then, to find near-optimal solutions in a reasonable computational time, we develop a Scatter Search meta-heuristic exploiting the specific facility location features of the problem.

However, setup time depends not only on the batch size but also on technological characteristics. This paper investigates a single batch scheduling problem with dual quantitative and technological setup times extracted from autoclave molding production. A mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) is established, in which the objective function is to minimize the makespan. The quantitative setup time is linear with the batch size, whereas the technological setup time is nonlinear with the occupied area of all jobs (jobs are represented by rectangles) in a batch. Three lower bounds are presented for evaluating the proposed algorithms. Then, a two-stage approximate algorithm is designed to solve the problem. The first stage concerns the normal batch processing time. In the second stage, an iterative local search method focuses on all terms in the objective function and improves the current solution’s quality. Finally, different scales of instances are designed to test the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithms.

  abstract     = {The Time Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (TCARP) extends the classical Capacitated Arc Routing Problem by considering time-based capacities instead of traditional loading capacities. In the TCARP, the costs associated with traversing and servicing arcs, as well as the vehicle’s capacity, are measured in time units. The increasing use of electric vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles , which use batteries of limited duration, illustrates the importance of time-capacitated routing problems. In this paper, we consider the TCARP with stochastic demands, i.e.: the actual demands on each edge are random variables which specific values are only revealed once the vehicle traverses the arc. This variability affects the service times, which also become random variables. The main goal then is to find a routing plan that minimizes the expected total time required to service all customers. Since a maximum time capacity applies on each route, a penalty time-based cost arises whenever a route cannot be completed within that limit. In this paper, a strategic oscillation simheuristic algorithm is proposed to solve this stochastic problem . The performance of our algorithm is tested in a series of numerical experiments that extend the classical deterministic instances into stochastic ones.},

  abstract     = {We consider logistic collaborations where multiple carriers collaborate by consolidating demands, combining delivery routes, and serving new customers. Logistic collaborations are known to provide numerous benefits such as an increase in profit as well as a reduction in emissions for all parties involved. One of the challenges associated with collaborations is the allocation of the additional profits. To this end, we model the corresponding profit allocation problem as a collaborative game. Here, the profit obtained by any subset of the collaborating carriers depends on the new customers served by the remaining carriers. Specifically, we try to determine an allocation in the core based on both the best-case profit and the worst-case profit that each subset of carriers can attain. To achieve this, we propose a heuristic row generation algorithm. We verify the performance of this algorithm on instances derived from benchmark instances of the capacitated vehicle routing problem . We show that our heuristic algorithm scales well with respect to the number of carriers considered and provides allocations similar to those obtained by enumerating all best-case and worst-case profits of each coalition.},

The proposed approach, referred to as MOPR/D , considers the localization of solutions in the objective space and can handle this information to make choices regarding intermediate solutions in the path-relinking trajectory. Because it does not require aggregation functions, it does not suffer from a tendency to introduce search bias to specific regions of the Pareto front. The proposed approach was compared with seven path-relinking techniques from the literature on three differently structured combinatorial optimization problems : 0/1 multidimensional knapsack , quadratic assignment, and spanning tree. Experiments were conducted on sets of benchmark instances with up to five objectives. This study also reviewed multi-objective path generation strategies, investigated their behaviors, and a taxonomy is proposed for standardizing and classifying them.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the problems of cell formation (CF) and cellular layout (CL) encountered in the design of a cellular manufacturing system are studied. A semi-robust cellular approach is proposed, which is able to cope with the continuous change of product mix and demand. At the heart of the proposed robust approach, the facility layout is not being changed from one period to the other, but rather the positions of the pick-up/drop-off points of cells. The developed model and solution algorithms can concurrently make the decisions regarding the optimum number of cells, CF and CL (both inter-and intra-cellular layout of unequal-area facilities). The problem is formulated as a multi-objective mathematical programming model. A modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (MNSGA-II) is then used to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions. In the proposed MNSGA-II, an improved non-dominated sorting strategy and a modified dynamic crowding distance procedure are implemented. The effectiveness of the MNSGA-II is evaluated against two well-known multi-objective optimization algorithms, namely multi-objective particle swarm optimization and non-dominated ranking genetic algorithm. To this aim, several numerical examples and computational experiments are carried out; five metrics are employed to evaluate the quality of the developed algorithms. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of e-commerce has led to an increase of home delivery requests. Providing efficient distribution systems for services on the last mile has become a challenging issue for logistics companies, where a trade-off between the classical approaches, attended home delivery (AHD) and usage of shared delivery locations (SDLs) has been identified. AHD provides a higher quality of service but implies very high costs for the company, while usage of SDL requires customers to perform the very last mile by themselves. For companies, this bears the risk of a decrease in the perceived service quality. However, due to consolidation effects, transportation costs can be considerably mitigated. We propose a mixed delivery approach, which combines AHD and SDL usage in an innovative way. Customers can either be served at home during their preferred time window, or they can be asked to pick up their parcel at one of the SDLs. For each customer served using an SDL, the company pays a compensation price in order to reduce the perceived decrease in service quality. The newly introduced decision problem is formulated mathematically. We propose two matheuristics to efficiently solve large instances. In an extensive numerical study , we show that the new approach clearly outperforms standard ones. We observe an increase in solution quality of up to 40\%, while customers’ perceived quality of service is not affected. Additionally, the results reveal that the obtained improvements are robust for different customer-specific time-window preferences, accepted travel times needed to reach an SDL, and different compensation schemes.},

  abstract     = {Personalized tourist route planning (TRP) and navigation are online or real-time applications whose mathematical modeling leads to complex optimization problems . These problems are usually formulated with mathematical programming and can be described as NP hard problems . Moreover, the state-of-the-art (SOA) path search algorithms do not perform efficiently in solving multi-objective optimization (MO) problems making them inappropriate for real-time processing. To address the above limitations and the need for online processing, a swarm intelligence graph-based pathfinding algorithm (SIGPA) for MO route planning was developed. SIGPA generates a population whose individuals move in a greedy approach based on A ∗ A∗ algorithm to search the solution space from different directions. It can be used to find an optimal path for every graph-based problem under various objectives. To test SIGPA, a generic MOTRP formulation is proposed. A generic TRP formulation remains a challenge since it has not been studied thoroughly in the literature. To this end, a novel mixed binary quadratic programming model is proposed for generating personalized TRP based on multi-objective criteria and user preferences, supporting, also, electric vehicles or sensitive social groups in outdoor cultural environments. The model targets to optimize the route under various factors that the user can choose, such as travelled distance, smoothness of route without multiple deviations, safety and cultural interest. The proposed model was compared to five SOA models for addressing TRP problems in 120 various scenarios solved with CPLEX solver and SIGPA. SIGPA was also tested in real scenarios with A* algorithm. The results proved the effectiveness of our model in terms of optimality but also the efficiency of SIGPA in terms of computing time. The convergence and the fitness landscape analysis showed that SIGPA achieved quality solutions with stable convergence.},

  abstract     = {The Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW) is a combinatorial optimization problem where the goal is to maximize the total score collected from different visited locations. The application of neural network models to combinatorial optimization has recently shown promising results in dealing with similar problems, like the Travelling Salesman Problem. A neural network allows learning solutions using reinforcement learning or supervised learning, depending on the available data. After the learning stage, it can be generalized and quickly fine-tuned to further improve performance and personalization. The advantages are evident since, for real-world applications, solution quality, personalization, and execution times are all important factors that should be taken into account. This study explores the use of Pointer Network models trained using reinforcement learning to solve the OPTW problem. We propose a modified architecture that leverages Pointer Networks to better address problems related with dynamic time-dependent constraints. Among its various applications, the OPTW can be used to model the Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP). We train the Pointer Network with the TTDP problem in mind, by sampling variables that can change across tourists visiting a particular instance-region: starting position, starting time, available time, and the scores given to each point of interest. Once a model-region is trained, it can infer a solution for a particular tourist using beam search. We based the assessment of our approach on several existing benchmark OPTW instances. We show that it generalizes across different tourists that visit each region and that it generally outperforms the most commonly used heuristic, while computing the solution in realistic times.},

  abstract     = {Most existing facility location and network design models assume the facility cost as either a fixed cost term or a linear/concave function of the volume of demand assigned to a facility. In particular, a concave cost function implies decreasing marginal cost and exhibits economies of scale . However, when the assigned demand volume exceeds a certain level, diseconomies of scale may occur due to facility congestions, overuse of resources, increasing operational complexity, and so on, leading to a convex cost function with increasing marginal cost. This paper studies a warehouse–retailer network design problem , which simultaneously optimizes the warehouse locations, the warehouse–retailer assignment, and the multi-echelon inventory replenishment policy to minimize the total cost, including the warehouse location and operating costs, the inventory replenishment cost, and the transportation cost. In this paper, the warehouse operating cost is defined as a general function of the volume of demand assigned to a warehouse, which could be concave first due to economies of scale and then convex due to diseconomies of scale. We formulate this problem as a set-covering model and propose a column generation algorithm to solve its linear relaxation. The pricing problem of the column generation process, although formulated as a nonlinear mixed integer program , has nice structural properties and can be solved efficiently by a branch-and-bound method. To validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed column generation algorithm, we conduct numerical studies based on randomly generated instances . Numerical results also demonstrate the impact of economies and diseconomies of scale on network design decisions and warehouse operating cost.},

We refer to this problem as the single ship pick-up and delivery problem with pick-up time windows, tank allocations and changeovers (s-PDP-TWTAC). We propose a formulation for the s-PDP-TWTAC that is significantly smaller in size when compared to the existing approaches. Even though our formulation requires significantly lesser computational effort than others, it is still challenging to solve for large realistic networks. We propose a linear programming based neighbourhood search heuristic to find good solutions to these problems. We also describe an instance generator for creating random but realistic instances, and a library of instances that have been created for testing and benchmarking.},

  abstract     = {The complexity of the socio-economic environment requires the involvement of a group of decision makers in the decision-making process. They can contribute the diversity of knowledge and experience that allow all the important aspects of the decision-making problem to be taken into account. In the aggregation process, the weights of the decision makers play an important role. In this paper we have focused on the group analytic hierarchy process (AHP). We emphasized the homogeneity of the opinions of the decision makers as the basis for determining the importance weights of the decision makers. We reviewed the projection method and its upgrades for determining decision makers weights and demonstrated with examples that they are not suitable for application in AHP. We proposed a new symmetric projection method that eliminates the imperfections of the previous projection methods. We proposed a Symmetric Projection Group Approach (SPGA) to derive group weights in AHP. To validate the SPGA, we selected four evaluation measures. The evaluation of the examples shows that the SPGA achieves good evaluation results compared to the other methods for deriving decision makers weights and is suitable for real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {It is well-known that the demand rate for some products depends on several factors, such as price, time, and stock, among others. Moreover, the holding cost can vary over time. More specifically, it increases with time since a long period of storage requires more expensive warehouse facilities. This research introduces an inventory model with shortages for a single product where the demand rate depends simultaneously on both the selling price and time according to a power pattern. Shortages are completely backordered. Demand for the product jointly combines the impact of the selling price and a time power function, which is performed as an addition. Furthermore, the holding cost is a power of the time that the product is held in storage. The main objective is to derive the optimal inventory policy such that the total profit per unit of time is maximized. For optimizing the inventory problem , some theoretical results are derived first to prove that the total profit function is strictly pseudo concave with respect to the decision variables. Next, an efficient algorithm that obtains the optimal solution is provided. The proposed inventory model is a general model because it contains several published inventory models as special cases. Some numerical examples are presented and solved to illustrate and validate the proposed inventory model. Also, a sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to highlight and generate significant insights.},

However, current research mainly focused on airlines&#39; interests, ignoring the influencing factors that lead to primary delays, which makes the temporal and spatial distribution of flight schedules unreasonable. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to reduce operational delays at a strategic level by considering operational efficiency and airline interests. The displacement probability distribution between the actual execution time and the scheduled time is first mined from the historical operation data. We then develop a model with the ultimate objective of improving the punctuality rate and reducing the actual operational delays by minimizing the total operational displacement. In addition to considering the basic operational restrictions of airports, the model also introduces the corridor capacity of the terminal airspace surrounding an airport, reducing the delay caused by the corridor flow control to a certain extent. The proposed model is applied to Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport in China. The experimental results suggest that the optimized flight schedule can significantly reduce flight delay, conforms to airport operational restrictions, and maintains flight connectivity.},

  abstract     = {Mixed-model assembly lines enable a flow-oriented mass production of individualized products such as cars. The most investigated operational decision problems in this domain are the sequencing problem, which plans the initial sequence of cars launched down the line, and the resequencing problem, which alters a given car sequence by applying resequencing buffers. This dichotomy of existing research neglects a third, even more short-term decision level: launch control under real-time conditions. In large automotive assembly lines unforeseen disturbances are rather the norm, so that one of the most important decisions to maintain a smooth and error-free production flow is the continuous launching decision of the next car model released from the central chassis storage system into final assembly. The launching decision in every cycle is made in a central control room (or leitstand) and has to consider the current state of the assembly line itself, with all potential time delays and defects in any assembly station, along with all part feeding processes under real-time conditions. This paper provides an integrated solution approach for real-time launch control that applies sophisticated optimization procedures considering both the workflow along the assembly line and its impact on part feeding processes. We test our real-time approach in a simulation study and compare it with alternative launching approaches. Our results show that sophisticated real-time optimization clearly outperforms its competitors. Furthermore, an integrated approach including part feeding aspects can considerably reduce safety stocks of parts within workstations.},

  abstract     = {With recent emergence of machine learning problems with massive number of features, feature selection (FS) has become an ever-increasingly important tool to mitigate the effects of the so-called curse of dimensionality . FS aims to eliminate redundant and irrelevant features for models that are faster to train, easier to understand, and less prone to overfitting. This study presents a wrapper FS method based on Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) with Barzilai and Borwein (BB) non-monotone gains within a pseudo-gradient descent framework wherein performance is measured via cross-validation. We illustrate that SPSA with BB gains (SPSA-BB) provides dramatic improvements in terms of the number of iterations for convergence with minimal degradation in cross-validated error performance over the current state-of-the art approach with monotone gains (SPSA-MON). In addition, SPSA-BB requires only one internal parameter and therefore it eliminates the need for careful fine-tuning of numerous other internal parameters as in SPSA-MON or comparable meta-heuristic FS methods such as genetic algorithms (GA). Our particular implementation includes gradient averaging as well as gain smoothing for better convergence properties . We present computational experiments on various public datasets with Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes classifiers as wrappers. We present comparisons of SPSA-BB against full set of features, SPSA-MON, as well as seven popular meta-heuristics based FS algorithms including GA and particle swarm optimization . Our results indicate that SPSA-BB converges to a good feature set in about 50 iterations on the average regardless of the number of features (whether a dozen or more than 1000 features) and its performance is quite competitive. SPSA-BB can be considered extremely fast for a wrapper method and therefore it stands as a high-performing new feature selection method that is also computationally feasible in practice.},

  abstract     = {Robust scheduling for target tracking with a wireless sensor network (WSN), focuses on the deployment of a WSN in a remote area to monitor a set of moving targets. Each sensor operates on a battery and is able to communicate with reachable sensors in the network. The targets are typically moving vehicles (planes, trains, cars,…) passing through the area. In order to monitor the targets, an activation schedule is sought such that the sensor network is continuously collecting data about the targets. Additionally, the transfer of the data collected to a base station deployed near the network also has to be planned. In this work, we consider that the trajectories of the targets are estimated. i.e. , during the mission, at each time instant t , there is a given position where the target is expected. However, such estimations are inaccurate and deviations can occur. In this work, we formulate the problem of spatial robust scheduling. The aim is to produce an activation schedule for the sensors such that the targets are covered as long as they remain no farther from their estimated positions than a maximized value, called the spatial stability radius of the schedule. Afterwards, we formulate the spatio-temporal robustness problem. It is a bi-objective problem, with a spatial stability radius and a temporal stability radius for covering delays and advances. Two algorithms are proposed to solve these problems, and we show their efficiency through several numerical experiments.},

A new lower bound is also constructed for the sum of path-endpoints coloring which is used alongside an existing lower bound from the literature on two bounding procedures. Computational experiments on benchmark data sets show that the proposed lower bound improves considerably upon the known lower bound from the literature.

  abstract     = {The discrete parallel machine makespan scheduling location (ScheLoc) problem is an integrated combinatorial optimization problem that combines facility location and job scheduling. The problem consists in choosing the locations of multiple machines among a finite set of candidates and scheduling a set of jobs on these machines, aiming to minimize the makespan. Depending on the machine location, the jobs may have different release dates, and thus the location decisions have a direct impact on the scheduling decisions. To solve the problem, it is proposed a new arc-flow formulation, a column generation and three heuristic procedures that are evaluated through extensive computational experiments. By embedding the proposed procedures into a framework algorithm, we are able to find proven optimal solutions for all benchmark instances from the related literature and to obtain small percentage gaps for a new set of challenging instances.},

  abstract     = {A problem of scheduling n n unit-time jobs with a small number of distinct release dates and deadlines, on identical parallel machines, to minimize the number of active machines is studied. The feature that makes this problem challenging is that no machine can stand idle between its start and completion times. A number of properties of this problem is established, and heuristic and optimal algorithms based on these properties are designed. They include optimal algorithms with running times O ( k n k ) O(knk) and O ( k n 2 3 n ) O(kn23n) for the general case, where k k is the number of distinct release dates and deadlines, optimal O ( n log n ) O(nlogn) algorithms for the cases of a common release date or a common deadline, and an optimal O ( k n 2 ) O(kn2) algorithm for the case of agreeable release dates and deadlines. Algorithms to find lower and upper bounds on the optimal (minimal) number of active machines are developed, and an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation with O ( k ) O(k) variables and O ( k 2 ) O(k2) constraints is provided. Computer experiments demonstrated that the ILP problem is solved by CPLEX to optimality within a few hours for n ≤ 400 n≤400 and k ≤ 50 k≤50 , and that the quality of the lower and upper bounds is sufficiently good.},

We present an open-source computational software system for facilitating the design of warehouse layouts to near-optimality considering average walking distance of the picker as the objective function. This software is particularly novel because a wide variety of traditional and innovative designs are automatically generated and evaluated. For the warehouse design parameters we consider the rectangular aspect ratio of the floor plan, the number and location of cross aisles, the number and location of pick aisles, and the location of a single input/output location. The main components of the design system are importing pick list profile data, creating the warehouse layout design as a network, product allocation (slotting) of SKUs through the warehouse, routing of pickers on a sample of orders using an exact routing algorithm, and design optimization using a meta-heuristic. We provide both mathematical and computational descriptions of the algorithms used by the software system, describe the types of problems that can be solved, and summarize our computational experience.

  abstract     = {The bin packing problem is one of the most studied combinatorial optimization problem . This paper proposes two novel bin packing problem settings with many practical applications, in particular in logistics capacity planning. Both problems explicitly consider, besides the classical bin-selection costs, the item and bin-specific item-to-bin assignment costs. These assignment costs depend not only on the physical, e.g., item and bin size, and economic, e.g., bin selection fixed cost and the cost of item “transport” by the bin, but also on the temporal attributes of items and bins, e.g., availability of regular bins for selection and utilization and of items to be assigned to such a regular bin. Special, item-specific in terms of size, spot-market bins may be used at higher cost for the items one cannot fit into the selected bins. Single and a multi-period formulations are proposed, both aiming to minimize the total cost of the system computed as the sum of the fixed costs of the selected bins and the total item-to-bin assignment cost using regular and spot-market bins. The multi-period formulation optimizes the cost over all the time periods considered. Several constructive heuristics are proposed, three for the single-period model, and four for the multi-period formulation. The heuristics are evaluated and compared through an extensive computational experimentation. The numerical results show the high level of performance of the proposed heuristics in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency, as well as the potential benefits of using the new models in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Clustering addresses the problem of assigning similar objects to groups. Since the size of the clusters is often constrained in practical clustering applications, various capacitated clustering problems have received increasing attention. We consider here the capacitated p p -median problem (CPMP) in which p p objects are selected as cluster centers (medians) such that the total distance from these medians to their assigned objects is minimized. Each object is associated with a weight, and the total weight in each cluster must not exceed a given capacity. Numerous exact and heuristic solution approaches have been proposed for the CPMP. The state-of-the-art approach performs well for instances with up to 5 , 000 5,000 objects but becomes computationally expensive for instances with a much larger number of objects. We propose a matheuristic with new problem decomposition strategies that can deal with instances comprising up to 500 , 000 500,000 objects. In a computational experiment, the proposed matheuristic consistently outperformed the state-of-the-art approach on medium- and large-scale instances while having similar performance for small-scale instances. As an extension, we show that our matheuristic can be applied to related capacitated clustering problems, such as the capacitated centered clustering problem (CCCP). For several test instances of the CCCP, our matheuristic found new best-known solutions.},

We develop an extended mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation built on a predefined piecewise linear approximation. Then, we adopt the so-called dynamic cut generation approach to be able to use the proposed MIP formulation with no prior approximation of the cost function. Also, we demonstrate how to extend the dynamic cut generation approach to consider the exact inventory cost in the objective function. We show the computational performance of the proposed MIP model with the dynamic cut generation approach in an extensive numerical study where second order cone programming formulations developed in the literature are used as benchmark. The results reveal that the proposed MIP model deployed with the dynamic cut generation yields a superior computational performance as compared to the benchmark formulations especially when the order of compression cost function is higher.},

This work addresses a constrained graph clustering problem in biological networks where (1) subgraph connectivity constraints are strictly required to be satisfied and (2) clustering quality is assessed with respect to pairwise constraint violations. Existing constrained graph clustering methods often fail to fully satisfy connectivity constraints. This paper presents an iterated local search algorithm which aims to find the clustering with the highest quality in a short computing time. Experiments demonstrate how the proposed solutions are of good quality, often being optimal. Additionally, the proposed method significantly outperforms an existing branch-and-cut algorithm in terms of computational runtime and produces competitive results with regard to other local search techniques and graph clustering algorithms. Furthermore, a multilevel algorithm for clustering is designed to handle large-scale graphs. The performance of the overall scheme for a variety of coarsening methods from the literature is studied on a large number of biological networks exceeding 10,000 genes.},

  abstract     = {We consider the Boolean Quadratic Programming problem with Generalized Upper Bound constraints ( BQP-GUB ). This problem belongs to the NP-hard complexity class of problems and is a generalization of the Quadratic Semi-Assignment Problem ( QSAP ), which has applications in different areas such as production planning and image segmentation. Non-exact methods for solving BQP-GUB instances are commonly based on exploring solution neighborhoods, which consist of flip moves that choose an even number of binary variables and flip their values to the complementary value (from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1). In order to find fairly good solutions, these methods must evaluate a large number of flip moves, and that can be time consuming. The best-known formulae used to evaluate flip moves for BQP-GUB take O ( nr ) O(nr) time, where n is the number of variables and r is the number of flips. In this paper, we seek to improve the processing time of evaluating flip moves. We extend the results in the literature and prove two closed-form formulae for evaluating flip moves in O ( mr ) O(mr) and O ( r 2 ) O(r2) times, where m is the number of variables with values equal to one. Additionally, for experimental purposes, we prove a reduction from QSAP to BQP-GUB . We report on computational experiments with local search and Iterated Tabu Search algorithms using our formulae and those in the literature. Our results show that the implementations using one of our formulae achieved the best performance in all of the experiments.},

  abstract     = {Permutation flow shop scheduling problem with makespan criterion is known to be NP-hard if the number of machines is greater than two. The most known polynomial complexity algorithm for solving PFSP is the constructive NEH heuristic. In this paper we propose the N -NEH+ algorithm which extends the classical NEH heuristic and which is, to our best knowledge, the first deterministic constructive algorithm that can produce a family of solutions having equal quality. The main idea of the N -NEH+ algorithm is to use a list (called N -list) of N jobs to be candidates for partial sequencing. The results of the extensive numerical experiments confirm that the N -list technique performs well in improving the NEH heuristic. Moreover, the proposed approach can be easily adapted for a multi-core processing environment, which is very difficult with other constructive algorithms. Another advantage of the proposed technique is that it can be used to improve many other algorithms for solving permutation flow shop problems.},

  abstract     = {Appointment scheduling has many applications (e.g., surgery scheduling, airport gate scheduling, container vessel dockings and radiation therapy bookings) and it has a direct and significant operational and economic impact. For example, in healthcare, surgical departments are one of the main drivers of hospital costs and revenue, and appointment scheduling is used to book surgeries. Effective scheduling not only enables patients’ timely access to care but also enables more efficient operations. This becomes especially important as healthcare costs and demand are on the rise in many countries. We study appointment scheduling where there are jobs (e.g., patients, container vessels, airplanes) with random processing durations, an expensive processor (e.g., a doctor, dock crane, airport gate) and significant costs for processor idle time, processor overtime, and job waiting. The goal is to determine an appointment schedule that minimizes a measure of total costs as the objective. The appointment scheduling problem has been well studied in the literature with the expected cost objective. Almost all papers in the literature on appointment scheduling use the expected cost criterion, which may not be suitable when risk measures and/or service levels are considered. In this paper, we study this problem with a new objective: minimization of any quantile of the cost distribution, e.g., median, 90th percentile. We obtain theoretical results for some special cases and develop an algorithm for the general case. Our algorithm does not require a specific distribution assumption and can work directly with data samples. We present numerical examples with real data on surgeries. Our results show that allocated schedules based on the quantile objective with identical jobs are different than the ones generated by the expected cost objective and they do not show the well-known dome-shaped pattern but a semi-dome-shaped pattern which first increases (like the dome-shaped pattern) but then its decrease is not monotone (unlike the dome-shaped pattern). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper on appointment scheduling problem with the objective of the quantile function minimization.},

The multiple facilities case is solved by means of the application of an alternate-location-allocation heuristic, characterized by embedded exact and approximate procedures. For large instances, we propose a heuristic (with polynomial time complexity) which provides near-optimal solutions in a short computational time and a negligible gap. Finally, for testing purposes, we use a benchmark based on the transformation of the main problem into an equivalent p-median problem. Experimental results evidence the efficiency and validity of the proposed heuristics, which are capable of obtaining high quality solutions within acceptable computation times.},

  abstract     = {We consider an uncapacitated location problem where p facilities have to be located in order to serve a given set of customers, and we assume that a customer requesting for a service has to reach a facility at his/her own cost. In this setting, a central issue is that of fairness among customers for the accessibility to the services provided. Every choice regarding the location of facilities corresponds to a distance distribution of customers to reach an open facility. Minimizing the average of this distribution would lead to a p -median problem, where system efficiency is optimized but the fair treatment of users is neglected. Minimizing the maximum (worst-case) of the distribution would lead to a p -center problem, where the unfair treatment of users is mitigated but system efficiency is neglected. To compromise between these two extremes, we minimize the conditional β β -mean, i.e., the average distance traveled by the 100 × β\% 100×β\% of customers farther from a facility. We call Fair Facility Location Problem (FFLP( β β )) the resulting optimization problem, which is formulated as a Mixed-Integer linear Program (MIP) with a proven integer-friendly property. We propose a heuristic framework to produce a set of representative solutions to the FFLP( β β ). The framework is based on Kernel Search, a heuristic scheme that has been shown to obtain high-quality solutions for a number of MIPs. Computational experiments are reported to validate the quality of the solutions found by the proposed solution algorithm, and to provide some general guidelines regarding the trade-off between average and worst-case optimization. Finally, we report on a case study stemming from the screening activities related to the pandemic triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The case study regards the optimal location of a number of drive-thru temporary testing sites for collecting swab specimens.},

The first criterion is maximized, while the two others are minimized. The first and the third criteria are not classical in scheduling theory, but are justified in industrial settings.

The goal is to extract the largest possible convex or non-convex object from the solid material. There are two variants of the problem: the general case where the solid material is non-convex and its special case consisting of a convex solid material. We propose a matheuristic approach for solving both problems. For the special case, the problem is also modeled as a non-linear programming formulation. Meanwhile, for the general case a mixed integer linear programming formulation is provided based on the decomposition of the non-convex material into a finite number of convex regions. Computational experiments evaluate the performance of both models for small-scale instances considering objects with at most 1400 and 370 vertices for the special and general case, respectively. We observe that the required computational effort increases with the number of vertices of the objects, therefore, it is also evaluated the efficiency of the proposed matheuristic approach for more complicated instances, considering objects with a higher number of vertices.

For the problem, two mixed integer programming models are proposed in order to explore their relative efficiencies in obtaining optimal solutions and linear programming relaxation lower bounds. Furthermore, due to the fact that the complicating constraints involve pairs of items (the sequence-dependent setups) and pairs of consecutive periods (the setup carryovers), making it difficult to decompose the problem per item or per period, we instead present a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition reformulation per machine to improve lower bounds. We propose a branching and selection method to solve the problem, in which a collection of variables rather than individual variables are put into a data-driven process to generate useful information which is then adopted in the branching and selection process. Extensive numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm can obtain numerically near-optimal solutions for small-scale problems and outperforms CPLEX and other heuristics in terms of both solution quality and runtime when the scale of instances increases.

  abstract     = {In this article we examine a specific version of the temporal bin packing problem (TBPP) that occurs in job-to-server scheduling. The TBPP represents a generalization of the well-known bin packing problem (BPP) with respect to an additional time dimension, and it requires to find the minimum number of bins (servers) to accommodate a given list of items (jobs) at any instant of time. In addition to this goal, recent publications suggest to also incorporate the number of fire-ups of the respective servers as an important factor in sustainable and energy-efficient overall operation. Addressing both these objectives by a weighted sum method typically increases the modeling complexity, thus leading to challenging ILP formulations, two of which have already been described in the literature. It has been shown that the parameter used to weight the two objectives strongly influences the applicability of heuristics and, therefore, the difficulty of the overall problem, so that only favorable choices can be handled so far. Even for these tailored scenarios, the current approaches already fail to compute an exact solution of many moderately-sized instances in reasonable times. For this reason, we propose various new preprocessing techniques to strengthen the LP bound and/or to reduce the numbers of variables or constraints appearing in the existing ILP formulations as well as one alternative modeling approach for the problem under consideration. Based on numerical tests with differently characterized sets of benchmark instances, the new and improved formulations are shown to lead (on average) to better performances (than compact state-of-the-art models) in terms of instances solved to optimality and computation times.},

The objective is to minimize the maximum total expected weighted costs of customers’ waiting times and service providers’ idle times and overtimes over multiple stages under the worst-case distribution of service times. For the DR multi-stage appointment scheduling model, we first establish linear relationships among performance indicators (i.e., waiting times, idle times and overtimes), and then develop a cutting-plane approach to solve it. To overcome the difficulty of implementing the cutting-plane approach, we reformulate the inner maximization problem in the DR model as a mixed-integer linear program. Finally, computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the computational and simulational performance of the DR model, investigate the structure of the optimal schedule and examine the efficiency of some potential sequencing heuristics.},

This greedy approach trains trees very fast, but, by its nature, their classification accuracy may not be competitive against other state-of-the-art procedures. Moreover, controlling critical issues, such as the misclassification rates in each of the classes, is difficult. To address these shortcomings, optimal decision trees have been recently proposed in the literature, which use discrete decision variables to model the path each observation will follow in the tree. Instead, we propose a new approach based on continuous optimization . Our classifier can be seen as a randomized tree, since at each node of the decision tree a random decision is made.

The optimization literature on cross-docking has mostly focused on the modeling and solution of problems considering a single cross-docking facility. Networks with multiple cross-docks remain rather unexplored and the few papers that deal with the problem do this by simplifying the geometry of the goods. We intend to shorten this gap by proposing a mixed-integer linear programming model for optimizing distribution and delay costs for the transportation of goods in open networks with multiple cross-docks considering the three-dimensional aspects of the cargo. Also, we propose a logic-based Benders decomposition strategy which allow for the solution of larger instances when compared with those that can be handled by a branch-and-cut MIP solver. Experiments showed that the decomposition can handle instances with two times more nodes and five times more boxes than a direct use of the solver. Also, the framework is flexible enough to accommodate other features of practical cases.},

  abstract     = {The use of electric buses is expected to rise due to its environmental benefits. However, electric vehicles are less flexible than conventional diesel buses due to their limited driving range and longer recharging times. Therefore, scheduling electric vehicles adds further operational difficulties. Additionally, various labor regulations challenge public transport companies to find a cost-efficient crew schedule. Vehicle and crew scheduling problems essentially define the cost of operations. In practice, these two problems are often solved sequentially. In this paper, we introduce the integrated electric vehicle and crew scheduling problem (E-VCSP). Given a set of timetabled trips and recharging stations, the E-VCSP is concerned with finding vehicle and crew schedules that cover the timetabled trips and satisfy operational constraints, such as limited driving range of electric vehicles and labor regulations for the crew while minimizing total operational cost. An adaptive large neighborhood search that utilizes branch-and-price heuristics is proposed to tackle the E-VCSP. The proposed method is tested on real-life instances from public transport companies in Denmark and Sweden that contain up to 1109 timetabled trips. The heuristic approach provides evidence of improving efficiency of transport systems when the electric vehicle and crew scheduling aspects are considered simultaneously. By comparing to the traditional sequential approach, the heuristic finds improvements in the range of 1.17–4.37\% on average. A sensitivity analysis of the electric bus technology is carried out to indicate its implications for the crew schedule and the total operational cost. The analysis shows that the operational cost decreases with increasing driving range (120–250 km) of electric vehicles.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of industry-4.0 era, industrial production are evolving towards high flexibility, diversity, customisation, and dynamism. We address a realistic scenario of a smart manufacturing system, which concerns the production scheduling of complex multi-level products under a dynamic flexible job shop environment with shop floor disruptions incorporated. The products are assembled from multiple basic parts, whose fabrication processes are highly flexible, involving alternative process plans, alternative machines and alternative processing sequences of operations. We aim at providing Pareto solutions, with consideration of three typical optimisation objectives, including makespan, maximum machine workload, and total tardiness. A hybrid MPGA-CP approach is designed for the problem. To the best our knowledge, this is the first attempt to embed an exact optimisation technique into a meta-heuristic algorithm in the domain of production scheduling. Compared with other alternative approaches, its efficiency and performance are proven to be outstanding in solving medium-to-large scale problems, covering the largest proportion of Pareto solutions among all tested approaches. Furthermore, we constructed a simulation model of a real-time production scheduling control system, in which our approach is embedded as the kernel algorithm, to study the impacts of some uncertainties that are concerned in practice. Based on the results of simulation experiments and sensitivity analysis, meaningful managerial insights have been provided.},

In this paper, we introduce a mobile multi-agent sensing problem and present a mathematical formulation. The model can be represented as a submodular maximization problem under a partition matroid constraint, which is NP-hard in general. The optimal solution of the model can be considered computationally intractable. Therefore, we propose two decent algorithms based on the greedy approach, which are global greedy and sequential greedy algorithms , respectively. We show that the sequential greedy algorithm is competitive with the global greedy algorithm and has advantages of computation times. Moreover, we present new approximation ratios of the sequential greedy algorithm and prove tightness of the ratios.

We first present a mathematical model as the representation of the problem, and then establish a network graph model to describe the structural characteristics of the problem and develop a new neighborhood structure. The neighborhood structure defines four move types for different objectives. Next, we propose a hybrid many-objective evolutionary algorithm (HMEA), which is designed to better balance exploitation and exploration. In this algorithm, the tabu search with the neighborhood structure is proposed to improve the local search ability. A reference-point based non-dominated sorting selection is presented to guide the algorithm to search towards the Pareto-optimal front and maintain diversity of solutions. Through three sets of experiments based on 28 benchmark instances, the partial and overall effects of this algorithm are evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HMEA in solving the MaOFJSP_T/S.},

We show that the problem is strongly NP-Hard. Experts in real life make use of a heuristic. Yet, the heuristic calls vehicles in their preventive maintenance cycles as early as possible, which increases the number of maintenance calls in the long term. We build a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that handles all aspects of this problem. To improve the quality of the model, we modify it based on the structure of the problem and call MILP2. We enhance the heuristic and name ImprHeur. We introduce ImprHeur to provide a starting solution for the MILP2 model and call ImprHeur + MILP2. We perform computational experiments on random test instances and show that the ImprHeur + MILP2 drastically heightens the solution quality of the MILP model. We define key performance indicators (KPI) to assess the system behavior. We create a discrete-event simulation framework for different problem parameters to test the performance of these heuristics and ImprHeur + MILP2. We conclude that ImprHeur + MILP2 improves the real life heuristic by 74.72\% with regard to the objective function value of the MILP model.},

  abstract     = {In the past decades, the resource on the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) has grown rapidly, resulting in an overwhelming amount of solution procedures that provide (near)-optimal solutions in a reasonable time. Despite the rapid progress, little is still known what makes a project instance hard to solve. Inspired by a previous research study that has shown that even small instances with only up to 30 activities is sometimes hard to solve, the current study provides an analysis of the project data used in the academic literature. More precisely, it investigates the ability of four well-known resource indicators to predict the hardness of an RCPSP instance. The study introduces a new instance equivalence concept to show that instances might have very different values for their resource indicators without changing any possible solution for this instance. The concept is based on four theorems and a search algorithm that transforms existing instances into new equivalent instances with more compact resources. This algorithm illustrates that the use of resource indicators to predict the hardness of an instance is sometimes misleading. In a set of computational experiment on more than 10,000 instances, it is shown that the newly constructed equivalent instances have values for the resource indicators that are not only different than the values of the original instances, but also often are better in predicting the hardness the project instances. It is suggested that the new equivalent instances are used for further research to compare results on the new instances with results obtained from the original dataset.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to solve a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation for the admission control of elective patients. To manage the elective patients from multiple specialties equitably and efficiently, we establish a waiting list and assign each patient a time-dependent dynamic priority score. Then, taking the random arrivals of patients into account, sequential decisions are made on a weekly basis. At the end of each week, we select the patients to be treated in the following week from the waiting list. By minimizing the cost function of the MDP over an infinite horizon, we seek to achieve the best trade-off between the patients’ waiting times and the over-utilization of surgical resources. Considering the curses of dimensionality resulting from the large scale of realistically sized problems, we first analyze the structural properties of the MDP and propose an algorithm that facilitates the search for best actions. We then develop a novel reinforcement-learning-based ADP algorithm as the solution technique. Experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithms consume much less computation time in comparison with that required by conventional dynamic programming methods. Additionally, the algorithms are shown to be capable of computing high-quality near-optimal policies for realistically sized problems.},

  abstract     = {We consider a special case of resource leveling problem with variable job duration and period-aggregated resource consumption. The objective function is to minimize the total extra resource cost required to complete all jobs before the hard project deadline. All jobs must be implemented without any preemption. The planning horizon is divided into periods, each period is characterized by an available level of resources of each type. For each job, resource consumption varies from one period to another. It is possible to control the speed of the job execution: if more resources are allocated to a job, then the job is executed faster if fewer resources are used, the job takes more time. A problem solution defines the start and end times for each job, but also its resource usage per period. On contrary to former models of this problem, our formulation allows an independent resource usage for each resource type. This approach can reach more flexible solutions with lower cost objective function value. We develop a Benders decomposition algorithm to solve this new formulation. Several enhancements are also implemented, such as the construction of effective bounds and multi-cut generation with the single search tree (Branch&amp;Benders cuts). Numerical experiments on several sets of instances demonstrate the advantage of the algorithm in comparison with the basic model and a CPLEX built-in Benders decomposition.},

To be specific, our work highlights that spare capacities of operating rail and bus lines can provide complementary services to disrupted commuters and should be taken into consideration in disruption recovery plan. To this end, an integrated network is constructed, which consists of remaining available rail lines, existing operating bus lines and newly introduced bridging bus lines. Based on this network, alternative traveling routes for disrupted commuters are generated from a multimodal k -shortest path model. The model captures the fact that commuters can have several alternative routes in practice. They usually select one from them rather than insist on the shortest path. In addition, commuters may transfer between different lines when rerouting their travel. Based on the outputs of the aforementioned models, a stochastic programming model is developed for the design of bus bridging services plan within bus resource limit. The objective of the model is to minimize the expected unsatisfied commuter demand under rail transit disruptions, considering uncertainties in commuter demand and spare capacities of existing rail and bus lines. The proposed models are demonstrated on the core part of the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit network.},

The model incorporates risk measures to resolve the stochastic scheduling problem where the uncertainty of demand, transit time and unloading time are taken into account. The developed model considers the transit cargoes and the various transportation options under time window limitations. In order to select the most effective risk measure, four well-known risk measures are evaluated including Value at Risk ( VaR ), Conditional Value at Risk ( CVaR ), Tail Value at Risk ( TVaR ) and Mean Absolute Deviation ( MAD ). A two-phase hierarchical algorithm with an integrated novel Golden Search ( GS ) algorithm is developed to deal with the proposed bi-objective model. In order to cope with the large scale problems , the Sample Average Approximation ( SAA ) and Scenario Decomposition ( SD ) methods are further proposed. A Lagrangian Decomposition ( LD ) algorithm is then developed to estimate the best lower bound of the SD .

  abstract     = {A 1-block in a binary matrix is any maximal sequence of 1s occurring consecutively in the same row. Consecutive block minimization (CBM) requires a permutation of the matrix columns that minimizes the number of 1-blocks. CBM is NP-hard for matrices with a maximum of two 1s per row and an arbitrary number of 1s per column. First, we prove that it is NP-hard even when it is restricted to binary matrices having a maximum of two 1s per row and a maximum of three 1s per column. In these circumstances, a reasonable and traditional approach to solve the problem is to design a heuristic capable of finding good configurations within acceptable computation times. This paper proposes an Iterated Local Search (ILS) metaheuristic . A binary matrix satisfies the strong consecutive ones property (is strongly C1P) if its non-zero entries occur consecutively in each row. It is C1P if there is a permutation of its columns such that the resulting matrix is strongly C1P. In this study, two necessary conditions for a binary matrix to be C1P are provided, each allowing to define a neighborhood for local search (LS). In addition, a third large-scale neighborhood is proposed where the local optimal solution can be directly obtained by solving a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It is noteworthy that the three neighborhoods are being proposed for the first time. The ILS algorithm is tested on a dataset from the OR-library, composed of thirty large-scale set covering instances of varying sizes and densities. Comparison with two TSP solvers as well as with a recently published metaheuristic, from both accuracy and computing time points of view, allows to conclude that the proposed method competes favorably with the methods available in the literature.},

Given its intractability, instances of relevant size of additive manufacturing (AM) machine scheduling problem cannot be solved in reasonable computational times through mathematical models. For this reason, this paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning Iterated Local Search meta-heuristic, based on the implementation of a Q-Learning Variable Neighborhood Search, to provide heuristically good solutions at the cost of low computational expenses. A comprehensive computational study is conducted, comparing the proposed methodology with the results achieved by the CPLEX solver and to the performance of an Evolutionary Algorithm recently proposed for a similar problem, and adapted for the AM machine scheduling problem. Additionally, to explore the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness more deeply, we present a further set of experiments that test the potential inclusion of a probabilistic stopping rule. The numerical results evidence that the proposed Reinforcement Learning Iterated Local Search is able to obtain statistically significant improvements compared to the other solution approaches featured in the computational experiments.},

  abstract     = {This study considers a two-echelon supply chain that is comprised of an outside vendor, multiple distribution centers (DCs), and multiple retailers. The retailers have access to trade credit offered by upstream suppliers. We propose an integrated DC-retailer network design model that optimizes trade credit terms and safety stock levels, in addition to the decisions of DC locations, DC-retailer assignments, and inventory replenishment policies typically considered in the literature. The operating and handling cost is concave and non-decreasing to capture economies of scale whereas most existing studies simply assume that such cost is linear in demand. Trade credit financing cost is characterized in a way that preserves the important mathematical structure of the classic warehouse retailer network design model. Leveraging on the submodularity property of the cost components, we developed a polymatroid cutting-plane solution algorithm, which is effective for practically sized problem instances in numerical experiments. The results show that incorporating trade credit financing into supply chain network design may substantially reduce the total cost. Further, our study suggests a more consolidated supply chain network when either the safety stock or financing cost increases. Interestingly, as financing cost rises, a high-volume and low-frequency reorder pattern is favored, but the opposite is recommended when financing gain increases. The variation of each individual cost component is also analyzed for an in-depth understanding of the impact of operational and financial parameters on supply chain optimization.},

  abstract     = {Following the guaranteed service approach (GSA), several studies have investigated the interaction between production and inventory decisions in multistage supply systems and developed efficient algorithms to solve the large-scale optimization problems that emerge. These works have largely ignored limited inventory budgets and their effect on production and inventory decisions. In reality, however, firms tend to limit the amount of capital tied-up in inventories, and there is usually a limited amount of storage space at a warehouse or a retailer. This study investigates the problem of production capacity and safety stock placement with both limited capacity and inventory budgets in general acyclic supply chains. This problem allocates capacity to production stages and sets inventory targets at logistics stages, with the objective to minimize the expected total supply chain cost while meeting a target customer service level. The present paper contributes to the GSA literature in several ways. First, we compare guaranteed and chance-constraint approaches to model limited inventory budgets and analyze their effect on safety stock placement. Second, we present two new equivalent formulations of the production capacity and safety stock placement problem. Solving these new models using a successive piecewise linear approximation algorithm outperforms existing solution procedures in terms of solution quality and time, in both cases of infinite and finite inventory budgets. Third, taking advantage of the structure of these formulations, we develop a two-phase heuristic, which finds optimal or near-optimal solutions and greatly improves CPU times. Finally, our numerical experiments show that inventory budgets affect production capacity and safety stock placement decisions, increasing both work in process (WIP) and safety stock levels.},

The goal is to minimize transportation costs and inventory holding costs at both the supplier and the customers. We present a matheuristic that uses a giant tour and simple operators to heuristically create routes that are used in a path-flow formulation. The proposed method iterates between solving a path-flow model with a small set of routes and updating the route set based on the optimal solution from the previous iteration. Computational results on known benchmark instances show that it outperforms state-of-the-art exact methods and heuristics on larger and more difficult instances. It finds the best-known solution on 179 out of 240 larger multi-vehicle benchmark instances, where 178 of them are strictly improving upon the previously best-known solution, and does so in considerably shorter time compared with other methods. In addition, when tested on another set of benchmark instances consisting of 798 smaller instances, the matheuristic finds the optimal solution in 44.7\% of the 642 instances with known optima and has an average gap of 1.75\% on the others.

As the scale of the optimization problem under study rises, the solution representation becomes ever more crucial because the computational performance tends to deteriorate for three reasons: (1) increased landscape complexity, (2) exponential growth of search space, and (3) costly function evaluation. In this study, data compression of solution representation is explored to improve the performance of meta-heuristics in terms of compression efficiency and solution quality. A proposed new data compression scheme – variable-length solution representation compression for meta-heuristics – is developed and tested against benchmarked problem instances from the quadratic assignment problem library (QAPLIB) and additional large problem instances. The analyzed results indicate that the compressed solution representation scheme under a meta-heuristic framework performs well against the QAPLIB and large problem instances with less space complexity and computation time.},

  abstract     = {The standard blending problem consists of combining components to produce a final product with a given demand, while satisfying specific criteria with respect to the global blend and minimizing the total cost. The Bill-Of-Material (BOM) (or recipe) indicates which components are used and in which proportion. Typically, there is some flexibility in the planning process with respect to the proportion used for each of the components, where it may vary between a minimum and a maximum level instead of being fixed. This problem has been widely studied in a single period setting. However, the problem becomes more complex when we take into account a longer time frame. In such a case, demand for the final product occurs in several time periods, and both the final product and the components can be held in stock. In the integrated lot sizing and blending problem, the decisions relate to the production of the final product via the blending process, and the production (or procurement) of the components over an extended time horizon. We propose three mathematical formulations for this integrated problem and present a theoretical analysis of their Linear Programming relaxation bounds. In a computational experiment, we analyse the impact of important parameters such as the level of flexibility in the BOM, the variance in the procurement cost among the components, and the variance of the proportion of the components in the total mix. Furthermore, we analyse the value of integration by comparing the solution of the integrated models to the solutions of approaches that do not fully capture this integration such as a lot-for-lot approach, just-in-time models without inventory for the final product or components, and a hierarchical approach.},

We exploit the structure of the problem to derive new path-based integer linear programming formulations that are scalable when compared to an existing compact model. We develop an efficient algorithm for the separation problem that is based on breadth first search tree generation. We also study some valid inequalities to strengthen the formulations and a heuristic to improve primal bounds. We have applied our models and algorithm to two different classes of the problems determined by the distance based connectivity functions. Extensive computational experiments on both real-world and randomly generated network instances, show that the proposed approach is computationally more efficient than the existing compact model especially for larger instances where connections between nodes consist of a small number of hops. Our computational experiments on both classes of distance-based critical node detection problem provide good numerical evidence to support the importance of defining appropriate metrics for specific network applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the transportation of valuable goods in which security carriers are interested to optimize the operating costs and the vehicle routes’ security. In real operations, route planning and scheduling are normally performed manually based on individual experience. Hereupon, an optimizing approach should be developed to target the robbery risk reduction and the distribution network’ operational costs. Facing the dangerous nature of operations, some considerations play an important role, including demand fluctuations and traffic congestion of the urban environment. To handle these issues, we respectively benefit from the robust optimization theory and considering time-dependent travel speeds with satisfying the “first-in-first-out” property. This paper proposes a rich vehicle routing problem denoted by the secure time-dependent vehicle routing problem with time windows including pickup and delivery with uncertain demands (S-TD-VRPTWPD-UD). A mathematical formulation and an efficient solution approach combining the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) and the iterated local search (ILS) are developed to minimize the predictability of route plans using an integrated risk index, besides the travel costs. Extensive computational experiments on this problem are performed to analyze the impact of the demand uncertainty and the speed time-dependency and to show the efficiency of the GRASP × ILS GRASP×ILS implementation. The results show the significant improvements due to the time-dependency as well as the extra cost of protecting the model against the worst-case scenario of demand requests by deriving the robust counterpart of the S-TD-VRPTWPD-UD.},

To tackle this challenge, we propose a framework that integrates fire spread, optimization, and simulation models. We introduce the concept of Downstream Protection Value (DPV), a flexible metric that assays and ranks the impact of treating a unit of the landscape, by modeling a forest as a network and the fire propagation as a tree graph . Using our open-source decision support system, custom performance metrics can be optimized to minimize wildfire losses, obtaining effective treatment plans. Experiments with real forests show that our model is able to consistently outperform alternative methods and accurately detect high-risk and potential ignition areas, focusing the treatment on the most critical zones. Results indicate that our methodology is able to decrease the expected area burned and fire propagation rate by more than half in comparison to alternative methods under ignition and weather uncertainty.},

The goods are disseminated from a depot and distributed to the customers via a heterogeneous fleet of electric vehicles with limited capacity. Differently from the classical vehicle routing problem, the vehicles have battery restrictions that need to be recharged at some stations if a trip is longer than their range. The problem reduces to finding the optimal locations of the recharging stations and their number to minimize the total cost, which includes the routing cost, the recharging cost, and the fixed costs of opening stations and operating vehicles. We propose a novel mathematical formulation and an efficient Benders decomposition algorithm embedded into a two-phase general framework to solve this environmental logistics problem. Phase I solves a restricted problem to provide an upper bound for the original problem which is later solved in Phase II. Between the two phases, an intermediate processing procedure is introduced to reduce the computations of the Phase II problem. This is achieved by a combination of the Phase I upper bound and several lower bounds obtained via exploiting the underlying network structure. Our approach solves the problem in a general setting with non-identical stations and vehicles by allowing multiple visits to the stations and partial recharging.

  abstract     = {We consider the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) with one vendor replenishing the inventories of many retailers who face stochastic demands. To hedge against demand uncertainty, dynamic lot-sizing and safety stock planning are integrated using chance-constrained programming to adapt to the varying demand uncertainty across planning periods and allow for variable replenishment periods. We present a tactical approach towards obtaining cyclic delivery schedules that avoid given starting inventories and account for non-stationary interdependent demands. The assumption of independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) demands often oversimplifies the stochasticity of the underlying demand time series by neglecting, among other things, seasonality and correlation. In IRPs, the evolution of the demand time series highly affects the consolidation of retailer replenishments in delivery routes. The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), including several real-world characteristics. To obtain solutions faster than by using MILP solvers, we propose a multi-start adaptive local search and an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) heuristic. The influence of several problem parameters on the solutions is investigated. The benefit of an integrated planning of lot-sizing and routing over sequential planning is assessed. The results show that the proposed approach for cyclic delivery schedules allows a (de-)synchronization of retailer replenishments and their consolidation in vehicle routes while meeting real-world constraints in both routing and inventory management. Under non-stationary demands, it yields savings of 2.8\% and 1.9\% on average compared to given or zero starting inventories by setting initial inventories endogenously. The presented heuristics render near-optimal results. The ALNS deviates by only 0.6\% from optimal on instances where cv = 0 , cv=0, and by an average of 1.6\% from optimal on all small-sized instances. On larger problems, it outperforms the other heuristics and obtains an average deviation from the best solution found of only 0.1\%.},

  abstract     = {Mixed complementarity problems are of great importance in practice since they appear in various fields of applications like energy markets, optimal stopping, or traffic equilibrium problems . However, they are also very challenging due to their inherent, nonconvex structure. In addition, recent applications require the incorporation of integrality constraints. Since complementarity problems often model some kind of equilibrium, these recent applications ask for equilibrium points that additionally satisfy certain integer conditions. Obviously, this makes the problem even harder to solve. The solution approach used most frequently in the literature is to recast the complementarity conditions as disjunctive constraints using additional binary variables and big- M M constraints. However, both latter aspects create issues regarding the tractability and correctness of the reformulation. In this paper, we follow the opposite route and restate the integrality conditions as complementarity constraints, leading to purely continuous reformulations that can be tackled by local solvers. We study these reformulations theoretically and provide a numerical study that shows that continuous reformulations are useful in practice both in terms of solution times and solution quality.},

  abstract     = {Complex projects, such as product development projects, usually involve myriads of interrelated activities. Identifying an appropriate sequence of these activities is a challenge to project managers because of the existence of rework iterations. Researchers have developed a series of methods to find a schedule that minimizes the first-order rework of interrelated activities using the design structure matrix (DSM). By contrast, this study presents a more accurate approach for determining a sequence that minimizes the high-order rework. First, a new objective function is proposed to describe the first-order and second-order rework time (FSRT) of complex projects. Second, a parallel branch-and-prune algorithm and two local search heuristics are proposed, which can be conveniently used to reduce the FSRT. Experimental results show that we can reduce more rework of complex projects through minimizing FSRT than using other objective functions. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed methods is validated using random experiments.},

In this paper, we study a new unrelated parallel batch processing machine scheduling problem arose in AM, which requires to simultaneously assign parts to batches, determine the orientation of parts, pack the parts to the two-dimensional surface, and allocate the batches to machines. It is the first work to consider the orientation selection for parts in machine scheduling with the objective to minimize the makespan. To solve this problem, we first present a mixed integer linear programming model. Then, a simulated annealing algorithm with designed packing strategies based on the skyline representation of packing pattern is developed. Moreover, data structure Trie is introduced to accelerate the whole procedure and four post-optimization methods are designed to further refine solutions. Finally, a comprehensive computational study is conducted. The efficiency of our heuristic algorithms is verified and the best packing strategy for this problem is identified. The advantage of considering multiple orientations of parts in machine scheduling is demonstrated by comparisons with scenarios of fixed orientation.},

Recently, managing food supplies has become a very important issue due to the onset of unexpected conditions such as natural disasters (earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, droughts etc.) and pandemics. In this paper, we aim to design sustainable food supply chain networks for e-commerce food companies (e.g. e-groceries) by applying lateral inventory share policies after the consideration of the existence of strategic alliances between organizations. We aim to minimize food waste as well as back orders resulting in more sustainable networks. Further, we explore how a business-to-business (B2B) policy (i.e. lateral-inventory share policy) should be designed to optimize business (i.e. e-groceries) profitability. We optimize the re-order and up-to ( s , S s,S ) inventory levels of e-groceries for the pre-defined sharing policies by using a simulation optimization approach. The optimal results show that having a lateral inventory share poliIndiacy in food networks is more efficient compared to a non-lateral policy. Also, at the optimal points of the considered policies, lateral inventory share ratio is usually observed to be larger than 50\% on average, meaning that more than half of customer orders are met by lateral inventory share.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the multi-item inventory lot-sizing problem with supplier selection. The problem consists of determining an optimal purchasing plan in order to satisfy dynamic deterministic demands for multiple items over a finite planning horizon, taking into account the fact that multiple suppliers are available to purchase from. As the complexity of the problem was an open question, we show that it is NP-hard. We propose a facility location extended formulation for the problem which can be preprocessed based on the cost structure and describe new valid inequalities in the original space of variables. Furthermore, we study the projection of the extended formulation into the original space and show the connection between the inequalities generated by this projection and the newly proposed inequalities. Additionally, we present a simple and easy to implement yet very effective MIP (mixed integer programming) heuristic using the extended formulation. Besides, we introduce two new benchmark sets of instances to assess the performance of the approaches under different cost structures. Computational results show that the preprocessing approach can significantly reduce the size of the formulation to be solved, allowing both an increase in the number of instances solved to optimality within the time limit and a reduction on the average time to solve them. Moreover, the described inequalities can improve the performance of a standard formulation for nearly all instance groups. They can also be used to provide strong lower bounds for certain large instances for which the preprocessed facility location formulation fails even to provide a linear relaxation bound due to memory limitations. Furthermore, the proposed MIP heuristic outperforms the heuristics available in the literature as it obtains solution values which at least match those reported for all instance groups, strictly improving most of them. The results also show that the performance of the approaches can vary considerably under different cost structures.},

  abstract     = {The goal of this research is to accelerate improvement heuristics which use a graph to model the system and calculates the makespan, i.e., longest path in the graph, during each iteration. These heuristics iteratively perturb the graph and recalculate the makespan in each iteration until a satisfactory schedule is determined. We propose Improved Structural Perturbation Algorithm ( ISPA ) to accelerate the calculation of the length of the longest path in the graph in each iteration. This will decrease the overall computation time of these scheduling improvement heuristics. Scheduling perturbations are represented by structural perturbations of the graph (edge additions and deletions). ISPA partitions nodes in the graph into two types of sets and applies two different processes to calculate the effects of the perturbations depending on the set the node was in. The major contribution of this study is that ISPA executes once to update the length of the longest path regardless of the number of added and deleted edges. This results in a more efficient algorithm in terms of time complexity than previous algorithms. To show this performance improvement, an experiment was performed applying ISPA to a Simulated Annealing (SA) heuristic and compare it with applying the commonly used Standard Longest Path Algorithm (SLPA) and two other existing methods to the SA heuristic. The experiment shows that ISPA outperforms existing methods in all cases. Moreover, for these SA problems, ISPA saved 9\%-65\% of the execution time compared to SLPA for the job-shop scheduling problems. The time savings increase with size (number of nodes) of the problem. ISPA is applicable to other iterative heuristics, such as Tabu-search, Genetic Algorithms, and Shifting Bottleneck.},

In terminals with large and persistent stockpiles, the ever-changing geometry of stockpiles can impose challenging scheduling constraints. For those situations, we propose that each stockpile is modelled in detail, for instance as a collection of heterogeneous sized blocks. This is called a bench block model (BBM). We then demonstrate how stockpiles are manipulated via their BBM and how BBM can be integrated as a form of stockpile manager within a sophisticated DBET scheduling engine. Numerical testing of the DBET scheduling engine and three horizontal bench block model (HBBM) has been performed and indicates that the application of BBM is worthwhile, if not essential. The concept of BBM is generic, highly flexible, and integrable into existing optimisation routines. The results provided are superior to other approaches that model stockpiles as simple silos. We can provide schedules that are devoid of any stockpile geometry errors in contrast to others which cannot, and computational overheads to do this are no greater than previous approaches. In the three case studies considered, it was also pleasing to see that solutions of comparable quality with key performance criteria (KPI) equivalent to those constructed without any consideration of stockpile geometry are achievable. The new scheduling approach can significantly reduce the time to perform terminal planning and can increase the utilization of key resources within the terminal.},

The nurses in a hospital should be assigned to the most appropriate shifts and days so as to meet the demands of the hospital as well as to satisfy the requirements and requests of the nurses as much as possible. Nurse rostering represents a challenging and demanding combinatorial optimisation problem. To address it, general and efficient methodologies, such as selection hyper-heuristics, have emerged. In this paper, we will consider the multi-stage nurse rostering formulation, posed by the second international nurse rostering competition’s problem. We introduce a sequence-based selection hyper-heuristic that utilises a statistical Markov model. The proposed methodology incorporates a dedicated algorithm for building feasible initial solutions and a series of low-level heuristics with different dynamics that respect the characteristics of the competition’s problem formulation. Empirical results and analysis suggest that the proposed approach has significant potential for difficult problem instances.},

  abstract     = {In this study we consider the shortest path problem, where the arc costs are subject to distributional uncertainty. Basically, the decision-maker attempts to minimize her worst-case expected loss over an ambiguity set (or a family) of candidate distributions that are consistent with the decision-maker’s initial information. The ambiguity set is formed by all distributions that satisfy prescribed linear first-order moment constraints with respect to subsets of arcs and individual probability constraints with respect to particular arcs. Under some additional assumptions the resulting distributionally robust shortest path problem (DRSPP) admits equivalent robust and mixed-integer programming (MIP) reformulations. The robust reformulation is shown to be NP -hard, whereas the problem without the first-order moment constraints is proved to be polynomially solvable. We perform numerical experiments to illustrate the advantages of the considered approach; we also demonstrate that the MIP reformulation of DRSPP can be solved effectively using off-the-shelf solvers.},

  abstract     = {Due to the complexity of manufacturing processes, many industries today try to group their production components into families and use a common setup time to process every family. Also, the failure of machinery has an important impact on the planning of production systems. This paper deals with the problem of single machine scheduling with family setup times and randomly machine breakdown. It is assumed that there is disruption along the planning horizon with uncertain start and duration times based on a specific probability distribution function. The goal is to minimize the maximum expected tardiness. For this problem, a hill climbing based heuristic (HCO) and a novel hybrid variable neighborhood search metaheuristic (HVNS) have been developed. A branch and bound (BB) procedure is also proposed to optimally solve this problem using HCO and HVNS algorithms to derive upper bounds. Comparison of the solutions obtained from the presented algorithms with the mathematical programming model of the problem in small-scale instances shows that the solutions obtained from the proposed algorithms have a good quality in terms of the expected value of the objective function and the solving time. The computational results for executing the proposed algorithms on 36 series of various instances show that the BB procedure is able to solve 97.76\% of the instances within the specified time frame and HVNS metaheuristic is capable to solve 41.07\% of them, optimally. Also, the maximum mean deviation of HVNS solutions from the optimal solution is reported below 5\% for hard instances and below 15\% for instances with medium complexity. After performing a non-parametric hypothesis test, it is found that at a confidence level 99.9\%, the deviation index for HVNS is less than 1.5\% for difficult problems and less than 9\% for semi-difficult ones. Finally, the results of solving large scale instances, demonstrate the efficiency of proposed metaheuristic.},

A variant of the traveling salesperson problem (TSP), called the traveling salesperson problem with hotel selection, was introduced in the last years. Herein, the salesperson needs to visit all customers just once, ensuring that a length-traveled daily not exceeds a length limit constraint. If necessary, a hotel can be used to connect tours on different days. This work proposes a hybrid Iterated Local Search heuristic using a random variable neighborhood descent procedure with a variable perturbation procedure. Furthermore, to perform better, a data mining technique is sporadically executed to construct new solutions based on patterns extracted by frequent itemset mining. Computational experiments show the potential of this algorithm to significantly improve the number of best known solutions when using the same computational time of the principal works available in literature.},

  abstract     = {Recommendation system has attracted large amount of attention in the field of E-commerce research. Traditional MF (Matrix Factorization) methods take a global view on the user-item rating matrix to derive latent user vectors and latent item vectors for rating prediction. However, there is an inherent structure in the user-item rating matrix and a local correspondence between user clusters and item clusters as the users induce the items and the items imply the users in a recommendation system. Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes a novel rating prediction approach called RP-LGMC (Rating Prediction based on Local and Global information with Matrix Clustering) based on matrix factorization by making use of the local correspondence between user clusters and item clusters. The RP-LGMC approach consists of three components. The first component is to partition the user-item rating matrix into small blocks by the sparse subspace clustering (SCC) algorithm with co-clustering its rows (users) and columns (items) simultaneously. The second component is local distillation to extract those dense and stable blocks by thresholding block density and standard deviation. The third component is to predict the ratings with residual approximation on the local blocks and SVD++ on the global blocks of the original user-item matrix R R . The RP-LGMC approach can not only reduce the data sparsity but also increase the computation scalability. Experiments on the MovieLens-25 M dataset demonstrate that the proposed RP-LGMC approach performs better than most state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and has lower computation complexity than the SVD++ algorithm.},

After initiation of a job, the traveler moves to the next location immediately and the job continues autonomously. This is representative of many practical scenarios including autonomous robotics, equipment maintenance, highly automated manufacturing, agricultural harvesting, and disaster recovery. The goal is to minimize the time of completion of the last job, i.e. makespan. Although the makespan objective typically is used in scheduling problems, the transportation times can be significant relative to the processing time, and this changes the optimization considerations. We refer to this problem as the Traveling Salesman Problem with Job-times ( TSPJ ) and present a mathematical formulation and local search improvement heuristics for it.

  abstract     = {We address the problem of floorplanning, a crucial step of VLSI design, and propose a novel approach named Quasi-Newton-based FloorplannER (QinFer) for the challenging fixed-outline floorplanning problem. QinFer is an effective two-phase method. The first phase recursively bipartitions the original circuit to a set of subcircuits until each leaf subcircuit contains only one module. By placing each module onto the suboutline of the leaf subcircuit, a distributed floorplan is obtained. The recursive bipartition enables the strongly connected modules to be placed closely so that the obtained floorplan has a good quality of wirelength. By bipartitioning the circuit into leaf subcircuits with only one module and using terminal propagation technology during the whole bipartitioning process, the capabilities of bipartition tool and terminal propagation technology in improving quality of wirelength are fully utilized. The second phase contributes a potential energy function to evaluate the overlap among the modules as well as the protruding portion of modules beyond the outline, and a Quasi-Newton method is employed to reduce the potential energy for the legalization of the distributed floorplan. The Quasi-Newton legalization method is a general method that can be used to calculate a floorplan without constructing any geometric representations for the modules. Moreover, the robustness of QinFer is further improved by incorporating a refined distribution algorithm to establish feasibility for the case of illegal floorplan. Extensive experimental results on public benchmarks show that, in comparison to the well-known approaches DeFer and F-FM, QinFer can generate 7.3\% 7.3\% and 2.1\% 2.1\% better half-perimeter wirelengths, respectively.},

Multi-Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) methods have been widely used in this field. But most of the studies neglect the undeniable impact of time and changes of the credit assessment criteria, their importance and evaluation data over time. On the other hand, developed Dynamic MADM (DMADM) methods often used subjective weighting methods and then applied some aggregation operators to rank alternatives. This paper proposes a new combination of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) as a powerful objective weighting method with DMADM as a novel dynamic decision-making method for credit performance evaluation. For this aim, the credit performance criteria were extracted using literature review and experts’ views. Criteria weights were calculated with dynamic DEA common set of weights approach. Then, the applicants are prioritized using five Grey MADM methods (including SAW-G, VIKOR-G, TOPSIS-G, ARAS-G and COPRAS-G). Finally, a new method called Correlation Coefficient and Standard Deviation (CCSD) was used to determine the final aggregated rank. This novel method is applied in order to credit ratings of the clients in the Beekeeping Industry Development Funding Institute IRAN The results indicate that the proposed MADM method, while eliminating the limitations of previous methods, has been able to maintain robustness. Also, the results are highly correlated with the results of previous methods.},

However, preparing routing plans for multiple hazmat shipments between various origin–destination pairs also raises the question of risk-equity, and not just minimization of hazmat risk. Hence, the objective is to plan an equitable routing plan for different rail hazmat shipments while not only ensuring the safety of citizens but also precluding certain population zones from being subjected to intolerable levels of hazmat risk. To this end, we propose an analytical framework that makes use of a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measure of risk to generate minimum risk shipment routes while promoting risk-equity in both the arcs and the yards of the railroad network. While the commercial solver, CPLEX, lacks the ability to generate integer solutions for even small problem instances, a Lagrangian relaxation method aimed at being maximized using the Subgradient optimization algorithm is applied to provide a lower bound. The proposed framework is finally used to study several problem instances using the realistic infrastructure of a railroad operator, and to conclude that risk-equity can be achieved by re-routing, and that the design of train services along with the trade-off between yard-risk and arc-risk determine the number of re-routing and the optimal value of CVaR.},

To deal with the dual-resource constraints (DRC) of material processing and material handling, a performance evaluation method is proposed to calculate the system throughput, WIP and cycle time.

In the algorithm, the temporal-spatial distance is introduced to cluster the customers to generate an initial population to improve the quality of the initial solution. Adaptive neighborhood search times strategy and simulated annealing inferior solution acceptance mechanism are used to balance the diversification and exploitation in the algorithm iteration process.

These internship positions are offered by local hospitals that specify minimum and maximum staffing requirements. To some extent, students can customise their own training program as they need to select a subset of the disciplines from an elective list and they are able to express their preferences related to these disciplines and the hospitals in which they would like to carry out their training program. The objective is to find a feasible student roster satisfying all educational and hospital requirements while optimising the student preferences and the equity between students. We propose an efficient branch-and-price algorithm to solve the problem under study. To that purpose, we include different dedicated mechanisms to accelerate the algorithm performance to find the exact solution in an acceptable time span. In this way, we propose a two-stage pricing procedure finding a diverse set of suitable columns to reduce the tailing-off effect in column generation. The pricing algorithm relies on dynamic programming and different pruning and symmetry breaking rules. In addition, the branch-and-price tree is constructed based on a mixed-shifting branching rule that executes different individual branching rules in a specific order. The created nodes in the branching tree are visited in the order determined by a novel right-first search strategy. We conducted different computational experiments to show the performance of the proposed branch-and-price and the implemented speed-up techniques and optimisation principles. We have benchmarked the branching and pricing methodology with other approaches and show the contribution of the different components in the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the distributed concrete precast flow shop scheduling problem to minimize total weighted earliness and tardiness. It is crucial for a precast manufacturer to schedule jobs effectively to meet shipping dates because of tight due date, limited inventory capacity and huge tardiness penalties. In order to respond quickly to customer demands, many concrete precast manufacturers have adopted the distributed-multiple-factory mode in which job assignment and scheduling have to be decided jointly. To solve this problem, through analyzing the characteristics of distributed precast production, we first develop a novel mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model and then transform it into an effective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model by linearization techniques. Additionally, since the problem is more complex than the classical distributed flow shop scheduling problem, which is NP-hard in most cases, we propose a hybrid iterated greedy algorithm (HIG) by integrating due date related NEH-based heuristics, problem-specific knowledge, different local search methods, and mechanism of destruction and reconstruction. Subsequently, we propose a hybrid tabu search and iterated greedy (HTS_IG) in which a hybrid tabu search (HTS) is run at first and then an iterated greedy (IG) starts from the best solution obtained by HTS. Aimed at improving search efficiency, some structural properties of the schedules are explored and integrated into the local search steps of HIG and HTS_IG. We also develop a hybrid genetic algorithm and variable neighborhood search (HGA_VNS) and a two-phase heuristic method (TPHM) for comparison. Finally, extensive experiments and deep analysis are conducted on instances with different combination of problem parameters. Computational results show the effectiveness of the MILP model and the proposed algorithms. The computational analysis indicates that, on average, HTS_IG performs best among all the proposed metaheuristics . The effectivenesses of local search based on problem-specific knowledge (PSK) in HIG and HTS_IG are also verified.},

Among them, we can highlight the problem of transporting customers from origin to destination locations, which is known as the dial-a-ride problem (DARP). This problem consists of designing least-cost routes to serve pickup-and-delivery requests, while meeting capacity, time window, maximum route duration, and maximum ride time constraints. This work proposes a hybrid algorithm to solve single and multi-depot DARP variants where both the demands and vehicle fleet are heterogeneous. The method combines the iterated local search metaheuristic with an exact procedure based on a set partitioning approach. In addition, several procedures were implemented to speedup the local search phase . Extensive computational experiments were conducted on existing and newly proposed benchmark instances in order to evaluate the impact of the different components of the algorithm, and to compare its performance against the best existing method. The results obtained suggest that the proposed algorithm is capable of producing highly competitive results regarding both solution quality and CPU time, and of improving several best known solutions.},

Both these characteristics are considered in our DMPGRP. An effective solution strategy for this problem selects demands that must be fulfilled day by day, after distinguishing them according to priority classes. It then constructs the vehicle routes by using a heuristic algorithm based on the adaptive large neighbourhood search. The results of an extensive computational study are reported.},

  abstract     = {The multiple traveling salesmen problems ( mTSP mTSP ) are variants of the well-known traveling salesmen problems, in which n n cities are to be assigned to m m salespeople. In this paper, we propose an evolution strategy ( ES ES ) approach for solving the mTSP mTSP with minsum minsum and minmax minmax objectives. The ES ES employs a self-adaptive Ruin and Recreate ( RR RR ) heuristic to generate an offspring population. In the RR RR heuristic, some solution components are removed from a solution and the removed components are reinserted into the partial solution to obtain a new complete solution again. We employ the Multiple Insertion Heuristic ( MIH MIH ) when carrying out insertions with the speed-up method based on the nearest neighbor approach in the recreate procedure. Through the ES ES , the ruin size parameter of the RR RR heuristic and the selection probabilities of applying a random search algorithm consisting of four different moves are self-adapted. 3 O p t 3Opt local search is also embedded in the ES ES to further enhance the solution quality. A Boolean flag is developed whether or not to apply 3 O p t 3Opt local search, which is computationally expensive, on non-improving tours. Moreover, new constructive heuristics are presented for both minsum minsum and m inmax minmax mTSP mTSP . Computational experiments show that the proposed ES ES algorithm is very competitive or superior to the best performing algorithms from the literature for both objectives. Ultimately, 21 new best-solutions are presented for the mTSP mTSP with minsum minsum and minmax minmax objectives for the first time in the literature. In this paper, the multi-depot mTSP mTSP with non-predetermined depots ( M M - mTSP mTSP ) is also studied as an extension of the mTSP mTSP . Two new MILP models are proposed for both minsum minsum and minmax minmax M M - mTSP mTSP as well as lower bounds, and optimal results are obtained for small instances. The computational results show that the ES ES algorithm can find the optimal solution for all the small-sized instances. Furthermore, we derive new large-sized M M - mTSP mTSP benchmarks from the well-known TSPLIB, which have nodes ranging from 52 and 442. We report the results for both minsum minsum and minmax minmax objectives for these instances as new M M - mTSP mTSP benchmarks, considering four different m settings.},

We compare three approaches for the problem: a path-based model with all feasible routes, a “Price-and-Branch” algorithm in which the pricing is formulated as a collection of shortest path problems in a cunningly constructed acyclic network , and a compact arc-flow formulation based on this network. The experiments shows that the latter formulation is the most efficient, and can solve to optimality instances of real-world size (and beyond) in time compatible with typical operational constraints. Also, the models allow us to assess that limited amounts of flexibility from customers can significantly improve routing costs for the carrier while decreasing customers’ cost as well.},

Developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and operations research have increased the prevalence of computer systems in decision making tasks across a myriad of applications. Markov decision processes (MDPs) are utilized in a variety of system controllers, and attacks against them are of particular interest, even though this problem structure is relatively understudied in the adversarial learning literature. Therefore, in this research, we consider the finite-horizon MDP poisoning problem wherein an adversary perturbs a decision maker’s baseline MDP formulation to induce desired behavior while balancing the risk of attack detection. We formally define the associated mathematical programming formulation as a mixed-integer bilevel programming problem. We provide a single-level representation that can be handled by some commercial global solvers, but, since their performance is frequently inadequate, we develop gradient-based, gradient-free, and bifurcation heuristic solution methodologies that include self-tuning extensions. The performance of these algorithms is explored on a wide array of sample problem instances to determine their relative efficacy in terms of solution quality and computational effort for different finite-horizon MDP structures.},

To validate the applicability of our program, we conduct a case study on the Chicago Metropolitan area using cost data from leading ABSM manufacturer and geographical data from the planning and operations language for agent-based regional integrated simulation (more commonly known as POLARIS).

We develop a Mixed-Integer Linear Program and a solution approach for larger instances based on decomposing the problem into the truck-routing and the drone-resupply decisions. Numerical experiments show that using drones for resupply can reduce the total delivery time by up to 20\%. Additionally, experiments show that the decomposition can rapidly obtain high-quality solutions. For instances of 10 and 15 customers, the decomposition solved the majority to optimality, with a trivial gap. For larger instances, this approach provided lower delivery times than a traditional parcel delivery system using a truck only. Investigations on the effects of drone speed, drone capacity, depot location, constraint addition, and allowing the truck to return to the depot are studied.

In this paper, we show that the JOBPRP can be modelled as a clustered vehicle routing problem (CluVRP), a variant of the capacitated VRP in which customers are grouped into clusters. To solve this cluster-based model of the JOBPRP, we apply a two-level variable neighborhood search (2level-VNS) metaheuristic, previously developed for the CluVRP, and study which adaptations are required to perform efficiently in a warehouse environment. Additionally, we evaluate if the Hausdorff distance used as an approximation for the clusters’ proximity in the CluVRP, performs equally well when determining closeness between pick orders in a warehouse. We compare the performance of the Hausdorff-based batching criterion to the cumulative minimal aisles visited-criterion, known as a well-performing batching metric in rectangular warehouses with parallel aisles. The 2level-VNS performs well compared to state-of-the-art algorithms specifically developed for the order batching problem (OBP) in a single-block warehouse. A multi-start VNS remains slightly superior to our approach. Concerning the Hausdorff distance, we conclude that in most experiments, the minimum-aisles criterion retains a better fit in the warehouse context.},

In this paper, we design an efficient and effective heuristic for the LRP based on an existing heuristic to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem . Our heuristic reduces the solution space to a manageable size by the estimation of an upper bound for the number of open depots and then iteratively applies the routing heuristic on each remaining depot configuration. A progressive filtering framework, in which the vehicle routing problem is solved to a larger precision at each iteration, is employed to quickly detect unpromising configurations. Extensive experimentation reveals that the estimated upper bound effectively reduces the search space on different types of instances and that a good filtering design combines coarse and fine filters. Benchmarking shows that, despite its simple design, the final heuristic outperforms existing heuristics on the largest LRP benchmark set, on very-large-scale LRPs, and on 2-echelon LRPs.},

We give a general definition of the problem and then focus on a special class of it where uncertainty occurs only in the right-hand side of the underlying linear program. We show that our problem is computationally hard to solve and also study some of its theoretical properties. We then develop two approximation methods to solve it: a local search algorithm and a super set based method. We test the methods on a set of randomly generated instances.

  abstract     = {The soft-clustered vehicle-routing problem (SoftCluVRP) is a variant of the classical capacitated vehicle-routing problem. Customers are partitioned into clusters and all customers of the same cluster must be served by the same vehicle. In this paper, we present a large multiple neighborhood search for the SoftCluVRP. We design and analyze multiple cluster destroy and repair operators as well as two post-optimization components, which are both based on variable neighborhood descent. The first allows inter-route exchanges of complete clusters, while the second searches for intra-route improvements by combining classical neighborhoods (2-opt, Or-opt, double-bridge) and the Balas-Simonetti neighborhood. Computational experiments show that our algorithm clearly outperforms the only existing heuristic approach from the literature. By solving benchmark instances, we provide 130 new best solutions for 220 medium-sized instances with up to 483 customers and prove 12 of them to be optimal. Furthermore, we describe a straightforward adaption of our algorithm to the clustered vehicle-routing problem, a variant of the SoftCluVRP.},

Given a set of jobs that differ in terms of size, processing time and due date, the generalized SBPM problem aims to cluster the jobs into batches and process each batch one at a time on a capacitated batch-processing machine such that the total earliness and tardiness of jobs, a just-in-time objective, is minimized. We investigate the intrinsic properties of the optimal solutions of the problem, based on which an effective span-limited tree search (SLTS) heuristic is developed to find the near-optimal solutions to a restricted SBPM problem with a specified processing sequence of jobs. Varying the sequence, we embed the SLTS approach into a self-adapted genetic algorithm to further explore the solution space of the original problem. A hybrid span-limited tree search and genetic algorithm approach is proposed. The results of extensive numerical experiments on various random instances with a common due date and non-identical due dates of jobs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches in obtaining high-quality near-optimal solutions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the duration-minimizing time-dependent vehicle routing problem with time windows (DM-TDVRPTW), where time-dependent travel times represent different levels of road congestion throughout the day. The departure time from depot becomes an important decision to reduce the route duration. We provide an alternative arc-based mixed-integer programming model with explicit arc time zone index. For larger scale instances, we extend the segment-based evaluation method to speed up the feasibility check of a given vehicle route. It is thereafter incorporated to implement an efficient hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search with tabu search (ALNS-TS) algorithm, to explore both feasible and infeasible solution spaces. The ALNS-TS exploits the strength of diversification in ALNS through adaptive control of neighborhood size, as well as the strength of intensification in TS by limiting the maximum number of steps allowed without improvement. Related parameters are tuned using an automatic configuration tool to determine the best set of configurations. The computational results demonstrate its excellent performance on the benchmark instances proposed by Dabia et al. (2013), obtaining optimal solutions for all instances with 25 customers and improving best-known solutions for 36 instances with 50 and 100 customers. Computational experiments are also conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm on an extra set of large scale instances and on the simplified VRPTW instances.},

A graph is given, in which every arc has a cost and a probability of failure, and in which two nodes are marked as source and destination. The aim of our RPSP is to find a subgraph of minimum cost, containing a set of paths from the source to the destination nodes, such that the probability that all paths fail simultaneously is lower than a given threshold. We explore its theoretical properties and show that, despite a few interesting special cases can be solved in polynomial time, it is in general NP-hard. In fact, we prove that even deciding if a given subgraph has a probability of failure not exceeding a given threshold is already NP-Complete. We therefore introduce an integer relaxation that simplifies the computation of such probability, and we design an exact algorithm for the full RPSP exploiting this relaxation and other ad hoc procedures. We present computational results, highlighting that our exact algorithms can handle graphs with up to 30 nodes within minutes of computing time, consistently producing proven optimal solutions. Moreover, we show that our algorithms can be used also as heuristics, outperforming path protection schemes from the literature also on much larger networks.},

The server has a constant construction speed which is much lower than its travel speed, so relocation times are negligible with respect to construction times. It is required to find a construction schedule that minimizes a non-decreasing function of the times when various connections of interest become operational. Most problems of this class are strongly NP-hard on general networks, but are often tree-efficient, that is, polynomially solvable on trees. We develop a generic local search heuristic approach and two metaheuristics (Iterated Local Search and Tabu Search) for solving tree-efficient network construction problems on general networks, and explore them computationally. Results of computational experiments indicate that the methods have excellent performance.},

A hybrid genetic algorithm is designed to solve CLSNDP (Container Liner Shipping Network Design Problem). We validate the proposed model by employing a real liner shipping network on the trade shipping route between Asia and West Europe. Through sensitivity analysis, it is found that the service level and market share of container liner shipping company can be improved by considering the dual preference of shippers. In the non-inertia preference of shippers, when cost preference of shippers is greater than time preference, using large ships (over 7000TEU) can achieve greater profits and realize the scale economies of lager ships.},

These constraints include complete shipment, conflicting items, priorities, weight limit, cargo stability, load-bearing, multi-drop, load-balancing, manual loading, grouping, separation, and multiple orientations. Extensive computational experiments are carried out on instances from the literature to show the performance of the proposed approach and state how each practical constraint affects the container’s occupancy, the approach runtime, and the number of packing patterns evaluated. In general, the approach could optimally solve instances with around ten items types and a total of 110 items, besides obtaining the optimal solution for more than 70\% of all instances.},

Noting that the classical benchmark test instances were limited in difficulty due to their selected structure, he proposed a set of new test instances for the 0–1 knapsack problem with characteristics that made them more challenging for dynamic programming and branch-and-bound algorithms. This important work highlighted the influence of diversity in test instances to draw reliable conclusions about algorithm performance. In this paper, we revisit the question in light of recent methodological advances – in the form of Instance Space Analysis – enabling the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms to be visualised and assessed across the broadest possible space of test instances. We show where the hard instances lie, and objectively assess algorithm performance across the instance space to articulate the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms. Furthermore, we propose a method to fill the instance space with diverse and challenging new test instances with controllable properties to support greater insights into algorithm selection , and drive future algorithmic innovations.},

This paper first proposes an IoT and digital twin-enabled tracking solution framework for safety management. Then an indoor safety tracking mechanism for detecting motionless behaviour and self-learning genetic positioning is developed for recognizing the abnormal condition and obtaining precise location information in a real-time manner. A real-life case study with physical and cyber world implementation is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed techniques. The results show that the detection of abnormal motionless behaviour is fulfilled, and the indoor positioning algorithm with self-learning ability not only achieves high accuracy up to 96.5\% but also ensures the long-term use through adaptation.},

  abstract     = {We present a method for bundling scenarios in a progressive hedging heuristic (PHH) applied to stochastic service network design, where the uncertain demand is represented by a finite number of scenarios. Given the number of scenario bundles, we first calculate a vector of probabilities for every scenario, which measures the association strength of a scenario to each bundle center. This membership score calculation is based on existing soft clustering algorithms such as Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). After obtaining the probabilistic membership scores, we propose a strategy to determine the scenario-to-bundle assignment. By contrast, almost all existing scenario bundling methods such as K-Means (KM) assume before the scenario-to-bundle assignment that a scenario belongs to exactly one bundle, which is equivalent to requiring that the membership scores are Boolean values. The probabilistic membership scores bring many advantages over Boolean ones, such as the flexibility to create various degrees of overlap between scenario bundles and the capability to accommodate scenario bundles with different covariance structures . We empirically study the impacts of different degrees of overlap and covariance structures on PHH performance by comparing PHH based on FCM/GMM with that based on KM and the cover method, which represents the state-of-the-art scenario bundling algorithm for stochastic network design. The solution quality is measured against the lower bound provided by CPLEX. The experimental results show that, GMM-based PHH yields the best performance among all methods considered, achieving nearly equivalent solution quality in a fraction of the run-time of the other methods.},

  abstract     = {In an observable queue, customers joining decisions may be influenced by wait-aversion and crowd-attraction. These opposing phenomena and the diversity of arriving customers lead to an arrival process that depends on the number of present customers. For the system manager, having more customers may be beneficial as it can increase future arrivals due to the attraction generated. It may also saturate the system, resulting in long waits. Rejection at arrival may then be employed as a way to obtain a trade-off between these conflicting objectives. With this in mind, we developed a Markov decision process approach to determine how to optimally reject customers in a queueing system with state-dependent arrivals. When the arrival rate is bounded, we compute the optimal policy from a value iteration approach. When the arrival rate is decreasing and convex, we prove that it has a threshold form. When the arrival rate is increasing and potentially unbounded, uniformization may not apply. In dealing with this case, we restrict the analysis to stationary policies and prove the optimality of threshold policies from a computational approach. In addition, we show how to compute the optimal threshold within a finite number of iterations and prove that the long-run expected cost is decreasing and convex in the number of servers. We finally illustrate the applicability of our results through the analysis of a linearly increasing arrival rate, determining the main drivers of control decisions.},

This class of optimization problems has a desirable characteristic: a MIL-mMP can be viewed as a special case of the problem of optimization over the efficient set in multi-objective optimization. The proposed algorithms exploit this characteristic and solve any MIL-mMP from the viewpoint of multi-objective optimization. A computational study on 960 instances demonstrates that the proposed algorithms outperform a generic-purpose solver, SCIP, by a factor of more than 10 on many instances. We numerically show that selecting the best algorithm among our proposed algorithms highly depends on the class of instances used. Specifically, since one of the proposed algorithms is a decision space search algorithm and the other one is a criterion space search algorithm, one can significantly outperform the other depending on the dimension of decision space and criterion space. Although it is possible to linearize some instances of MIL-mMPs, we show that a commercial solver, CPLEX, struggles to directly solve such linearized instances because linearization introduces additional constraints and binary decision variables.},

  abstract     = {The Steiner Team Orienteering Problem (STOP) is defined on a digraph in which arcs are associated with traverse times, and whose vertices are labeled as either mandatory or profitable , being the latter provided with rewards (profits). Given a homogeneous fleet of vehicles M , the goal is to find up to m = | M | m=|M| disjoint routes (from an origin vertex to a destination one) that maximize the total sum of rewards collected while satisfying a given limit on the route’s duration. Naturally, all mandatory vertices must be visited. In this work, we show that solely finding a feasible solution for STOP is NP-hard and propose a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) heuristic for the problem. The algorithm is provided with initial solutions obtained by means of the matheuristic framework known as Feasibility Pump (FP). In our implementation, FP uses as backbone a commodity-based formulation reinforced by three classes of valid inequalities . To our knowledge, two of them are also introduced in this work. The LNS heuristic itself combines classical local searches from the literature of routing problems with a long-term memory component based on Path Relinking. We use the primal bounds provided by a state-of-the-art cutting-plane algorithm from the literature to evaluate the quality of the solutions obtained by the heuristic. Computational experiments show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed heuristic in solving a benchmark of 387 instances. Overall, the heuristic solutions imply an average percentage gap of only 0.54\% when compared to the bounds of the cutting-plane baseline. In particular, the heuristic reaches the best previously known bounds on 382 of the 387 instances. Additionally, in 21 of these cases, our heuristic is even able to improve over the best known bounds.},

  abstract     = {The Multi-Sector Planning (MSP) concept, adopted in both the SESAR and NextGen projects, promotes the control of aircraft and resolution of conflicts over a medium time horizon to reduce and balance controller workload. In the context of MSP, we propose a first formulation of the complexity resolution problem that allows trajectory modifications using both speed and heading changes assuming exact knowledge of aircraft positions. This model is also the first to have the capacity to ensure workload balancing among sectors in a Multi-Sector Area (MSA). The number of crossing conflicts in a sector is used as a measure of controller workload. This problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model that allows obtaining optimal solutions. This model ensures neighbor trajectory recovery and minimal delays. This model was tested on a set of conflict detection and resolution benchmark test problems with up to 300 simultaneous conflicts. Conflict-free solutions were obtained in less than 1.4 s. The model was also tested on several distinct sets of randomly generated problems with an MSA of four sectors and up to 150 aircraft. The number of crossing conflicts was reduced by more than 99\% 99\% with a computation time smaller than four seconds. It was found that it is beneficial to allow the use of both speed and heading changes in high traffic situations. It was also found that considering workload balancing allows the minimization of the total workload in the MSA while preventing overloading some sectors.},

  abstract     = {In this study, one-dimensional marble plane cutting problem is studied based on the cutting equipment productivity and effective use of marble blocks. Different types of marble planes should be cut from multiple stock sized marble blocks in parallel by using a stone block-cutting machine (gang saw). Marble blocks, which have different dimensions, and quality gradations are supplied by the marble processing factory’s own marble quarries. Different quality gradations of the marble blocks and cutting equipment productivity need to be taken into account in addition to minimize the total trim loss or cost in modelling the present cutting problem. The nature of the production process in the marble industry consists of large amount of waste. Minimizing the amount of waste can be controlled indirectly by establishing an appropriate cutting plan. Therefore, minimization of the total cost of transportation and overgrading ( supplying higher quality material than specified by the customer ) while determining a suitable cutting plan for the marble blocks is aimed. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed for solving the present marble plane cutting problem for small-size instances. The salient feature of the developed model is not requiring a priori enumeration of all possible cutting patterns and to permit generation of retail to reuse. For larger size problem instances a Stochastic Diffusion Search (SDS) algorithm is developed. Extensive computational studies are performed by using test instances, which are collected from a marble processing company operating at İzmir. The computational results show that the developed models and SDS algorithm are very useful in providing effective cutting plans.},

The model aims to simultaneously determine the transportation route, modes of transport as well as the lines or nodes required to be reconstructed to minimize the total cost. To attain multiple solutions, the K shortest paths algorithm is introduced and improved to solve MM-OHC-R problem. The proposed algorithm is derived from a virtual network named multi-prism network and Yen algorithm. Moreover, the algorithm is improved by introducing improved A* algorithm. A case study is conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed model and algorithms. The results demonstrate that the usage of reconstruction measurements is able to optimize the transportation schemes and the proposed algorithm is capable of developing multiple transportation schemes to provide the support of decision making and risk prevention and control for the carrier. For the constrained MM-OHC-R problem, the improvement of the A* algorithm enhances the computation performance by reducing the size of the candidate path set effectively.},

In this work, we focus on search tree algorithms applied to sequencing problems. In these algorithms, on lower branching levels, isomorphic sub-problems may appear exponentially many times and the use of memorization is twofold: on the one hand it avoids repetitive solutions, as they correspond to identical sub-problems; on the other hand, it allows to check for dominance conditions among permutations of the same subset of elements. The idea of memorization appeared for a long time, however, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, it was only seldom applied in the number of branching algorithms proposed in the literature. In this paper, we propose a unifying framework for implementing memorization in exact branching algorithms dedicated to sequencing problems. Our proposal leads to the paradigm of Branch &amp; Memorize and its implementation to three classical single machine problems is validated by an extensive computational experimentation that shows that the mentioned paradigm consistently improves existing exact branching algorithms. These results emphasize the idea of more systematically embedding memorization in branching algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a new lot-size inventory problem for products whose demand pattern is dependent on price, advertising frequency and time. It is considered that the demand rate of an item multiplicatively combines the effects of a power function dependent on the frequency of advertisement and a function dependent on both selling price and time. This last function is additively separable in two power functions, one varies with the selling price and the other depends on the time since the last inventory replenishment. Moreover, it is assumed that the holding cost per unit of item is a non-linear function of time in stock. Shortages are not allowed. The aim consists of determining the frequency of advertisement, the selling price and the length of the stock period to maximize the average profit per unit time. This leads to a mixed integer non-linear inventory problem, which is solved by using an efficient algorithm previously developed. The inventory model considered here extends several inventory models previously proposed in the literature. Some numerical examples are solved to illustrate how the algorithm works to obtain optimal inventory policies. Finally, a sensitivity analysis for the optimal solution with respect to the parameters of the inventory system is presented.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel scheduling approach to minimise the energy consumption of a machine during its idle periods. In the scheduling domain, it is common to model the behaviour of the machine by defining a small set of machine modes, e.g. “on”, “off” and “stand-by”. Then the transitions between the modes are represented by a static transition graph. In this paper, we argue that this type of model might be too restrictive for some types of machines (e.g. the furnaces). For such machines, we propose to employ the complete time-domain dynamics and integrate it into an idle energy function. This way, the scheduling algorithm can exploit the full knowledge about the machine dynamics with minimised energy consumption encapsulated in this function. In this paper, we study a scheduling problem, where the tasks characterised by release times and deadlines are scheduled in the given order such that the idle energy consumption of the machine is minimised. We show that this problem can be solved in polynomial time whenever the idle energy function is concave. To highlight the practical applicability, we analyse a heat-intensive system employing a steel-hardening furnace. We derive an energy optimal control law, and the corresponding idle energy function, for the bilinear system model approximating the dynamics of the furnace (and possibly other heat-intensive systems). Further, we prove that the idle energy function is, indeed, concave in this case. Therefore, the proposed scheduling algorithm can be used. Numerical experiments show that by using our approach, combining both the optimal control and optimal scheduling, higher energy savings can be achieved, compared to the state-of-the-art scheduling approaches.},

We construct a baseline personnel roster that takes the personnel scheduling constraints into account and model the workload stemming from the project activities as an endogenous variable in the model. In order to decrease the overall staffing budget, we consider the sharing of resources, i.e. personnel resources can be transferred between projects. In the problem under study, we consider unproductive resource transfer times and different restrictions related to the sharing of resources imposed on the schedule of individual workers, which is often neglected in the literature. We propose a multi-stage solution procedure that exploits the optimal linear programming solution, obtained via column generation , to find a high-quality integer solution based on a diving heuristic. In order to improve the computational performance, different speed-up mechanisms are included relying on a state space reduction. Detailed computational experiments are presented to evaluate and benchmark different alternative optimisation strategies .

We present compact and extended mathematical models of the problem, where the extended model is based on generating all trips apriori. When solving the extended model we apply delayed constraint generation (DCG) to parts of the model to speed up the solution process. Computational results are presented that show that the extended formulation and solution method can solve realistic instances of the problem within one hour. The results further show that the DCG method works significantly better than using lazy constraints from a commercial solver, especially when the number of transportation tasks requiring temporal synchronization becomes large.},

Due to the characteristics of the electroplating process, part processing times are confined to time-window constraints and controlled by independent autonomous agents with the support of multi-agent and distribution manufacturing technologies. It is shown that part processing times in chemical/physical tanks not only determine the productivity but also affect the environmental cost. Hence, two essential issues should be addressed: (a) how to find equilibrium strategies of agents (i.e., part processing times) in such a decentralized manufacturing setting; and (b) how to design an incentive protocol inducing the equilibrium strategies towards the optimal ones concerning the productivity and the environmental cost simultaneously. To deal with the first issue, this paper establishes a non-cooperative sequential game model, which simulates the evolution process of the strategies from an unstable state to an equilibrium one. Then, an iterative algorithm is developed to find Nash equilibrium strategies based on a cyclic bi-value graph. To address the second issue, a novel heuristic rule is proposed for the incentive protocol by exploring the characteristics of time-window constraints and environmental cost functions. The results of numerical experiments validate the performance of the Nash-equilibrium algorithm and the effectiveness of the heuristic rule.},

Removing such entries reduces the problem size, creating smaller models that can be more easily solved by integer programming (IP) solvers. The new theorems are the first to describe when preference list entries can be removed from instances of HRT when ties are present on both sides, and also extend existing results on preprocessing instances of SMTI. A number of heuristics, as well as an IP model and a graph-based algorithm, are presented to find and perform this preprocessing. Experimental results show that our new graph-based algorithm achieves a 44\% reduction in the average running time to find a maximum weight stable matching in real-world instances of SMTI compared to existing preprocessing techniques, and 80\% compared to not using preprocessing.

  abstract     = {Back in the 80’s clustering methods were considered state of the art for non-structured box constrained global optimization (GO). Their disappearance is mainly due to their increasing difficulties in solving even moderately sized GO problems, yet the basic idea was indeed a brilliant one. More recently population methods and Differential Evolution (DE) in particular has gained much attention in the GO heuristic world due to their easy implementation and good exploration capabilities. In order to improve the exploitation capability of DE, some memetic variants have been proposed with success. In this paper we revisit clustering methods and apply them both to standard low dimensional problems and to large scale ones; in particular we propose a novel approach to apply a clustering-type decision on when to start a local search to variants of memetic DE. The resulting algorithm, C-MDE (Clustering Memetic DE) outperforms the best-known methods both in quality of the returned solution and in the number of calls to the expensive local optimization phase, even in large dimension. For large dimensional problems, random projections are used in order to be able to decide on starting a local search on a limited number of features. The resulting GO method is a revisit of clustering techniques in which all of the defects which made those methods no more feasible are eliminated: in particular, the method is used within an adaptive population method and it efficiently runs also in large dimension. Thus we think the proposed approach will find a place in the top-performing modern GO algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the general serial-lock scheduling problem (SLSP) is studied from a new methodological angle, aiming at optimizing the process of ships passing a series of consecutive locks. For the first time in this research topic, we propose a widely applicable model for the SLSP from a flexible job-shop scheduling (FJS) perspective, integrated with a two-dimensional bin-packing problem. The FJS-based perspective allows the formulation of a mixed integer linear programming model, which is capable of solving the SLSP to optimality. Wide-ranging instances with various lock configurations and traffic scenarios are performed to test the applicability and efficiency of the proposed FJS model, which demonstrates that the FJS can optimally solve most of the instances with up to four multi-chamber locks and 20 ships. The results obtained respectively with and without the first-come-first-served restriction show that imposing this restriction can accelerate the solution process for most instances. Meanwhile, experimental results also confirm the advantage of the FJS for solving single-lock scheduling problems, compared with other existing methods. Additionally, although the experiments on the simplified SLSP without multi-type chambers nor two-dimensional ship placement demonstrate a comparable performance between the FJS-based approach and other exact methods, the majority of experimental results infer that the FJS is a more suitable candidate model for dealing with the scenarios with high-density water traffic.},

Motivated by our collaboration with relevant European authorities and companies in the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) initiative, we investigate novel mathematical models and algorithms for supporting the Air Traffic Flow Management in Europe. In particular, we consider the problem of optimally choosing new (delayed) departure times for a set of scheduled flights to prevent en-route congestion and high workload for air traffic controllers while minimizing the total delay. This congestion is a function of the number of flights in a certain sector of the airspace, which in turn determines the workload of the air traffic controller(s) assigned to that sector. We present a MIP model that accurately captures the current definition of workload, and extend it to overcome some of the drawbacks of the current definition. The resulting scheduling problem makes use of a novel formulation, Path&amp;Cycle, which is alternative to the classic big- M or time-indexed formulations. We describe a solution algorithm based on delayed variable and constraint generation to substantially speed up the computation. We conclude by showing the great potential of this approach on randomly generated, realistic instances.},

  abstract     = {Dominating set problems are among the most important class of combinatorial problems in graph optimization, from a theoretical as well as from a practical point of view. In this paper, we address the recently introduced (minimum) weighted total domination problem. In this problem, we are given an undirected graph with a vertex weight function and an edge weight function. The goal is to find a total dominating set D with minimal weight. A total dominating set D is a subset of the vertices such that every vertex in the graph, including vertices in D , is adjacent to a vertex in D . The weight is measured by the sum of all vertex weights and edges weights in the subgraph induced by D , plus for each vertex not in D the minimum weight of an edge from such a vertex outside D to a vertex in D . In this paper, we present two new Mixed-Integer Programming models for the problem, and design solution frameworks based on them. These solution frameworks also include valid inequalities , starting heuristics and primal heuristics. In addition, we also develop a genetic algorithm, which is based on a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure version of our starting heuristic. We carry out a computational study to assess the performance of our approaches when compared to the previous work for the same problem. The study reveals that our exact algorithms are up to 500 times faster compared to previous exact approaches and instances with up to 125 vertices can be solved to optimality within a timelimit of 1800 s. Moreover, the presented genetic algorithm also works well and often finds the optimal or a near-optimal solution within a short runtime. Additionally, we also analyze the influence of instance-characteristics on the performance of our algorithms.},

  abstract     = {We study a problem in which independent project managers cooperate to generate additional revenue by reallocating their resources. This additional revenue equals the increase in the direct return of a project minus the resource transfer cost. For each project, its direct return is closely related to its duration, which is mainly determined by the amount of resources available. In practice, the relationship between direct return and resources can be very complex. We study the situation that all projects use one same type of continuously divisible renewable resource and require some other types of discrete renewable resources. The activity processing rate of a project depends on its continuous resource and can be linear, strictly concave, or convex. The direct return of a project is linear over time. Based on results reported in the literature, we first show that it is not uncommon for the direct return of a project to be concave in relation to the amount of resources. Then, we formulate the resource transfer problem (RTP) as a convex programming problem and derive interesting properties. Furthermore, we design a revenue sharing scheme, which is in the core of a corresponding cooperative game. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to show the value of cooperation, examine the efficiency of the proposed additional revenue sharing scheme, and evaluate the effects of the transfer cost, the unit time reward/penalty, and the amount of initial resource.},

OpM is a general model that has a wide range of practical applications. However the problem is computationally challenging because it is known to be NP -hard. In this work, we propose an effective parallel iterative solution-based tabu search algorithm to solve OpM. The proposed algorithm combines a delete-add compound move instead of a typical time-consuming swap move to improve neighborhood exploration, a solution-based tabu search procedure to strictly prevent visited solutions from being revisited, a perturbation scheme similar to the shaking phase of variable neighborhood search for diversification, and a parallel strategy of leveraging multiple processors of a computer. Experimental results on 144 benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to find new lower bounds for 7 instances and match the best known results for the other instances. Further experimental analysis sheds light on the key ingredients to the performance of the proposed algorithm. The code of our PISTS algorithm is publicly available to facilitate future comparative studies.},

To solve this problem, we propose a simple and efficient hybrid genetic search based on a generic solution representation, a tailored decoding operator, efficient local searches and diversity management techniques. To guide the search, we introduce a secondary objective designed to break ties. These techniques allow to explore structurally different solutions and escape local optima.

  abstract     = {The first Waste Framework Directive issued by the European Union dates back to the seventies but was drastically amended in the last decade to reduce environmental impacts of waste by encouraging reuse, recycling and remanufacturing. Product recovery starts with disassembly which results in high labor costs. Disassembly supports environmentally conscious choices like replacement of defective parts to extend the life span of products, removal of suitable components for reuse and extraction of hazardous substances to decontaminate materials for reprocessing. Besides, selective disassembly also accommodates maintenance and repairs. Optimizing the cost of disassembly is crucial to make this process an economically viable option. Due to change tools and parts reorientation, disassembly costs are sequence-dependent. Therefore minimizing the disassembly cost involves the search for an adequate sequence of disassembly tasks. Consequently, this paper addresses the disassembly sequencing problem for selective and sequential disassembly under sequence-dependent costs. As optimal formulations fail to handle real-world cases, we develop a randomized greedy algorithm (needing a very few number of parameters to be set and proving to be robust with respect to their value) and a matheuristic to solve efficiently medium to large-sized instances.},

Each request is associated with a time window. The company managing the distribution has a given fleet of vehicles to serve the customers, and, in addition, occasional drivers are available to perform the service, i.e., private citizens who are willing to distribute some customer orders in exchange for a compensation. Each occasional driver specifies the time window in which he/she is available. A penalty is incurred when violating time windows as well as when a request is not served. The objective of the company is to determine the distribution plan that minimises the distribution cost, which is given by the sum of the cost of regular vehicles, the compensation paid to the occasional drivers and the penalty cost. In addition, we design and implement a solution method which is based on an insertion algorithm evaluating each request singularly. Albeit being simple, this approach allows to handle dynamic requests and to adjust the distribution plan in real-time. Then, we propose a re-optimisation approach in which the solution constructed through the insertion algorithm is periodically passed to a variable neighborhood search algorithm. In a detailed computational study, we analyse the behavior of the proposed solution approaches.

A generic solution framework is proposed, combining heuristic procedures and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models. The pipeline scheduling problem is decomposed into two sub-problems: the allocation and sequencing of pumping operations of the initial source, and the scheduling of delivery operations and also pumping operations of the intermediate sources. An innovative execution procedure using a rolling horizon strategy is developed to solve both problems. We focus on a new discrete-time MILP model formulation, covering several operational aspects of real-world pipeline systems, such as rigorous treatment of forbidden sequences and preventive tank maintenance and pipeline maintenance periods, while considering rigorous inventory management during the scheduling horizon. The approach is validated by solving an illustrative example and two real-world based pipeline problems. Results show that the proposed framework is able to obtain solutions in reasonable run time with detailed inventory management and respecting several operational constraints of the system.},

We consider the objectives of minimizing the number of used stacks and the number of badly placed items with respect to retrieval times, respectively.

  abstract     = {Inland transportation of containers contributes significantly to the total cost of container intermodal transportation. For this reason, it has received a lot of attention in the last few decades. While there are many reports of attempts to solve the problem out there, the variants considered are all simpler than the form addressed in this paper. Here, we consider the container transportation problem where pick-up and delivery orders, empty and loaded containers, Discharge and Strip of heterogeneous container types with time windows, are handled with heterogeneous truck fleets that carry one or two 20ft or one 40ft chassis. Moreover, to manage the movement and reuse of empty containers, two strategies for empties, i.e. Depot-turn and Street-turn, are simultaneously allowed in the problem setting. A novel MILP model for this rich transportation problem is developed, which applies to various scenarios, even when some functions/delivery modes/types of container, are disabled. Given the complexity of this problem, exact solution of large instances is not realistic. We, therefore, suggest a novel implementation of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) tailored to this particular problem in its rich form. It differs from existing ones for VRP problems due to the nature of the problem we are considering. Numerical experiments on examples with real geographical data show that combining Discharge and Strip containers in transportation saves on cost and increases fleet utilisation.},

  abstract     = {We address a new packing problem variant known as the 2D circle bin packing problem (2D-CBPP), which involves packing circles into multiple square bins as densely as possible so as to minimize the number of bins used. To this end, we propose an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm, which uses our Greedy Algorithm with Corner Occupying Action (GACOA) to construct an initial layout. The greedy solution is usually in a local optimum trap, and ALNS enables multiple neighborhood searches that depend on a stochastic annealing schedule to avoid local minimum traps. Specifically, ALNS perturbs the current layout to escape local optima by iteratively reassigning some circles and accepting the new layout with some probability during the search. The acceptance probability is adjusted adaptively using simulated annealing, which fine-tunes the search direction in order to reach the global optimum. We benchmark computational results against GACOA in heterogeneous instances. In all cases, ALNS outperforms GACOA in improving the objective function, and in several cases, the number of bins used for packing is significantly reduced.},

We contribute to a missing piece of literature by giving some mathematical formulations for this single-minded bundle pricing problem. We first present a mixed-integer nonlinear program with bilinear terms in the objective function and the constraints. By applying classical linearization techniques, we obtain two different mixed-integer linear reformulations. Inspired by a reformulation–linearization technique framework, we derive valid inequalities leading to a tighter linear reformulation. We then discuss a Benders decomposition to project strong cuts from the tightest model onto a light and fast model. In another attempt to exploit the tighter linear relaxation, we discuss heuristics based on the developed mixed-integer linear formulations to quickly find good solutions. We conclude this work with extensive numerical experiments to assess the quality of the mixed-integer linear formulations, as well as the performance of the Benders decomposition and the heuristics.},

  abstract     = {In designing reliable and impermeable networks, the robustness of the network is evaluated against the removal and failure of the node or edge where the network robustness (network connectivity) is measured using various metrics (objective functions) such as the number of connected components, size of the largest connected component, and pairwise connectivity. Critical node detection problem (CNDP) is one of the main issues in this literature, which aims to find a set of vertices whose removal maximizes or minimizes some objective function. In this paper, the focus is on solving CNDP, considering the size of the largest connected component as its objective function. In this regard, we introduce a new problem called K-Group-Division-Problem and present a mixed integer linear programming model to solve it. We prove that under certain circumstances, any optimal solution of the new problem is also an optimal solution of CNDP. Analyzing the performance of the proposed model on solving CNDP, indicates that this model is highly competitive against the base model in the literature. Furthermore, a novel exact algorithm is introduced which improves the proposed mixed integer linear programming model to address CNDP more efficiently. The results show that the proposed algorithm is much more efficient, and, compared with the base model, it can solve the problem on networks with a higher number of nodes.},

The overall objective is to maximize the overall margins that are equal to the total revenue of the selected markets minus the total costs, including the leasing costs of hubs, transportation costs, and outsourcing costs. We propose a mixed integer programming model to formulate the problem with service and flow capacity constraints. For this problem, we propose a subgradient-based Lagrangian relaxation method that exploits the rich structure of the Lagrangian subproblems to obtain its objective values and bounds efficiently. Specifically, we treat the Lagrangian subproblems as knapsack problems and solve them by using a dynamic programming method. Furthermore, we propose a polynomial algorithm to quickly generate objective values of the original problem at each iteration of the Lagrangian relaxation. Computational results show that the proposed method can obtain optimal solutions for small-sized test instances and achieve much better solution qualities than the commercial software package (Cplex) for large-sized test instances. The proposed method also achieves better solutions than a Benders decomposition method for the tested instances.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers an inventory model where the demand rate depends on the selling price and the stock level. A lower price or higher stock level lead to a higher demand rate. Three decision variables are considered: the selling price, the order-level and the reorder point. The goal is the maximization of the return on inventory management expense (ROIME), which is defined as the ratio between the profit and the total cost of the inventory system. The optimal values of the selling price, the order level, the reorder point, the lot size, the maximum ROIME and the cycle time are proposed, and the condition that ensures the profitability of the inventory system is established. The partial derivatives of these optimal values with respect to the initial parameters are calculated to analyse the sensitivity of the optimal policy concerning the parameters of the model. The profitability thresholds for each parameter, keeping all the others fixed, are also evaluated. A comparison between the solution with maximum ROIME and the solution with maximum profit per unit time is illustrated by using a numerical example. The solutions can be very different. Maximizing the return on inventory management expense leads to a zero-ending policy at the end of an inventory cycle, so the order-level is equal to the lot size. On the other hand, maximizing the profit per unit time requires a lower selling price, a higher lot size and a non-zero reorder point.},

Based on the gained insights of the analysis, constructive algorithms are proposed for the general problem setting. A greedy randomized adaptive search (GRASP) framework is proposed to guide the subordinate heuristics to further improve algorithm performance for large-sized problem instances. Computational experiments based on randomly generated problem instances are carried out. They demonstrate that the GRASP computes competitive schedules for the special cases. For small problem instances, the GRASP is able to compute optimal solutions.

In this paper, we study the properties of search trees under which CBFS-depth may outperform BFS in terms of the average number of nodes explored to prove optimality. To facilitate the study, a search tree model is proposed for minimization problems solved by B&amp;B algorithms which is based on the distributions of nodes in the tree with different lower bounds. Using this model, we estimate the expected number of nodes expanded by CBFS-depth. Additionally, we apply B&amp;B algorithms using both search strategies to trees that are randomly generated according to the proposed model in order to study how the average number of nodes expanded by each search strategy is affected by the search tree.

  abstract     = {Decision diagrams (DDs) have proven to be useful tools in combinatorial optimization . Relaxed DDs represent discrete relaxations of problems, can encode essential structural information in a compact form, and may yield strong dual bounds. We propose a novel construction scheme for relaxed multi-valued DDs for a scheduling problem in which a subset of elements has to be selected from a ground set and the selected elements need to be sequenced. The proposed construction scheme builds upon A * A* search guided by a fast-to-calculate problem-specific dual bound heuristic. In contrast to traditional DD compilation methods, the new approach does not rely on a correspondence of DD layers to decision variables. For the considered kind of problem, this implies that multiple nodes representing the same state at different layers can be avoided, and consequently also many redundant isomorphic substructures. For keeping the relaxed DD compact, a new mechanism for merging nodes in a layer-independent way is suggested. For our prize-collecting job sequencing problem, experimental results show that the DDs from our A * A* -based approach provide substantially better bounds while frequently being an order-of-magnitude smaller than DDs obtained from traditional compilation methods, given about the same time. To obtain a heuristic solution and a corresponding lower bound, we further propose to construct a restricted DD based on the relaxed one, thereby substantially exploiting already gained information. This approach outperforms a standalone restricted DD construction, basic constraint programming and mixed integer linear programming approaches, and a variable neighborhood search in terms of solution quality on most of our benchmark instances.},

  abstract     = {We consider a dynamic food supply chain with multiple process steps where the decisions at each step include supplier selection and settings for their process parameters. We assume that the resulting quality level of the product at every step is stochastic. We also consider that this quality level at each supply chain step has a minimum accepted level and any product that does not meet the minimum accepted level is rejected. We propose an integrated approach that uses Big Data mining techniques to study the effect of these decisions on the quality of the final product and determine our state transition matrix. From there, stochastic optimization methods are implemented to find an optimal policy describing the preferred suppliers and settings for their process parameters. The goal of this policy is to maximize the supply chain’s expected profit and reduce rejected product. We show how this technique outperforms traditional techniques in running time as the problem’s complexity (state and action space size) grows. We also conduct experiments to explore how the optimal policy changes as the quality threshold for acceptance becomes more restrictive and exhibits a convex behavior.},

Additionally, we propose the use of an alternative objective function for min–max optimization problems, never used before in the context of the CCMP.

Given a set of items each with a certain size, the goal in BPPC-IF is to pack these items into a minimum number of fixed-capacity bins while not packing fragments of conflicting items into the same bin. We assume a size-preserving fragmentation, i.e., the total size of fragments of an item packed into the bins has to be equal to the item’s original size. We first prove that BPPC-IF is still NP-hard even though items can be fragmented. Unlike the Bin Packing Problem with Item Fragmentation (BPPIF), we show that BPPC-IF does not necessarily admit optimal solutions with a special structure. Moreover, we show that preprocessing an instance with oversized items (items with size greater than bin capacity) by packing a fragment of such items with size equal to bin capacity to a single bin does not necessarily yield an optimal solution. Using this observation, we develop a lower bounding procedure. Finally, we propose a heuristic algorithm which sequentially packs items into the bins using the observation about the oversized items. Through an extensive computational study, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed solution approach over the existing algorithms in the literature.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, which demonstrates how both the product and the supply chain can simultaneously be designed based on real-time data. At the heart of the proposed model is the utilisation of a cloud-based management system comprising of three steps. In the first step, a generic bill of materials is modelled to design a set of product families using “AND” and “OR” nodes. In the second step, a cloud-based framework is designed to manage real-time costs viz. echelons. In the third step, a mixed integer linear programming model is then applied, which optimizes the SCD based on real-time costs. We use a metaheuristic method based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the optimization problem. We further illustrate the model using power transformer numerical example. Then the critical parameters of GA are examined to determine the best settings. We believe that the proposed SCD is an intelligent and expert management system, which can facilitate effective decision-making support by taking into account real-time cost data. This is particularly important when there are uncertain and volatile market conditions.},

  abstract     = {Recovery of products has received much attention in the last decade due to the increase in both environmental awareness and regulations enacted by governments. In product recovery, disassembly of a product into its constituent parts on a line is one of the most significant operations. This paper deals with a disassembly line balancing and sequencing (DLBS) problem subject to balancing issues, hazardousness of parts, demand quantities and direction changes considered in a lexicographic order. Due to the combinatorial nature of this problem, exact methods, e.g., mixed integer linear programming (MILP), are able to solve only small and medium size problems. Therefore, various metaheuristic algorithms are proposed in literature to find near-optimal solutions. In this paper, constraint programming (CP), which is a suitable technique especially for highly-constrained discrete problems, is used to develop models and solution approaches. To the best of author’s knowledge, this study is the first that uses CP for the disassembly line balancing problems. For the DLBS problem, first, a generic CP model is developed. This CP model provides efficient results for small/medium size disassembly problems and benchmark instances. Observing that the generic CP model could not produce even feasible sequence of tasks for some large-sized benchmark instances, a CP-based solution approach is proposed. This approach generates a feasible sequence subject to a fixed assignment of tasks to the workstations by using a CP model and uses this sequence as an initial feasible solution within a warm-start context in CP sequencing models. The computational results show that the proposed CP model improves the several best solutions of medium-sized benchmark instances, while the proposed CP-based solution approach produces excellent results in all large test instances by either improving the best solutions (found so far) or establishing new benchmark solutions.},

However, the optimal policy for an MDP may be sensitive to the reward and transition parameters which are often uncertain because parameters are typically estimated from data or rely on expert opinion. To address parameter uncertainty in MDPs, it has been proposed that multiple models of the parameters be incorporated into the solution process, but solving these problems can be computationally challenging. In this article, we propose a policy-based branch-and-bound approach that leverages the structure of these problems and numerically compare several important algorithmic designs.

  abstract     = {A districting problem consisting of the minimization of a dispersion function subject to multiple-activity balancing and contiguity constraints is addressed. This problem arises from a real-world application in a commercial firm responsible for distributing bottled beverage products. The objective is to find a partition of a set of city blocks into a given number of territories that minimizes a p -median problem-based dispersion function. Minimizing this measure allows for territory compactness. Districts must be connected and balanced with respect to both activities: number of customers and workload. A heuristic procedure based on a location-allocation scheme is proposed for this NP-hard problem. This technique has been successfully used for similar territory design problems with single-activity balancing constraints. The proposed method is an iterative algorithm that consists of two phases: first centroids are determined or fixed (location phase) and then units are assigned to centroids (allocation phase). The success of this technique relies on some theoretical properties that no longer hold for problems having multiple-activity balancing constraints. The novelty of our work is to design a framework for handling both connectivity and multiple-activity balancing constraints simultaneously. The solution framework is enhanced by a local search phase that attempts to improve the quality of solutions found in the allocation phase. The empirical work includes a thorough study of the different components of the algorithm, solution of very large scale instances, and comparison with existing work. Extensive empirical testing reveals the effectiveness of the proposed approach, including the impact of both the location-allocation component and its local search component. It is based on the intelligent exploitation of problem structure. The algorithm significantly outperforms one of the best-known heuristics for this problem in terms of feasibility success and solution quality. It obtains similar quality solutions than the ones obtained by the other known heuristic in less computational effort.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers an integrated scheduling problem in an e-commerce supply chain. The supply chain consists of heterogeneous suppliers, consumer-goods manufacturers that offer online channels, and a network of retailers. Suppliers provide raw materials or semi-finished products to manufacturers. Then, manufacturers produce and deliver end items to retailers. The retailers require that the manufacturers maintain a given fill rate, and, otherwise, a penalty will apply. Missing the fill rate can not only result in penalties, but also retailers’ switching, operational issues, and loss of image, and market value. Therefore, the total penalty costs are nonlinear with retailers’ unsatisfied quantities and the fill rate, which exhibits spillover effects. The problem is to select a subset of suppliers, assign retailers’ orders, and identify a production schedule with the manufacturers while minimizing the total costs that includes shipping and penalty. In this paper, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear program and develop a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm that can find a suitable solution within a reasonable time. The algorithm incorporates augmented Lagrangian relaxation and particle swarm optimization. We then perform computational testing on randomly generated cases and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm is robust and efficient. Moreover, we provide a real case study, which demonstrates that the proposed model can lead to a substantial reduction of both the total and penalty costs.},

Using Conditional Value-at-Risk as our measure of risk-aversion, we take into consideration the dispersion of the random total cost arising due to uncertain streamflow amount. We propose an exact solution approach based on scenario decomposition to solve our large scale problem. We then present a case study for the Mediterranean Region in Turkey and generate scenarios using a modified k k -nearest neighbor algorithm for bootstrapping the historical time series data of Manavgat River. The results of our computational study show how an optimal solution differs based on the degree of risk-aversion and demonstrate the computational power of our solution approach. Our algorithm is able to solve instances that cannot be solved by CPLEX, furthermore, CPLEX requires 5.84 times more computation time than our algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This study develops a distributionally robust optimization approach for inventory decisions for a retailer with limited budget ordering multiple products from multiple suppliers. The demand of a product is assumed to be dependent on the current inventory level. Uncertainties are involved in the demands and yields of the products with their means and standard deviations as the only known information. Using the distributionally robust optimization approach, the problem is formulated as a worst-case expected profit maximization model with a budget constraint. Through mathematical deduction, the developed model is transformed into a tractable convex programming model which can be solved efficiently. The closed-form solution for the order quantity using a Lagrange multiplier is proposed and the corresponding algorithm is presented in the case with one reliable or unreliable supplier. The retailer’s ordering decisions are investigated when there are multiple identical or different suppliers, and the effects of yield uncertainties are also assessed. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed models and the solution approaches in dealing with demand and yield uncertainties. Furthermore, the impacts of parameters such as the budget, means and standard deviations of yields and demands, and the correlations between yields on retailer’s ordering policies and performance are analyzed. Managerial insights in selecting suppliers are also provided. In particular, a bootstrapping method is used to estimate the means and standard deviations of the demand and yield distributions in a practical application, and the out-of-sample performance of the resulting optimal inventory policy is evaluated.},

We consider additional conditions in the classic location-allocation problem for clients and facilities. Namely, some pairs have to be served by a common plant. The resulting problem can be addressed with existing models for the case of single assignment. However, to the best of our knowledge, the proposed setting when each client must be assigned to a couple of facilities is still unexplored. We examine the implications of adding such new constraints to standard formulations of the SPLP with double assignment. We compare the resulting formulations from a theoretical point of view. After that, we focus on the study of one of the models, which turned out to be a set packing problem. All the clique facets are identified and a separation algorithm is devised. Although the separation problem is proved to be NP-hard, our computational experience shows that the separation algorithm is effective and efficient, reducing computational times and duality gaps for all the instances tested.},

  abstract     = {In Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSPs), it is usually assumed that the activity durations are known and integers. This assumption helps to conveniently develop a standard mathematical model , using discrete time steps. However, in reality, activity durations may not only be integer, and they may not be known with certainty at the time of project planning. The consideration of real-valued activity durations would increase the complexity in modelling of RCPSPs. In this paper, we consider that activity duration can be either integer or real-valued or both, and they are uncertain. To solve the optimization problem with uncertainty, scenario-based approaches are a popular choice. However, such a solution method is computationally very expensive. Therefore, in this research, we propose a simulation assisted evolutionary framework, that consists of two multi-operator based EAs and two heuristics to deal with the optimization process, and a simulation approach to deal with the uncertainty components. In the simulation, a range of problem instances is evaluated that are generated based on uncertain durations. The framework also proposes a new strategy to reduce the number of simulation runs. In the approach, the solution representation is different from the one required in the mathematical programming approach for RCPSP, and it does not require any discretization of the time periods. More than 1600 test problems, including some industrial problems, with up to 120 activities, have been solved using this proposed approach and the results have been compared with a set of state-of-the-art algorithms. The results obtained by the proposed approach were found to be of acceptable quality with a significant reduction of computational time.},

  abstract     = {Navigating through an airport is easy enough for most passengers, but when you are reduced in mobility it is a different story. In this paper we look at an airport at which between 300 and 500 Passengers with Reduced Mobility (PRMs) arrive daily, who need assistance from airport employees in their journey. We want to find a schedule for these employees to support as many PRMs as possible while ensuring a smooth journey with little waiting time. PRMs may not be left unsupervised, except in a lounge. Since the employees are only allowed to work within their own terminal, the tasks of the employees must be synchronized to enable a smooth hand-over of a PRM. Moreover, we want to find a robust schedule to be resistant against minor disturbances. Since we must be able to reschedule in case of a major disturbance, the maximum computation time of our algorithm is restricted to two minutes. This problem was first studied by Reinhardt et al., who present an insertion heuristic, where the order in which the PRMs are considered is modified through local search. We present a decomposition model in which we first determine feasible start times for the tasks describing the journeys of the passengers using Simulated Annealing, after which in each iteration we assign the tasks to the employees using a (heuristic) matching algorithm . Experimental results show that our algorithm is able to ensure smooth, robust connections, while supporting every passenger in the given deterministic instances, which originate from Reinhardt et al. Finally, we present a simulation study to test our approach in a dynamic environment. It turns out that it can easily deal with these disturbances in real time and come up with very good solutions.

  abstract     = {The Container Drayage Problem (CDP) aims at routing a fleet of trucks, based at a common terminal, to serve customers while minimizing the total travel distance. Each trip starts from and ends at the terminal, and handles a subset of customers. Each customer requires either that a container is picked up or delivered. We introduce a more realistic variant, i.e., the Multi-trip Multi-period CDP with Release and Due Dates (MM-CDP-RDD), in which the planning horizon is composed of several periods (days). On each day, each truck may perform more than one trip respecting the Release and Due Dates (RDD) associated with customer services, corresponding to the first and the last day on which the service can be carried out, respectively. Drivers’ contracts impose limitations on the maximum driving time allowed on each day, on two consecutive days and on the whole weekly planning horizon. To model the MM-CDP-RDD, we propose both an Arc-based Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation and a Trip-based ILP formulation that receives as input all the feasible non-dominated trips. To efficiently address medium/large-sized instances of the problem, we also design six Combinatorial Benders’ Cuts approaches. All the methods are compared on a rich set of instances generated for this new problem.},

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms under a variety of production scenarios.

A number of approximation methods have been provided to overcome such intractability. Monte Carlo type methods are the most general and practical approaches approximating the Shapley value thanks to coalitions sampling. Their efficiency depends on the associated sampling and approximation steps. Most of the contributions focus on the sampling step that suffers from a loss of information and the difficulty to deliver a value satisfying certain expected properties such as efficiency and monotonicity. In this paper, we propose an improvement of the approximation step. It associates a Bayesian approach to that of Monte Carlo, to derive a Shapley value approximation, preserving certain expected properties essential for handling real-world applications.

To solve the problem, we adapt policies introduced for the identical and unrelated parallel machine environments. We show that, with the help of lower bounds specific for the uniform machine environment, we can tighten the performance guarantees that are implied by the results for the unrelated machine environment for the special case of two machine speeds.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of e-commerce and the new retail, the same-day or even same-half day delivery service is provided to compete for market share. Recently, an increased number of e-commerce companies implement the unmanned smart warehouses to improve the logistics efficiency. In order to further reduce the demand response time, a novel picking strategy is designed to firstly split the orders, and then assign the partial orders to different pickers. After all the order segments have been collected, it is shipped to the customer. Due to the inherent complexity of the problem, a two stage optimization model is introduced. In the first stage, an order splitting and batching strategy based on spatial measure is proposed. And a MIP model is constructed to minimize the total picking distance, which is then solved via a column generation based algorithm. In the second stage, the newly formed batches are considered as a priori inputs, which are then assigned to automatic pickers. The picking process is modeled as a special parallel machine scheduling problem with multiple due dates for a single item, which could reduce to a customer order scheduling problem on parallel machines, and it is unary NP-complete. A heuristic method is proposed to obtain an approximate solution. Although the order splitting technique is not new in the logistics industry, the split orders are picked according to a vehicle routing problem, which fails to address the kitting issue for fast turnovers. In the numerical analysis section, the proposed algorithm is validated through extensive testing on various scales of instances. It is observed that the optimality gap for our algorithm is within 9\%, and the computation time is around 5 min. Also, the average turnover rate increases by approximately 50\% in comparison with the no-splitting policy. In most cases, the average order tardiness decreases by 90\% compared with order splitting and no-kitting policy.},

We present two heuristics (matheuristics) for the problem, one using partial integer optimisation, that are directly based upon our formulation. We also consider the problem of how to sequence the racks for presentation at each individual picker and formulate this problem as an integer program. We prove that, subject to certain conditions being satisfied, a feasible rack sequence for all orders can be produced by focusing on just a subset of the orders to be dealt with by the picker. Computational results are presented, both for order and rack allocation, and for rack sequencing, for randomly generated test problems (that are made publicly available) involving up to 1000 products, 200 orders, 500 racks and 10 pickers.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an iterated local search (ILS) based heuristic for the weighted vertex coloring problem (WVCP). Given a graph G ( V , E ) G(V,E) with a weight w ( v ) w(v) associated with each vertex v ∈ V v∈V , the WVCP asks to find a coloring { V 1 , … , V k } {V1,…,Vk} of G that minimizes ∑ i = 1 k max v ∈ V i w ( v ) ∑i=1kmaxv∈Viw(v) . This problem has many theoretical and practical applications, such as batch scheduling, buffer minimization, and traffic assignment in telecommunication. Our ILS heuristic relies on two new neighborhood structures for the problem, and its local search component is hybridized with a tabu search strategy. We compare our approach with state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods for the problem. Experimental results on well-known benchmark instances demonstrate that, first, our heuristic is better than the other heuristics in both solution quality and computational time, and, second, it is a good alternative for large instances that cannot be solved by exact methods.},

  abstract     = {Multi-stage semi-open queuing networks (SOQNs) are widely used to analyze the performance of multi-stage manufacturing systems and automated warehousing systems. While there are several methods available for solving single-stage SOQNs, solution methods for multi-stage SOQNs are limited. Decomposition of a multi-stage SOQN into single-stage SOQNs and evaluation of an individual single-stage SOQN is a possibility. However, the challenge lies in obtaining the job departure process information from an upstream single-stage SOQN to evaluate the performance of a downstream single-stage SOQN. In this paper, we propose a two-moment approximation approach for estimating the squared coefficient of variation of the job inter-departure time from a single-stage SOQN, which can serve as an input to link multi-stage SOQNs. Using numerical experiments, we test the robustness of the proposed approach for various input parameter settings for both single and multi-class jobs. We find that the proposed approach works quite well, particularly when the coefficient of variation of the job inter-arrival time is less than two. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach using a case study on a multi-tier shuttle-based compact storage system and benchmark our results with an existing approach. The results indicate that our approach yields more accurate estimates of the performance measures in comparison to the existing approach in the literature.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a real-time parking-sharing program with which owners of private parking spaces can lend out their parking spaces to other drivers to park when these are not in use. Compared with curbside and garage parking problems, the information of supplies and demands is randomly announced by drivers and owners respectively via a parking-sharing APP installed on their smartphones. Besides, the parking spaces made available by independent owners are usually heterogeneous in terms of their locations and available time intervals . Thus, two critical issues need to be resolved: (a) appropriately matching demands and supplies under an uncertain setting; and (b) efficiently scheduling the demands matched to avoid potential parking conflicts. We propose a novel real-time reservation approach based on a rolling-horizon framework, which can assign multiple drivers to a single parking space in order to better utilize scarce parking resources. For each period, an integrated optimal matching-and-scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming model and proved to be strongly NP-hard. To fast generate a near-optimal solution to the problem, a two-stage heuristics derived from the minimum-cost flow problem is developed. The computational results validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Some operational insights are also presented and discussed.},

  abstract     = {Cities suffer from high traffic congestion of which one of the main causes is the unorganized pursuit for available parking. Apart from traffic congestion, the blind search for a parking slot causes financial and environmental losses. We consider a general parking allocation scenario in which the GPS data of a set of vehicles, such as the current locations and destinations of the vehicles, are available to a central agency which will guide the vehicles toward a designated parking lot, instead of the entered destination. In its natural form, the parking allocation problem is dynamic, i.e., its input is continuously updated. Therefore, standard static allocation and assignment rules do not apply in this case. In this paper, we propose a framework capable of tackling these real-time updates. From a methodological point of view, solving the dynamic version of the parking allocation problem represents a quantum leap compared with solving the static version. We achieve this goal by solving a sequence of 0–1 programming models over the planning horizon, and we develop several parking policies. The proposed policies are empirically compared on real data gathered from three European cities: Belgrade, Luxembourg, and Lyon. The results show that our framework is scalable and can improve the quality of the allocation, in particular when parking capacities are low.},

  abstract     = {The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Stochastic Waiting Times at Recharging Stations is an extension of the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows where the electric vehicles (EVs) may wait in a queue before the recharging service starts due to limited number of chargers available at stations. Since the customers and the depot are associated with time windows, long waiting times at the stations in addition to the recharging times may cause disruptions in logistics operations. To solve this problem, we present a two-stage simulation-based heuristic using Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS). In the first stage, the routes are determined using expected waiting time values at the stations. While the vehicles are following their tours, upon arrival at the stations, their queueing times are revealed. If the actual waiting time at a station exceeds its expected value, the time windows of the subsequent customers on the route may be violated. In this case, the second stage corrects the infeasible solution by penalizing the time-window violations and late returns to the depot. The proposed ALNS applies several destroy and repair operators adapted for this specific problem. In addition, we propose a new adaptive mechanism to tune the constant waiting times used in finding the first-stage solution. To investigate the performance of the proposed approach and the influence of the stochastic waiting times on routing decisions and costs, we perform an experimental study using both small and large instances from the literature. The results show that the proposed simulation-based solution approach provides good solutions both in terms of quality and of computational time. It is shown that the uncertainty in waiting times may have significant impact on route plans.},

  abstract     = {Metaheuristic algorithms offer unique opportunities in problem solving. Although they do not guarantee optimality, it has been shown by numerous publications that they can achieve excellent results in acceptable time. Particularly in real-life production systems, which are mostly comprised of complex discrete optimization problems, the merit should be finding appropriate and efficient solutions in shorter periods rather than waiting for the optimum solution in whole shift. Accordingly, this paper presents a learning iterated greedy search metaheuristic to minimize the maximum completion time in a hybrid flexible flowshop problem with sequence dependent setup times encountered at a manufacturing plant. The proposed algorithm is comprised of four main phases. The first phase employs NEH heuristic to generate an initial solution. Additionally, in order to introduce diversity, some replications are occasionally allowed to start with random solutions. Destruction mechanism to perturb the current solution is used in the next phase. It is followed by a construction procedure, which is used to repair the partial solution obtained after destruction. Finally, a descent neighborhood search enhanced by a hyper-heuristic based learning is applied to the repaired solution in the fourth phase. Thus, algorithm adaptively learns and promotes the most efficient low-level heuristic out of a heuristics pool and encourages the metaheuristic algorithm in using the promoted low-level heuristic in the final phase. The proposed algorithm along with its several extensions is tested by using real data taken from the mentioned production system. Next, by making use of the same data, the developed algorithms are also compared to eight different algorithms, which are shown to be promising in the related literature. Finally, appropriate statistical tests are applied to demonstrate possible significant improvements among all tested algorithms.},
