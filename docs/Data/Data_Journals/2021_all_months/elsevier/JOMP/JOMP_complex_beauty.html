  abstract     = {We examine different models of recognition memory in a simultaneous detection and identification task, which features multiple simultaneously presented test stimuli. A common finding from eyewitness identification research investigating such tasks is that the more confident decision makers are about detecting the presence of a target, the higher the probability that they also correctly identify it. We demonstrate that for members of the signal detection theory (SDT) model framework, predicting such a relationship is — contrary to previous assertions — not entailed by a monotonic diagnosticity ratio. Instead, it can be shown that this prediction follows if latent memory signals’ rank order probabilities exhibit monotonicity under changes in the response criterion. For a selection of common SDT models, we prove that this monotonicity property holds in situations in which two test stimuli are presented simultaneously. Threshold models such as the two-high-threshold model (2HTM), however, do not necessarily possess this feature. Leveraging this fact, we show that in the presence of lures which resemble a target, the 2HTM is unable to make the same predictions as many reasonable SDT models with monotonic rank order probabilities. This enables us to construct a critical, distribution-free test between these models. An empirical investigation implementing this test reveals a clear failure of the 2HTM to account for the qualitative response patterns, which are consistent with the predictions of SDT models with monotonic rank order probabilities.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion models with constant boundaries and constant drift function have been successfully applied to model phenomena in a wide range of areas in psychology. In recent years, more complex models with time-dependent boundaries and space-time-dependent drift functions have gained popularity. One obstacle to the empirical and theoretical evaluation of these models is the lack of simple and efficient numerical algorithms for computing their first-passage time distributions. In the present work we use a known series expansion for the first-passage time distribution for models with constant drift function and constant boundaries to simplify the Kolmogorov backward equation for models with time-dependent boundaries and space-time-dependent drift functions. We show how a simple Crank–Nicolson scheme can be used to efficiently solve the simplified equation.},

  abstract     = {In nearly all situations, a person’s performance varies across time (i.e., trials), for example due to vigilance decrements or training. When the performance depends on multiple sources of information, the variation could be either due to changes in processing each source or the efficiency of combining the sources. The capacity coefficient is a frequently used statistic for measuring the efficiency of combining multiple sources of information, but in most applications the analyses assume stationary performance across trials. A trial-varying capacity measure would be valuable in determining the nature of the change over trials but dropping the stationarity assumption results in a severe loss in power. In this work, we develop a Bayesian trial-varying model of the capacity coefficient to estimate the efficiency of an individual processing multiple sources of information. This model is based on the Weibull distribution to approximately characterize the processing time of each source, with an inverse gamma distribution prior for the scale parameter and a known shape. This approach provided us a tractable way to update prior estimates for real-time estimation of capacity across trials. We demonstrate the approach with both simulated and human data.},

One essential goal of these computational models is the generalization to new sets of observations. Extracting parameters that can reliably predict out-of-sample data can be difficult, however. The use of prior distributions to regularize parameter estimates has been shown to help remedy this issue. While previous research has suggested that empirical priors estimated from a separate dataset improve predictive accuracy , this paper outlines an alternate method for the derivation of empirical priors: hierarchical Bayesian modeling. We provide a detailed introduction to this method, and show that using hierarchical models to simultaneously extract and impose empirical priors leads to better out-of-sample prediction while being more data efficient.},

  abstract     = {The research described in this paper began with the goal to develop critical tests of the two-high-threshold model of memory. Based on initial findings by Kellen and Klauer (2014) , we focus on a ranking task in which one target and n − 1 n−1 foils are ranked in decreasing order of perceived likelihood of being the target. The resulting distribution of interest is the probability that the target is ranked in position k k . We show that the two-high-threshold model predicts that the hazard function of this distribution increases monotonically for k &gt; 1 k&amp;gt;1 . We generalize this result to the case in which each foil has a different probability of being detected under the model. These results are compared with two alternative models for recognition memory. The research exploring these issues has led us to an investigation of the Poisson-binomial distribution, showing that it too has a monotonically increasing hazard. In our opinion this finding is novel and significant because the Poisson binomial distribution can have many other applications outside of memory research and outside of psychology. In addition it is proved that any memory theory for the ranking task, which produces rank probabilities that form a strictly log-concave sequence, predicts a monotonically increasing hazard function. The hazard function for the ranking task for a single experimental condition thus enables a critical test for a potentially large class of memory theories other than just the two-high-threshold model.},

In particular, response times tend to decrease as the overall (summed) value of the options increase. Standard sequential sampling models such as the diffusion model can account for this fact by assuming that decision thresholds or noise vary with overall value. Alternatively, gaze-based models that incorporate eye-tracking data can accommodate this overall-value effect directly as a consequence of the multiplicative relationship between gaze and option value. We compare the fit of non-gaze diffusion models to data simulated with a multiplicative-gaze model. The results show how parameters related to decision thresholds or noise will vary as a function of overall value, even when there is no such variability in the data generating process. In empirical data, we find similar patterns where decision thresholds, noise, or non-decision time seem to vary with overall value. Our results reveal that specific patterns in standard diffusion model parameters can arise from a latent process of gaze-dependent evidence accumulation.},

They quantify computational hardness of tasks based on particular algorithms or for specific problems. Here, we propose a set of measures of computational hardness of individual instances of a task in a way that is independent of any algorithm or computational model and can be generalized to other problems. Specifically, we introduce two measures, typical-case complexity (TCC), a measure of average hardness of a random ensemble of instances, and instance complexity (IC), an instance-specific metric. Both measures are related to structural properties of instances. We then test the effect of those measures on human behavior by asking participants to solve instances of two variants of the 0-1 knapsack problem, a canonical and ubiquitous NP-hard problem. We find that participants spent more time on instances with higher TCC and IC, but that decision quality was lower in those instances. We propose that the study of mathematical properties of tasks related to computational hardness can contribute to the development of computationally plausible accounts of human decision-making, just like stochastic properties have proven to be critical to our understanding of human decisions in probabilistic tasks.},

The construction treats each indifference-connected component of the semiorder separately. It uses a partition of such an indifference-connected component into indifference classes. Each element in the indifference-connected component is mirrored, using a “ghost” element, into a reference indifference class that is weakly ordered. A numerical representation of this weak order is used as the basis for the construction of the unit representation after an appropriate lifting operation. We apply the procedure to each indifference-connected component and assemble them adequately to obtain an overall unit representation. Our proof technique has several original features. It uses elementary tools and can be seen as the extension of a technique designed for the finite case, using a denumerable set of inductions. Moreover, it gives us much control on the representation that is built, so that it is, for example, easy to investigate its uniqueness. Finally, we show in a companion paper that our technique can be extended to the general (uncountable) case, almost without changes, through the addition of adequate order-denseness conditions.},

  abstract     = {Physical colors, i.e. reflected or emitted lights entering the eyes from a visual environment, are converted into perceived colors sensed by humans by neurophysiological mechanisms. These processes involve both three types of photoreceptors , the LMS cones, and spectrally opponent and non-opponent interactions resulting from the activity rates of ganglion and lateral geniculate nucleus cells. Thus, color perception is a phenomenon inherently linked to an experimental environment (the visual scene) and an observing apparatus (the human visual system). This is clearly reminiscent of the conceptual foundation of both relativity and quantum mechanics, where the link is between a physical system and the measuring instruments. The relationship between color perception and relativity was explicitly examined for the first time by the physicist H. Yilmaz in 1962 from an experimental point of view. The main purpose of this contribution is to present a rigorous mathematical model that, by taking into account both trichromacy and color opponency, permits to explain on a purely theoretical basis the relativistic color perception phenomena argued by Yilmaz. Instead of relying directly on relativistic considerations, we base our theory on a quantum interpretation of color perception together with just one assumption, called trichromacy axiom, that summarizes well-established properties of trichromatic color vision within the framework of Jordan algebras. We show how this approach allows us to reconcile trichromacy with Hering’s opponency and also to derive the relativistic properties of perceived colors without any additional mathematical or experimental assumption. In doing so, we also introduce several novel and mathematically rigorous definitions of chromatic attributes and discuss their counterparts in classical colorimetry. Finally, we underline the important role played by the Hilbert metric in our framework and its compatibility with known experimental data .},

This deterministic model accounts for both the accuracy of the responses and, especially, the sequence of ”moves” (observable solution process) made by the problem solver . A Markov model of the solution process of a problem-solving task is proposed, that provides a stochastic framework for the empirical test of the deterministic model and the related problem-space-derived learning space. This type of model allows for making predictions with respect to both the observable solution process, and the unobservable knowledge state on which the solution process is assumed to be based. The Tower of London test has been chosen as the problem-solving task for the empirical validation of the model.

In the present article, the navigation behavior and the learning process of a user of a web-based tutoring system are jointly modeled as BMPs constrained by assumptions that are coherent with the concepts of competence-based knowledge space theory. Such constraints are expressed as formal assumptions about the web-based system and about the nature of the learning process. Scenarios are considered where the observed process is the navigation of an individual through the pages of an intelligent tutoring system , whereas the latent learning process consists of transitions among states in a competence structure. The approach seems to be rather general and flexible in modeling learning scenarios with different assumptions. As an example, BMP models are developed for some exemplary scenarios. Maximum likelihood parameter estimation via expectation–maximization algorithm is presented. The results of a simulation study showed that the parameter values are well-recovered by the estimation algorithm. The results of the application of a bivariate Markov model to the real data of students navigating the intelligent tutoring system Stat-Knowlab showed that the proposed approach provides useful insight into students’ learning processes.},

By exploratory data analysis , from a binary data matrix, the method extracts logical implications between dichotomous test items. For example, assume that we have the problems i i and j j of a test that can be solved or failed by subjects. With inductive item tree analysis, an implication i → j i→j between the items i i and j j can be uncovered, which has the interpretation ”If a subject is able to solve item i i , then this subject is also able to solve item j j ”. Hence, in the current form of the method, solely dichotomous items are considered. In this paper, we extend this approach to the general case of polytomous items, when more than two answer categories are possible. Thus, we introduce extensions of inductive item tree analysis that can deal with nominal polytomous (including dichotomous) and ordinal polytomous, each with item-specific, answer scales. To show their usefulness, the extensions proposed in this paper are illustrated with empirical data examples.},

For initiates in this research area, the foundational relationship between SDT and the SPRT, or between statistical inference models and their mechanistic counterparts, can be unclear because many decision-making models in use today are much extended versions of the original, simpler models that contain the essence of these models’ claims to optimality . For those familiar with the models, it would be useful to have a quantitative comparison between their performance as multi-sample hypothesis tests. In this tutorial review of SDT and the SPRT, we emphasize that SDT and the SPRT differ only in their sampling procedures and so can be viewed as static and dynamic variants from the same family of hypothesis tests. Furthermore, we map the sample efficiency gains of using the SPRT over a multi-sample version of SDT by a novel construction of ROC curves. The goal of this paper is to provide a compact treatise on the statistical underpinnings of SDT and the SPRT, how they relate to the drift–diffusion model (DDM), and what these models imply for the physical implementation of evidence gathering and optimal decision making in biological systems.},

The number of parameters needed to describe this distribution can thus be very large. An exception is provided by the Simple Learning Model (SLM) in which, by means of assumptions on the learning process, the distribution is built from other parameters. However, the application of the SLM is limited to learning spaces. The present work generalizes the SLM by suggesting a method to build the state probabilities as products of the probabilities of single (or groups of) items. The construction follows from first factorizing the probability distribution into the product of marginal and conditional probabilities based on the blocks of an ordered exact cover of the item domain, and then by imposing suitable constraints on these probabilities. A specific ordered exact cover of the item domain, distinguishing minimal from non-minimal items, is shown to be of particular interest as it allows to recover the SLM and to generalize it to a wider class of regular knowledge structures.},

Overall, performance decreased in nonreward conditions but remained stable in reward conditions. The comparisons between our models and empirical data showed that our models were able to capture human performance. We managed to model changes in performance levels by adjusting the value of the main task goals, which controls the competition with distractions. In all the tasks modeled, the best model fits were obtained by a linear decrease in goal activation, suggesting this is a general pattern. We discuss possible mechanisms for activation decrease, and the potential of goal competition to model motivation.},

  abstract     = {Human beings can perceive depth by using binocular disparity , namely the difference between a stereo-pair of retinal images. It is commonly believed that the visual system requires oculomotor information about the relative orientation between the two eyes to perceive depth on the basis of binocular disparity. Such oculomotor information can be obtained from the efference copy of the oculomotor signal, or it can be derived from the vertical component of the binocular disparity (vertical disparity). Psychophysical studies have shown that stereo depth perception is affected by both the efference copy and by the vertical disparity. But note that any role for the efference signal for spatial perception is limited and the process using vertical disparity is slow. These effects are too restricted to explain depth perception under natural viewing conditions in which natural eye movements are made. In the present study, I describe a computational model that can recover depth from a stereo-pair of retinal images based only on the geometrical optics. This model treats depth recovery as a Direct problem rather than as an Inverse problem because it does not need to make use of any oculomotor information or of any a priori constraints. In this model, oculomotor information is not even implicitly recovered. Simply put, this paper shows that, at least from a computational perspective, oculomotor information and a priori constraints are not actually required for the stereo perception of depth. Having such a model allows us to discuss psychophysical and neurophysiological phenomena, as well as their mechanisms, without assuming that the human visual system needs oculomotor information to recover depth in a 3D scene from stereo retinal images.},

New Ising spin models are presented for the latter two problems. Additionally, we provide MATLAB software programs for obtaining solutions via enumeration of all spin ensembles (when computationally feasible) and simulated annealing. We are not claiming that the Ising spin model should be the preferred approach for formulating and solving graph-theoretic problems on conventional digital computers but it does provide a unifying framework for these problems, which may lead to future computational improvements. Recent progress in the development of quantum computing architecture has shown that Ising spin models can afford enormous improvements in algorithm efficiency when implemented on these platforms, potentially leading to widespread use of the methodology in the future.},

We obtain analytic expressions for the ‘optimal’ proportion of the bet to cash-out for bettors with CPT preferences. Diminishing sensitivity or marginal utility leads bettors to prefer to cash-out likely winning bets, but not likely losing bets. Any preference to liquidate bets early is exacerbated by probability weighting and loss aversion. We demonstrate that partial liquidation (cashing-out a fraction of the bet) may be optimal under CPT in well-defined situations. Some potential solutions are presented for reducing the tendency for bettors to cash-out in the gain domain.},

Here, we propose a novel computational model, the exponential-weight mean–variance (EWMV) model, which addresses the limitations of existing models. By using multiple model comparison methods, including post hoc model fits criterion and parameter recovery, we showed that the EWMV model outperforms the existing models. In addition, we applied the EWMV model to BART data from healthy controls and substance-using populations (patients with past opiate and stimulant dependence). The results suggest that (1) the EWMV model addresses the limitations of existing models and (2) heroin-dependent individuals show reduced risk preference than other groups, which may have significant clinical implications.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, Bayesian causal inference has emerged as a computational principle for multisensory integration; it considers the causal relationships of multisensory stimuli and combines stimuli only when they are causally related. Many empirical studies have confirmed the predictions of Bayesian causal inference models and have begun to reveal the neural mechanisms of their computations. However, some studies have suggested that Bayesian causal inference does not always hold, and it is still unclear if Bayesian causal inference is a general computational principle or whether it simply represents a limited range of multisensory integration. Most theoretical and empirical Bayesian causal inference studies have focused on the binary judgement of pairs of multisensory stimuli or sequences of stimuli. One empirical study presented a more complex case with one auditory stimulus and two visual stimuli. In this study, I propose three Bayesian causal models with different causal structures regarding the same scenario. The first model assumes that an auditory stimulus is integrated with a visual stimulus only when they share the same source. During model derivation, I present a hierarchical formulation of causal structural priors in complex situations with multiple number of audio-visual stimuli. The second model assumes that an auditory stimulus is forcibly integrated with one of two visual stimuli. The third model assumes that all three stimuli are forcibly integrated. First, with minimum assumptions, I demonstrated that the full causal model explains existing experimental results better than the other two models. Meanwhile, by introducing another modelling parameter for simultaneity judgement criterion in different experimental conditions, the extended versions of the other two models also described the experimental results almost as accurately as the full causal model. It was confirmed that all three models explain the empirical results of simultaneity judgements of audio-visual stimuli, as well as the enhancement of sensitivity, to some degree. Although these models are difficult to distinguish based on existing data, they provide different interpretations of the underlying mechanisms of empirical findings. Additionally, I demonstrated that these models make qualitatively different predictions, and presented experimental manipulations that can distinguish the models based on the underlying causal structures of multiple multisensory stimuli.},

  abstract     = {In knowledge space theory, the (latent) knowledge state of a student consists of the subset of test items that he masters in principle. Even at a given stage of apprenticeship, the student’s knowledge state may vary in a given collection of subsets. The collection of all possible states of all potential students forms a knowledge structure. In the modeling of student answer production, the probabilities governing the knowledge state are parameters. Moreover, for each item, two additional parameters capture the probabilities of careless errors and lucky guesses in the answers to the item. From all the latter parameters, the Correct Response Model (CRM) predicts the probability of a correct answer to any isolated item. From the same parameters, the Basic Local Independence Model (BLIM) predicts the probability of any possible pattern of correct responses. Here, a particular pattern records at a given time all the items to which a given student would provide correct answers. While general properties of the BLIM (such as identifiability of parameters) have been investigated, the simpler Correct Response Model still requires scrutiny. The present paper investigates the CRM as regards testability, identifiability and characterizability. It either provides explicit answers or points out serious difficulties garnered from various mathematical disciplines.},

The first is to utilize a partial order of skills which belong to a given domain of knowledge to find items or problems which finally constitute a knowledge space or a learning space. Secondly the orders of skills of different (related) areas are coalesced by well known order operations to construct larger spaces. In the first part a so called basic set representation of an order is utilized to considerably simplify the construction of knowledge spaces. In the second part the techniques to “add” and “multiply” orders are applied to given orders resulting in new orders to which the set representation theory of the first part is applied. Properties of the building blocks are identified which can be transferred to the combination and yield properties of the final knowledge space which make their handling a bit more convenient. In particular, places which proved useful in the construction of the first part are identified when these order operations are utilized.},

  abstract     = {Based on the celebrated Birkhoff theorem, Doignon and Falmagne (1985) establish a one-to-one correspondence between certain binary relations on a domain of (dichotomous) items and the quasi-ordinal knowledge spaces defined on it. It is shown that this construction can be generalized to apply to polytomous response formats, where response values are partially ordered so that they form a lattice . Polytomous knowledge states are defined for the case where these response scales are identical across items, as well as for item-specific response scales, a generalization which emerges quite naturally within the developed theoretical framework. Certain collections of polytomous knowledge states are characterized through precedence relations that form particular quasi-orders on an extended set of (virtual) items, including for each item several dichotomous instances representing all the possible response values. These kinds of polytomous knowledge structures can be built from data through applying to the extended item set procedures commonly used in knowledge structure theory. Confining consideration to finite sets of items and response values, the presented theory generalizes previous approaches in this direction. Its application is illustrated for data from the 2011 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).},

The stimuli are presented either alone (single signals) or in combination (redundant signals). In this task, one often observes substantially faster responses to redundant signals than to single signals. Different mechanisms may underlie this so-called redundancy gain, including separate activation and coactivation models. The race model inequality (Miller, 1982) is typically used to distinguish these models. In this article, we consider the generalization of Miller’s inequality to redundant stimuli from three sources (e.g., auditory, visual, tactile). We review the approaches from the literature, and derive several inequalities that have been used to investigate interactions between three sensory modalities. We discuss the limitations and generality of a model which assumes up to three distinct signals representing pairwise interactions of sensory systems, and outline statistical approaches for testing the inequalities in empirical observations.},

In each of these aspects, the interactions of the student with the system are guided by the theory and by insights learned from student data. We present several relationships between theory and data for the ALEKS system. We begin by surveying the ALEKS system and examining some practical aspects of implementing KST on a large scale. We then study the effectiveness of the ALEKS assessment using both standard statistical measures and ones adapted to the KST context.

  abstract     = {Since the influential work of Schelling, binary choice games with externalities (situations in which the consequences of the choices of an agent are affected by the actions of other agents) have become central within social dilemma literature. Previous literature has developed models with agents mainly based on classic probability theory where populations formed by impulsive agents (i.e., they tend to switch strategies even when the difference between payoffs is extremely small) are one of the most common case. However, recent theoretical and empirical findings have showed how the recurrent contextual effects observed in psychology studies are better predicted by the probability theory employed in quantum physics. In this paper, we study the dynamics in binary choices when introducing quantum cognition in the Schelling model, distinguishing between context-insensitive agents (compatible choices in the quantum framework) and context sensitive agents (incompatible choices). We observed that: (i) in the context insensitive model, quantum agents population dynamics can be interpreted as a particular case of the impulsive agents population; (ii) the context-sensitive quantum population dynamics cannot be replicated by a context-insensitive population; (iii) assuming all things being equal, the future choice of the context-sensitive quantum agents is unpredictable. These results suggest that the quantum framework can be seen as an ideal tool to improve the modeling attempt of binary choice with externalities.},

We provide clear evidence, both by comparing responses to perceptually identical probe tones in low and high precision blocks, and using a novel model-based analysis, that subjects did indeed track the precision of the stimulus distribution. This extends previous work looking at electrophysiological effects of precision (or, equivalently, variance) learning, and provides new evidence that the putatively noradrenergic processes underlying pupil dilation reflect rapidly updated information about distributions of sensory stimuli .

  abstract     = {We continue to analyze basic constraints on the human decision making from the viewpoint of quantum measurement theory (QMT). As it has been found, the conventional QMT based on the projection postulate cannot account for the combination of the question order effect (QOE) and the response replicability effect (RRE). This was an alarming finding for quantum-like modeling of decision making. Recently, it was shown that this difficulty can be resolved by using of the general QMT based on quantum instruments. In the present paper we analyze the problem of the combination of QOE, RRE, and the well-known QQ-equality (QQE). This equality was derived by Busemeyer and Wang, and it was shown (in a joint paper with Solloway and Shiffrin) that statistical data from many social opinion polls satisfy it. Here we construct quantum instruments satisfying QOE, RRE and QQE. The general features of our approach are formalized with postulates that generalize (the Wang–Busemeyer) postulates for quantum-like modeling of decision making. Moreover, we show that our model closely reproduces the statistics of the well-known Clinton–Gore Poll data with a prior belief state independent of the question order. This model successfully corrects for the order effect in the data to determine the “genuine” distribution of the opinions in the Poll. The paper also provides an accessible introduction to the theory of quantum instruments — the most general mathematical framework for quantum measurements.},

  abstract     = {Vision and touch interact in spatial perception. How vision exerts online influences on tactile spatial perception is well-appreciated, but far less is known regarding how recent visual experiences modulate tactile perception offline, particularly in a bimanual context. Here, we investigated how visual cues exert both online and offline biases in bimanual tactile spatial perception. In a series of experiments, participants performed a 4-alternative forced-choice tactile detection task in which they reported the perception of peri-threshold taps on the left hand, right hand, both hands, or no touch (LRBN). Participants initially performed the LRBN task in the absence of visual cues. Subsequently, participants performed the LRBN task in blocks comprising non-informative visual cues that were presented on the left and right hands. To explore the effect of distractor salience on the visuo-tactile spatial interactions, we varied the brightness of the visual cues such that visual stimuli associated with one hand were consistently brighter than visual stimuli associated with the other hand. We found that participants performed the tactile detection task in an unbiased manner prior to experiencing visual distractors. Concurrent visual cues biased tactile performance, despite an instruction to ignore vision, and these online effects tended to be larger with brighter distractors. Moreover, tactile performance was biased toward the side of the brighter visual cues even on trials when no visual cues were presented during the visuo-tactile block. Using a modeling framework based on signal detection theory, we compared a number of alternative models to recapitulate the behavioral results and to link the visual influences on touch to sensitivity and criterion reductions. Our collective results imply that recent visual experiences alter the sensitivity of tactile signal detection processes while concurrent visual cues induce more liberal perceptual decisions in the context of bimanual touch.},

Importantly the EO model requires neither the stipulation of a specific format for the memory encoding nor the specification of a model of order learning. The EO model is proved to be identifiable. Also the statistical estimation of the parameters of the EO model is developed using either the population parameter mapping (PPM) procedure or the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method, and these procedures are compared by means of Monte Carlo studies . Furthermore three experiments are described that employ the experimental protocols that enable the estimates of the parameters of the EO model. The experimental evidence shows that item knowledge is quickly acquired; whereas the corresponding acquisition of ordinal information requires many more training trials. The EO model thus provides a new way to measure ordinal information.},

  abstract     = {Comparison of competing statistical models is an essential part of psychological research. From a Bayesian perspective, various approaches to model comparison and selection have been proposed in the literature. However, the applicability of these approaches depends on the assumptions about the model space M M . Also, traditional methods like leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) estimate the expected log predictive density (ELPD) of a model to investigate how the model generalises out-of-sample, and quickly become computationally inefficient when sample size becomes large. Here, a tutorial on Pareto-smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out cross-validation (PSIS-LOO-CV) is provided, which is computationally more efficient. It is shown how Bayesian model selection can be scaled efficiently for big data via PSIS-LOO-CV in combination with approximate posterior inference and probability-proportional-to-size subsampling. First, several model views and the available Bayesian model comparison methods in each are discussed. The Bayesian logistic regression model is then used as a running example to show how to apply the method in practice, and demonstrate that it provides similarly accurate ELPD estimates like LOO-CV or information criteria. Subsequently, the power and exponential law models relating reaction times to practice are used to demonstrate the approach with more complex models. Guidance is provided how to compare competing models based on the ELPD estimates and how to conduct posterior predictive checks to safeguard against overconfidence in one of the models under consideration. The intended audience are researchers who practice mathematical modelling and comparison, possibly with large datasets, and who are well acquainted to Bayesian statistics .},

  abstract     = {In everyday life, our behavior varies on a continuum from automatic and habitual to deliberate and goal-directed. Recent evidence suggests that habit formation and relearning of habits operate in a context-dependent manner: Habit formation is promoted when actions are performed in a specific context, while breaking off habits is facilitated after a context change. It is an open question how one can computationally model the brain’s balancing between context-specific habits and goal-directed actions. Here, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian approach for control of a partially observable Markov decision process that enables conjoint learning of habits and reward structure in a context-specific manner. In this model, habit learning corresponds to an updating of priors over policies and interacts with the learning of the outcome contingencies. Importantly, the model is solely built on probabilistic inference , which effectively provides a simple explanation of how the brain may balance contributions of habitual and goal-directed control. We illustrated the resulting behavior using agent-based simulated experiments, where we replicated several findings of devaluation, extinction, and renewal experiments, as well as the so-called two-step task which is typically used with human participants. In addition, we show how a single parameter, the habitual tendency, can explain individual differences in habit learning and the balancing between habitual and goal-directed control. Finally, we discuss the link of the proposed model to other habit learning models and implications for understanding specific phenomena in substance use disorder.},

  abstract     = {To form a coherent presentation of the world, the brain needs to combine multiple sensory modalities accurately together in the temporal domain. Judgements on the relative timing of audio–visual stimuli are complex, due to the differing propagation speeds of light and sound through the environment and the nervous system , and the dependence of processing latencies on stimulus intensity (Piéron, 1913). Simultaneity judgement (SJ) and temporal order judgement (TOJ) tasks are often used to assess the temporal mechanisms underlying this binding process. However, these tasks consistently produce measures of perceived simultaneity that are uncorrelated with each other, leading to the suggestion that SJ and TOJ tasks could depend on separate neural mechanisms. Parise and Ernst’s (2016) multisensory correlation detector (MCD) model predicts this lack of correlation by assuming two internal processing stages, a lag computation and a correlation. Here we include and empirically evaluate an intensity-dependent processing delay in the MCD model. We estimate the points of subjective simultaneity (PSSs) using both SJ and TOJ tasks for four different visual intensities and a fixed auditory sound level. Evaluation of four variants of the intensity-dependent MCD model shows that the introduction of an early processing delay can predict the different PSS values obtained in the two respective tasks, without the need for later intensity-dependent multisensorial processing stages. Crucially, this early processing delay can be estimated from simple reaction times.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a set of models designed to analyze datasets involving responses from multiple subjects on pairwise comparisons from a fixed discrete set of alternatives. These models are part of a greater body of work known as Cultural Consensus Theory (CCT). Like other CCT models, these simultaneously infer each individual’s tendency toward aligning with the group consensus, level of agreement on each item, and also a latent consensus value of each alternative. Two primary models are discussed, referred to as the Strong and Weak Consensus Paired-Comparison Models (SCPCM and WCPCM respectively). The SCPCM works under the assumption that all individuals are answering in accordance to the latent consensus values but with varying degrees of accuracy, while the WCPCM relaxes this assumption and assumes minor deviations from latent consensus values in people’s average valuation of alternatives. The WCPCM also includes inferences on participants’ individual tendencies toward self-consistency (related to their tendencies toward committing violations of transitivity) as well as inferences on the tendency of each item to be evaluated consistently by individuals. The Case III Thurstonian model is used as the backbone for both CPCMs, and inference is conducted under a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Model checks along with applications to both simulated and real data are overviewed.},
