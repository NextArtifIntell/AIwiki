In this paper, we construct the N N -fold generalized Darboux transformation (DT) with the limit approach, from which the general higher-order rogue wave solutions of the cDNLSIII equation are obtained. These solutions, divided into three categories, namely, rogue waves and rogue waves on multi-soliton and multi-breather backgrounds, have applications in nonlinear fiber communication. Furthermore, we present some interesting interactions between rogue waves and solitons or breathers and analyze the features of each type.},

Given the existence of interval uncertainty and the constraint concerning positivity of the original system, a new positive state-bounding observer is constructed to guarantee the coinstantaneous estimation of system state and sensor faults. To deal with actuator saturation, the convex hull scheme is employed. By designing the state-feedback controller and utilizing the multiple time-varying linear co-positive Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions for the robust exponential stability on the studied system are established under dwell-time switching. Furthermore, for optimizing the observer matrix, an iterative algorithm is developed.

The revolving disk is considered to move freely with uniform angular velocity. The surface of the disk is permeable. The nanofluid flow is considered thermally radiative. Also, the presence of a heat source/sink is included to portray a more realistic outcome. How the permeability feature of the surface affects the hydrothermal integrity has been analyzed in detail. The prime dimensional equations are made dimensionless using appropriate similarity transformation. After then, the spectral quasi linearization method (SQLM) is operated to solve those equations. Residual plots are extracted to exhibit the speediness of the introduced SQLM technique. Several graphs, three-dimensional figures, and tables are rendered to avail the consequences of the underlying parameters. The linear regression slope procedure is included to quantify the enhancement or reduction of the heat and mass transport as well as shear stresses. The outcomes assured that the normalized thickness parameter augments the radial velocity and nanoparticle concentration. Chemical reaction reduces the concentration profile for suction but amplifies for injection. The temperature drops off for suction, while it amplifies for injection. Heat transport drops off for heat source, but heat sink conveys the reverse scenario. Heat source drops down the heat transference at the rate of 0.69874 for injection and 0.8374 for suction. Mass transport amplifies for chemical reaction during injection, while the reverse trend is detected for suction. This investigation has noteworthy applications in the mechanical and chemical engineering process.},

  abstract     = {How biodiversity is maintained is one of the most important problems in biology. It, seemingly, challenges the Darwinian evolutionary theory which assumes that only the fittest species survive. Most previous researches try to solve the puzzle based on deterministic dynamics. However, it is not clear how demographic stochasity plays a role in biodiversity, even though randomness cannot be ignored in real biological systems. In contrast with deterministic methods, we propose that biodiversity is measured by the time that the species coexist. Modeled by the cyclic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, we concentrate on the Fermi process, where randomness is captured by the selection intensity. We find that there is a non-monotonic relationship between the selection intensity and the time that the species coexist. Intrinsic differences between stochastic dynamics and deterministic dynamics are shown to be present, even if the selection is in its strong limit which mirrors the deterministic dynamics. Furthermore, we prove that these results are robust for general stochastic imitation processes beyond the Fermi process. Our work highlights the importance of transient dynamics on biodiversity, which is absent in the deterministic counterpart, and opens an avenue to calculate biodiversity under stochastic evolutionary process.},

For the case when each follower in coupled MNNs have direct access to the leader MNN, a decentralized event-triggered scheme is provided. A distributed event-triggered controller is also designed when the node in coupled MNNs can only get the information of its neighbors. Some sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee the fixed-time event-triggered synchronization of considered coupled MNNs under these two situations, respectively. The upper bounds of the settling time are given and the Zeno behaviour is excluded for the two cases. Two numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.

Due to this polytope’s dependence, checking the spectral radius is difficult from the numerical viewpoint. As an attempt to solve the problem, we convert the polytope-based condition into a randomized approach.

  abstract     = {It is a well-known fact that there are chaotic behaviors of neurons in the brain. These chaotic behaviors may affect the membrane potential dynamics of neurons. In the current study, we present a new phenomenon, called as Chaos Delayed Decay (CDD), which emerges when the first spike latency of a periodically forced deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley neuron exhibits a prominent delay depending on the chaotic current intensity. First, we indicate that the firing rate of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron exhibits resonance-like dependence on the intensity of chaotic current. Then, we demonstrate that the first spike latency and jitter exhibits a resoance-like dependence on the chaotic current intensity for frequencies separating subthreshold and suprathreshold frequency regions. Besides, the obtained results reveal that chaotic activity may have unfavorable effects on the response of Hodgkin-Huxley neuron in the region of supra-threshold frequencies where the lowest mean latency and jitter occur. In this region increasing chaotic activity has augmented the latency and jitter in contrast to sub-threshold frequency region in which the mean latency and jitter of Hodgkin-Huxley neuron reasonably decrease versus increasing chaotic current intensity. It is also shown that, in this regime, the mean latency and jitter are insensitive to changes in frequency for high chaotic current intensities. Lastly, we have analyzed the effects of the phase of the forcing signal on the latency and jitter of the neuron. For a forcing signal in the lower sub-threshold region and an optimal one in the supra-threshold region, it is observed that there is an optimal initial phase of the forcing signal for the best encoding of information by the neuron, whereas the mean latency and jitter are insensitive to changes in the initial phase of the forcing signal in the upper sub-threshold region with high frequencies.},

  abstract     = {A practical resource allocation strategy is the prerequisite for disease control during a pandemic affected by various external factors, such as the information about the epidemic state, the interregional population mobility, and the geographical factors . Understanding the influence of these factors on resource allocation and epidemic spreading is the premise for designing an optimal resource allocation strategy. To this end, we study the interaction of resource allocation and epidemic spreading in the scope of the metapopulation model by incorporating the factors of geographic proximity, the information of the epidemic state, the willingness of resource allocation, and the population mobility simultaneously. We develop a mathematical framework based on the Markovian chain approach to analyze the dynamical system and obtain the epidemic threshold concerning external factors. Combining extensive Monte Carlo simulations , we find that the disease can be controlled effectively when resources are allocated unbiased in terms of the geographical factor during a pandemic. Specifically, the spreading size is the lowest, and the epidemic threshold is the largest when resources are allocated unbiasedly between neighbor nodes and other nodes. In addition, when studying the effects of resource allocation on the epidemic threshold, we find the same results, i.e., information-aware resource allocation with unbiased in terms of the geographical factor will raise the epidemic threshold. At last, we study the effects of mobility rate on the dynamical property and find an appropriate small value of mobility rate that is propitious to control the disease through numerical analysis and simulations. Our findings will have a direct application in the development of strategies to suppress the spread of the disease and guide the behavior of individuals during a pandemic.},

Using an Almansi type decomposition of holomorphic functions and reproducing properties of the zonal monogenics, we obtain an inversion formula for both the Hua-Radon and the polarized Hua-Radon transform.},

  abstract     = {In complex network research, the infectious disease model is often used to study transmission mechanisms and interference factors of information; consequently, they are essential for the prediction and control of information transmission. The conventional SIRS epidemic model has a wide range of applications and is theoretically mature. However, it does not stratify the nodes in a network, and fails to reflect the characteristics of different nodes. To solve this problem, we propose a layered SIRS information transmission model (L-SIRS) . Depending on the node influence, we assign the nodes in the network to high- and low-influence layers and establish an intra- and inter-layer information transmission mechanism. The transmission threshold and equilibrium point of this model are analyzed theoretically. To reduce the transmission of online public opinions, two kinds of information transmission interference strategies, namely, information blocking and information dredging, are designed to study their influence on information transmission. Finally, combine with practice, the simulation results indicate that the L-SIRS model can more accurately describe network information transmission and both information blocking and information dredging can effectively inhibit the spread of information.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an improved Bayesian collocation method (IBCM) for steady-state response analysis of structural dynamic systems with large interval uncertainties. The main task of interval analysis is to search the extrema of steady-state response within the parametric intervals, so that the response bounds can be obtained. However, interval analysis problems with large parametric uncertainties are usually highly nonlinear. Thus, to improve efficiency and accuracy for nonlinear interval analysis, the IBCM executes a bi-directional global optimization process by using a sequential Gaussian process surrogate model. In this method, IBCM constructs crude surrogate models based on Gaussian process. Then a bi-directional sampling strategy is proposed to guide to search the extrema within the parametric interval. Meanwhile, the surrogate model will also be refined. A decayed weight function is presented to balance exploration and exploitation in highly nonlinear cases. The above process repeats until it converges. The interval of steady-state response can be calculated with low computational cost according to the refined Gaussian process surrogate model. The feasibility and validity of the IBCM are demonstrated by numerical examples and engineering applications.},

According to the problem’s formulation, the Lagrange function will be applied to deal with the linear equality constraints. At the same time, the barrier function will be applied to make the solution arrive at the near-global or global optimal solution. For each of the two neural network models, an iterative procedure to optimize the proposed neural network will be developed and the descent direction is obtained. Then two Lyapunov functions corresponding to the two neural network models are proposed. On the basis of the Lyapunov functions, this deterministic annealing neural network method are shown to converge to the stable equilibrium state and be completely stable. Finally, preliminary numerical results on a number of test problems show that the developed method is promising and could be expanded to other similar issues in the real world.},

Among various methods, similarity-based algorithms are popular for their simplicity, interpretability , high efficiency and good performance. In this paper, we show that the most elementary local similarity index Common Neighbor (CN) can be linearly decomposed by eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of the target network, with each eigenvector’s contribution being proportional to the square of the corresponding eigenvalue. As in many real networks, there is a huge gap between the largest eigenvalue and the second largest eigenvalue, the CN index is thus dominated by the leading eigenvector and much useful information contained in other eigenvectors may be overlooked. Accordingly, we propose a parameter-free algorithm that ensures the contributions of the leading eigenvector and the secondary eigenvector the same. Extensive experiments on real networks demonstrate that the prediction performance of the proposed algorithm is remarkably better than well-performed local similarity indices in the literature. A further proposed algorithm that can adjust the contribution of leading eigenvector shows the superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms with tunable parameters for its competitive accuracy and lower computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Lung sounds convey valuable information relevant to human respiratory health. Therefore, it is important to classify lung sounds for early diagnoses of respiratory disorders. In recent years, computerized lung sound analysis with machine learning algorithms has attracted researchers, especially the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN). However, most of these algorithms require a large number of labeled respiratory sound samples, which is time- and cost-consuming. Based on a four-layers CNN, this study proposes graph semi-supervised CNNs (GS-CNNs), which can classify respiratory sounds into normal, crackle and wheeze ones with only a small labeled sample size and a large unlabeled sample size. The graph of respiratory sounds (Graph-RS) with labeled and unlabeled respiratory sound samples as vertexes is first constructed, which can indicate not only the reasonable metric information but also the relationship of all the samples. Then, GS-CNNs are developed by adding the information extracted from Graph-RS to the loss function of the original CNN. The added information enables the GS-CNNs to regulate the structure of the original CNN, thus enhancing classification accuracy. The GS-CNNs are evaluated by experiments with the samples collected by electronic stethoscope. Results demonstrate that the proposed GS-CNNs outperform the original CNN, and that the more information from Graph-RS is used, the better recognition effect will be achieved.},

  abstract     = {The fields of material manufacture, graphic designing, information science, aerodynamics, plastic industry and biotechnology have been found to have a greater reliance on the phenomenon of fluid flow over three-dimensional realms. Consequently, this article has been focused to the study of Williamson nanofluid containing microorganisms over three-dimensional surface under the influence of magnetic field through bidirectional non-linearly stretched surface. To transform the set of nonlinear partial differential equations into ordinary differentials equations by using appropriate similarity transformation. These obtained fundamental ordinary differential equations are solved numerically by exploiting bvp4c process built-in MATLAB mathematical software. The presentation of the results has been made in form of graphs and tables to warrant the comparison between different scenarios. More specifically the parameters like temperature profile, velocity profile, motility of organisms, concentration profiles, Peclet numbers, Lewis number, Williamson parameters, material parameter, Brownian motion parameters, Rayleigh numbers and Prandtl number were presented as the graphical outcomes. The numerical data suggested that greater values of Schmidt number, thermophoresis parameters and Brownian motion reduce the coefficient of wall heat transfer. The study has its applications in transportation hypothesis that is utilized in many automotive and industrial processes. The field of industrial manufacturing has also many applications that consider flow over a bidirectional stretched surface. The current approach explores the cumulative effect of different physical features on the flow of Williamson fluid, and there is no such effort in the reviewed studies.},

  abstract     = {The combination of fluids and tensors has been explored in recent works to constrain the fluid flow along specific directions for simulation applications. Such an approach points towards the necessity to model flows using anisotropic fluid dynamics. The formalism behind anisotropic Helmholtz decomposition plays a central role given the foundations to model directional constraints. In this paper, we apply the anisotropic Helmholtz theory to obtain a divergent free velocity field that respects the constraints of a symmetric positive tensor field. A major contribution is a well-defined anisotropic projection method suitable for anisotropic transport. An anisotropic projection is paramount for stable incompressible advection in anisotropic medium. Aiming to show how to benefit from the anisotropic projection, we customize the Navier-Stokes equations to use tensor information for locally modifying fluid momentum and material advection. Besides, we develop a stable numerical method to integrate the obtained system of partial differential equations and a methodology to optimize the tensor field to reduce numerical errors. Experiments show that tensor fields with different anisotropic features can provide distinct projected divergence-free vector fields. Our results also show that the proposed method forms a basis for fluid flow simulation following meaningful paths induced by the tensor field geometry and topology.},

  abstract     = {A theoretical analysis of quasi-one-dimensional, steady, inviscid, compressible channel flow at a low magnetic Reynolds number with variable cross-section is performed in this paper. A second-order nonlinear dynamical system describing the variation of physical parameters is investigated in the phase plane. The characteristics of all possible channel flow with a constant electromagnetic field are obtained by the phase plane and the isomorphism of labeled graphs. It is revealed that the magnetic interaction number novelly derived from the variation rate of the cross-sectional area could significantly affect the phase trajectory in the phase plane of dimensionless velocity and Mach number. Meanwhile, the phase trajectory is only dependent on this magnetic interaction number. Further analysis of the second-order dynamical system discovers five critical values in the range of the magnetic interaction number. These five critical values can divide the whole range into eight subsets under the isomorphism of labeled graphs, forming eight equivalence classes of the phase plane. The study of such eight equivalence classes reveals that the variable cross-section flow in the phase plane can be viewed as a linear superposition of constant cross-section magnetohydrodynamic flow and isentropic flow, the weight ratio being exactly the magnetic interaction number. Consequently, for the divergent channel, the acceleration region in the supersonic zone is larger than that of the constant cross-section flow, while for the convergent channel, only the acceleration region in the subsonic zone is larger than that of the constant cross-section flow.},

  abstract     = {Ecological communities may present complex interactions, such that the standard Lotka-Volterra mathematical model may not describe the system adequately. Here, we address the question of how to detect automatically the presence of a particular set of ecological nonlinear interactions known as higher-order interactions (HOI). Our proposal is based on estimating standard Lotka-Volterra model parameters by fitting experimental data, and then on generating synthetic HOI samples by stochastic differential equations. These samples are then regarded as input of machine learning classifiers to train the models and predict if the experimental time series present HOI or not. We present a case study using experimental data for single-, pairwise- and three-species of Drosophila . We compare the classical statistical tests from literature against our proposed machine learning approach. For the testing sets, the classical statistical tests (additive test and multiplicative test) showed a lack of robustness, with best results of 0.75 accuracy, 0.50 sensitivity and 1.0 specificity. In contrast, our proposed machine learning HOI recognition approach showed robustness across the testing sets, achieving mean results of 0.93 accuracy, 0.88 sensitivity and 0.99 specificity. The advantage of our machine learning HOI recognition is that we are able to train the classifiers with noisy data that resembles experimental data, producing a more robust automatic tool for HOI detection than classical statistical tests.},

  abstract     = {The lattice-Boltzmann method, in its classical form, is a hyperbolic-leaning equation system which requires long term time-marching solutions to attain quasi-steady state, and much research has been done to improve the convergence performance of the algorithm. Nevertheless, previous approaches have seen limited use in the literature, either due to high complexity, a lack of integrability, and/or instability considerations. In this study, we propose a new acceleration scheme that utilizes information carried by pressure waves propagating in the simulated domain to achieve accelerated convergence to steady and quasi-steady state solutions. The formulated algorithm achieves accurate final flow fields and is in excellent agreement for tested benchmark problems. We show that this scheme is highly robust for a wide range of relaxation parameters in the single-relaxation time and the multiple-relaxation time formulations of the LBM, and effectively apply the algorithm to both obstacle-driven and shear-driven flows, with an observed time reduction to steady state behavior of more than half. Furthermore, the method is successfully tested on a complex, unsteady flow employing the KBC entropic multirelaxation operator – this exhibited a significant reduction of the flow transient stage of up to 63.8%, and proves the scheme to work with the full triad of major LB collision operators. In terms of numerical implementation, the relative cleanness and ‘bolt-on’ nature of the proposed algorithm allows for ease of application and increased universality, making it ideal for a previously unfilled role in current LBM development.},

However, how emotion affects the evolution of cooperation in structured population is largely unknown. Here we introduce emotion into network reciprocity, where emotion is considered quantifiable and cumulative, and then divide individuals into two types, namely non-competitive individuals whose social value orientation is mutually beneficial and competitive individuals whose social value orientation is maximizing outcomes for the self. Here, we explore the effects of the proportion of non-competitive individuals and emotional cumulative length on the evolution of cooperation. Simulation results show that the existence of non-competitive individuals promotes cooperation in the system. Furthermore, we also find that emotional cumulative length plays a key role in promoting overall cooperation, but surprisingly, the cooperation rate of competitive individuals peaks at an intermediate value of emotional cumulative length.},

The head-on and overtaking interactions of two/three solitons are analyzed. The elastic and inelastic interactions of two/three solitons are presented. The soliton velocity can be controlled by adjusting the physical parameters ϕ j , ( j = 1 , 2 , … N ) ϕj,(j=1,2,…N) and ϵ ϵ . The energy exchange occurs between the variables u u and v v before and after the collision. The local interference of two/three solitons is observed.

The real and imaginary parts of the parameters ϕ j , ( j = 1 , 2 , … N ) ϕj,(j=1,2,…N) have the effects on the numbers of peaks and holes in the collisions. The structure of four eyes and one peak is observed during the two-soliton interaction. The three-soliton interactions are given with two peaks and local interference.

Combining with the Lyapunov stability theory and inequality estimation techniques, some rigorous analyses on the exponential stability of the resulting closed-loop system are carried out. Then, an explicit expression for controller gain is developed based on the feasibility of certain specified LMIs.

The transition rates of the mode jumps are considered to be generally hybrid, which relax the traditional assumption in Markov jump systems that estimate errors must be completely symmetric. The introduced generally hybrid transition rates (GHTRs) make these systems more general and realistic. In order to deal with the GHTRs, a new approach named double-boundary approach is proposed. Then, a new integral inequality named Wirtinger-type free-matrix-based integral inequality (WFMII) is proposed to estimate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), in which some delay-product-type matrices are produced to fully link the relationship among time-varying delay and system states. Based on these ingredients, an explicit expression of the desired filter can be given to ensure the filtering error system to be stochastically admissible and strictly dissipative. The further examination to demonstrate the feasibility of the presented method is given by designing a filter of a two-loop circuit network.},

  abstract     = {The structural stability of the Boussinesq fluid interfacing with a Darcy fluid in a bounded region in R 2 R2 was studied. We assumed that the viscous fluid was governed by the Boussinesq equations in Ω 1 Ω1 , while in Ω 2 Ω2 , we supposed that the flow satisfies the Darcy equations. Some interfacing boundary conditions are imposed. The traditional Poin car e ´ Poincare´ inequalities can’t be used. With the aid of some useful a priori bounds and some new Poin car e ´ Poincare´ inequalities, we were able to demonstrate the continuous dependence result on the interface coefficient α α . The result showed that the structural stability is valid for the interfacing problem.},

  abstract     = {Recently, there appeared a considerable interest in inverse Sturm–Liouville-type problems with constant delay. However, necessary and sufficient conditions for solvability of such problems were obtained only in one very particular situation. Here we address this gap by obtaining necessary and sufficient conditions in the case of functional-differential pencils possessing a more general form along with a nonlinear dependence on the spectral parameter. For this purpose, we develop the so-called transformation operator approach, which allows reducing the inverse problem to a nonlinear vectorial integral equation. In Appendix A , we obtain as a corollary the analogous result for Sturm–Liouville operators with delay. Remarkably, the present paper is the first work dealing with an inverse problem for functional-differential pencils in any form. Besides generality of the pencils under consideration, an important advantage of studying the inverse problem for them is the possibility of recovering both delayed terms, which is impossible for the Sturm–Liouville operators with two delays. The latter, in turn, is illustrated even for different values of these two delays by a counterexample in Appendix B . We also provide a brief survey on the contemporary state of the inverse spectral theory for operators with delay observing recently answered long-term open questions.},

The goal of this study is to design a controller which exponentially stabilizes the system with a larger maximum sampling interval. To achieve this, we utilize the information of the parameters in the controller part. The proposed controller is dependent on the polynomials with respect to the sampled parameters, which is more effective to stabilize the system with a larger maximum sampling interval. To design the controller, an exponential stabilization condition is derived from a new Polynomially Parameter Dependent Quadratic Lyapunov Function with Looped-Functionals (PPDQLLF) which is dependent on the parameters of a plant. The derived condition is represented in terms of the linear matrix inequality (LMI) and it is formulated as sum of squares (SOS) conditions to obtain feasible solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by the simulation results of numerical examples .},

The intersection graph of such disks is the undirected graph with vertices the n n disks and two disks are adjacent if and only if they have a point in common. Such a graph was introduced by Huemer and Pérez-Lantero (Discrete Mathematics, 2020), proved to be planar and Hamiltonian. In this paper, we study further combinatorial properties of this graph. We prove that the treewidth is at most 3, by showing an O ( n ) O(n) -time algorithm that builds a tree decomposition of width at most 3, given the polygon as input. This implies that we can construct the intersection graph of the side disks in O ( n ) O(n) time. We further study the independence number, which is the maximum number of pairwise disjoint disks. The planarity condition implies that for every convex n n -gon we can select at least ⌈ n / 4 ⌉ ⌈n/4⌉ pairwise disjoint disks, and we prove that for every n ≥ 3 n≥3 there exist convex n n -gons in which we cannot select more than this number. Finally, we show that our class of graphs includes all outerplanar Hamiltonian graphs except the cycle of length four, and that it is a proper subclass of the planar Hamiltonian graphs.},

The existence of a unique numerical solution, its uniform stability with respect to the Mach number, and the accuracy at low Mach numbers are established for both time semi-discrete and space-time fully-discrete schemes. The AP property of the scheme is proved for a general class of IMEX schemes which need not be globally stiffly accurate.

We develop a mathematical framework to estimate errors of the linear approximation for globally and locally coupled networks. We mathematically prove that the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the network’s Laplacian matrix is enough for examining synchrony alignment and that the functionality of this vector depends on the corresponding eigenvalue. Moreover, we prove that if a globally coupled network with frustration has perfect phase synchronization when its coupling strength tends to infinity, it is a regular network. Finally, the effect of correlation between frustration values and degrees (or frequencies) on the synchronizability of the network is investigated.},

In fact, different individuals in a network usually hold different standards for information adoption. Considering the heterogeneity of adoption thresholds, this study constructs a two-layer network model with limited contacts. The adoption threshold of a node is related to its degree and a parameter obeying truncated normal distribution . This study also proposes a partition theory based on edges to analyze the mechanism of information dissemination quantitatively. Experiments find that increasing the mean of parameters can inhibit information from spreading, and the effect of the standard deviation of parameters on information dissemination depends on the mean of parameters. For instance, when the mean of parameters is a low value, as the standard deviation of parameters increases, the information outbreak size will decrease. On the other hand, the information outbreak size will increase continuously with increased propagation probability. If the mean of parameters is high, the information outbreak size will increase first and then decrease with the increment in the standard deviation of parameters. The theoretical predictions of this study are in good agreement with the numerical simulations.},

Two kinds of problems are considered: (1) the system tracks a fixed reference output signal (ROS); (2) the system tracks a time variant reference output trajectory (TVROT). For the first problem, we design an effective event-triggered controller to realize output tracking in probability one. An algorithm is offered to find the control invariant subset (CIS) of a set, and a triggering set sequence is constructed based on the CIS. Next, a necessary and sufficient condition is proposed to judge whether the system is trackable in probability one. For the second problem, a criterion is given to judge whether the initial state can generate TVROT with probability one and an algorithm is then provided to solve the corresponding control sequence. Furthermore, a profit function is established to solve the maximum tracking probability for the initial state which can not generate TVROT with probability one. Lastly, two examples are offered to explain the theoretical results.},

A semi-Markov jump model is used to describe the stochastic jump parameters in networks. Different from the invariable transition probabilities in the traditional Markov jump systems, the transition probabilities of the semi-Markov jump systems rely on the stochastic sojourn-time. Accordingly, the Weibull distribution taking the place of the exponential distribution in this paper is adopted for the sojourn-time of each mode in the system. Firstly, by utilizing an applicable vector substitution, the second-order differential system could be converted into the first-order one. Afterwards, via constructing a seemly Lyapunov function of the semi-Markov inertial neural networks and adequately taking advantage of the peculiarities of cumulative distribution functions, some sufficient conditions with less conservatism are constructed to assure that the estimation error system is strictly ( R 1 , R 2 , R 3 ) − ϱ − (R1,R2,R3)−ϱ− dissipative stochastically stable. Based on these conditions, mode-dependent estimator gains are designed. Finally, a numerical example is proposed to validate the availability of the provided approach.},

The burning number b ( G ) b(G) of a graph G G is the minimum number of steps in a graph burning process for that graph. In this paper, we introduced a new graph parameter, the generalized burning number of a graph b r ( G ) br(G) , which is generalization of b ( G ) b(G) with b 1 ( G ) = b ( G ) b1(G)=b(G) . And then determined the generalized burning number of several graphs and operation graphs. The general bounds on this parameter are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {The Cahn-Hilliard phase-field model of two-phase incompressible flows , namely the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CH-NS) problem represents the fundamental building blocks of hydrodynamic phase-field models for multiphase fluid flow dynamics. Since finding solution (numerically and theoretically) of the CH-NS system is non-trivial (owing to the coupling between the Navier-Stokes equation and the Cahn-Hilliard equation), in this paper, we propose and analyze a numerical scheme with the following properties: (1) first-order in time, (2) nonlinear, (3) fully coupled and (4) energy stable; for solving CH-NS system, in the framework of weak Galerkin (WG) method. More precisely, we employ the WG method, which uses discontinuous functions to construct the approximation space, and the first-order backward Euler (implicit) method for space and time discretizations , respectively. We first recall the corresponding variational formulation , and then summarize the main WG method ingredients that are required for our discrete analysis. In particular, in order to define the weak discrete bilinear (and trilinear) form, whose continuous version involves classical differential operators , we propose two well-known alternatives for gradient and divergence operators onto a suitable polynomial subspace. Next, we show that the weak global discrete bilinear form satisfies the hypotheses required by the Lax-Milgram lemma. In this way, we derive the associated a priori error estimates for phase field variable , chemical potential , velocity and further the pressure in L 2 L2 norm. Finally, several numerical results confirming the theoretical rates of convergence and illustrating the good performance of the method for simulation influence of surface tension, small density variations, and the driven cavity are presented.},

A robust model is developed for non-Newtonian flow and hydrodynamic dispersion with the first-order chemical reaction on the arterial boundary in multiple irregular stenosed arterial geometries. Multiple scale solutions of the non dimensional boundary value problem are presented. Asymptotic expressions are developed for velocity and shear stress. Extensive visualization of velocity, concentration, and other flow characteristics is included for various stenotic scenarios, Péclet numbers, and Damköhler numbers. Significant modification in hemodynamic characteristics is computed with viscoplasticity. Mean concentration is also dramatically modified with yield stress and Péclet and Damköhler numbers.

  abstract     = {This study formulated an autonomous non-linear epidemic model for the numerical solutions of the transmission dynamics of acute and chronic hepatitis B with a saturated incidence rate, which prevailed due to the hepatitis B virus. In this article, a model of HBV is extended by introducing a non-linear saturated incidence rate. That non-linear saturated incidence rate helps to reduce the infected population by improving the immunity of the human body. The continuous Galerkin-Petrove (2) technique a numerical method, is used for finding the solution of the mentioned model. For continuous Galerkin-Petrove (2) technique, we need two variables on every step that must be figured out by solving a square matrix. Different parameters on the population dynamics of susceptible, infected with acute and chronic hepatitis B virus and recovered individuals are analyzed. As it could be seen that the increase in the value of the saturation constant ( ξ 1 ξ1 ) and recovery rate from chronic stage to recovered ( ψ 2 ψ2 ) led to the decrease in the population infected with acute and chronic HBV so susceptible population has large concentration and less population is contaminated and the outcomes are illustrated graphically. The model is solved by utilizing a Runge Kutta method of order (4) scheme and results of both techniques are compared numerically and graphically. Although the numerical and graphical results of both methods (continuous Galerkin-Petrove (2) and Runge Kutta method of order (4)) are the same after comparison the continuous Galerkin-Petrove (2) is more efficient and less time consuming as compared to Runge Kutta method of order (4).},

Parametric expression, unit normal vector field, shape operator, Gaussian and mean curvatures of the screw surface M ψ Mψ are investigated by using differential geometric techniques. As a result, by applying rigid motion to the points of the surface M M changes in differential geometric properties of M M are investigated.

  abstract     = {Monotone matrices play a key role in the convergence theory of regular splittings and different types of weak regular splittings. If monotonicity fails, then it is difficult to guarantee the convergence of the above-mentioned classes of matrices. In such a case, K K -monotonicity is sufficient for the convergence of K K -regular and K K -weak regular splittings, where K K is a proper cone in R n Rn . However, the convergence theory of a two-stage iteration scheme in a general proper cone setting is a gap in the literature. Especially, the same study for weak regular splittings of type II (even if in standard proper cone setting, i.e., K = R + n K=R+n ), is open. To this end, we propose convergence theory of two-stage iterative scheme for K K -weak regular splittings of both types in the proper cone setting. We provide some sufficient conditions which guarantee that the induced splitting from a two-stage iterative scheme is a K K -regular splitting and then establish some comparison theorems. We also study K K -monotone convergence theory of the stationary two-stage iterative method in case of a K K -weak regular splitting of type II. The most interesting and important part of this work is on M M -matrices appearing in the Covid-19 pandemic model. Finally, numerical computations are performed using the proposed technique to compute the next generation matrix involved in the pandemic model. The computation of large PageRank matrices shows that the two-stage Gauss-Seidel method performs better than the Gauss-Seidel methods.},

Notably, the proportional integral observer incorporates both proportional and integral loop, where the presence of additional loop provides unbiased state estimation. Moreover, an improved equivalent input disturbance approach with a gain factor is considered to enhance better disturbance estimation and rejection performance. Naturally, Smith predictor is commenced to handle input time delays. Subsequently, the combination of improved equivalent input disturbance with Smith predictor guarantees the desired tracking performance with input time delays and external disturbances . By endowing Lyapunov stability theory , a set of sufficient conditions is developed in the frame of linear matrix inequalities to promise the asymptotically stability of the closed-loop system. Subsequently, the explicit form of the desired proportional integral gain matrices are parameterized using the matrix inequality techniques. The superiority of our proffered control technique are validated through two numerical examples, which includes a practical model namely RLC circuit .},

  abstract     = {This article concentrates on the extended dissipative filtering for slow sampling singularly perturbed systems based on the double-layer switching mechanism containing the Markov jump signal and the persistent dwell-time switching signal simultaneously. The Markov jumping signal, as the upper layer switching signal, is utilized to describe the jumping of system modes. Then, the persistent dwell-time switching signal is introduced as a lower layer switching signal to characterize the variation for transition probabilities of the Markov chain . Besides, the uncertainties of actual measurement output are assumed to randomly occur, which are described by a set of Bernoulli distributed white sequences. Furthermore, some sufficient conditions ensuring the filtering error system being mean-square exponentially stable with an extended dissipative performance are obtained through the Lyapunov stability theory and some advanced linear matrix transformation techniques. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Temperature can affect the action potential of a neuron such that the firing pattern is changed under its variation. To incorporate the effects of the temperature, recently, a thermosensitive neuron was proposed in which a thermistor was added to a simple FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model. Here, thermosensitive neurons are studied to realize the consequence of the thermistor on the neurons’ collective behavior. For specific coupling strengths, the chimera state is developed. The parameter region of the occurrence of the chimera state is obtained by computing the strength of incoherence and shows that the occurrence of the chimera is highly dependent on the coefficient of temperature change in the thermistor. Since, in reality, the neurons are not identical and also the thermistors are not precisely the same, the network is further considered with non-identical neurons. For this purpose, the coefficient of temperature changes in thermistors is not fixed and selected randomly from a normal distribution . The results show that for distributions with a small standard deviation, the behavior of the network changes slightly. While with increasing the standard deviation, the synchronization is achieved for higher coupling strengths, and the region of chimera is extended. Furthermore, although in the asynchronous network the neurons have different attractors, by the appearance of coherent groups and creation of the chimera, the attractors become identical.},

By applying a suitable variable substitution, new fractional order six-neuron BAM neural networks involving mult-delays are converted to a class of fractional order six-neuron BAM neural networks with single delay. Using the stability criterion and bifurcation theory of fractional order differential dynamical systems , we carry out a detailed discussion on the stability and the onset of Hopf bifurcation of the established BAM neural networks. The study shows that the time delay is an important factor which affects the stability behavior and Hopf bifurcation of the involved neural networks.

We derive analytical and numerical techniques based on the cosymmetry approach. Parameter relations are established for which the given model admits a continuous family of stationary distributions. This implies multistability, i.e. the existence of successful invasion scenarios with different final states. Then, we treat the general situation as a disturbance of this cosymmetric case and develop methods for forecasting. Numerical results of the one-dimensional spatial problem demonstrate the effectiveness of the chosen methodology. In particular, we show the possibility to predict, by accurate long-term calculations, final states in the case of slow evolution.

However, the discontinuity caused by the impulsive effect and the saturation nonlinearity caused by the actuator saturation have brought great challenge to the theoretical analysis of such problems. Firstly, this paper uses mathematical induction to estimate the admissible set of the system state at the impulse instant, which is used to ensure that the saturation nonlinear problem can be dealt with by the sector nonlinear model method and the polyhedral representation method. Secondly, by constructing a suitable time-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovsknii functional (LKF), using Jensen’s inequality, Wirtinger-based inequality and the sector nonlinearity model approach, a sufficient condition has been derived, which guarantee the exponential stability of the synchronization error system in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Thirdly, some synchronization criteria are obtained by using polytopic representation approach to deal with the saturation nonlinearity. Based on these criteria, the saturated impulsive and sampled-data controller is designed, and the region of attraction of the drive response error system is estimated. As a corollary, exponentially synchronization conditions and controller design are also presented for the nonlinear dynamical networks without actuator saturation. Finally, two numerical examples shows the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

Furthermore, both the follower agents’ and the leader agent’s dynamics are assumed to be completely unknown. As the consensus problem based on feedback control, the second-order discrete-time multi-agent systems (DT-MASs) model with directed topology is formulated to the optimal tracking control problem via online deep reinforcement learning method. Based on graph theory, matrix analysis, Lyapunov stability, deep learning and optimal control, the optimality of value function and the stability of the consensus error systems for the unknown second-order systems are guaranteed for each agent. The results show that the designed policy iteration algorithm not only stabilizes the distributed dynamic systems, but also makes all agents’ position and velocity states reach consensus, respectively.

  abstract     = {In this paper, an attractive idea using moving least squares (MLS) and spectral collocation method is extended to estimate the solution of nonlinear stochastic Volterra integro-differential equations (NSVIDEs) that arise in mathematical modeling of natural systems in financial mathematics, physics, and engineering. An essential advantage of the proposed technique is that it does not require any preprocessing, such as mesh refinement. Another advantage that may be appealing to the readers of this article is that acceptable results can be obtained using a small number of points and basis functions, so the calculations are reduced. Applying the proposed scheme leads to the conversion of the problem into a system of algebraic equations. An error bound is presented to ensure the convergence and reliability of the method. Some illustrative examples are presented to reveal the efficiency and applicability of this technique.},

  abstract     = {Collective cooperation is essential to human society, and it exists in many social dilemmas. In the scenario of a collective-risk social dilemma, a group of players have to collectively contribute to a public fund to prevent the tragedy of the commons, such as dangerous climate change , because everybody will lose all their remaining money when the damage happens with a certain probability if the group fails to reach a fixed fundraising target. Yet, it remains largely unclear how the group size affects the probability of reaching the collective target and the mechanism that drives different outcomes of the collective cooperation. Here, we contribute to the literature by exploring the role of group size in the collective-risk social dilemma and the potential underlying mechanism using both model simulations and human experiments. Through simulations we found that the rate of failure for collective cooperation increases for larger groups, along with the arising of bystander effect and a decrease in average contributions, which are confirmed by our experimental observations. We further analyze the patterns of investment behaviors in the experiment setting by categorizing players into cooperators, altruists, and free riders using both a clustering method and a golden standard. We found that altruists who tend to contribute more, rather than cooperators who prefer contributing a fair-share investment, play a crucial role in groups with success outcome in early and/or middle stages of the game. Our results indicate that bystanders are dynamic and their amount depends on the contribution of others. When others contribute less, bystanders also contribute less. If the collective goal is unlikely to achieve, more players choose to be bystanders who strategically contribute less, intriguing the failure of the collective goal. Our findings suggest a potentially effective way to solve the collective-risk social dilemma by reducing the bystander effect through the mechanism design of forming small groups.},

This paper focuses on the computation of that derivative, which we call the density gradient function, on general smooth manifolds. We analytically derive formulas for the density gradient and present examples of manifolds determined by popular differential equation-driven systems.

Conventional division methods that use a fixed period (e.g., month) can result in confusion during statistical analysis. In this study, we propose a novel analysis technique based on time series complex network theories to divide the historical information of urban air quality by using flexible periods. First, air quality information is converted into time series complex networks via a multilayer visibility model. Thereafter, an improved community detection algorithm is proposed on the basis of network characteristics. In particular, the centrality of nodes is increased using a kernel density estimation model. An improved bidirectional search pattern results in the optimal modularity. Finally, the historical curves of urban air quality are divided into several stages in accordance with the optimal clustering results. The simulation experiments demonstrate important conclusions. The clustering accuracy of the proposed algorithm is superior to those of other evaluated methods on actual air quality networks. The number of historical stages is decreased constantly in accordance with clustering results, and this condition is beneficial for statistics. Our results can reasonably explain the relationship between valid time and air quality features. The proposed technique can provide effective and reliable division results of historical stages.},

Existing exact algorithms for updating the solution of dynamic graph regression require at least a linear time (in terms of n n : the size of the graph). However, this time complexity might be intractable in practice. In the current paper, we utilize subsampled randomized Hadamard transform and CountSketch to propose the first sublinear update time randomized algorithms for regression of general dynamic graphs. Suppose that we are given a n × d n×d matrix embedding M M of the graph, where d ≪ n d≪n and M M has certain properties.

Our first algorithm supports edge insertion and edge deletion and updates the approximate solution in O ( r d ) O(rd) time. Our second algorithm is based on CountSketch and supports edge insertion, edge deletion, node insertion and node deletion. It updates the approximate solution in O ( q d ) O(qd) time, where q = O ( d 2 ϵ 2 log 6 ( d / ϵ ) ) q=O(d2ϵ2log6(d/ϵ)) .},

Nevertheless, up to now, how to understand the effect of these multifarious population on the dynamics of cooperation still needs further exploration. Herein, we put forward a novel co-evolutionary game model to study the evolutionary cooperation dynamics based on reputation in a mixed population with two interactive species of strategists (i.e., node-type strategists and link-type strategists). We utilize a compound Fermi function to characterize the possibility for a focal player to imitate the strategy of chosen neighbor, in which the parameter μ μ is introduced to represent how much a strategist depends on reputation during the process of strategy imitation. Through large quantities of numerical simulations, the results indicate that even if the living environment of strategists in the spatial structure deteriorates gradually, the reputation-driven imitation rule can alleviate this bad situation and restore the prosperity of collective cooperation. In addition, the micro-exploration of the spatial cooperative cluster shows that the link-type strategists can adopt different strategies when confronting different partners, which plays an important role in facilitating the evolution of cooperation. On the one hand, they cooperate with the players holding the cooperation strategy; on the other hand, they punish the defective partners, which not only protects the cooperative cluster but also prevents the further expansion of the defective cluster. The current research greatly enriches the understanding of the widespread cooperation exhibited within many real-world systems.},

  abstract     = {Brain complexity and neural oscillations are of vital significance for understanding brain dynamics. Although widely used in the quantification of complex behavior of the brain, standard complexity measures are hampered by some theoretical and implementation issues which limit their applicability to the study of nonlinear brain signals. Further, they have been used for spatial analysis but are insensitive to the temporal structure of data and not applicable to short EEG segments. We demonstrated the ability of a change-based complexity measure (Aksentijevic-Gibson complexity) to analyze neural activity in both spatial and temporal domains. We examined EEG recordings from a group of adolescents with schizophrenia and an age-matched group of healthy controls. AG revealed that the spatial complexity was significantly lower in the patient group across all electrodes with the lowest complexity at the frontal area of the brain. By focusing on outer frontal regions and temporal data averaged over schizophrenia adolescents, we observed periodic drops in complexity and low-delta oscillations at the left electrode F7 and numerous irregularly placed drops at the right side (F8). Periodicity was caused by zero complexity troughs in several individuals associated with large voltage declensions and connected with hypofrontality supporting left frontal pathology. Both averaged spatial and temporal complexities of healthy and schizophrenia adolescents were significantly different from the complexities of random sequences confirming that neural activity is more regular than a true random process. As a final step, we performed the analysis of short EEG segments for the two subjects (one control, one patient) in order to search for differences in neural oscillations. The examination revealed a clear 33 Hz gamma rhythm in a healthy participant and only a fast beta rhythm of 27 Hz in a patient as well as the presence of a full range of rhythms in a healthy EEG and only theta oscillations in that of a patient. The results support the large body of work which associates schizophrenia with lowered complexity, low-frequency rhythms and the scarcity of high-frequency oscillations.},

A new merit function is constructed to establish the convergence of the whole sequence generated by the parameterized Douglas–Rachford splitting method. As a by-product, this also provides convergence results of a special case of the adaptive Douglas–Rachford algorithm proposed by Dao and Phan (2019)[22] in nonconvex settings. We then apply the parameterized Douglas–Rachford splitting method to three important classes of nonconvex optimization problems arising in data science: sparsity constrained least squares problem, feasibility problem and low rank matrix completion. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the parameterized Douglas–Rachford splitting method compared with some other classical methods.},

The cross diffusion term is proposed for the first time in literature and through our analysis we have confirmed that coexistence of the participating species is possible under its influence. We study the model using coupled upper and lower solutions for an elliptic partial differential equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We derive sufficient conditions for the coexistence of the susceptible and infected populations. Mathematical analysis is performed to prove that at least one coexistence state will exist for the proposed model system. We further proved that the system exhibits Turing instability in the presence of the proposed cross diffusion and carried out numerical simulation to observe the patterning behavior. This work provides a significant insight on how epidemic models can be influenced by cross diffusion effects.},

Because of memory-efficient approximations, invariant subspaces for a possibly low-dimensional solution representation are identified. A Galerkin projection onto a trial space related to a low-rank approximation of the solution of the algebraic Riccati equation is proposed. The modified Davison-Maki method is used for time discretization . Known stability issues of the Davison-Maki method are discussed.

First, we prove that the stochastic model possesses a unique global positive solution . Second, by means of the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 of the corresponding deterministic model , two relevant critical values which include R ¯ 0 R¯0 and R 0 C R0C are derived. Next, we obtain the disease extinction under R 0 &lt; 1 R0&amp;lt;1 and R ¯ 0 1 R0C&amp;gt;1 for the existence and uniqueness of an ergodic stationary distribution of the stochastic model, which means the infectious disease will be prevailing and persistent in a community.

  abstract     = {Acoustic waves in a slightly compressible fluid saturating porous periodic structure are studied using two complementary approaches: 1) the periodic homogenization (PH) method provides effective model equations for a general dynamic problem imposed in a bounded medium, 2) harmonic acoustic waves are studied in an infinite medium using the Floquet-Bloch (FB) wave decomposition. In contrast with usual simplifications, the advection phenomenon of the Navier–Stokes equations is accounted for. For this, an acoustic approximation is applied to linearize the advection term. The homogenization results are based the periodic unfolding method combined with the asymptotic expansion technique providing a straight upscaling procedure which leads to the macroscopic model defined in terms of the effective model parameters. These are computed using the characteristic responses of the porous microstructure. Using the FB theory, we derive dispersion equations for the scaffolds saturated by the inviscid, or the viscous, barotropic fluids, whereby the advection due to a permanent flow in the porous structures is respected. A computational study is performed for the numerical models obtained using the finite element discretization. For the FB methods-based dispersion analysis, quadratic eigenvalue problems must be solved. The numerical examples show influences of the microstructure size and of the advection generating an anisotropy of the acoustic waves dispersion .},

Especially, we use a generalized iterated shrinkage operator to deal with the ℓ p ℓp quasi-norm subproblem , which is easy to implement.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a weak Galerkin finite element method for 2D Keller-Segel chemotaxis models and closely related haptotaxis models to simulate tumor invasion into surrounding healthy tissue. The chemotaxis and haptotaxis models consist of a system of time-dependent nonlinear reaction-diffusion-taxis partial differential equations . It is well known that solutions of chemotaxis systems may blow-up in finite time in the cell density. This blow-up is a mathematical description of a cell concentration phenomenon, which mathematically results in rapidly growing solutions in small neighborhoods of concentration points or curves. Capturing such singular solutions numerically is a challenging problem. We applied the weak Galerkin finite element method (WGFEM) to approximate the spatial variables. Weak Galerkin finite element method can be considered as an extension of the standard finite element method where classical derivatives are replaced in the variational equation by the weakly defined derivatives on discontinuous weak functions. The weak derivatives of weak functions are approximated by polynomials with various degrees of freedom. The accuracy and the computational complexity of the WGFEM is impacted by the selection of such polynomials. We show that the proposed method produced numerical results that are nonnegative, oscillation-free and suitable for solving models that have a blow-up of the cell density. Error bounds for cell density and chemoattractant equation are obtained. The proposed method is applied to several Keller-Segel chemotaxis models and extended to the haptotaxis model for simulating the behavior of cancer cell invasion of surrounding healthy tissue. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the attitude control problem of flexible satellite system under time-varying disturbance, actuator fault and input time-delay. Initially, in order to compensate for the negative effects of the disturbance and fault, two observer designs are proposed to obtain their estimations, respectively. Secondly, by combining anti-disturbance control, fault tolerant control and time-delay control approaches, a composite delay-dependent controller is presented and an augmented closed-loop system is derived. Then, based on Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, two sufficient conditions on ensuring the asymptotical stability and H ∞ H∞ performance index are established, in which the observer gains and controller one can be computed by resorting to the Matlab LMI Toolbox. Finally, some simulations and comparisons are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control methods.},

Three recent adaptations of an alternating direction implicit scheme are employed for time-stepping. Spatial and temporal errors corresponding to our chosen FD and time-stepping schemes are numerically studied. For parallel computation of solutions we have applied the well-know parallel cyclic reduction (PCR) algorithm for tridiagonal systems and our novel PCR algorithm for pentadiagonal systems. Ample numerical experiments are performed to study speed and accuracy on three platforms: single GPU using CUDA, multi-core CPU using OpenMP and an efficient sequential algorithm on a single core using MATLAB, where substantial speed-up is observed on the GPU. Sensitivities of computational times of the sequential algorithm in MATLAB with respect to certain parameters in the Bates model are also analysed.},

  abstract     = {A mathematical model is proposed to capture the implication of quiescent and activated CD4 + + T cells as well as the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response on HIV-1 infection in an early stage. It underlies the different mechanisms behind the productive and latent infection, whereby virion-cell contact, cell-cell contact, immune response, slow-kinetic viral reverse transcription in quiescent cells, lytic death, pyroptosis, and virus survival play their significant role within. The existence, uniqueness, and global stability of both the virus-free and endemic equilibrium with respect to the magnitudes of the basic reproduction ratio are studied. Due to technical difficulties in revealing the close form of the endemic equilibrium, determining the whole picture of forward bifurcation around the virus-free states is accomplished with the aid of bifurcation theory. The sufficient condition for the forward bifurcation is satisfied by the choices of the parameter values, and simulations are presented to illustrate the analytical findings. In an effort to study which parameters can be attacked through the applications of RTIs, PIs, and vaccination toward foremost reduction of the basic reproduction ratio, a local sensitivity analysis is presented. Finally, a model version combining productive and latent infection, also treating disparate time scales from CD4 + + T cells and CTLs as well as virions is studied. As long as any solution trajectory is initiated around the stable part of the critical manifold, it approaches and stays around the manifold and eventually lands in the manifold when the lifespans of CTLs and virions are comparably small. If the corresponding basic reproduction ratio is sufficiently large, then not only does the endemic equilibrium locate in the unstable part of the critical manifold, but all the solution trajectories (from the stable part) converge to the equilibrium due to global stability, indicating the existence of canards.},

The method essentially relies on a posteriori error indicators consisting of the Tikhonov regularized solutions obtained by the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) and the given data for the problem in hand. For a desired accuracy, the a posteriori error estimator chooses the best possible combination of a complete set of fundamental solutions determined by the location of the sources that are arranged in a particular manner on a pseudo-boundary at each iteration. Also, since we are interested in a stable solution, an adaptive stochastic optimization strategy based on an error-balancing criterion is used, so as to avoid unstable regions where the stability contributions may be relatively large. These ideas are applied to two benchmark problems and are found to produce efficient and accurate results.},

This formalism was established for Riemann–Liouville and Caputo fractional calculi in the 1990s, and more recently for other types of fractional calculus. In the general setting of fractional calculus with respect to functions, the authors recently extended Mikusiński’s operational calculus to Riemann–Liouville type derivatives, but the case of Caputo type derivatives with respect to functions remains open. Here, we establish all the function spaces, formalisms, and identities required to build a version of Mikusiński’s operational calculus which covers Caputo derivatives with respect to functions. In the process, we gain a deeper understanding of some of the structures involved in applying Mikusiński’s operational calculus to fractional calculus, such as the existence of a group isomorphic to R R . The mathematical structure established here is used to solve fractional differential equations using Caputo derivatives with respect to functions, the solutions being written using multivariate Mittag-Leffler functions, in agreement with the results found in other recent work.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a neural network-based method for CVA computations of a portfolio of derivatives. In particular, we focus on portfolios consisting of a combination of derivatives, with and without true optionality, e.g., a portfolio of a mix of European- and Bermudan-type derivatives. CVA is computed, with and without netting, for different levels of WWR and for different levels of credit quality of the counterparty. We show that the CVA is overestimated with up to 25% by using the standard procedure of not adjusting the exercise strategy for the default-risk of the counterparty. For the Expected Shortfall of the CVA dynamics, the overestimation was found to be more than 100% in some non-extreme cases.},

  abstract     = {The present mathematical study analyzes the reflection and transmission phenomenon of a plane wave being incident at the distinct types of separating interfaces in a rotating pre-stressed structure with two semi-infinite media comprised of functionally graded piezoelectric-orthotropic (FGPO) materials. The effects of pre-stresses, rotation, and functional gradients along with six different types of boundaries viz. Normal stiffness boundary (NSB), Transverse stiffness boundary (TSB), Electric imperfection boundary (EIB), Complete debonded boundary (CDB), Slip boundary (SB), and Welded contact boundary (WCB) on reflection coefficients (RCs) of reflected qP, qSV, and EA waves and transmission coefficients (TCs) of transmitted qP, qSV, and EA waves have been examined with a comparative approach. Comparison of the obtained result with that of the case when rotating pre-stressed structure with two semi-infinite media is constituted of lesser anisotropic functionally graded transversely isotropic piezoelectric (FGTIP) materials is also carried out. To validate the findings energy-partitions of reflected and transmitted waves for both the cases of the structures have been computed and shown to observe the Law of conservation of energy . Further, on considering a grazing incident of qP wave in both the cases of structure, RCs and TCs for reflected and transmitted qSV waves and EA waves become zero, whereas the RC for reflected and TC of transmitted qP wave gets out of phase. Some important peculiarities have also been highlighted through numerical results, which serve as a salient feature of the study.},

  abstract     = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or heart disorders are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among men, women and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the world. CVDs currently pose the highest threat to human health around the world. Due to the cardiac dysfunction that affects the heart valves, blood flow is in turn affected, which can eventually lead to abnormal heart sound. It can therefore be adequately characterised by the phonocardiogram (PCG) signal, as it directly reflects the mechanical function of the human heart. The main issue is the non-linear character of phonocardiography signals and the wide range of distinguishable pathological PCG signals. The present work proposes a computer-aided technique based on PCG signals with the higher-order spectra analysis (HOS). The HOS method is used since it is well known as suitable tool for analysing non-linear bio-signals. A variety of PCG signals were used and converted to bispectrum 2-D images using the FFT direct method, then a HOS-based features extraction was carried out and the analysis was performed with the energetic ratio (ER) as benchmark parameter. It is shown that the distinctive bispectral pattern of the different PCG signals presented in this study implies that each phonocardiogram could be distinguishable by applying the graphical bispectral analysis. Moreover, the derived HOS-related features, such as bispectral magnitude, bispectral entropies and weighted center of the bispectrum, show good performance in assessing the severity of cardiac pathology in the heart sounds signals. It is found that these results showed that the variation of the extracted HOS features are sensible to the added murmur intensity in the PCG recordings . The results suggest that the information obtained from the use of HOS technique to analyse PCG signals can improve the diagnosis of heart disorders and help clinicians differentiate patients according to the pathological severity of their heart state.},

In the convex case we present the ADMM with and without automatic penalty updates and demonstrate via numerical experiments on problems of various dimensions that our methods significantly outperform all other existing methods for finding the distance between ellipsoids. In the nonconvex case we propose a heuristic rule for updating the penalty parameter and a heuristic restarting procedure (a heuristic choice of a new starting for point for the second run of the algorithm). The restarting procedure was verified numerically with the use of a global method based on KKT optimality conditions. The results of numerical experiments on various test problems showed that this procedure always allows one to find a globally optimal solution in the nonconvex case. Furthermore, the numerical experiments also demonstrated that our version of the ADMM significantly outperforms existing methods for finding the distance between the boundaries of ellipsoids on problems of moderate and high dimensions.},

  abstract     = {On the basis of Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model, dynamical robustness and the transition of firing modes of multilayer memristive neural network consisting of nonidentical neurons have been investigated in detail. The dynamic effects of memristive synapses coupling which are either cubic order flux or quadratic flux are detected. Our results suggest that for the cubic order flux-controlled memristors increasing electromagnetic induction parameter and parameter of memristor show the tendency to spoil the dynamical robustness of the multilayer memristive neural network. For quadratic flux-controlled memristors, weak electromagnetic induction can spoil the dynamical robustness while strong electromagnetic induction and parameter of memristor have little influence on dynamical robustness. We found that the ratio of inactive neurons switches the firing patterns of the active neuron among periodic bursting, chaotic bursting and spiking-like. In the case of memristive synapse coupling by cubic order flux-controlled memristors, chaotic bursting alternates with period bursting as the ratio of inactive neurons is increased, and the chaotic bursting occupy a large range of the ratio of inactive neurons. In the case of memristive synapse coupling by quadratic flux-controlled memristors, the main firing pattern of the active neuron is chaotic bursting. The distribution of interspike interval can be broadly classified into two groups: those that are long interspike intervals and those that are short interspike intervals. The dynamics of multilayer memristive neural network is also verified in the circuits built on Multisim. These results could give new mechanism explanation for aging transition by applying electromagnetic field to neural network.},

The purpose of this paper is to design a suitable SMC controller to suppress the influence of factors such as model switching and time delay on the system performance, so that the system state can be stabilized within a limited time interval. First, the state of the system is reconstructed through the H ∞ H∞ state observer, and the SMC law based on the state observer is designed so that the state trajectory reaches the specified sliding surface (s.s.s) in a given finite time . Next, by introducing the concept of time-partitioning strategy, the finite-time boundedness (FTBs) of the reaching phase and the sliding motion phase are realized respectively. Then, according to the linear matrix inequality(LMI), the asymptotic stochastic stability of the system and sufficient conditions for sliding mode dynamics with a given interference attenuation level are derived. Finally, the numerical example and single-link robot arm model (S-lram) show the effectiveness of the method.},

The neural network is used to extract the features of the preprocessed dataset, and then the learning strategy can be adjusted according to the special advantages of strengthening the decision-making ability of learning and feedback. The experimental results show that the model based on deep reinforcement learning can achieve 98.06% accuracy in abnormal flow detection.Compared with various methods proposed by peers in current literature, this method is superior to other technologies in four evaluation indexes including accuracy rate, accuracy rate, recall rate and F1 score, among which the accuracy is increased by 2 percentage points.},

  abstract     = {The problem of the distributed interval estimation is studied for sensor networks under the denial-of-service (DoS) attack and the adaptive event-triggered protocol (AETP). The DoS attacks are described by the attack frequency and occurred duration in the channels between the local estimator and its neighbor nodes. Furthermore, AETP is employed to reduce the communication burden resulting from the limited bandwidth of communication networks. The dynamic threshold parameters of the proposed AETP are governed by an adaptive law, which is directly related with the error between the innovation at the current instant and the broadcast innovation at the latest trigger instant. The purpose of this article is to design a distributed interval estimator by utilizing the local information and the neighboring information such that, in the simultaneous presence of AETP, the bounded noises, and the aperiodic DoS attacks, system real states are involved in an interval. Then, some sufficient conditions are gained by employing the stability analysis theory and positive system theory, and the desired estimator gains are obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a simulation example is proposed to show the effectiveness of the developed method.},

The proposed formulation, which addresses invertible condition problems, overcomes the limitations in the selection of dependent degrees of freedom (DOFs) in interpolation MPCs. For the extension of the DOF selection criteria, a new transformation matrix is essentially derived via the approximation of the series expansion by using dynamic correction, and hence the derived transformation matrix can be easily applied to construct a symmetric FMBD formulation for the numerical stability. Consequently, the proposed formulation shows an improved performance in the selection of dependent DOFs to well reflect the realistic constraints of flexible bodies and provide better numerical stability with standard time integrators. The performance of proposed method was evaluated through numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {We propose a data-driven approach aiming at reducing Bond Graphs by using simulation data. The output of the approach is a hybrid model that contains a Reduced Bond Graph coupled to a simple artificial neural network . In this paper, the neural network is obtained by a linear calibration procedure. We propose a method that contains two training steps. First, the method selects the components of the original Bond Graph that are kept in the reduced Bond Graph. Secondly, the method builds an artificial neural network that supplements the reduced Bond Graph. Because the output of the proposed approach is a hybrid model, not solely data, it becomes difficult to use a usual Backpropagation Through Time to calibrate the weights of the neural network. So, in a first attempt, a very simple neural network is proposed by following a model reduction approach. As an industrial application, we consider the modeling of the automotive cabins thermal behavior. The data used for the training step are obtained via solutions of differential algebraic equations by means of a design of experiment . Simple cooling simulations are run during the training step. We show a simulation speed-up when the reduced bond graph is used to simulate the driving cycle of the WLTP vehicles homologation procedure, while preserving accuracy on output variables. The variables of the original bond graph are split into a set of primary variables, a set of secondary variables and a set of tertiary variables. The reduced bond graph contains all the primary variables, but none of the tertiary variables. While secondary variables are coupled to primary ones via an artificial neural network . Besides, the mathematical modeling used to describe the proposed method allows generalizing it to any set of differential algebraic equations, and not only to bond graphs. Finally, we discuss the extension of the coupling approach to more complex artificial neural networks.},

We first develop a standard DCA scheme especially dealing with the very specific structure of this problem. Furthermore, we extend DCA to give rise to the so-named DCA-Like, which is based on a new and efficient way to approximate the DC objective function without knowing a DC decomposition. We further improve DCA based algorithms by incorporating the Nesterov’s acceleration technique into them. The convergence properties and the convergence rate under Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz assumption of extended DCAs are rigorously studied. We prove that DCA-Like and the accelerated versions subsequently converge from every initial point to a critical point of the considered problem. Finally, we investigate the proposed algorithms for an important problem in machine learning: the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding.

In this paper, a mathematical framework new in the field is used and, starting from the discussion of the invariance problem of local indices, the behavior of some widespread global ones that evaluate the resilience of a network will be investigated from both a theoretical and computational point of view. The authors also give suitable changing formulas in the local and global case and describe the conditions that ensure invariance.

In particular, we combine Newton-type directions with scaled SD steps to have suitable descent directions. Scaling the SD directions with a suitable step length makes a significant difference with respect to similar globalization approaches, in terms of both theoretical features and computational behavior. We apply our strategy to Newton’s method and the BFGS method, with computational results that appear interesting compared with the results of well-established globalization strategies devised ad hoc for those methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper is dedicated to numerical computation of higher order derivatives in Simulink. In this paper, a new module has been implemented to achieve this purpose within the Simulink-based Infinity Computer solution, recently introduced by the authors. This module offers several blocks to calculate higher order derivatives of a function given by the arithmetic operations and elementary functions . Traditionally, this can be done in Simulink using finite differences only, for which it is well-known that they can be characterized by instability and low accuracy. Moreover, the proposed module allows to calculate higher order Lie derivatives embedded in the numerical solution to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Traditionally, Simulink does not offer any practical solution for this case without using difficult external libraries and methodologies, which are domain-specific, not general-purpose and have their own limitations. The proposed differentiation module bridges this gap, is simple and does not require any additional knowledge or skills except basic knowledge of the Simulink programming language. Finally, the block for constructing the Taylor expansion of the differentiated function is also proposed, adding so another efficient numerical method for solving ODEs and for polynomial approximation of the functions. Numerical experiments on several classes of test problems confirm advantages of the proposed solution.},

Then, step-by-step, this simpler problem is converted into the original problem, while the quasi-time parameter τ runs from τ = 0 τ=0 to τ = 1 τ=1 .

In this paper, the stress function and multidimensional scaling, in general, have been considered from the geometric point of view. The so-called Geometric MDS has been developed. The new interpretation of the stress allows finding the proper step size, and the descent direction forwards the minimum of the stress function analytically if we consider and move a separate point of the projected space. The exceptional property of the new approach is that we do not need the analytical expression of the stress function. There is no need for numerical evaluation of its derivatives, too. Moreover, we do not need for the linear search that is used for local descent in optimization. Theoretical analysis disclosed that the step direction, determined by Geometric MDS, coincides with the steepest descent direction . The analytically found step size is such that it guarantees the decrease of the stress in this direction. Two realizations of Geometric MDS are proposed and examined. The comparison with SMACOF realization of MDS looks very promising.},

Thanks to this, some applications to cryptography are described, considering convenient parametrizations of the conics. We perform an evaluation of the complexity of the operations involved in the parametric groups and consequently in the cryptographic applications. In the case of the hyperbolas , the Rédei rational functions can be used for performing the operations of encryption and decryption, and the More’s algorithm can be exploited for improving the time costs of computation.

The ART-operators are generalized for complex-valued absorption coefficient as well as weight functions of polynomial and exponential type . Connections between ART operators of various orders are established by means of the application of the linear part of a transport equation. These connections lead to inhomogeneous differential equations of order ( k + 1 ) (k+1) for the ART of order k . Uniqueness theorems for the corresponding boundary-value and initial boundary-value problems are proved. Properties of integral angular moments of order p are considered and connections between the moments of different orders are deduced. A close connection of the considered operators with mathematical models for tomography, physical optics and integral geometry allows to treat the inversion of ART of order k as an inverse problem of determining the right-hand side of a corresponding differential equation.},

However, there are no studies on the internal mechanism of synaptic loss and synaptic compensation affecting human cognitive ability. In order to solve this problem, we propose here a three-layer neural network with multiple associative memory abilities, which is one of the main cognitive abilities. Based on synaptic plasticity , models of synaptic loss and synaptic compensation are established to study the pathogenesis of the degeneration of associative memory and explore feasible treatment approaches by setting different degrees of loss and compensation. Our simulation results show that the model can describe the associative memory ability at different stages of AD, which is of great significance for paramedics to determine the stage of disease and develop effective treatment strategies.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a new constructive piecewise interpolation method. The procedure is composed of a weighted average of two sequential interpolating polynomials on each subinterval , where we employ a rational weight function satisfying some properties to glue the sequential polynomials appropriately. The scheme is rather simple compared with existing piecewise interpolation schemes. Analysis for the error bound of the presented scheme is performed, and numerical examples are included to demonstrate usefulness of the scheme. As a result, we can find that the proposed interpolating function is C 2 C2 over the whole interval including the given data and, in particular, the method associated with the cubic polynomials is comparable to the well-known cubic spline scheme.},

This disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Mathematical modeling is one of the most important tools that can speed up finding a drug or vaccine for COVID-19. COVID-19 can lead to death especially for patients having chronic diseases such as cancer, AIDS, etc. We construct a new within-host SARS-CoV-2/cancer model. The model describes the interactions between six compartments: nutrient, healthy epithelial cells, cancer cells, SARS-CoV-2 virus particles, cancer-specific CTLs, and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We verify the nonnegativity and boundedness of its solutions. We outline all possible equilibrium points of the proposed model. We prove the global stability of equilibria by constructing proper Lyapunov functions. We do some numerical simulations to visualize the obtained results. According to our model, lymphopenia in COVID-19 cancer patients may worsen the outcomes of the infection and lead to death. Understanding dysfunctions in immune responses during COVID-19 infection in cancer patients could have implications for the development of treatments for this high-risk group.},

  abstract     = {The work aims to increase the efficiency of finding local fields in problems, like those of fracture mechanics, for which extreme, rather than average, values of fields are of prime significance. We focus on using kernel independent fast multipole methods (KI-FMM) when a problem is solved by a boundary element method . To accurately calculate local fields, we employ smooth equivalent surfaces (SES), used in translations of a KI-FMM, instead of non-smooth surfaces having singular lines (12 edges of a cube) and/or points (8 vertices of a cube in 3D; 4 vertices of a square in 2D). We develop and employ exact representations of circular (in 2D) and spherical (in 3D) equivalent surfaces and higher-order approximations of equivalent densities on them. It is established that the accuracy and stability of a KI-FMM with the SES suggested are notably higher than those of a similar KI-FMM employing non-smooth (square in 2D, cubic in 3D) equivalent surfaces. Theoretical considerations presented and numerical tests performed show that, when using the SES, the complexity of a KI-FMM does not exceed that of an analytical FMM of the same accuracy. Numerical examples illustrate the exposition. The subroutines developed are of immediate use in any code of the KI-FMM to increase the accuracy of translations without increasing their time expense.},

The solutions of the 1-D reaction-diffusion equation are considered using the Galerkin technique. Full maps of Hopf bifurcation are determined for the parameters of maturation time, diffusion coefficient and growth rate. In addition, the effects of the free parameters in this model have been examined with the consequence that they can destabilize or stabilize the solution. The Hopf bifurcations for proliferation rate decreased as the maturation time increased while the diffusion coefficient grew. Furthermore, bifurcation diagrams and examples of periodic limited cycle solutions and 2D phase plane maps have been constructed. The comparisons between the numerical simulations with the analytical solutions provided confirmatory evidence and the validation of the technique used, with an excellent agreement compared for all the examples shown. Lindstedt–Poincaré in perturbation theory was applied to calculate the asymptotic results around the Hopf bifurcation point for both the one and two-term analytical systems.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a fast and efficient numerical method is constructed for solving nonlinear space-fractional multidelay reaction-diffusion equations. Firstly, we spatially discretize the equation using the weighted and shifted Grünwald–Letnikov difference (WSGD) formula. As a result, a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is obtained. Then, based on the fact that the implicit integration factor (IIF) method is an effective time-stepping scheme with good stability properties, we develop a multidelay IIF (MIIF) method to deal with the resulting ODE system. Compared with traditional numerical schemes , such as the backward differential formula (BDF) and the Crank–Nicolson scheme (CN), the proposed MIIF scheme has two main advantages: (1) MIIF can achieve high-order accuracy in time; (2) the temporal errors are smaller and the convergence orders observed with MIIF are more regular. In addition, in order to overcome the computational challenges, we propose some Krylov subspace methods to calculate the actions of the Toeplitz matrix exponentials in MIIF. Finally, numerical examples are presented to confirm the accuracy of the MIIF scheme and to demonstrate the considerable computational advantages of the proposed fast solving algorithms.},

It is the first time that the coupled Boussinesq equations are derived by using perturbation and spatiotemporal extensions transformations to simulate the evolutions of nonlinear barotropic and baroclinic waves. The solitary wave solutions are analytically obtained to explain the excitation, propagation and decrease of the coherent structures. The physical mechanism of the nonlinear wave-wave coherent structures is discussed by considering the effects of different physical factors, such as the topography, the Earth’s rotation and the basic shear flow. It is found that both topography and beta parameter have essential effects on the evolutions of the coherent structures.

In contrast to most traditional control schemes that can only achieve bounded error tracking performances, the proposed control method in this paper can make the switched systems with unknown nonlinear functions achieve an asymptotic tracking performance. It is completed by introducing nonlinear filters with a compensation term to remove the boundary layer error stemming from using linear filters in the DSC process. Meanwhile, the approximation error caused by the use of radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NNs) is compensated by an online updated parameter. Furthermore, the nonstrict-feedback form is handled by adopting the inherent properties of RBF NNs. Then, in terms of the backstepping technique and the common Lyapunov function (CLF) approach, the desired control law with only two adaptive laws is set up. Finally, the validity of the developed strategy is verified via simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Stefan problems provide one of the most fundamental frameworks to capture phase change processes. The problem in cylindrical coordinates can model outward solidification, which ensures the thermal design and operation associated with phase change materials (PCMs). However, this moving boundary problem is highly nonlinear in most circumstances. Exact solutions are restricted to certain domains and boundary conditions. It is therefore vital to develop approximate analytical solutions based on physically tangible assumptions, e.g., a small Stefan number. A great amount of work has been done in one-phase Stefan problems, where the initial state is at its fusion temperature, yet very few literature has considered two-phase problems particularly in cylindrical coordinates. This paper conducts an asymptotic analysis for a two-phase Stefan problem for outward solidification in a hollow cylinder, consisting of three temporal and four spatial scales. The results are compared with the enthalpy method that simulates a mushy region between two phases by numerical iterations, rather than a sharp interface in Stefan problems. After studying both mathematical models, the role of mushy-zone thickness in the enthalpy method is also unveiled. Moreover, a wide range of geometric ratios, thermophysical properties and Stefan numbers are selected from the literature to explore their effects on the developed model with regards to interface motion and temperature profile. It can be concluded that the asymptotic solution is capable of tracking the moving interface and evaluating the transient temperature for various geometric ratios and thermophysical properties in PCMs. The accuracy of this solution is found to be affected by Stefan number only, and the computational cost is much less compared with the enthalpy method and other numerical schemes.},

  abstract     = {Remote sensing hyperspectral images (HSIs) are inevitably corrupted by several types of noise in the process of acquisition and transmission. In this paper, we propose a non-convex low-rank tensor approximation (NonLRTA) model for mixed noise removal, which can estimate the intrinsic structure of the underlying HSI from its noisy observation. The clean HSI component is characterized by the ϵ ϵ -norm, which is a non-convex surrogate to Tucker rank. The mixed noise is modeled as the sum of sparse and Gaussian components, which are regularized by the l 1 l1 -norm and the Frobenius norm , respectively. An efficient augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model. Experiments implemented on simulated and real HSIs validate the superiority of the proposed method, as compared to the state-of-the-art matrix-based and tensor-based methods.},

Firstly, by establishing a modified Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJI) equation, which is difficult to be solved, a model-based policy iteration (PI) GCC algorithm is designed for input-constrained nonlinear systems with disturbances. Moreover, without requiring any knowledge of system dynamics, by designing an auxiliary system with a control law and an auxiliary disturbance policy, an online model-free GCC approach is developed by utilizing integral reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm. To implement the proposed control algorithm, the actor and disturbance NNs are constructed to approximate the optimal control input and worst-case disturbance policy, while the critic NN is utilized to approximate optimal value function. Further, a synchronization weight update law is developed to minimize the NN approximation residual errors. The asymptotic stability of controlled systems is analyzed by applying the Lyapunov’s method. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control method are verified by two nonlinear simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a neural network-based method for approximating expected exposures and potential future exposures of Bermudan options. In a first phase, the method relies on the Deep Optimal Stopping algorithm (DOS) proposed by Becker, Cheridito, and Jentzen (2019), which learns the optimal stopping rule from Monte-Carlo samples of the underlying risk factors. Cashflow paths are then created by applying the learned stopping strategy on a new set of realizations of the risk factors. Furthermore, in a second phase the cashflow paths are projected onto the risk factors to obtain approximations of pathwise option values. The regression step is carried out by ordinary least squares as well as neural networks, and it is shown that the latter results in more accurate approximations. The expected exposure is formulated, both in terms of the cashflow paths and in terms of the pathwise option values and it is shown that a simple Monte-Carlo average yields accurate approximations in both cases. The potential future exposure is estimated by the empirical α α -percentile. Finally, it is shown that the expected exposures, as well as the potential future exposures can be computed under either, the risk neutral measure, or the real world measure, without having to re-train the neural networks.},

Then, the stability of the resulting impulsive dynamic system is strictly proved by using the Lyapunov stability theory , and the event-trigger condition is designed to realize that the NN weights and feedback signals are updated only when the condition is violated. In addition, the lower bound of inter-event times is strictly proved to be positive, which effectively avoids Zeno behavior. Compared with the conventional adaptive control based on the time-triggered scheme, feedback transmissions and NN weight updating only occur at necessary instants, such that the waste of communication resources is effectively reduced.

In particular, we are interested in the speed of sharp interfaces approaching and annihilating each other. This process is known to be exponentially slow in the case of the classical Laplacian. Here we investigate how the width and speed of the interfaces change if we vary the exponent α α of the fractional Laplacian. For the associated model on the real line we derive asymptotic formulas for the interface speed and time–to–collision in terms of α α and a scaling parameter ε ε . We use a numerical approach via a finite-element method based upon extending the fractional Laplacian to a cylinder in the upper-half plane, and compute the interface speed, time–to–collapse and interface width for α ∈ ( 0.3 , 2 ] α∈(0.3,2] . A comparison shows that the asymptotic formulas for the interface speed and time–to–collision give a good approximation for large intervals.},

  abstract     = {In the actual industrial process, the distribution of historical training data and online testing data is always different due to the switching of operating modes and changes in climate conditions. At this time, the performance of traditional data-driven fault diagnosis methods based on the assumption that historical training data and online testing data follow the same distribution will degrade. Therefore, how to ensure the reliability of the fault diagnosis method for the distribution distortion is necessary yet challenge. In this paper, a cross-domain fault diagnosis method based on transferred stacked autoencoder is proposed. In detail, a stacked autoencoder is firstly used to extract features of a large amount of source domain data, and the features are classified to establish the source domain model. Then, a small amount of target domain data is introduced to fine-tune the source domain model to achieve domain adaptation. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed deep transfer method was demonstrated through wind turbine system experiment and pump truck experiment. In addition, this paper also discusses the number of layers of the stacked autoencoder and model transfer strategies in detail to help practitioners understand the proposed method in practice.},

Compared with existing control approaches for uncertain nonholonomic mobile robots, the primary contribution of our study is to develop quantized-states-based low-complexity tracking and stability methodologies for ensuring the predesignated performance of tracking errors. A robust tracking scheme using quantized state variables is designed without any adaptive mechanisms to compensate for nonlinear dynamic uncertainties. The boundedness of the quantization errors of the closed-loop signals is derived from a theoretical lemma. Using this lemma, the closed-loop stability is analyzed with the predesignated performance guarantee of tracking errors in the Lyapunov sense.

A novel time-varying Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) is firstly constructed to deal with the time-varying output constraint. A new SOSM dynamics subject to mismatched terms is established for the purpose of uncertainty reduction in control input channels. Meanwhile, by incorporating the time-varying BLF into the adding a power integrator (API) technique, a new finite-time SOSM controller, which can ensure that the system output variable will not violate the boundary of the constrained region, is explicitly constructed. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed SOSM algorithm.},

Moreover, as modifying costs are usually uncertain in many real life situations, we measure the robustness by taking into account the minmax regret inverse maximum weight problem on E E . In order to solve the problem, we first prove that there are exactly two scenarios that lead to the maximum regret of the cost function.

Then, based on this formula, algebraic standards are obtained by employing M M -matrix theory as well as analytical techniques to guarantee the global robust exponential stability of the considered QNNs. Particularly, different from most existing decomposition approaches, this whole quaternionic method can be used whether the QNNs are decomposable or not and greatly reduces computation cost.

An analytical geometrical model is presented to incorporate the perforation effect into the governing equations. The microstructure size dependent effect is incorporated based on the modified couple stress theory. Based on the presented geometrical model, the dynamic equations of motion including the interaction terms of the mass inertia are derived from the exact differential of the displacement functions of the beam relative to the mass contact point. To investigate the temperature effect on the dynamic behavior, thermal loading with different temperature rise profiles are considered. Thermal stresses, due to thermal loads are converted to mechanical stresses and then the thermal rigidity matrix is combined with the stiffness matrix of the beam. The dynamic finite element equations of motion are derived including the thermal effect. The system equations are solved numerically by using implicit time integration method due to its stability. The proposed numerical procedure is checked by comparing the obtained results with the available solutions and good agreement is observed. Effects of perforation parameters, thermal loading profile, moving mass characteristics, as well as the moving speed on the dynamic behavior of perforated microbeams are studied. The obtained results are helpful in the design and manufacturing of perforated microbeams structural systems.},

To handle the non-synchronization phenomenon of the system mode and the controller mode, an asynchronous state feedback controller based on hidden Markov model (HMM) is developed.

  abstract     = {The main goal of this research paper is to present the modeling and analysis of bi-directional functionally graded (BDFG) nanobeams within the framework of the Timoshenko beam theory and nonlocal strain gradient theory. According to the DBFG material model, the material properties of the nanobeams are simultaneously distributed in two different directions (thickness and length directions). Besides, the volume fraction of component material is described by a function that combines the power and exponential distribution rules. The study focuses strongly on understanding the mechanical behavior of the BDFG nanobeams and in calculating important parameters of materials and nonlocal strain gradient coefficients. In addition, equilibrium and stability equations for DBFG nanobeams are systematically formulated to static bending and buckling problems with the corresponding boundary condition. The highlight is the combination of two different technical solutions as Navier solution and the Galerkin technique. In the numerical results section, some specific examples are presented to verify the proposed solution, and thereby, a good agreement is observed. Finally, a detailed investigation is performed, with a particular focus on the influences of material properties, nonlocal parameter on the critical buckling load and transverse deflection of the BDFG nanobeams.},

In particular, the estimator integrates a gain factor to improve the flexibility of the system performance and to enhance the dynamic efficiency of disturbance rejection. In addition, the randomness phenomena are integrated by the stochastic variables agency which satisfies the properties of the Bernoulli distribution . Precisely, to alleviate the disturbance effect in the closed-loop system, the IEID-based estimator is added into the feedback control input without any prior information about the disturbance effect. With the aid of stochastic analysis and Wirtinger’s inequality techniques, the desired IEID-based non-fragile feedback controller can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities .

The perturbation analysis of these two structures is discussed one by one to depict the additional properties explicitly. Present work shows the entrywise structured perturbation of matrix pencils in Frobenius norm such that the specified eigenpairs become exact eigenpairs of an appropriately perturbed matrix pencil. The framework used here maintains the sparsity in the perturbation of the above-structured matrix pencils.

The drug-sensitive strain could mutate and become drug-resistant strain during the process of reverse transcription (i.e., SR conversion in short). The nonnegativity and boundedness of solutions are discussed, by introducing two kinds of principle reproduction numbers, i.e., R s Rs (the reproduction number induced by drug-sensitive strain of HIV virus) and R r Rr (the reproduction number induced by drug-resistant strain of HIV virus), the existence of equilibria is also acquired. Using the linearization method and constructing the suitable Lyapunov functionals, the criteria are established on the local and global stability of equilibria (including infection-free, drug-sensitive strain, drug-resistant strain and endemic) based on the composite effects of R s Rs and R r Rr . We find that there exist competitive exclusion and coexistence phenomenon between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains without SR conversion, while uniform persistence between the two kinds of strains with SR conversion.

The construction of the multiplex network allows us to establish relationships between mobility and urban bus transport system with tourism and commercial activities. From these networks, two measures of centrality in multiplex networks are calculated based on the spectral properties of a matrix constructed from the network graph and the data associated with the nodes. The centrality measures establish a ranking in the importance of the nodes within the graph. This allows us to identify the most important zones or areas within the urban layout, both from the point of view of mobility and displacement and of tourist and leisure activity within the city.

Multiple communities correspond to multiple underlying true states. At each time step, the individual in a community receives his private signal and updates his opinion to be a weighted linear combination of his own Bayesian posterior opinion and the opinions of his neighbors, while the uninformed individual outside the communities has no private signal and only takes the neighbors’ weighted average opinion as his own opinion. Simulation results show that in the social network environment with multiple true states, for the uninformed individual, the opinion will depend on the weighted average opinion of his neighbors, and for the individual in the strongly connected community, the opinion dynamics will depend on the communication types between communities. If communities are not connected, he will achieve asymptotic learning. If communities are unidirectionally connected, he will learn the true state of the root community. If communities are bidirectionally connected, his opinion will appear chaos phenomenon and oscillate within a certain range. So, in a society with multiple true states, the absence of communication between communities is conducive to asymptotic learning and bidirectional communications between communities will hinder asymptotic learning.},

In this article we examine the theory of cross-efficiency measurement by comparing a selection of methods popular in the literature. These methods are applied to performance measurement of European warehouses. We develop a cross-efficiency method based on a rank-order DEA model to accommodate the ordinal nature of some key variables characterizing warehouse performance. This is one of the first comparisons of methods on a real-life dataset and the first time that a model allowing for qualitative variables is included in such a comparison. Our results show that the choice of model matters, as one obtains statistically different rankings from each one of them. This holds in particular for the multiplicative and game-theoretic methods whose results diverge from the classic method. From a managerial perspective, focused on the applicability of the methods, we evaluate them through a multidimensional metric which considers their capability to rank DMUs, their ease of implementation, and their robustness to sensitivity analyses. We conclude that standard weight-restriction methods, as initiated by Sexton et al. [48] , perform as well as recently introduced, more sophisticated alternatives.},

We introduce σ = − a D p σ=−aDp as an intermediate variable to isolate a ( x ) a(x) from the nonlocal operator , and then apply the least-squares method to obtain a mixed-type variational formulation . Correspondingly, solution space is split into a regular space and a kernel-dependent space. The solution p p and σ σ are then represented as a sum of a regular part and a kernel-dependent singular part . Doing so, a new regularity theory is established, which extends those regularity results for the one side CFDE in [23, 36], and for the fractional Laplace equation corresponding to θ = 1 / 2 θ=1/2 in [37, 38], to general CFDE with variable diffusive coefficients and for 0 &lt; θ &lt; 1 0&amp;lt;θ&amp;lt;1 .

We derive the partial differential equation modeling the XVA when stochastic volatility is assumed. For both European and American options, a linear and a nonlinear problem have been deduced. In order to obtain a numerical solution, suitable and appropriate boundary conditions have been considered. In addition, a method of characteristics for the time discretization combined with a finite element method in the spatial discretization has been implemented.

  abstract     = {Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, much effort has been put on studying the spread of infectious diseases to propose more adequate health politics. The most effective surveillance system consists of doing massive tests. Nonetheless, many countries cannot afford this class of health campaigns due to limited resources. Thus, a transmission model is a viable alternative to study the dynamics of the pandemic. The most used are the Susceptible, Infected and Removed type models (SIR). In this study, we tackle the population estimation problem of the A-SIR model, which takes into account asymptomatic or undetected individuals. By means of an algebraic differential approach, we design a model-free (no copy system) reduced-order estimation algorithm (observer) to determine the different non-measured population groups. We study two types of estimation algorithms: Proportional and Proportional-Integral. Both shown fast convergence speed, as well as a minimal estimation error. Additionally, we introduce random fluctuations in our analysis to represent changes in the external conditions and which result in poor measurements. The numerical results reveal that both model-free estimators are robust despite the presence of these fluctuations. As a point of reference, we apply the classical Luenberger type observer to our estimation problem and compare the results. Finally, we consider real data of infected individuals in Mexico City, reported from February 2020 to March 2021, and estimate the non-measured populations. Our work’s main goal is to proportionate a simple and therefore, an accessible methodology to estimate the behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic from the available data, such that the competent authorities can propose more adequate health politics.},

For this problem, we first show that, by a time-scaling transformation, the problem can be transformed into an equivalent fractional optimal control problem with fixed final time. We then discretize the transformed fractional optimal control problem by a second-order one-point numerical integration scheme and the trapezoidal rule. Furthermore, we derive the gradient formulae of the cost and constraint functions with respect to decision variables and propose a numerical procedure for calculating these gradients. On this basis, a gradient-based optimization algorithm is developed for solving the resulting problem.

Using estimation errors instead of tracking errors to update adaptive laws, estimator-based minimum learning parameter (EMLP) observers capable of relaxing computational complexity are respectively explored in translational and rotational loops to reject fast time-varying disturbances, such that transient oscillations can be efficiently mitigated even with a large adaptive gain. Meanwhile, quantitative analysis for transient learning performance is characterized by means of L 2 norms of time differential of neural network weights. With the aid of disturbance estimates, a relative event-triggered robust control law is derived by inserting a compensation term to guarantee a favorable trajectory tracking with Zeno free behaviors and decreased sampling cost. Besides, an appointed-time prescribed performance control (APPC) is established, enforcing trajectory tracking errors to evolve within pre-given regions even in face of triggering errors, where a piecewise and continuous finite-time behavior function, rather than an exponential decaying function, is applied to enable a preassigned fast convergence time without retuning controller parameters.

  abstract     = {Motivated from the study of eccentricity, center, and sum of eccentricities in graphs and trees, we introduce several new distance-based global and local functions based on the smallest distance from a vertex to some leaf (called the “uniformity” at that vertex). Some natural extremal problems on trees are considered. Then the middle parts of a tree is discussed and compared with the well-known center of a tree. The values of the global functions are also compared with the sum of eccentricities and some sharp bounds are established. Last but not the least, we show that the difference between the eccentricity and the uniformity, when considered as a local function, behaves in a very similar way as the eccentricity itself.},

In the presented stability conditions, the established L L -operator differential inequality is based on the VLF and allows cross item to exist.

  abstract     = {The turbulent hydromagnetic dynamo is a process of magnetic field generation by chaotic flow of an electrically conducting fluid (plasma, liquid iron etc.). It is responsible for generation of large-scale magnetic fields of astrophysical objects such as planets, stars, accretion discs , galaxies, galaxy clusters etc. In particular, the dynamical process of induction of large-scale fields is strongly nonlinear and the effect of the Lorentz force is crucial. The aim of the analysis presented here is to provide analytic expressions for the large-scale electromotive force (EMF) in the limit of rapid rotation, with inclusion of both types of nonlinearities - the effect of the Lorentz force (hitherto scarcely considered) and the nonlinear evolution of turbulent fluctuations. The renormalization group technique is applied to extract the final expression for the mean EMF from the full nonlinear dynamical equations (Navier-Stokes, induction equation) and the mean-field equations are studied in order to demonstrate amplification and saturation of the mean magnetic field in two simplifying limits, that is the limit of a thin disc and a limit of a narrow spherical gap.},

This wavelet IB method is developed by introducing a wavelet finite element method to calculate the FSI force affected by the two-variable coupling. Furthermore, a boundary influence matrix and a series of B-spline wavelet delta functions are constructed to restrain the non-physical force oscillations. Finally, several FSI problems are simulated, which include flows past a fixed circular cylinder and a crosswise oscillating circular cylinder, as well as an in-line oscillating circular cylinder in a rest fluid. The numerical examples show that the new method is a simple and efficient method for two-variable coupled FSI problems.},

A proper management policy equipped with the scientific understanding of species interaction is a footstep in a long-term sustainable fishery . This work performs a qualitative study of bioeconomic management of a fishery in presence of some infection. The model narrates the rate equations of the healthy fish, infected fish, fishing effort and market price, where the fishing effort is considered to be dependent on the fish price and the fish price is regulated by the demand-supply theory of the open market. Routh–Hurwitz criterion is utilized for the local stability analysis whereas the high-dimensional Bendixson criterion is used for the global stability analysis. The one and two parameters bifurcation analysis explain various switching in equilibrium states, which includes infection-free, infected and harvesting-free states. The existence conditions of the bionomic equilibrium, where both the ecological and economic equilibrium exists, has been established. The harvested fish biomass is observed to be higher at the infection-free equilibrium state compare to the infected equilibrium state under increasing infection rate, however, the outcome is opposite under increasing environmental carrying capacity. Though, the total revenue is highest at the infection-free state when demand is high. An unintuitive result is that the infection persists at a higher level if demand decreases.},

The energy decay rates of the solution to the model are examined through the Fourier transform method. Moreover, we develop a pseudo-compact finite difference scheme for solving the model, study solution behavior, and confirm our theoretical results. The fundamental energy-decreasing property, which is obtained from the model of coupling the Rosenau-RLW equation with the Rosenau-Burgers equation, is derived and preserved by the present numerical scheme . The existence, uniqueness, convergence, and stability of the numerical solution are theoretically analyzed. Some numerical experiments are also conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the present method. Finally, to verify the optimal decay rates, the numerical results are carried out at variant time scales by applying the moving boundary technique. The simulations are successfully constructed to support the theoretical results.},

An adaptive observer is firstly constructed to observe the compromised states under DoS attacks. Then based on the estimated sates, a resilient control strategy is developed to remedy the negative influence of DoS attacks and perturbations. By employing linear matrix inequality and Lyapunov stability theory , one can guarantee that the system states can track the desired signals of reference systems with time going to infinity. Furthermore, the state observation errors are guaranteed to remain a high accuracy.

Taking the coefficient of spatial memory diffusion as the bifurcation parameter, the critical values of steady state and Hopf bifurcations are rigorously determined.

As of December 14, 2020, it has caused an epidemic outbreak with more than 73 million confirmed infections and above 1.5 million reported deaths worldwide. During this period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is established and reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rising worldwide, investigation of control strategies and forecasting are necessary for health care planning. In this study, we propose and analyze a compartmental epidemic model of COVID-19 to predict and control the outbreak. The basic reproduction number and the control reproduction number are calculated analytically. A detailed stability analysis of the model is performed to observe the dynamics of the system. We calibrated the proposed model to fit daily data from the United Kingdom (UK) where the situation is still alarming. Our findings suggest that independent self-sustaining human-to-human spread ( R 0 &gt; 1 , R0&amp;gt;1, R c &gt; 1 Rc&amp;gt;1 ) is already present. Short-term predictions show that the decreasing trend of new COVID-19 cases is well captured by the model. Further, we found that effective management of quarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated individuals to reduce the disease burden. Thus, if limited resources are available, then investing on the quarantined individuals will be more fruitful in terms of reduction of cases.},

In [12] it was conjectured that every graph G G with cyclomatic number c ( G ) c(G) satisfies mdim ( G ) ≤ L 1 ( G ) + 2 c ( G ) mdim(G)≤L1(G)+2c(G) where L 1 ( G ) L1(G) is the number of leaves in G G . It is already proven that the equality holds for all trees and more generally for graphs with edge-disjoint cycles in which every cycle has precisely one vertex of degree ≥ 3 ≥3 . In this paper we determine that for every Θ Θ -graph G , G, the mixed metric dimension mdim ( G ) mdim(G) equals 3 or 4, with 4 being attained if and only if G G is a balanced Θ Θ -graph. Thus, for balanced Θ Θ -graphs the above inequality is also tight. We conclude the paper by further conjecturing that there are no other graphs, besides the ones mentioned here, for which the equality mdim ( G ) = L 1 ( G ) + 2 c ( G ) mdim(G)=L1(G)+2c(G) holds.},

Then the equivalent system is discretized by the finite difference method to yield a linear system at each time step, which can be efficiently solved.

Nonhomogeneous thermal boundaries corresponding to heat flux on vertical walls and convection heat transfer at the bottom along with moving top lid are effectively approximated by interpolated Coiflet-type wavelet. Highly coupled and nonlinear governing equations for the complex fields of temperature, nanoparticles volume fraction and solute concentration have been formulated and decomposed into linear differential ones by homotopy transformation. Numerical wavelet solutions with larger range of physical parameters are finally obtained and validated by solving a set of iterative algebra equations applying Galerkin method, which are difficult to be given by traditional numerical methods. The results reveal that nanoparticles and double-diffusive buoyancy parameters, the thermo-nanofluid and thermo-solutal Lewis numbers, the heat conductivity coefficient, the periodical heat flux with different phase differences, the diffusiophoresis parameters, the nanoparticles and solute Dufour parameters, the solute Soret parameter are of great significance on characteristics of heat and mass transfer in the complex flow.},

We embed a suitable value function into the interactions of wealth to describe that agents allocate their wealth between the risky and risk-less assets. The value function contains the predicted price and present price of the stock to depict reactions of agents toward potential risks. The price prediction and risk estimation affect investment strategies of agents through the value function. After constructing the interactions of wealth, we apply quasi-invariant wealth limits and Boltzmann-type equations to derive a Fokker-Planck equation with underlying equilibrium. When the wealth invested in the risky asset satisfies certain conditions, an explicit stationary solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is obtained to show that the wealth distribution converges exponentially to a close lognormal distribution in the long run.

  abstract     = {Nonlinear science is very common and important natural phenomenon in our surroundings. It is quite possible to find a large number of phenomena, which become a cause of the formulation of a non-linear partial differential equation. Due to the presence of non-linear partial differential equations in each branch of science, these equations have become a useful tool to deal with complex natural phenomena. It is interesting to investigate any complex non-linear partial differential equations for different exact solutions and examine the behavior of the solutions. Many effective approaches are developed to obtain the explicit exact solutions of the NLPDEs. Lie symmetry analysis is also one of the significant approaches to investigate the NLPDEs. Based on the Lie group analysis, we investigate a very famous and important equation, which is named as fourth-order Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur water wave dynamical equation . The symmetry groups , Commutator Tables and Adjoint of infinitesimals are constructed for this equation. Further, using the adjoint table, the optimal system is obtained. According to the optimal system, we tried to find the possible exact solution using symmetry reduction and presented a brief study of the properties of different solutions. We found some new exact solutions described with graphical representation showing solution wave structure, contour plot and wave propagation of the solution profile. The results are often helpful for studying the interaction of waves in many new localized structures and high-dimensional models.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we extend the discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) to simulate conjugate heat transfer flows. The conjugate interface that separates two media with different thermophysical properties is handled by a ghost-cell (GC) immersed boundary method. Specifically, fictitious cells are set in both domains to implement the continuity conditions of both temperature and heat flux at the conjugate interface. Information at the ghost cells is unavailable and should be reconstructed from the interface and neighboring field. With interface constraints involved in the reconstruction, the conjugate condition can be incorporated smoothly into the process of solving the full flow field. Those features make the present GC-DUGKS capture the conjugate interface, without introducing an additional term or modifying the equilibrium distribution function as in previous studies. Furthermore, the Strang-splitting scheme is applied for convenient handling of the thermal force term in the governing equation. Simulations of several well-established natural convection flows containing complex conjugate interfaces are performed to validate the GC-DUGKS. The results demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of the present method for conjugate heat transfer problems.},

  abstract     = {Image deblurring is an important pre-processing step in image analysis. The research for efficient image deblurring methods is still a great challenge. Most of the currently used methods are based on integer-order derivatives, but they typically lead to texture elimination and staircase effects. To overcome these drawbacks, some researchers have proposed fractional-order derivative-based models. However, the existing fractional-order derivative-based models only exploit nonlocal smoothness of spatial dimensions and fail to consider the other dimensional information for three-dimensional (3D) images. To address this issue, we propose a three-dimensional fractional total variation (3DFTV) based-model for 3D image deblurring problem. In this paper, we mathematically formulate the proposed model under the tensor algebra. Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve our model. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model against comparing models in terms of quality metrics and visual effects.},

First, the original equation is transformed into an equivalent system with quadratic energy conservation law by the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach. Then the exponential time difference Runge-Kutta (ETDRK) method is applied to the semi-discrete SAV reformulation which conserves semi-discrete quadratic energy conservation law. Different from the standard ETDRK method, an additional differential equation of the auxiliary variable is introduced by the SAV reformulation, therefore, special treatments are requisite to maintain the accuracy of the ETDRK method and thus obtain high-order scheme. Finally, the energy preservation is achieved by the projection technique which is completely explicit because of the quadratization of the energy. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is more effective than other comparison methods.},

Unavailability of totally effective vaccination and proper treatment regimen forces to employ a non-pharmaceutical way of disease mitigation. The world is in desperate demand of useful control intervention to combat the deadly virus. This manuscript introduces a new mathematical model that addresses two different diagnosis efforts and isolation of confirmed cases. The basic reproductive number, R 0 , R0, is inspected, and the model’s dynamical characteristics are also studied. We found that with the condition R 0 &lt; 1 , R0&amp;lt;1, the disease can be eliminated from the system. Further, we fit our proposed model system with cumulative confirmed cases of six Indian states, namely, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi and West Bengal. Sensitivity analysis carried out to scale the impact of different parameters in determining the size of the epidemic threshold of R 0 R0 . It reveals that unidentified symptomatic cases result in an underestimation of R 0 R0 whereas, diagnosis based on new contact made by confirmed cases can gradually reduce the size of R 0 R0 and hence helps to mitigate the ongoing disease. An optimal control problem is framed using a control variable u ( t ) , u(t), projecting the effectiveness of diagnosis based on traced contacts made by a confirmed COVID patient. It is noticed that optimal contact tracing effort reduces R 0 R0 effectively over time.},

One novelty of the work comes from the numerical treatment of the non-linear convective term in the PDE. Thus, we use the Bermdez-Moreno algorithm to deal with this non-linear term. This duality algorithm is based on the Yosida regularization of non-linear maximal monotone operators. In order to solve the obtained linearized problem, we use numerical methods based on semi-Lagrangian schemes in the direction without diffusion while we consider an implicit second order finite differences scheme in the direction with diffusion term. Finally, we show illustrative results of the performance of the proposed model and numerical methods that have been implemented.},

Therefore, there is a close correlation between social events and network evolution.

The change point detection method is applied to capture the “shocks” of social events on the network structure. Then, the patterns of structural changes are analyzed based on the theory of community evolution. Experiments on two cases illustrate that social events are significant milestones to promote the development of social networks. And the mesostructure is the intermediary connecting evolving network and social events.},

The majority of drugs are eliminated at first order kinetics with a nonconstant elimination rate due to spontaneous erratic variations in the metabolic processes and individual difference. Noting the paradox of stochastic pharmacokinetic models, this paper proposes an uncertain pharmacokinetic model for mono-compartmental drugs administered with intravenous administration based on uncertain differential equations . Uncertainty distributions, expected values and confidence intervals of the half-life and the area under the curve are provided. For this method to achieve its full potential, this paper derives moment estimations for unknown parameters in this uncertain pharmacokinetic model. Finally a numerical example and a real data analysis illustrate our methods.},

First, according to practical situation, the discrete-time heterogeneous multi-unmanned system composed of unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicle is given. Then, by using switching directed topology, the distributed state feedback control strategies are proposed for the leaders and followers. An l 2 − l ∞ l2−l∞ performance index is introduced to guarantee the tracking performance of the heterogeneous multi-unmanned system under the unknown energy-bounded disturbance. The controller gains of the leaders and followers are solved by a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

In this paper, we adapt the new strategy to PDEs that are not in Kovalevskaya form and to systems of PDEs. The Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equation and a system equivalent to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation are used as benchmarks, showing that the strategy yields conservative schemes which are robust and highly accurate compared to others in the literature.},

First, in order to deal with the partly unmeasurable states, matched uncertainties and actuator faults with the loss of effectiveness and bias, a distributed fault estimation observer (DFEO) is designed based on the functional observer with an adaptive compensator. Then, a distributed fault-tolerant controller (DFTCr) is designed to compensate faults effect on the interconnected CPSs based on the integral sliding mode control (SMC) technique, which ensures that the closed-loop systems reach a given boundedness in a predefined finite time. Moreover, some sufficient conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities are proposed to guarantee the finite-time boundedness with H ∞ H∞ performance (FTB- H ∞ H∞ ). Due to introducing more degrees of freedom of the functional observer, the designed finite-time distributed fault-tolerant controller is more flexible and less conservative. Finally, a numerical simulation on the three-machine power systems is acquired to show the validity of the proposed method.},

A series of numerical analyses are conducted to determine the kernel function of the proposed model with the best performance, and the good agreement between the model predictions and test results is observed. With the advantage of introducing the fractional flow rule, the fractional creep model exhibits higher accuracy and convenience than conventional models as fewer material parameters and state variables are required. Furthermore, a parameter study reveals that the fractional order directly relates to the stress level, and the different deformation patterns of soft soil under low and high stresses could be reflected by the tendency of the order.},

  abstract     = {This work introduces a novel algorithm that automatically produces computer code for the calculation of sparse symbolical Jacobian matrices. More precisely, given the code for computing a function f f depending on a set of state (independent) variables x , x, where the code makes use of intermediate algebraic (auxiliary) variables a ( x ) , a(x), the algorithm automatically produces the code for the symbolic computation of the matrix J = ∂ f / ∂ x J=∂f/∂x in sparse representation. A remarkable feature of the algorithm developed is that it can deal with iterative definitions of the functions preserving the iterative representation during the whole process up to the final Jacobian computation code. That way, in presence of arrays of functions and variables, the computational cost of the code generation and the length of the generated code does not depend on the size of those arrays. This feature is achieved making use of Set–Based Graph representation. The main application of the algorithm is the simulation of large scale dynamical systems with implicit Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers like CVODE-BDF, whose performance are greatly improved when they are invoked using a sparse Jacobian matrix. However, the algorithm can be used in a more general context for solving large systems of nonlinear equations . The paper, besides introducing the algorithm, discusses some aspects of its implementation in a general purpose ODE solver front-end and analyzes some results obtained.},

  abstract     = {Avoiding social dilemmas requires that some partners forgo partial or complete benefits to help one another within a cooperative system. Although recognitions and memories with social partners could help these altruistic agents obtain a reward, either immediately or in the future, thus avoiding social dilemmas. However, a state of complete information is often not possible. In this paper, we introduced a super-rational aspiration induced strategy updating in an asymmetric prisoner&#39;s dilemma game, where agents adjust their strategies in line with their payoffs and aspirations. If their payoffs from a strategy reach or exceed the aspiration level, which may be rational or super-rational, they retain their strategies. Otherwise, they imitate another agent&#39;s strategy. This updating rule focuses on satisficing rather than optimizing and does not require agents to have additional information from the strategic environment, which is thus considered to be spontaneous. We modeled this mechanism in different spatial settings. The simulation and analytical results show that the high degrees of super-rationality and asymmetry are more effective in promoting cooperation among agents. This suggests that super-rational aspiration induced strategy updating in the asymmetric prisoner&#39;s dilemma game could be a novel rule to maintain cooperative interaction among egoistic agents.},

  abstract     = {Interventions from third parties, such as governmental agencies or organizations, play an important role in mitigating conflicts in modern human societies. The goal thereby is to pacify disputants, although this is subject to failure on account of self-interest from all involved. To study how relationships between disputants and third parties evolve, we propose an interdependent network model, where one layer is occupied by disputants and the other layer is occupied by third parties. Disputants play a prisoner’s dilemma game, where defection is the dominant strategy, whereas third parties play a snowdrift game, where cooperation and defection coexist more commonly. Moreover, third parties have the ability to mediate a conflict on the other layer by enforcing a snowdrift game onto disputants, for which they can receive a fee. We show that third party interventions improve the evolution of cooperation between disputants, and also, that the improvement of cooperation in turn promotes interventions. Nonetheless, non-intervention does not go extinct, which enables defectors to survive, thus creating a feedback loop between the two networks layers. The evolutionary dynamics is characterized by fascinating spatial pattern formation, which we explore by means of Monte Carlo simulations and via replicator equations.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the issue of dissipative asynchronous and resilient filter design for singular Markov jump linear parameter-varying (SMJLPV) systems against deception attacks under the dynamic event-triggered transmission protocol. Firstly, an improved dynamic event-triggered transmission protocol is provided to further relieve the channel congestion caused by the bandwidth limited communication network. Then, the deception attack, which can potentially destroy the integrity of the system, is modelled as a random variable satisfying Bernoulli distribution. Since the filter cannot identify the original system mode accurately, the hidden-Markov-model (HMM) is established to describe the phenomenon that two modes are out of synchronization . By augmenting the states of the original system and the filter, the filtering error systems are converted into SMJLPV systems with partially known transition rates (TRs). Based on the parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities (PDLMIs), a cooperative design technique for the asynchronous filter and the weighting matrix of the dynamic event-triggered transmission protocol is proposed. Lastly, a numerical instance and a resistance-inductance-capacitance (RLC) switch circuit system are employed to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

The Bouc–Wen model is first introduced to capture the output hysteresis phenomenon. The variable-transformed method is employed to resolve the problem that x 1 x1 cannot be available for measurement because of the output hysteresis. Furthermore, for the sake of conquering the output hysteresis constraint, the adaptive backstepping control and ln-type barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) are combined in a unified framework, which can guarantee the prescribed constraint of the tracking error. In addition, the Nussbaum function is used to deal with the unknown control gain problem (UCGP). Basing on the new finite-time stability criterion, an adaptive finite time controller is constructed, which can ensure that the closed-loop system is segi-global practical finite-time stability (SGPFS). The system states remain in the defined compact sets and the output constraint is not violated. Finally, the simulation is implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

We present a method for general interval matrices as well as its modification for symmetric interval matrices. In the second part of the paper, we apply the spectral decomposition to computing powers of interval matrices, which is our second goal. Numerical results suggest that a simple binary exponentiation is more efficient for smaller exponents, but our approach becomes better when computing higher powers or powers of a special type of matrices. In particular, we consider symmetric interval and circulant interval matrices. In both cases we utilize some properties of the corresponding classes of matrices to make the power computation more efficient.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, vaccination is the most effective way to control the epidemic spreading. In this paper, an epidemic SEIRV (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed -vaccinated) model and an evolutionary game model are established to analyze the difference between mandatory vaccination method and voluntary vaccination method on heterogeneous networks. Firstly, we divide the population into four categories, including susceptible individuals, exposed individuals, infected individuals and removed individuals. Based on the mean field approximation theory, differential equations are developed to characterize the changes of the proportions of the four groups over time under mandatory vaccination. Then through the analysis of the differential equations, the disease-free equilibrium point (DFE) and the endemic disease equilibrium point (EDE) are obtained. Also, the basic reproduction number is obtained by the next-generation matrix method and the stability analysis of the equilibrium points is performed. Next, by considering factors such as vaccination cost, treatment cost and government subsidy rate, differential equations are established to represent the change of vaccination rate over time. By analyzing the final vaccination coverage rate, we can get the minimum vaccination cost to make infectious disease disappear. Finally, the Monte Carlo method is used for numerical simulation to verify the results obtained from the theoretical analysis. Using the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic data from Wuhan, China, the experimental results show that when the effectiveness rate of vaccination is 0.75, the vaccination cost is not higher than 0.886 so that the vaccination strategy can be spread among the population. If mandatory vaccination is adopted, the minimum vaccination rate is 0.146.},

  abstract     = {This paper clarifies the difference between intrinsically 0–1 data and binarized numerical data for Boolean logical patterns and strengthens mathematical results and methods from the literature on Pareto-optimal LAD patterns. Toward this end, we select suitable pattern definitions from the literature and adapt them with attention given to unique characteristics of individual patterns and the disparate natures of Boolean and numerical data. Next, we propose a set of revised criteria and definitions by which useful LAD patterns are clearly characterized for both 0–1 and real-valued data. Furthermore, we fortify recent pattern generation optimization models and demonstrate how earlier results on Pareto-optimal patterns can be adapted in accordance with revised pattern definitions. A numerical study validates practical benefits of the results of this paper through optimization-based pattern generation experiments.},

  abstract     = {This work completes and extends the Ref. Tchakoutio Nguetcho et al. (2017), in which we have focused our attention only on the dynamic behavior of gap soliton solutions of the anharmonic Klein-Gordon model immersed in a parameterized on-site substrate potential. We expand our work now inside the permissible frequency band. These considerations have crucial effects on the response of nonlinear excitations that can propagate along this model. Moreover, working in the allowed frequency band is not only interesting from a physical point of view, it also provides an extraordinary mathematical model, a new class of differential equations possessing vital parameters and vertical singular straight lines. The dynamics around these singularities gives new informations of great interest, such as to better understand the break up (rupture) of a stretched polymer chain by pulling and its relation to soliton destruction and which until now had no mathematical explanations yet. The mathematical model of the differential equation we obtain corresponds, as an equivalent experimental model, to the nonlinear transmission electrical line introduced in 2009 in Ref. Yemélé and Kenmogné(2009), whose equations were corrected but not entirely resolved in 2016 in Ref. Yamgoué and Pelap(2016). Our dynamic study thus presents a theoretical prediction for their experimental set up. An extensive account of the bifurcation theory for modulated-wave propagation is given. By investigating the dynamical behavior and bifurcations of solutions of the planar dynamical systems , we not only make a total inventory of the solutions that can include such differential equations, but we derive a variety of exotic solutions corresponding to each phase trajectories as well as their different conditions of existence.},

  abstract     = {The condition for strong ellipticity of the equilibrium equations plays a significant role in the theory of elasticity. For isotropic elastic materials and anisotropic linearly elastic materials, identification of the strong ellipticity conditions for the corresponding equilibrium equations has been discussed in many references and obtained some equivalent checkable criteria. But for general nonlinearly elastic materials, it is hardly possible to give checkable equivalent criteria for the strong ellipticity condition of the associated equilibrium equations. In 2009, Qi et al. pointed that the strong ellipticity condition of the equilibrium equations can be equivalently transformed into the strong ellipticity condition of partially symmetric tensors. In this paper, using the M-eigenvalues of partially symmetric tensors, we give some easily computable and verifiable sufficient conditions for the strong ellipticity of partially symmetric tensors. Based on these criteria, some direct algorithms for identifying the strong ellipticity condition of partially symmetric tensors are derived. Numerical examples show that the proposed criteria are efficient in identifying the strong ellipticity condition of the equilibrium equations, especially for general nonlinearly elastic materials.},

  abstract     = {Shape is an important visual characteristic in representing an object, and it is also an important part of human visual information. Shape recognition is an important research direction in pattern recognition and image understanding. However, it is a difficult problem to extract discriminative and robust shape descriptors in shape recognition. This is because there are very large deformations in the shape, such as geometric changes, intra-class variations, and nonlinear deformations. These factors directly influence the accuracy of shape recognition. To deal with the influence of these factors on the performance of shape recognition and enhance the accuracy of recognition, we present a novel shape description method called invariant multiscale triangle feature (IMTF) for robust shape recognition. This method uses two types of invariant triangle features to obtain the shape features of an object, and it can effectively combine the boundary and the interior characteristics of a shape, and hence can increase the distinguish ability of the shape. We conducted an extensive experimental analysis on some shape benchmarks. The results indicate that our method can achieve high recognition accuracy. The superiority of our method has been further demonstrated in comparison to the state-of-the-art shape descriptors.},

It is an important extension of the classical Turán number ex ( n , H ) , ex(n,H), which is the maximum number of edges in a graph with n n vertices that does not contain H H as a subgraph. In this paper, we consider the maximum number of edges in an even-cycle-free subgraph of the doubled Johnson graphs J ( n ; k , k + 1 ) , J(n;k,k+1), which are bipartite subgraphs of hypercube graphs. We give an upper bound for ex ( J ( n ; k , k + 1 ) , C 2 r ) ex(J(n;k,k+1),C2r) with any fixed k ∈ Z + k∈Z+ and any n ∈ Z + n∈Z+ with n ≥ 2 k + 1 . n≥2k+1.

  abstract     = {As a way to induce cooperation more effectively, positive incentives have emerged in social species forefront to negative incentives. To assess their effects in cooperation networks, we simulated a social scenario in which reward behaviors are dispensed unilaterally. To do so, we let evolve asymmetric rewards within two specular, interdependent networks, whose individuals in an upper layer have the right to reward corresponding players displaying, likewise, cooperative or defective behavior in the lower layer. With this setup, rewarded players in the lower layer can obtain a payoff equivalent to the amount of the cost of granting reward from the upper layer. Peculiarly, we find that cooperators survive for larger reward values regardless of how high the temptation to defect is. Notably, cooperators in the upper network thrive even if the temptation to defect is pretty high. By further analyzing the nature of social interactions, we find that defection is the winning strategy when rewards originated pro-socially, and that cooperation instead wins by invading the whole system when rewards originated anti-socially. These results are consistent when crosschecked to a theoretical analysis here purposely drawn up. Our work highlights the need of including complex network structures when analyzing asymmetric incentives in the evolution of cooperation, both in human and non-human species.},

Given observations over time of a set of correlated variables, it is assumed that these variables are components of vectors tangent to a real differentiable manifold. Each vector belongs to the tangent space at a point on the manifold, and the collection of all vectors forms a path on the manifold, parametrized by time. We compute a manifold connection such that this path is a geodesic. The future of the path can then be computed by solving the geodesic equations subject to appropriate boundary conditions.

  abstract     = {In social dilemmas cooperators pay costs for other individuals to receive benefits, whereas defectors are the benefactors but do not provide anything in return. What is more, except in the snowdrift game, defective strategies are evolutionarily stable against invasion by cooperative strategies under strong selection. It is thus of interest to determine under which conditions the spontaneous emergence of cooperation is possible in a population consisting entirely of defectors. To that effect, we here want to concentrate on exploring how expulsion influences the emergent dynamics of cooperation in the context of the spatial social dilemmas. Interestingly, expulsion can indeed support the emergence of cooperators for all classes of social dilemma games. By analyzing the spatial expansion and invasion processes of cooperative individuals, we further reveal that merely a 1 × 2 1×2 (or 2 × 1 2×1 ) cluster of expulsive cooperators, introduced for example by means of mutations, is required for invading and completely dominating a spatial population of expulsive defectors provided that the cost of cooperation is no larger than a constant value.},

  abstract     = {The present study deals with a thermal analysis of porous fins subjected to internal heat generation, convection, and radiation energy transfer considering an actual system of analysis under the moving condition of the fin. The main aspiration to carryout this analysis is to establish a correct approach to derive the governing equation for energy transfer in porous fins. The physical explanation was given to require the modification of all existing analyses of porous fins to exchange heat with the surroundings. Three types of fins, namely longitudinal, annular, and spine, have been analyzed with the common mathematical expressions. The temperature distribution in fins has been obtained by employing the differential transform method for solving a high class nonlinear governing equation for all temperature dependent design variables adopted to develop an actual case study. The present approximate analytical method has been authenticated by the numerical technique based on the finite difference method . An excellent agreement of results between these two analyses has been investigated. Unlike all the published works allied with the porous fin, the present work establishes a correct thermal analysis with the key parameter porosity. A clear demonstration has been discussed to distinguish between the solid and porous fins which can be only conjunction with the porosity. The present method of analysis is equally suited for the solid fin also considering only the zero value of porosity to convert the porous fin into a solid fin directly. An optimization study has also been carried out for the maximization of heat transfer rate for a given volume of the solid fraction of a porous fin. The optimum results indicate that under a given design condition, there is an optimum value of porosity for which the heat transfer rate attains a maximum and it is always higher than the solid fin. Therefore, the enhancement of heat transfer can be significantly done by using porous fins for a constant volume of solid or weight of a fin. Finally, the results have been presented in a direction adopted to clearly visualize the superiority of the present study over that of the existing analyses, and to exhibit a difference between solid and porous fins.},

CAEX approach was tested in the construction of covering arrays of order three and strength two. The CAEX approach’s performance was evident by the definition of new upper-bounds in the size of some covering arrays; 34 new upper bounds for covering arrays were defined, remarkably a covering array with 112,770 parameters only requires 50 rows. One important goodness of the CAEX approach is that it can provide the genealogy of each covering array (how each covering arrays was constructed).},

  abstract     = {In this paper a new hybrid semi-implicit finite volume / finite element (FV/FE) scheme is presented for the numerical solution of the compressible Euler and Navier–Stokes equations at all Mach numbers on unstructured staggered meshes in two and three space dimensions . The chosen grid arrangement consists of a primal simplex mesh composed of triangles or tetrahedra , and an edge-based / face-based staggered dual mesh. The governing equations are discretized in conservation form. The nonlinear convective terms of the equations, as well as the viscous stress tensor and the heat flux, are discretized on the dual mesh at the aid of an explicit local ADER finite volume scheme, while the implicit pressure terms are discretized at the aid of a continuous P 1 P1 finite element method on the nodes of the primal mesh. In the zero Mach number limit, the new scheme automatically reduces to the hybrid FV/FE approach forwarded in [1] for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. As such, the method is asymptotically consistent with the incompressible limit of the governing equations and can therefore be applied to flows at all Mach numbers. Due to the chosen semi-implicit discretization , the CFL restriction on the time step is only based on the magnitude of the flow velocity and not on the sound speed , hence the method is computationally efficient at low Mach numbers. In the chosen discretization, the only unknown is the scalar pressure field at the new time step. Furthermore, the resulting pressure system is symmetric and positive definite and can therefore be very efficiently solved with a matrix-free conjugate gradient method . In order to assess the capabilities of the new scheme, we show computational results for a large set of benchmark problems that range from the quasi incompressible low Mach number regime to compressible flows with shock waves.},

In addition, the slow state variables feedback (SSVF) controller gain is obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

  abstract     = {Extrapolation cascadic multigrid (EXCMG) method with the conjugate gradient smoother is shown to be an efficient solver for large sparse symmetric positive definite systems resulting from linear finite element discretization of second-order elliptic boundary value problems [Pan et al. J. Comput. Phys. 344 (2017) 499–515]. In this paper, we generalize the EXCMG method to solve a class of spatial fractional diffusion equations (SFDEs) with variable coefficients. Both steady-state and time-dependent problems are considered. First of all, space-fractional derivatives defined in Riemann–Liouville sense are discretized by using the weighted average of shifted Grünwald formula, which results in a fully dense and nonsymmetric linear system for the steady-state problem, or a semi-discretized ODE system for the time-dependent problem. Then, to solve the former problem, we propose the EXCMG method with the biconjugate gradient stabilized smoother to deal with the dense and nonsymmetric linear system. Next, such technique is extended to solve the latter problem since it becomes fully discrete when the Crank-Nicolson scheme is introduced to handle the temporal derivative. Finally, several numerical examples are reported to show that the EXCMG method is an efficient solver for both steady-state and time-dependent SFDEs, and performs much better than the V-cycle multigrid method with banded-splitting smoother for time-dependent SFDEs [Lin et al.

A more representative faulty plant is considered, where unknown additive sensor and process faults, the Lipschitzian disturbance in state dynamics, and the external composite disturbance in the measured output exist simultaneously. Compared to some existing actuator models, a more representative actuator fault model is given, where some bounded conditions of the degradation and the additive fault are canceled. The actuator empirical efficiency is also introduced to estimate the time-varying actuator degradation. An important highlight is the extension of the Lyapunov terminal sliding mode (TSM) condition of finite-time stability into descriptor switched systems, where the method of average dwell time (ADT) is considered. A novel adaptive sliding mode observer is developed by constructing an augmented system model, and the relevant rank conditions are proved. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed observer, a descriptor switched circuit system is simulated under different control inputs and various actuator fault models. It can be seen that the TSM finite-time state and fault observer acquires the fast and accurate estimation of the targeted vector.},

The design objective is to maintain the acceptable flight quality at a high angle-of-attack under the influence of unknown disturbance and aerodynamics uncertainties. The nonlinear dynamics of F16 aircraft are divided into two loops by utilizing time-scale separation principle and adaptive ISM/NDI controller is designed for each loop. The aerodynamics coefficients are estimated using the iterative reweighted least square (IRLS) algorithm based on the wind tunnel real-time flight data available at NASA Langlet and Ame Research center. The internal dynamics stability is proven to validate the complete system stability .

However, the large amount of memory involved in computing and storing the entire kernel matrix makes it difficult for kernel-based clustering to handle large-scale datasets. In this study, we prove that an incomplete Cholesky factorization (InCF) can generate an approximate matrix with rank s s for a kernel matrix after s s iterations. We also show that the approximation error decreases exponentially as the number of iterations increases when the exponential decay of the kernel matrix eigenvalues is sufficiently fast. We therefore employ InCF to accelerate kernel clustering and save memory space. The key idea of the proposed kernel k k -means clustering using InCF is that the entire kernel matrix is approximated as the product of a low-rank matrix and its transpose. Then, linear k k -means clustering is applied to the columns of the transpose of the low-rank matrix. We prove that the clustering error achieved by this method decreases exponentially as the rank of the approximate matrix increases. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is similar to that of the kernel k k -means clustering algorithm, but the method can be applied to large-scale datasets.},

  abstract     = {The present article’s primary goal is to analyze entropy generation on unsteady three dimensional thermally radiating magnetohydrodynamic flow of Casson nanofluid past a vertical stretching sheet embedded in a non-Darcy porous medium under the influence of mixed convection, Hall current, viscous dissipation , Ohmic heating, and heat generation. The combined effects of Brownian motion and thermophoretic diffusion are taken into consideration, and the impact of the chemical reaction initiated by activation energy is also incorporated in the flow-field. A mathematical model of the physical problem containing highly nonlinear coupled partial differential equations with convective boundary conditions is developed. Suitable similarity transformation is applied to convert the governing highly nonlinear coupled partial differential equations into nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations , and then the resulting nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations are numerically solved with the help of the spectral quasi-linearization method. A detailed investigation is performed to illustrate the impact of several pertinent flow parameters on the velocity, temperature, concentration, entropy generation and Bejan number profiles. In contrast, the numerical values of skin friction coefficients in x x and z z directions, local Nusselt number , and local Sherwood number are presented in tabular forms for varying values of pertinent flow parameters. Apart from this, linear and quadratic multiple regression analyses for the physical quantities of engineering interest have been executed to upgrade the present model’s efficiency and application in various industrial and engineering processes. With a variation in magnetic parameter, the maximum relative errors in the linear regression estimates for the skin- friction coefficients in x x and z z directions are found to be 2.28–2.37% and 0.85–1.72%, respectively. Besides, due to the enhancement in magnetic parameter, the maximum relative errors in the quadratic regression estimations for the reduced Nusselt number N u x R e x − 1 / 2 NuxRex−1/2 and the reduced Sherwood number S h x R e x − 1 / 2 ShxRex−1/2 are 0.56 % − 0.58 % 0.56%−0.58% and 0.30 % , 0.30%, respectively. It is observed that the error of each solution of the present physical problem approaches to be less than 10 − 8 10−8 in mere six iterations. Moreover, the findings of the current research work signify that the Brownian motion and thermophoretic diffusion minimize entropy generation adjacent to the sheet; on the contrary, activation energy intensifies entropy generation rate closer to the sheet. Furthermore, the appropriate resemblance is obtained through verifying the present results with previous existing results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a collocation technique based on Haar wavelet is developed for the solution of delay fractional order differential equations (FODEs). The developed technique is applied to both nonlinear and linear delay FODEs. The Haar technique reduces the given equations to a system of nonlinear and linear algebraic equations . The derived nonlinear system is solved by Broyden’s technique while the linear system is solved by Gauss elimination technique. Some examples are taken from literature for checking the validation and convergence of the Haar collocation technique. The comparison of approximate and exact solution are given in figures. The mean square root and maximum absolute errors for distant number of grid points are calculated. The results show that Haar wavelet collocation technique (HWCT) is easy and efficient for solving delay type FODEs. Fractional derivative is described in the Caputo sense throughout the paper.},

We here derive the stability conditions for the controller and observer gains using asynchronous dynamical system (ADS) formulation of the networked control system (NCS) in discrete time which yields a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The control design has been validated on two test-bench energy systems viz. battery with DC/DC converter and synchronous generator with power system stabilizer. Numerical simulations report the joint observer and controller&#39;s performance in the presence of random packet drops within output feedback control scheme using PI/PID controllers and employing state estimation for the battery and synchronous generator systems. The major numerical challenge includes handling nonconvex constraints in LMIs and stabilizing the observer-based controller with specified rate of packet dropouts. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to compare the uncertain state trajectories, state estimation errors and control efforts under different probability of packet dropouts for the two test-bench energy systems.},

The case that the communication network of multi-agent systems only contains a directed spanning tree is considered. Subsequently, we conduct a precise analysis of frequency and duration of denial of service attacks. Then, we regard the multi-agent system suffering from the invalid denial of service attack as a multi-agent system with switching topology, and adopt the control method of dealing with the switching topology to reduce the impact of invalid denial of service attacks on the multi-agent system. In addition, we propose a event-triggered resilient control mechanism, which enables multi-agent systems to reach consensus at an exponentially convergent speed, and prevents multi-agent systems from Zeno behavior, thereby avoiding continuous communication between agents. A simulation example is given to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis.},

The fractional time derivative of the Caputo method and the fractional derivative of the velocity and temperature of the viscoelastic fluid are calculated using the finite difference numerical method by combining the L-1 algorithm. The effect of various factors such as parameters of velocity and temperature fraction derivative (α and β), buoyancy force, step length, and Prandtl number on velocity profile, the temperature of the viscoelastic fluid, Nusselt number and friction coefficient on a vertical forward-facing step are investigated. Numerical results show that with increasing α, β and step length, the coefficient of friction increases and also decreases with increasing Prandtl. With increasing α , the average Nusselt value decreases, and with increasing β, Prandtl, and step length increases. It is also observed that the thickness of the momentum and thermal boundary layer in viscoelastic fluids is higher than that of the Newtonian fluid boundary layer.},

By converting the governing equations into a first-order systems of differential equations, the approximate solution is sought in a piecewise discontinuous polynomial space while the natural upwind fluxes are used at element interfaces. The existence-uniqueness of the weak formulation is provided and the numerical stability of the method in the L ∞ L∞ norm is established. Five illustrative test problems are given to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the scheme. Comparisons between the numerical results of the proposed method with existing results are carried out in order to show that the new approximation algorithm provides accurate solutions even near the singular point.},

The reliability and applicability of the proposed method are demonstrated herein through the solution of some illustrative problems, including the vibration problems of thin and thick rectangular plates. The simulations have been done for plates with different boundary conditions including the simply supported, clamped, and free boundary conditions.

  abstract     = {The paper centers on the investigating the FT (finite-time) rate anti-bump switching control problem for switched systems. The aim is to propose a switching control scheme to alleviate the undesirable big jumps in the system rate at switching points while achieving the disturbance restrain in FT. An improved definition of the rate anti-bump switching property is presented, measuring the alleviation level on the rate bumps just at switching points. A condition is captured to drive the rate anti-bump switching property and the disturbance restrain property. A switching control technique is developed by constructing a switching law combined with a switching controller to force that the FT rate anti-bump switching control issue is solvable. A verification example is served to display the reasonability of the developed theory.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of treatment-induced acquired resistance is considered one of the most significant challenges in managing typhoid infection. A deterministic nonlinear mathematical model describing the transmission dynamics of antimicrobial-resistant typhoid infection is developed and analyzed. The basic reproduction number is computed for the model. The condition for the existence of possible equilibria and their stability has been discussed. The sensitivity analysis shows that the direct transmission rates of two strains and the consumption rate of bacteria in environmental transmission strongly impacts the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 . The parameter p , p, related to treatment-induced acquired resistance, does not affect R 0 , R0, but numerical simulations reveal that it enhances the load of resistant strain in a co-existence equilibrium state. Although the resistant strain has lower transmissibility than the sensitive strain, the resistant strain alone can persist in a community due to re-infection. The study suggests that access to safe drinking water combined with improved sanitation and hygiene practices can reduce the emergence and global spread of antimicrobial-resistant S. Typhi strains.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous traffic flow model such as mixes of trucks and cars or connected and regular vehicles is a central issue in traffic flow modeling. However, few researches focus on the bifurcation phenomena of heterogeneous traffic flow. Due to this point, a novel heterogeneous continuum model accounting for different ratios of multiple optimal velocity functions is proposed, in which electronic throttle angle changes with memory is also considered. A simple formula for the linear stability criterion of this improved model is theoretically deduced, and the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers (KdV-Burgers) equation is derived to discuss the characteristics of density evolution through nonlinear analysis method. The conditions and stability of the Hopf bifurcation for the modified model are then proved minutely. Numerical simulations are executed to investigate how multiple maximum velocities, multiple safety spacings and electronic throttle angle changes with memory affect the density fluctuations, in which numerical experiments on fuel consumptions and emissions are also included. To address the problems mentioned above, we set the Hopf bifurcation as the initial point of the heterogeneous continuum traffic flow to analyze the evolution of bifurcation behavior in the heterogeneous traffic flow.},

  abstract     = {In real life , individuals tend to be self-interested. The defectors exploit the cooperators for high payoffs, and the cooperators take defensive measures to reduce their own losses. Since the defensive behavior of cooperators is affected by environmental factors, this paper proposes an environmental-based defensive game model in the well-mixed population. Theoretical analysis shows that when cooperators do not have the defensive awareness, all the individuals choose defection. When cooperators have defensive awareness, the cooperators can survive in the fierce competition, so as to realize the stable coexistence of cooperation and defection. If all the cooperators have defensive awareness, the system can reach an evolutionary stable state of full cooperation. Through abundant numerical calculations, it is found that when the temptation is small and the defensive probability is large, the cooperation fraction is significantly affected by the threshold. Furthermore, the stronger the defensive awareness, the higher the cooperation fraction. As long as there are cooperators in the population who take defensive measures, a state of full defection can be avoided. Reducing the defensive cost and increasing the defensive benefit as well as the defensive loss are conducive to enhance cooperation level. In a word, defensive behavior promotes cooperation, which provides a new perspective for understanding the emergence of cooperation.},

This model describes many natural processes, such as thermal conduction for different media and fluid evolution in soils and rocks. The proposed method approximates the unknown solution with the help of two main stages. At a first stage, the time discretization is performed by means of a second-order finite difference procedure. At a second stage, the space discretization is accomplished using the local radial basis function partition of unity collocation method based on the finite difference (LRBF-PUM-FD). The major disadvantage of global techniques is the high computational burden of solving large linear systems. The LRBF-PUM-FD significantly sparsifies the linear system and reduces the computational burden, while simultaneously maintaining a high accuracy level. The time-discrete formulation is studied in terms of the stability and convergence analysis via the energy method. Three examples are illustrated to verify the efficiency and accuracy of the method.},

Its goal is to find an optimal spectral subset, from a large spectral library, to properly model the mixed pixels in hyperspectral images. Sparse unmixing via variable splitting augmented Lagrangian and total variation (SUnSAL-TV) incorporates a TV regularizer into sparse unmixing, achieving a promising unmixing performance. Note that, SUnSAL-TV is solved by the framework of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). In this paper, we first propose a weighted collaborative sparse unmixing via TV model, named as WCSU-TV, for hyperspectral unmixing. Then a two-step iterative strategy, based on ADMM, is designed to solve the proposed model. Its key idea is to compute the current solution by a linear combination of the results of two previous iterates, instead of only using current solution in classic ADMM. Experiments on simulated and real hyperspectral data illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The formation of the patterns of the SKT equation consists of a fast transient phase and a long stationary phase. Reduced order solutions are computed by separating the time into two time-intervals. In numerical experiments, we show for one- and two-dimensional SKT equations with pattern formation, the reduced-order solutions obtained in the time-windowed form, i.e., principal decomposition framework, are more accurate than the global proper orthogonal decomposition solutions obtained in the whole time interval. The finite-difference discretization of the SKT equation in space results in a system of linear-quadratic ordinary differential equations. The ROMs have the same linear-quadratic structure as the full order model. Using the linear-quadratic structure of the ROMs, the computation of the reduced-order solutions is further accelerated by the use of proper orthogonal decomposition in a tensorial framework so that the computations in the reduced system are independent of the full-order solutions. Furthermore, the prediction capabilities of the ROMs are illustrated for one- and two-dimensional patterns. Finally, we show that the entropy is decreasing by the reduced solutions, which is important for the global existence of solutions to the nonlinear cross-diffusion equations such as the SKT equation.},

  abstract     = {Based on the Crank-Nicolson alternating direction implicit finite volume (CN-ADI-FV) discretization of two dimensional Riesz space-fractional diffusion equations (2 D RSFDEs) proposed in [1], a fast direct solver is proposed to obtain the numerical solutions. Linear systems result from the CN-ADI-FV discretization can be treated as two matrix equations with symmetric positive definite (SPD) Toeplitz coefficient matrices. Then numerical solutions, expressed as multiple matrix-vector multiplications involving the inverse of SPD Toeplitz matrices, can be effectively obtained by using Gohberg-Semencul formula (GSF), where the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method is applied as an acceleration technique. Moreover, under certain assumptions, the spectral of the preconditioned matrices of the linear system associated with the GSF are theoretically proved to be clustered around 1. Then the PCG method is verified to converge superlinearly and can be implemented with O ( N log N ) O(NlogN) operations, where N N is the number of spatial unknowns in both x x - and y y - directions. Besides, the PCG method is used only twice in the whole solution process, and the complete solution process can be finished with O ( M N 2 log N ) O(MN2logN) operations and O ( N ) O(N) memory, where M M is the number of temporal unknowns. Numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.},

In addition, the variable spatial grid structures from one time span to the next and the time steps are permitted for this method, which are more suitable to design adaptive algorithm on unstructured mesh. We detailedly give the well-posed analysis of the numerical solution and the a priori error estimation in L ∞ ( H 1 ) L∞(H1) norm without any restrictions on the space-time grid ratio.

  abstract     = {At present, community detection methods are mostly focused on the investigation at unweighted networks. However, real-world networks are always complex, and unweighted networks are not sufficient to reflect the connections among real-world objects. Hence, this paper proposes a community detection algorithm based on a deep sparse autoencoder. First, the second-order neighbors of the nodes are identified, and we can obtain the path weight matrix for the second-order neighbors of the node. We combine the path weight matrix with the weighted adjacent paths of the node to obtain the similarity matrix, which can not only reflect the similarity relationships among connected nodes in the network topology but also the similarity relationships among nodes and second-order neighbors. Then, based on the unsupervised deep learning method, the feature matrix which has a stronger ability to express the features of the network can be obtained by constructing a deep sparse autoencoder. Finally, the K-means algorithm is adopted to cluster the low-dimensional feature matrix and obtain the community structure. The experimental results indicate that compared with 4 typical community detection algorithms, the algorithm proposed here can more accurately identify community structures. Additionally, the results of parameter experiments show that compared with the community structure found by the K-means algorithm, which directly uses the high-dimensional adjacency matrix , the community structure detected by the WCD algorithm in this paper is more accurate.},

Through the direct Taylor expansion method, the proposed LB model can correctly recover the macroscopic equations . The cross diffusion terms in the coupled system are modeled by introducing additional collision operators, which can be used to avoid special treatments for the gradient terms. In addition, the auxiliary source terms are constructed properly such that the numerical diffusion caused by the convection can be eliminated. We adopt the developed LB model to study two important systems, i.e., the coupled chemotaxis-fluid system and the double-diffusive convection system with Soret and Dufour effects. We first test the present LB model through considering a steady-state case of coupled chemotaxis-fluid system, then we analyze the influences of some physical parameters on the formation of sinking plumes. Finally, the double-diffusive natural convection system with Soret and Dufour effects is also studied, and the numerical results agree well with some previous works.},

We use a semi-analytical method as Reproducing kernel Method (RKM) to solve FDDE such that the obtained approximate results are much better than other methods in comparison. The main obstacle to solve this problem is the existence of a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process in the general form of reproducing kernel method, that is very time consuming. So, we introduce a different implementation for the general form of the reproducing kernel method. In this method, the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process is eliminated to significantly reduce the CPU-time. Also, this new method, increases the accuracy of approximate solutions . Due to the increasing accuracy of approximate solutions, we will be able to provide a valid error analysis for this technique. The accuracy of the theoretical results are also illustrated by solving two numerical examples .},

It is concluded that the introduction of multigame is conducive to the enhancement of cooperation, and the coupling between the two sublayers of the network is conditional in favoring cooperation. Moreover, the conclusions are further confirmed in the multigame model including the snowdrift game and the stag hunt game. Since this research framework is closer to reality, we hope that the discussion of the diffusion of cooperation here will provide inspiration for the future research of cooperation in the context of multiple complex environments.},

Nevertheless, two important factors are not considered in the existing works, one is that the asymptomatic state is ignored in many epidemic dynamics, which can significantly affect the awareness and the epidemic dynamics simultaneously. The other is that the self-initiated awareness mechanism is omitted, which addresses that individuals can be altered spontaneously by the infected neighbors rather than just be informed by others. To this arm, we propose a novel coupled epidemic-awareness model in multiplex networks by incorporating these two factors and investigate their impacts on the dynamics of epidemic and awareness. Based on the microscopic Markov chain approach and Monte-Carlo simulation, our findings indicate that the asymptomatic state makes people underestimate the risk of disease, leading to insufficient diffusion of awareness and further inducing the outbreak of epidemic. On the contrary, even though the self-initiated mechanism plays a positive role on the control of epidemic, whose effect is also weakened by the existence of the asymptomatic state. More importantly, a fundamental quantity underlying the spreading dynamics–the epidemic threshold is analytically derived.},

  abstract     = {A signed graph is a pair Γ = ( G , σ ) , where G is a graph, and σ : E ( G ) ⟶ { + 1 , − 1 } is a signature of the edges of G . A signed graph Γ is said to be unbalanced if there exists a cycle in Γ with an odd number of negatively signed edges. In this paper it is presented a linear time algorithm which computes the inertia indices of an unbalanced unicyclic signed graph. Additionally, the algorithm computes the number of eigenvalues in a given real interval by operating directly on the graph, so that the adjacency matrix is not needed explicitly. As an application, the algorithm is employed to check the integrality of some infinite families of unbalanced unicyclic graphs. In particular, the multiplicities of eigenvalues of signed circular caterpillars are studied, getting a geometric characterization of those which are non-singular and sufficient conditions for them to be non-integral. Finally, the algorithm is also used to retrieve the spectrum of bidegreed signed circular caterpillars, none of which turns out to be integral.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a meshless Hermite weighted least-square method is developed to improve the accuracy and stability of the numerical analysis for piezoelectric structures. The basic equations of the piezoelectric structures including the constitutive equation, geometric equations, equilibrium equations and boundary conditions are introduced. The approximate function of the Hermite weighted least-square method is constructed through the Hermite approximation method and weighted least-square method. The collocation method is utilized to derive the discrete equation of the Hermite weighted least-square method for the piezoelectric structures. Furthermore, the influences of the scale parameter and node number on the calculation accuracy of the present method are discussed, and the effectiveness of the present method for analyzing the piezoelectric structures is demonstrated by some numerical examples. The numerical results show that the Hermite weighted least-square method can effectively analyze the piezoelectric structures with various boundary conditions, and has excellent convergence and calculation accuracy.},

This is an example of non-homogeneous hyperbolic systems of conservation laws that admit stationary solutions. We use the strategy developed by the authors in [1] which is to transform the non-homogeneous system into homogeneous writing the source term in divergence form , so that it can be incorporated into the flux vector of the homogeneous system and discretized in the same way. As a result, the source terms are automatically discretized to achieve perfect balance with flux terms, obtaining well-balanced schemes that produce very robust and accurate solutions. Concretely, the mentioned strategy will be used to extend the flux limiter technique [2] and the Harten, Lax and van Leer (HLL) Riemann solver [3] to the quasi-1D flow in ducts of variable cross-section. The numerical results confirm the capacity of these methods to construct well-balanced schemes.},

A ρ ρ -moment of G G at a given vertex u u is defined as M G ρ ( u ) = ∑ v ∈ V ρ ( v ) d i s t ( u , v ) , MGρ(u)=∑v∈Vρ(v)dist(u,v), where d i s t ( . , . ) dist(.,.) stands for the distance function. The ρ ρ -moment of G G is the sum of moments of all vertices in G G . This parameter is closely related to degree distance, Wiener index, Schultz index etc. Motivated by earlier work of Dalf o ´ o´ et al. (2013), we introduce three classes of hereditary graphs by vertex(edge)-grafting operations and give the expressions for computing their ρ ρ -moments, by which we compute the ρ ρ -moments of uniform(non-uniform) cactus chains and derive the order relations of ρ ρ -moments of uniform(non-uniform) cactus chains. Based on these relations, we discuss the extremal value problems of ρ ρ -moments in biphenyl and polycyclic hydrocarbons , and extremal polyphenyl chains, extremal spiro chains etc are given, respectively.

However, there is a numerical instability problem with QEMs because they can only take integer orders, and this problem restricts the performance of QEMs in image reconstruction and noise resistance. In this paper, the concept of fractional order is introduced and incorporated into exponential moments (EMs) and fractional-order exponential moments (FrEMs) are proposed; then the FrEMs are extended to fractional-order quaternion exponential moments (FrQEMs) that are suitable for color images and have better performance than QEMs in noise resistance and image reconstruction; subsequently, it is proved that FrQEMs are invariant to rotation; and finally, the properties of FrQEMs are experimentally analyzed and FrQEMs are used for object recognition. The experimental results show that FrQEMs have very excellent performance in color image reconstruction, high noise resistance, good rotation invariance and object recognition in color images.},

Sufficient conditions on the nonexistence of nonconstant periodic solutions are provided. Bifurcation analysis including Hopf bifurcation and Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation is carried out. The theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations. Numerical simulations reveal the complexity of the dynamical behaviors of the model, which includes the subcritical/supercritical Hopf bifurcation, homoclinic bifurcation, saddle-node bifurcation at a nonhyperbolic periodic orbit , the appearance of two limit cycles with a singular closed orbit, and so on.

The flow and heat transfer model meets the Navier’s slip conditions at the boundary which allows the extremes of no-slipping at the penetrable surface.

Symmetry operators are used to find self-similar transformations which help to perform reduction of the governing nonlinear partial differential equations to different classes of nonlinear ordinary differential equations . Reduced ordinary differential equations, as a result of the implication of symmetry reductions, are solved by employing the general compatibility approach.

In addition, inspired by the SA, the equilibrium equations of plane elasticity of octagonal QCs with Laue class 15 are simplified, which is an open problem.

  abstract     = {Recently, promising clinical advances have been made in the development of antimalarial drugs that block the parasite transmission and also cures the disease and has prophylactic effects, called transmission-blocking drugs (TBDs). The aim of this paper is to develop and analyze a population level compartmental model of human-mosquito interactions that takes into account an intervention using TBDs. We do this by extending the SEIRS-SEI type model to include a class of humans who are undergoing the treatment with TBDs and a class of those who are protected because of successful treatment. Before we proceed with an analysis of the model’s stability and bifurcation behaviours, we start by ensuring that the model is well-posed in a biologically feasible domain . Mathematical analysis indicates that the model exhibits a forward and backward bifurcation under certain conditions. Results from our analysis shows that the effect of treatment rate on reducing reproduction number depends on other key parameters such as the efficacy of the drug. The projections of the validated model show the benefits of using TBDs in malaria control in preventing new cases and reducing mortality. In particular, we find that treating 35 % 35% of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa with a 95 % 95% efficacious TBD from 2021 will result in approximately 82 % 82% reduction on the number of malaria deaths by 2035.},

The method we develop constitutes an improvement on earlier work which involved dropping a spatial grid point at each time step; moreover, we demonstrate that our new approach is able to maintain second-order accuracy for the solution and the numerical scheme , whereas it is in general not even possible to calculate the accuracy for either using the earlier approach.

The security investment made by an enterprise in a network has an impact on its neighbors, but also bears the impact of its neighbors’ security investments. Such individual interaction problems are often modeled as interdependent security games (IDS). In this paper, we study IDS models under three different attack scenarios: the total effort, the weakest link and the best shot. We use evolutionary game theory to explore the dynamics of social payoffs and the average social investments of these three models under different network topologies. The results show that under the total effort model, individuals are more inclined to increase their investments, while under the weakest link and best shot models, individuals choose to minimize their investments due to selfishness. Finally, we study the cluster effect under different network structures and find the threshold at which it exists.},

Actually, the strong Lipschitz condition is assumed that it only relates to the current state, it is difficult to be employed to determine the stability in mean for the UDDEs. In this paper, we propose two kinds of new Lipschitz conditions containing the current state and the past state, which are more weaker than the strong Lipschitz condition.

  abstract     = {Punishment and reward are effective ways to sustain cooperation among selfish groups. Researches show that the ultimate result of selflessness is self-interest. This paper considers that individuals take defensive measures to reduce losses in the face of unknown risks. Defensive cooperators need to pay the defensive cost. When they interact with unconditional defectors, the defensive cooperators gain benefit due to defensive behavior, while the unconditional defectors lose some benefit due to the defense of defensive cooperators. Results show that in the well-mixed population, reducing defensive cost and improving defensive benefit can promote cooperation, and maintain a higher cooperation level unchanged within a larger range of temptation. In the structured population, the three strategies perform the phenomenon of cyclic dominance, that is unconditional cooperators dominate defensive cooperators who dominate unconditional defectors who dominate unconditional cooperators. It is worth noting that both in the well-mixed population and structured population, three strategies have obvious phased advantages with regard to defensive benefit. Lower defensive benefit leads to an advantage for unconditional defectors. If defensive benefit is moderate, the weakened competitiveness of unconditional defectors leads defensive cooperators dominate. And excessive defensive benefit results in the second-order free-rider phenomenon of the unconditional cooperation strategy. In addition, structured population do not always support cooperation better than well-mixed population. When the defensive cost is small and defensive benefit is high, the spatial effect can enhance network reciprocity. More generally, our results prove that defensive self-interested behavior leads to the maintenance of cooperation, which provides a new perspective for understanding the cooperation evolutionary.},

Under this assumption, exactly measured local state variables are unknown during Lyapunov-stability-based recursive control design steps. The primary contributions of this study are (i) to develop a recursive adaptive control design strategy for achieving decentralization of unmatched interconnected nonlinearities using corrupted local state feedback information and (ii) to design a decentralized asynchronous event-triggering mechanism using the corrupted local state variables. To this end, local injection data compensators using neural networks and adaptive tuning laws are designed to compensate for unknown injection data and nonlinear interaction effects. It is shown that the proposed decentralized control system via the corrupted local state feedback ensures the practical stability of the total closed-loop system and the exclusion of Zeno behavior.},

Stability respect to the initial input data is also crucial in applications. The so called PPH nonlinear subdivision scheme is proven to be both convexity preserving and stable. The tighter the stability bound the better controlled is the final output error. In this article a more accurate stability bound is obtained for the nonlinear PPH subdivision scheme for strictly convex data coming from smooth functions.

  abstract     = {Vegetation pattern is caused by local instability in phase space, which can reflect the distribution characteristics of vegetation in the studied space. In semi-arid environment, the vegetation roots will not only absorb the water resources near themselves, but also absorb the water resources in the whole study area, that is to say, the absorption of water resources by vegetation roots is a nonlocal process. Meanwhile, the feedback mechanism of soil-water diffusion plays an important role in the process of water absorption by vegetation roots. However, it is not clear that how the feedback mechanism of nonlocal water absorption by vegetation roots and soil-water diffusion affects vegetation pattern. In this paper, we construct a positive feedback vegetation-water model with nonlocal delay. The instability of Turing pattern is analyzed by analytical method, and the conditions of stable pattern occurrence are obtained. At the same time, we use multi-scale analysis method to obtain the amplitude equation of vegetation-water system. We found that the non-local water absorption intensity of vegetation roots and the feedback of soil-water diffusion can cause the phase change of vegetation pattern. The change of nonlocal water absorption intensity will produce mixed vegetation pattern structure. The enhancement of soil-water diffusion feedback intensity will change the vegetation pattern structure: low density cold spot patterns → → mixed patterns → → high density hot spot patterns. The isolation between vegetation patches will be increased as that nonlocal water absorption intensity is enhanced or the feedback intensity of soil-water diffusion is increased. We also revealed that increasing the feedback intensity of soil water diffusion or nonlocal strength within a certain range is helpful to increase the vegetation density, while excessive feedback intensity or nonlocal strength will induce land desertification.},

Firstly, delayed inertial memristive neural networks (DIMNNs) are characterized as the differential equations, which is second-order and has discontinuous right-hand side. Secondly, a suitable two-parameter variable substitution method is advocated for the second-order derivatives of states, and then DIMNNs can be represented in the shape of first-order differential equation. Thirdly, a new fixed-time criterion and FTS of DIMNNs are achieved under the designed feedback controller in the light of comparison lemma and inequality techniques. Meanwhile, the settling-time (ST) of FTS is estimated, it could be adjusted to arbitrary expected values by controller parameters without relying on the initial conditions and also fully reflects that a tighter ST value is obtained. Finally, the effectiveness of the brought forward theoretical results is testified via a numerical simulation.},

This paper further investigates an extended disk dynamo system having three coupled conducting disks and incorporates the interaction-induced time delay in the dynamic governing equations. By carrying out a comparative analysis, the dynamic behaviors of the coupled three-disk dynamo system with and without time delay are studied to explore novel and complex nonlinear dynamic phenomena in the coupled delayed dynamo system. It is found that the double Hopf bifurcations can be induced in the time-delayed dynamo system. Three different topological structures of the unfolding are obtained under different time delays. Accordingly, it is shown that the novel dynamic behaviors, including quasi-periodic torus, three-dimensional torus and the coexistence of multiple attractors, can appear in the time-delayed dynamo system. Furthermore, by performing the continuation analysis on the periodic orbit generated from the Hopf bifurcation of equilibrium, some new coexistence patterns, e.g., the coexistence of periodic orbits and chaos, the coexistence of quasi-periodic orbits and chaos, are observed in the dynamo system with time delay. Based on the obtained results, it is believed that the inclusion of time delay in the modelling of the three-disk dynamo system is necessary and meaningful for developing an in-depth understanding of dynamo dynamics. Finally, the results of theoretical analyses are verified by the numerical simulations.},

To study the nonlinear stability of DST schemes, a TVD flux limiter is introduced, and it is proven that the overall method is a TVD scheme. The numerical illustrations justify the non-oscillatory behaviour of the developed class of schemes in presence of shocks and discontinuities. It is worth to note that the underlying DST schemes include both of the upwind and symmetric schemes and the resulting TVD DST scheme produce comparable results with the standard non-oscillatory schemes like WENO schemes.},

The accuracy, efficiency and effectiveness of the developed technique mCBCT4 is demonstrated in terms of six different test examples of nonlinear Burgers’ equation by computing the error norms: L 2 L2 and L ∞ L∞ errors. The proposed mCBCT4 scheme is also tested for nonlinear Burger’s equation with very small kinematic viscosities. The proposed mCBCT4 is shown unconditionally stable scheme.

While solving these linear equations with a preconditioned iterative method, the entries with small magnitudes may be insignificant to the preconditioner efficiency. In this paper, we use a filter to remove such small entries in the coefficient matrix while constructing the preconditioner. The proposed filter eliminates the small entries first according to a so-called weak dependence matrix, which relies on the conception of the strength of connections in algebraic multigrid. The preconditioner is then built based on the filtered matrix instead of the original one. Four strategies of filtering out entries are designed and investigated. Numerical results for various model-type problems and two real application problems, i.e., the multi-group radiation diffusion equations and the three temperature energy equations, are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, this paper provides a practical approach to choose a proper parameter in the proposed method, which should help solve linear equation systems of radiation diffusion problems.},

  abstract     = {Area optimization is one of the most important contents of circuit logic synthesis. In logical function expressions, mixed polarity Reed–Muller (MPRM) expansion produces a smaller area than Boolean expansion and fixed polarity Reed–Muller (FPRM) expansion. However, the area optimization for MPRM logic circuits is a combinatorial optimization problem, and the existing area optimization effect of MPRM logic circuits is poor. In this paper, an improved multiple disturbances fireworks algorithm is proposed to solve the combinatorial optimization problem of three-valued variables. Based on the ordinary fireworks algorithm, the algorithm we proposed initializes the individual of the fireworks population by introducing the Latin hypercube sampling model and introduces multiple disturbances in the process of iterative optimization of the population, so that the algorithm takes the global and local search into account, and achieves a good result. Moreover, we propose an MPRM logic circuits area optimization method, which uses the proposed improved multiple disturbances fireworks algorithm to search for the optimal polarity corresponding to MPRM logic circuits with minimum area. An adequate comparative analysis based on different MCNC benchmark circuits has been presented. The results of the experiment show that the method we proposed has a good effect on MPRM logic circuits area optimization.},

  abstract     = {The standard inertial Navier–Stokes equations consisting of the conservation equations for mass , momentum and energy are often used to investigate the motion of a compressible fluid around an object that is in arbitrary motion. The non-inertial form of the Navier–Stokes equations can be used to accurately capture the acceleration effects that arise from the unsteady motion. The acceleration source terms that arise in the conservation equation for momentum have been extensively documented. In this paper, an Eulerian approach for deriving the apparent forces is presented to transform the governing conservation equation for energy into a non-inertial reference frame that is in arbitrary motion. The Eulerian approach is based on successive Galilean transformations between an inertial frame, an orientation-preserving non-inertial frame and a rotating non-inertial frame. The paper demonstrates that for an object in arbitrary motion, the rate of work done due to fictitious forces affects the rate of change of the total energy. The fictitious work arises in the kinetic energy equation while the internal energy and enthalpy equations remain invariant in the non-inertial frame. The present derivation is a step towards quantifying the contribution of the fictitious work terms to the heat transfer of a body that is accelerating/decelerating.},

  abstract     = {The point inclusion tests for polygons, in other words the point-in-polygon (PIP) algorithms, are fundamental tools for many scientific fields related to computational geometry, and they have been studied for a long time. The PIP algorithms get direct or indirect geometric definition of a polygonal entity, and validate its containment of a given point. The PIP algorithms, which are working directly on the geometric entities, derive linear boundary definitions for the edges of the polygons. Moreover, almost all direct test methods rely on the two-point form of the line equation to partition the space into half-spaces. Voronoi tessellations use an alternate approach for half-space partitioning. Instead of line equation, distance comparison between generator points is used to accomplish the same task. Voronoi tessellations consist of convex polygons, which are defined between generator points. Therefore, Voronoi tessellations have become an inspiration for us to develop a new approach of the PIP testing, specialized for convex polygons. The equations, essential to the conversion of a convex polygon to a Voronoi polygon, are derived. As a reference, a very standard convex PIP testing algorithm, the sign of offset , is selected for comparison. For generalization of the comparisons, the ray crossing algorithm is used as another reference. All algorithms are implemented as vector and matrix operations without any branching. This enabled us to benefit from the CPU optimizations of the underlying linear algebra libraries. Experimentation showed that, our proposed algorithm can have comparable performance characteristics with the reference algorithms. Moreover, it has simplicity, both from a geometric representation and the mental model.},

The Greville algorithm proposes a simple formula for updating the pseudoinverse of a matrix A ∈ R n × m A∈Rn×m with rank r r . In this paper, we explicitly derive a similar formula by maintaining a general rank factorization, which we call rank-Greville. Based on this formula, we implemented a recursive least-squares algorithm exploiting the rank-deficiency of A , A, achieving the update of the minimum-norm least-squares solution in O ( m r ) O(mr) operations and, therefore, solving the linear least-squares problem from scratch in O ( n m r ) O(nmr) operations. We empirically confirmed that this algorithm displays a better asymptotic time complexity than LAPACK solvers for rank-deficient matrices. The numerical stability of rank-Greville was found to be comparable to Cholesky-based solvers. Nonetheless, our implementation supports exact numerical representations of rationals, due to its remarkable algebraic simplicity.},

  abstract     = {Accurate modelling of shallow water flows in canals for realistic scenarios cannot neglect the variations of the size and shape of the cross-section along the canal. In typical situations, especially in view of applications to flows in networks of canals, a 2D model would be too costly, while the standard 1D Saint-Venant model for a rectangular channel with constant breadth would be too coarse. In this paper we derive efficient, high order accurate and robust numerical schemes for a 1.5D model, in which the canal can have an arbitrary cross-section: the shape can vary along the channel and is described by a depth-dependent breadth function σ ( x , z ) , σ(x,z), where x x is the coordinate along the channel and z z represents the vertical direction. Contrary to all previous schemes for this model, we reformulate the equations in a way that avoids the appearance of the moments of σ σ and of ∂ σ / ∂ x ∂σ/∂x in the source terms. Our numerical schemes are based on the path-conservative approach for dealing with non-conservative products, are well-balanced on the lake at rest solution and can treat wet-try transitions. They can be implemented with any order of accuracy. Schemes up to third order are explicitly constructed and tested, thanks to the CWENO CWENO reconstruction technique. Through a large set of numerical tests we show the performance of the new schemes and compare the results obtained with different orders of accuracy.},

In this paper, several criteria are introduced to analyze the influence of the initial guess on the evolution of Newton-Raphson’s algorithm and to identify which initial guesses need to be improved in case of convergence failure. In particular, indicators based on first and second derivatives of the residual function are introduced, whose values allow to assess how much the initial guess of each variable can be responsible for the convergence failure. The use of such criteria, which are based on rigorously proven results, is successfully demonstrated in three exemplary test cases.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new nonlinear finite volume (FV) scheme preserving the discrete maximum principle (DMP) for diffusion equations on distorted meshes. We introduce both cell-centered and vertex unknowns as primary ones. It is well-known that some restrictions on the diffusion coefficients and meshes have to be imposed for existing cell-centered schemes to preserve the DMP (see, e.g., Sheng and Yuan 2011,2018), while our scheme here removes these restrictions and can apply to diffusion problems with arbitrary discontinuity on general meshes. That is, the new scheme avoids failure of handling arbitrary discontinuity on general meshes for existing cell-centered schemes, moreover it is proved that our scheme satisfies the DMP. Numerical results show that our scheme can obtain second-order accuracy, deal with the problems with anisotropic and heterogeneous diffusion coefficient and satisfy the DMP. In addition, it is verified that our scheme can compete with some existing schemes, even behaves better in regard to numerical accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Recently, D. Vukičević and J. Sedlar in [1] introduced an order “ ⪯ ⪯ ” on T n , Tn, the set of trees on n n vertices, such that the topological index F F of a graph is a function defined on the order set 〈 T n , ⪯ 〉 〈Tn,⪯〉 . It provides a new approach to determine the extremal graphs with respect to topological index F F . By using the method they determined the common maximum and/or minimum graphs of T n Tn with respect to topological indices of Wiener type and anti-Wiener type. Motivated by their researches we further study the order set 〈 T n , ⪯ 〉 〈Tn,⪯〉 and give a criterion to determine its order, which enable us to get the common extremal graphs in four prescribed subclasses of 〈 T n , ⪯ 〉 〈Tn,⪯〉 . All these extremal graphs are confirmed to be the common maximum and/or minimum graphs with respect to the topological indices of Wiener type and anti-Wiener type. Additionally, we calculate the exact values of Wiener index for the extremal graphs in the order sets 〈 C ( n , k ) , ⪯ 〉 , 〈C(n,k),⪯〉, 〈 T n ( q ) , ⪯ 〉 〈Tn(q),⪯〉 and 〈 T n Δ , ⪯ 〉 〈TnΔ,⪯〉 .},

In addition, in order to get fast estimation to Caputo fractional derivative and reduce the storage of numerical scheme, an efficient sum-of-exponentials approximation for the kernel t − α , α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) t−α,α∈(0,1) is adopted. Under the non-uniform time mesh, the stability and convergence are discussed for the semi-discrete scheme, and the error estimate is investigated for the fully discrete scheme in detail.

  abstract     = {Social distancing can be divided into two categories: spontaneous social distancing adopted by the individuals themselves, and public social distancing promoted by the government. Both types of social distancing have been proved to suppress the spread of infectious disease effectively. While previous studies examined the impact of each social distancing separately, the simultaneous impacts of them are less studied. In this research, we develop a mathematical model to analyze how spontaneous social distancing and public social distancing simultaneously affect the outbreak threshold of an infectious disease with asymptomatic infection. A communication-contact two-layer network is constructed to consider the difference between spontaneous social distancing and public social distancing. Based on link overlap of the two layers, the two-layer network is divided into three subnetworks: communication-only network, contact-only network, and overlapped network. Our results show that public social distancing can significantly increase the outbreak threshold of an infectious disease. To achieve better control effect, the subnetwork of higher infection risk should be more targeted by public social distancing, but the subnetworks of lower infection risk shouldn’t be overlooked. The impact of spontaneous social distancing is relatively weak. On the one hand, spontaneous social distancing in the communication-only network has no impact on the outbreak threshold of the infectious disease. On the other hand, the impact of spontaneous social distancing in the overlapped network is highly dependent on the detection of asymptomatic infection sources. Moreover, public social distancing collaborates with infection detection on controlling an infectious disease, but their impacts can’t add up perfectly. Besides, public social distancing is slightly less effective than infection detection, because infection detection can also promote spontaneous social distancing.},

In addition, the reduced-order PTO is also considered in this paper. Moreover, it is shown that the existence conditions under which the full-order PTO exists can also guarantee the existence of a corresponding reduced-order PTO. The advantages of the full-order and the reduced-order PTOs over the existing asymptotic convergence observers are that (1) they can achieve exact estimations in almost any prescribed convergence time regardless of what the system initial values are. (2) the proposed time-varying gain PTOs can avoid the conservatism of the unknown input decoupling conditions brought about by the traditional polytopic LPV observer design methods. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

The resulting linear partial differential equations (PDE) form the symmetric hyperbolic system written for velocities, relative velocities, pressure and shear stress, which ensures application of a high order finite difference scheme on a staggered grid. A diffuse interface approach is applied to simulate wavefields in regions with interfaces between media with different porosity, including pure phases. The latter allows computations with the use of a single PDE system on rectangular grids without cumbersome interface tracking. Numerical experiments confirming the efficiency of the proposed approach are presented.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the exponential stabilization of continuous-time dynamical systems via aperiodic intermittent controls (APIC). Time-triggered and event-triggered APIC schemes are designed respectively for continuous-time dynamical systems. Under time-triggered APIC (T-APIC), by proposing the notions of (minimum) average control width and using the method of Lyapunov-like function, the exponential stabilization criteria expressed by converse average dwell-time conditions are derived. Based on indices of threshold-value and check-period, the event-triggered APIC (E-APIC) is proposed. E-APIC is state dependent and the algorithm for E-APIC is given to derive criteria of exponential stabilization. Moreover, by introducing control-free index into APIC, an E-APIC with state-based control widths (SCW) is proposed to improve the constraints on control widths in E-APIC and T-APIC. In order to verify performances of the intermittent control schemes including periodic intermittent control (PIC), some discussions are given by using notions of number of control, rate of control, and cost of control. Finally, one example with numerical simulations is given for illustrations. It is shown that both PIC and T-APIC are stronger control schemes than E-APIC and E-APIC with SCW. E-APIC and E-APIC with SCW have better performances than PIC and T-APIC with lower values on rate of control, number of control, and cost of control. And E-APIC with SCW has lowest rate of control and can achieve least total control time.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a high-precision curvature constrained Bernoulli–Euler beam element based on the gradient deficient beam elements (GDBE) of the absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) is developed for precisely and efficiently tackling the geometrically nonlinear analysis of straight and strongly curved planar thin beam structures. Firstly, this research proposes a vector interpolation scheme named “curvature constrained interpolation method” (CCIM) which can present comprehensive and accurate curve properties including Frenet frame, position, gradient and especially, curvature at base points. Since the correctness and superiority of the CCIM are proven, it is therefore utilized as the shape function of the proposed element, which ensures the second-order accuracy. With the accurate Frenet frame provided by the CCIM, the strain energy including axial strain and bending strain of a beam element is rigorously derived by applying the definition of the Green–Lagrange strain tensor in continuum mechanics with the Bernoulli–Euler beam assumption. The sign of curvature in the bending strain term is determined by a referenced vector. This revision makes the proposed element feasible when solving the configuration which presents different orientations of concavity or the deformed configuration where the orientation of concavity reverses with comparison to the initial configuration. Due to the constant global reference coordinate, the elastic force and its Jacobian matrix are expressed in an elegant form, which can be calculated by the Gauss quadrature integration conveniently. The efficiency and high accuracy of the proposed element are validated by several nonlinear benchmark problems, which is especially reflected in considerably fewer numbers of elements and continuous, exact strain result between adjacent elements with comparison to relevant examples from literature and ABAQUS. After comprehensive demonstrations, it can be concluded that the proposed element is accurate and effective enough for modelling planar thin beam structures experiencing large deformation and large rotation.},

  abstract     = {An efficient computational method to approximate the solution of a general class of nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems in Cartesian grids is presented. The proposed scheme uses the Local Discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method as spatial discretization and the symmetric Strang operator splitting as time marching scheme. As a result, not only diffusion and reaction are decoupled; but the reaction sub-step reduces to a set of completely independent small local nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations. To reduce their computational cost a Lagrange interpolatory technique is used. Diffusion sub-steps are approximated by a directional splitting method derived from an algebraic decomposition of the discrete Laplacian operator, which amounts to solve sets of completely independent small block tridiagonal linear systems; one set per direction. Stability of the diffusive step is analyzed. Finally the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme is numerically investigated on well known Turing pattern formation models in 2D/3D.},

  abstract     = {Total variation (TV) is broadly utilized in image processing because it is able to preserve sharp edges and object boundaries, which are usually the most important parts of an image. Recently, the non-convex functions such as the smoothly clipped absolute deviation, the minimax concave penalty, the capped ℓ 1 ℓ1 -norm penalty and the ℓ p ℓp quasi-norm with 0 &lt; p &lt; 1 0&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;1 have been shown remarkable advantages in sparse learning due to the fact that they can overcome the over-penalization associated with the ℓ 1 ℓ1 -norm. In this paper, an efficient non-convex total variation approach for image deblurring and denoising model has been proposed, which combines a non-convex regularization term and a non-convex data fitting term perfectly. Firstly, the non-convex functions are employed into the regularization term and the fidelity term for enhancing the sensitivity to sharp edges and object boundaries. Secondly, the optimizing minimization method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to solve the non-convex total variation optimization problem. The resulting subproblems either have closed-form solutions or can be solved by fast solvers, which makes the ADMM particularly efficient. In theory, with the help of the smoothing technique and Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz function, we prove that the sequence generated by the ADMM converges to a stationary point when the penalty parameter is above a computable threshold. The numerical experiments illustrate that our proposed non-convex total variation model outperforms the existing convex and non-convex total variation models.},

  abstract     = {Evacuation assistants and their guiding strategies play an important role in the multi-exits pedestrian evacuation. To investigate the effects of guiding strategies on evacuation efficiency, we propose a force-driven cellular automaton model with adjustable guiding attractions imposed by the evacuation assistants located in the exits. In this model, each of the evacuation assistants tries to attract the pedestrians in the evacuation space towards its own exit by sending a quantifiable guiding signal, which may be adjusted according to the values of pedestrian density near the exit. The effects of guiding strategies pursuing balanced pedestrian densities are studied. It is observed that the unbalanced pedestrian distribution is mainly yielded by a snowballing effect generated from the mutual attractions among the pedestrians, and can be suppressed by controlling the pedestrian densities around the exits. We also reveal an interesting fact that given a moderate target density value, the density control for the partial regions (near the exits) could yield a global effect for balancing the pedestrians in the rest of the regions and hence improve the evacuation efficiency. Our findings may contribute to give new insight into designing effective guiding strategies in the realistic evacuation process.},

A dynamic model based on Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is then proposed for the climate change dilemma, where the information exchange is restricted by a network. Simulation results show that the proposed dynamic model can effectively promote cooperation, especially in the case of continuous contribution, and making decisions based on historical information can largely boost the average contribution.},

Both companies have the option of paying dividends. The objective is to maximize the expected discount utility of surplus relative to a reference point for each insurer, the gains brought by the insurer’s own dividend payout, and the losses incurred by the dividend payment of the competitor. The gains and losses are proportional to the amount of corresponding dividend payment. To find the optimal dividend policy, we relate this singular control problem to a stopping game. Further, we prove the link based on the verification theorem and show that value functions of the non-zero-sum stochastic differential problem can be derived by integrating value functions of a stopping game. Finally, we apply our results to the case with two regimes and the case without regime switching. Numerical examples are also provided.},

This kind of stabilized space-time finite element (STFE) scheme, based on approximation space enriched by bubble functions that can increase stability, is constructed. The existence, uniqueness and stability are proved with the properties of Lagrange interpolation polynomials established on Radau points in time direction. An error estimate in L ∞ ( L 2 ) L∞(L2) -norm is given by introducing the elliptic projection operators in space direction. This estimate approach is different from the previous ones that construct a special interpolant into approximation space showing an extra orthogonality property on the projection space. Since the techniques of Lagrange interpolation in time direction decouple time and space variables, the method proposed in this paper has the advantages of reducing calculation and simplifying theoretical analysis. The space and time convergence orders are illustrated in the first numerical example with smooth solutions. A comparison between the traditional STFE scheme and the constructed scheme for the problem having exponential boundary layers is presented in the second numerical example. The simulation results show that the novel method can greatly reduce nonphysical oscillations. And the influences of the stabilization parameters on the behavior of the approximate solution are discussed by some numerical results.},

  abstract     = {Viral infections remain a major cause of deaths globally. Here, we focus on Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) infection dynamics in the liver and blood cells , taking into account non-cytotoxic and cytotoxic mediated immune response as well as antiviral therapy. The analysis of the model is presented in terms of the reproduction number, R 0 R0 . The system has a globally stable disease-free equilibrium when R 0 R0 is below unit. It exhibits forward bifurcation when R 0 R0 is greater than one, with a locally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium point. By carrying out sensitivity analysis using the Latin Hypercube Sampling scheme (LHS), we determine the key processes that are essential in containing the infection. Our results suggest that, the production of virions from blood and liver cells as well as degeneration of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (CTLs) can greatly aggravate HBV and HCV infections. Moreover, CTL-mediated immune response alone cannot effectively contain the infection. Although virion production from the liver and blood as well as per-capita loss of CTLs were observed to greatly aggravate the infection, their effects imposed on the infection dynamics were not significantly different. We recommend based on the results that, use of highly effective antiviral/combination therapy to block production of new virions is an ideal approach to containing the infections.},

In order to get a numerically stable and positive definite modification of the sample covariance matrix in the high-dimensional data setting, in this paper we consider the condition number constrained covariance matrix approximation problem and present its explicit solution with respect to the Frobenius norm . The condition number constraint guarantees the numerical stability and positive definiteness of the approximation form simultaneously. By exploiting the special structure of the data matrix in the high-dimensional data setting, we also propose some new algorithms based on efficient matrix decomposition techniques.

Mechanical properties of magneto-elastic heterogeneous reinforced media in wave scattering are an essential part of this study. A generalized Haskell’s [1] technique has been applied to obtain the wave scattering relation in multi-layer heterogeneous magneto-elastic media using suitable boundary conditions. Estimated wave scattering relation is in affirmation with the general Love-type surface wave relation in case of a single layered medium over a semi-infinite substance as well as multi-layered media over the semi-infinite substance. A finite difference technique is derived to obtain the group and phase velocities with shear deformation in the magneto-elastic heterogeneous reinforced media. To study the group and phase velocity in a square grid, stability conditions for introducing finite difference techniques have been derived. Using graphical representation , it has been examined that phase velocity, group velocity, and wave scattering in the layered media are affected by heterogeneity, reinforced, magneto-elastic coupling parameters, and stability ratio.},

The novel asynchronous edge-event triggered mechanisms are proposed to avoid continuous information transmission between neighbors, under which each subsystem does not exhibit the Zeno behavior. Compared with the existing works, the highlight of this paper is based on edge communication and the construction of triggering mechanism depends on the information of the edge. Moreover, compared with the event-triggered mechanism, the edge-event triggered mechanism is a more distributed information exchange mode and each agent transmits information to its out-neighbors asynchronously, thus effectively reducing the use of system resources. Finally, a practice simulation example is introduced to demonstrate the main results of this paper.

Two discrete time-delays are incorporated to justify the reaction time of predator with each prey. The permanence of such system is proved. Local and global stabilities of interior steady states are discussed. Hopf bifurcation analysis in terms of time-delay parameters is investigated, and threshold parameters τ 1 * τ1* and τ 2 * τ2* are obtained.

A modified Newton linearization algorithm is developed by analyzing how to properly account for mass conservation implicitly in the linearization. The numerical performance of the modified Newton linearization algorithm is investigated in terms of solution stability, convergence behaviour , and accuracy. A set of standard fluid flow test problems is solved using a pressure-based cell-centered fully coupled finite volume solver linearized by Picard, standard Newton, and modified Newton methods . The accuracy of numerical solutions is assessed by comparisons with provided benchmark solutions and those obtained by the present coupled solver linearized by the Picard method. The numerical results showed the modified Newton linearization algorithm converged to a solution with a rate up to 22 times higher than that of Picard linearization algorithm for the steady flow fields for lid-driven cavity test problems. The modified Newton linearization technique is also evaluated by computations of steady flow over a backward facing step and unsteady flow around a circular cylinder. The developed algorithm reduces the iteration number of the linearization cycle required up to 10 times for the backward facing step flow problem. Also, the unsteady flow computations are performed by modified Newton linearization algorithm with a lower number of iterations in comparison with the Picard linearization algorithm. The numerical experiments indicate that the modified Newton linearization algorithm maintains the solution accuracy with respect to the Picard linearization algorithm.},

Several approaches have been proposed on the basis of shortest paths or diffusive navigation. However, no existing approaches have tackled the challenges of efficient communication in networks without full knowledge of their global topology under external noise. Here, we develop a first principles approach and mathematical formalism to determine the informational cost of navigating a network under different levels of external noise. Using this approach we discover the existence of a trade-off between the ways in which networks route information through shortest paths, their entropies and stability, which define three classes of real-world networks. This approach reveals that environmental pressure has shaped the ways in which information is transferred in bacterial metabolic networks and allowed us to determine the levels of noise at which a protein–protein interaction network seems to work in normal conditions in a cell.},

The Chebyshev polynomials employed here can provide the spectral accuracy of new approach. The concept of the local subdomain is introduced to derive a sparse system, which ensures the feasibility for large-scale simulation. This paper aims at proposing a new method to solve general partial differential equations accurately and efficiently. Several numerical examples including Poisson equation, Helmholtz-type equation and transient heat conduction equation are provided to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method.

Then we prove that the connected orthogonal convex hull of a finite set of points is an orthogonal ( x , y x,y )-polygon where its convex vertices are its connected orthogonal convex hull’s extreme points. As a result, an efficient algorithm, based on the idea of Graham’s convex hull algorithm, for finding the connected orthogonal convex hull of a finite planar point set is presented. We also show that the lower bound of computational complexity of such algorithms is O ( n log n ) O(nlogn) . Some numerical results for finding the connected orthogonal convex hulls of random sets are given.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we propose an eco-friendly optimization of banana or plantain yield by the control of the pest burrowing nematode Radopholus similis . This control relies on fallow deployment, with greater respect for the environment than chemical methods. The optimization is based on a multi-seasonal model in which fallow periods follow cropping seasons. The aim is to find the best way, in terms of profit, to allocate the durations of fallow periods between the cropping seasons, over a fixed time horizon spanning several seasons. The existence of an optimal allocation is proven and an adaptive random search algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem. For a relatively long time horizon, deploying one season less than the maximum possible number of cropping seasons allows to increase the fallow period durations and results in a better multi-seasonal profit. For regular fallow durations, the profit is lower than the optimal solution, but the final soil infestation is also lower.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new method for designing a state-dependent switching law to stabilize a class of switched nonlinear system with two unstable subsystems. The main idea is to convert each subsystem to a second-order mechanical system by introducing a reversible transformation, thus the summation of its kinetic and potential energies is calculated as an energy function. Then, by defining a performance index with energy function and using the variational principle , two optimal switching curves are derived from the Euler equation . By adopting a switching law designed by such switching curves, the state of the switched system can approach to the origin at the fastest speed in a sense. In addition, for the case of switched systems with linear vibration subsystems, a critical stability condition related to the stiffness and negative damping coefficients of the subsystems is obtained to make the switched system periodic. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively solve the stability problem of switched systems, in which each subsystem does not have any stability factors.},

  abstract     = {In approximating solutions of nonstationary problems, various approaches are used to compute the solution at a new time level from a number of simpler (sub-)problems. Among these approaches are splitting methods. Standard splitting schemes are based on one or another additive splitting of the operator into “simpler” operators that are more convenient/easier for the computer implementation and use inhomogeneous (explicitly-implicit) time approximations. In this paper, a new class of splitting schemes is proposed that is characterized by an additive representation of the solution instead of the operator corresponding to the problem (called problem operator). A specific feature of the proposed splitting is that the resulting coupled equations for individual solution components consist of the time derivatives of the solution components. The proposed approaches are motivated by various applications, including multiscale methods, domain decomposition , and so on, where spatially local problems are solved and used to compute the solution. Unconditionally stable splitting schemes are constructed for a first-order evolution equation, which is considered in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. In our splitting algorithms, we consider the decomposition of both the main operator of the system and the operator at the time derivative. Our goal is to provide a general framework that combines temporal splitting algorithms and spatial decomposition and its analysis. Applications of the framework will be studied separately.},

The main aim is to show that modal analysis of these second order partial differential equations provides a valid and effective approach for analysing and comparing the models. It is known that reliable values for the phase lags of the heat flux and the temperature gradient are not readily available. The modal solutions are used to determine a range of realistic values for these lag times. Furthermore, it is shown that using partial sums of the series solutions for calculating approximate solutions is an efficient procedure. These approximate solutions converge in terms of a so-called energy norm which is stronger than the maximum norm. A model problem where a single heat pulse is applied to a specimen, is used for comparing these models with the Fourier (or parabolic) heat conduction model.},

After proving the convergence of the scheme, an adaptive two-scale strategy is incorporated, which improves the efficiency of the simulations.

First, the solution of the 2D-IDEs is replaced by the extended two dimensional barycentric Lagrange interpolant which is constructed by tensor product nodes, the set of differential operators is discretized by the differential matrix of barycentric interpolant, the double integral is approximated by an extended Gauss-type quadrature formula and the boundary conditions are treated by the substitute method.

In detail, each individual can be randomly endowed with a tunable reputation value and a fixed tag at the initial stage, the donor’s reputation will be adaptively varied by the adjustment increment R g Rg according to the action at each game round. In addition, another tunable parameter ω ω is used to control the strategy spreading ability of the individual with lower reputation. Through extensive simulations, the results indicate that the combination of reputation and tag greatly promotes the evolution of altruistic behaviors within the structured population. When other parameters are fixed, the smaller the value of ω ω is, the more obvious the advantage of dominant strategy becomes. It is also found that the reputation threshold has a decisive effect on the dominant strategy within the population. The current results suggest that the reputation contributes significantly to the evolution of cooperation in the population with the green beard effect, we hope our work can provide some valuable clues for exploring the altruistic behaviors in the future.},

  abstract     = {In a graph G , G, cardinality of the smallest ordered set of vertices that distinguishes every element of V ( G ) V(G) is the (vertex) metric dimension of G G . Similarly, the cardinality of such a set is the edge metric dimension of G , G, if it distinguishes E ( G ) E(G) . In this paper these invariants are considered first for unicyclic graphs, and it is shown that the vertex and edge metric dimensions obtain values from two particular consecutive integers, which can be determined from the structure of the graph. In particular, as a consequence, we obtain that these two invariants can differ by at most one for a same unicyclic graph. Next we extend the results to graphs with edge disjoint cycles (i.e. cactus graphs) showing that the two invariants can differ by at most c , c, where c c is the number of cycles in such a graph. We conclude the paper with a conjecture that generalizes the previously mentioned consequences to graphs with prescribed cyclomatic number c c by claiming that the difference of the invariant is still bounded by c c .},

However, many individuals have become addicted to using these technologies and, as a consequence, they experience negative mental effects. The home confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have worsened this situation. Here, an epidemic model is proposed to represent the spread of the problematic technology use. The model is written as a set of differential equations, which describes the time evolution of the numbers of non-users, light/moderate users, heavy users, and problematic users. This model presents a single endemic steady-state, which is asymptotically stable. This result is illustrated by numerical simulations and its relevance is examined from a public health perspective.},

Considering the state information may not be utterly available in practice, a state observer model is designed to estimate the state information. Meanwhile, a type of discrete-time event-triggered mechanism is utilized to filter the sampled signal for reducing the occupation of network bandwidths and the transmission rate of resources. In addition, a random variable obeying the Bernoulli distribution is adopted to describe the phenomenon of uncertainties randomly occurring in the measurement. With the aid of the Lyapunov stability and sliding mode control theory , some sufficient criteria are given to both guarantee the mean-square asymptotic stability of the overall closed-loop system with an extended dissipative performance, and the reachability of predefined sliding surface. Whereafter, the event-triggered weighting matrix, and gains of sliding mode controller and with observer are obtained by solving the matrix convex optimization problem. Finally, the feasibility of the presented scheme is demonstrated through two illustrative examples.},

The five-cell stencil is allotted a global higher-order indicator of smoothness than three-cell stencils. Then the five-cell stencil dominates the nonlinear combination and ensures the optimal accuracy in the smooth regions even at extremal points . In non-smooth regions, the three-cell stencils dominate the combination and compress the nonphysical oscillations. As the adaptive order WENO schemes which release the requirement of linear optimal weights, we will show that there is no requirement of linear optimal weights for the WENO-Z schemes as well, and even it is unnecessary to require the sum of linear optimal weights to be one.},

Our model is based on the forwarding quantity and takes into account the differential influence of a delivered emotional information on the emotion change of users depending on their respective emotion status. Our Model-based analytic and numerical analyses show that three types of forwarding probabilities involved in our E-SFI model are in accordance with the actual accident situation, and our sensitivity analyses describe important factors that affect the emotional choices of user communities in support for decision strategies to guide the public sentiment. To quantify the significance of these factors, we introduce multiple summative indices including the information with emotions propagation reproduction number , and emotion entropy.},

Different from the existing finite-time control techniques, the proposed controller can guarantee that the settling time does not depend on the initial conditions and the continuous controller updates cannot be required. Moreover, compared with the existing fixed-time control methods, the fixed-time event-triggered tracking problem for multi-dimensional nonlinear multi-agent system with uncertain disturbances is considered for the first time in this paper. To avoid continuous communication among agents, a novel triggering mechanism is further proposed. Furthermore, the fixed-time event-triggered containment consensus with multiple leaders is considered. No agent exhibits the Zeno behavior in these two consensus issues.

Some quantities of interest to measure persistence in the loss occurrence process are obtained. Given a real OpRisk database, the aggregate loss model is estimated by fitting separately the inter-loss times and severities. The M A P 2 MAP2 is estimated via direct maximization of the likelihood function, and severities are modeled by the heavy-tailed, double-Pareto Lognormal distribution .

  abstract     = {Mathematical models for predicting the geographical distribution of areas with high rates of home burglary and numerical experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of police patrol routing strategies in reducing crime can support security policymakers in planning more effective patrol routes. We give an overview of the model formulated by Jones et al. (2010) to study the effects of the presence of law enforcement on the formation of home-burglary hotspots. We propose an extension of the model to contemplate that a small proportion of burglars travel far away from their awareness space to burgle houses. We incorporate these trips in the form of long-range stochastic jumps that are biased towards more attractive sites. Simulations suggest that hotspots lose attractiveness as police more influences via deterrence on burglars’ decision making about returning home rather than burglarizing a house. The results indicate that a higher proportion of burglars making long crime journeys might counteract the deterrent effect form the police presence. A case study is carried out to predict at the zone and citywide levels the distribution of areas with the highest home burglary rates in Mexico City. The L-BFGS method is applied to get the values for the parameters in both the Jones et al. model and our model; we use data from home burglaries reported, patrol zones and prison admissions. The minimum of the objective function is slightly lower for our model than for the Jones et al. model. Results obtained through numerical simulations using our model better fit the spatial statistical distribution of home-burglary hotspots for the entire city than for the zones.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the H ∞ H∞ asynchronous filtering problem of discrete-time linear switched systems. A foreseeable Lyapunov function is firstly proposed for the asynchronous filtering error system with mode-dependent integrated dwell time (MDIDT) switching. The novelty consists in that the Lyapunov function carries the future state in the form of the convex linear functions which enables us to take into account the state and noise information at the next instant during the design process of the filter. The Lyapunov function follows the operation of the asynchronous filter and is designed corresponding to the partition of the synchronous intervals. In light of these merits, the stability and non-weighted l 2 l2 -gain performance can be deduced, and then the foreseeable H ∞ H∞ asynchronous filter is devised to ensure the resulting filtering error system is globally uniformly exponentially stable (GUES) with a prescribed non-weighted l 2 l2 -gain. The word foreseeable signifies that the H ∞ H∞ performance analysis of the filtering error system can’t do without the noise knowledge at the next instant. Compared with the traditional filter design method, our method gets tighter bounds on the dwell time and smaller filtering error results. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of our filtering scheme is verified by application examples.},

We present two variants of our construction algorithm: On the first, a homoclinic orbit is constructed locating the exit and return points on the crossing section of the switching surface are connected by a nonhyperbolic center-node domain. In the second variant, we extend the construction method to construct heteroclinic loops with two switching surfaces between them. For the resulting systems a wide range of parameter values results on Shilnikov chaos. These chaotic systems are illustrated with numerical simulations.},

In particular, we study several variations on a model of the so-called Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test (IVGTT), which measures a subject’s insulin response to glucose over time and yields data useful for characterizing and diagnosing diabetes. Nonsmoothness refers here to continuous behavior that is punctuated by “switches” (physiological events) arising due to biochemical and control thresholds being crossed. Insulin secretion from a typical pancreatic response and insulin infusion from an external device (for diabetic patients) are both considered here. The presence of nonsmoothness means that classical sensitivity theory and associated numerical methods are ill-equipped to handle these models. Motivated by this, lexicographic directional differentiation and lexicographic “sensitivity functions” are used, which are recently developed tools in nonsmooth analysis. Using this new approach, we derive nonsmooth sensitivity systems associated with the considered glucose kinetics models, whose unique solutions provide local sensitivity information analogous to classical forward parametric sensitivity functions. Moreover, the theory is practically implementable and the resulting sensitivity functions are computationally relevant, as they can be supplied to dedicated nonsmooth numerical methods (e.g., optimization). The nonsmooth sensitivity systems are solved numerically, giving new insights into the model, and thus into the dynamics of glucose kinetics under the simulated conditions. It is hoped that the results here may be used to improve the design of assessments for diabetes (e.g., the IVGTT) and its treatment.},

We extend the methodology to the geometric Brownian motion with affine drift and show that the joint distribution of this process and its time-integral can be determined by a doubly-confluent Heun equation. Furthermore, the joint Laplace transform of the process and its time-integral is derived from the asymptotics of the solutions. In addition, we provide an application by using the results for the asymptotics of the double-confluent Heun equation in pricing Asian options.

The priorities hinge on the magnitude of customers’ admission fee. Before entering the system where there are no servers, customers will make a two-stage strategy. First, customers should determine an optimal additional fee to pursue the optimal utilities, i.e., the so-called additional payment strategy. Then, they decide whether to join or not. We primarily give some necessary conditions for the equilibrium. As regards the heterogeneity of customers in delay sensitivity, both of the non-atomic continuous and atomic discrete types of customers are discussed, respectively. Applying the sequential approach, we capture the unique equilibrium for both cases. Specially, for the non-atomic continuous type of customers, the incoming ones adopt the pure additional payment strategy at equilibrium. While for the atomic discrete type of customers, the equilibrium additional payment strategies for incoming ones become mixed-type. It is found that the equilibrium additional fee and flexible cost for each incoming customer are both decreasing in fundamental payment. Finally, we use the particle swarm algorithm to consider the optimal social revenue when the incoming ones from both sides are strategic.},

Initially, the robust tracking control problem of interconnected systems is transformed to the robust stabilization one of augmented interconnected systems. To address the uncertain interconnections as well as optimize the sample intervals, a group of auxiliary subsystems, each with a novel discounted cost function, are introduced, which enables the robust stabilization problem to be further converted to a group of two-player zero-sum differential games. Next, an event-triggered ADP algorithm is proposed to obtain the saddle point solutions, based on which the distributed event-triggered robust tracking control policies for the overall system are established. Specifically, the proposed event-triggered mechanism is asynchronous and distributed where the sample intervals are optimized to further reduce the computational burden and save the communication resources. Moreover, the tracking errors and the approximation errors of critic network weights are demonstrated to be uniformly ultimately bounded by using the Lyapunov approach. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The results suggest that centralities of drugs in the network may have a significant implication in drug repositioning – a process of discovering new therapeutic uses of existing drugs. Given a particular disease, the drugs that have been approved for treating it were ranked by their centralities. It is shown that the top central ones among them are more likely to repurpose their neighboring drugs as new treatment options for the disease, as compared to their random and peripheral counterparts. Our predictions have proved to be in line with clinical interests indicated by the existing clinical studies in ClinicalTrials.gov database.

To study these languages collectively, the model is informed by universal biological, linguistic, and topological features of the task. We find that the majority of the naming systems are represented by eighteen clusters, each constituting a universal pattern. Novel mathematical techniques are developed to study the levels of similarity, underlying consensus, and diversity among these patterns.

If the two delays are identical, then the model becomes a one-delay system. The critical value of the delay is determined when stability might be lost. If the delays are different, then the stability switching curves are analytically defined and numerically verified. It is demonstrated that the unstable two-delay system may exhibit periodic behavior, multistability, quasi period-doubling cascade and even complicated dynamics depending on model parameters.},

The inevitable time-varying external disturbances and model uncertainties perturb the NSGC system. The nonlinear terms, external disturbances, model uncertainties, and plant&#39;s parameters are unknown and bounded. Avoiding the cancelation of the nonlinear terms of the plant by the controller makes the closed-loop robust stable in the presence of unknown parametric uncertainties; this concept blooms base for efficient control law design. The proposed RDAC eradicates the effects of the time-varying unknwon external disturbances and model uncertainties and accomplishes quick and smooth convergence of the state varaible (error vector) trajectories to the origin with reduced oscillations. Based on the Lyapunov function principle, the article describes a detailed analysis of the closed-loop stability. It provides suitable adaptive laws that estimate the upper bound of unknown controller parameters, external disturbances, and model uncertainties. The computer simulation results endorse the theoretical analysis, and the comparative study highlights the benefits.},

Surface and nonlocal effects have been accounted using the Gurtin-Murdoch surface elasticity theory and Eringen&#39;s nonlocal theory, respectively. The material properties of the beam are changing according to the power-law distribution in both the thickness and length directions. Employing Hamilton&#39;s energy principle, the governing equations of motion and corresponding boundary conditions have been extracted. The numerical results for frequency parameter have been obtained using the differential quadrature method for three different combinations of clamped and simply supported edge conditions. The study reveals that the consideration of surface and nonlocal effects in predicting the vibration characteristics of bi-directional functionally graded shear deformable nanobeam plays an important role and can&#39;t be ignored in the analysis.

The SWENO-AO consists of a high order and a second-order subreconstructions with a new weight, in which the second-order subreconstruction is always smooth. Comparing to WENO-AO method developed by Zhu and Qiu (2016), the SWENO-AO has the advantage of simplicity. First, the SWENO-AO does not need to regroup the candidate cells, but uses the weighted-least-squares to obtain a smooth second-order subreconstruction directly, which is more flexible for solving multi-dimensional problem. However the WENO-AO needs to regroup the candidate cells properly for obtaining different second-order subreconstructions, so that near discontinuity, at least one of them is smooth and can be used for avoiding the spurious oscillations. Second, the SWENO-AO only consists of two subreconstructions, so the implementation is simple. However the WENO-AO uses more subreconstructions for higher dimensional problem, which increases the computational complexity. Finally, the weight of SWENO-AO is simpler than the one of WENO-AO. Numerical tests also show that, the SWENO-AO gives comparable solution as WENO-AO, but uses less computational cost, thus has higher efficiency.},

Three scenarios are classified by preference parameter: completely cooperative, hostile to each other and general Cournot or Bertrand model. In each situation, Cournot model and its dual model present different chaos phenomenon which have various and abundant strange attractors, while the shapes of the stability regions are similar in the same situation. In the static setting, the local stability analysis of equilibrium gives the bounded region of quantity or price. The one-dimensional Logistic mapping is applied to studying the dynamics of the models on invariant axes. The critical curves classify different regions according to the number of preimages ( q 1 , q 2 ) or ( p 1 , p 2 ). Besides, simulations give more intuitive results: the cycle attractor, chaotic attractor and the basin of attraction with “holes” are presented. The article also provides new findings that under the assumption of comprehensive preference, the Cournot model with substitutes (complements) and the Bertrand model with complements (substitutes) are still duality models in the dynamic settings.},

  abstract     = {This article develops a new discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method on structured meshes for solving shallow water equations. The method here applies the one-stage ADER (Arbitrary DERivatives in time and space) approach for the temporal discretization and employs the differential transformation procedure to express spatiotemporal expansion coefficients of the solution through low order spatial expansion coefficients recursively. Numerical fluxes using the hydrostatic reconstruction together with a simple source term discretization results in a well-balanced method accordingly. Compared with the Runge-Kutta DG (RKDG) methods, the proposed method needs less computer memory storage due to no intermediate stages. In comparison with traditional ADER schemes, this method avoids solving the generalized Riemann problems at inter-cells. The differential transformation procedure used here is cheaper than the Cauchy-Kowalewski procedure in traditional ADER schemes. In summary, this method is one-step, one-stage, fully-discrete, and easily achieves arbitrary high order accuracy in time and space. Theoretically as well as numerically, the proposed method is verified to be well-balanced. Numerical results illustrate the high order accuracy as well as good resolutions for discontinuous solutions . Moreover, this method is more efficient than the Runge-Kutta DG (RKDG) method.},

  abstract     = {Delay differential equations have been the topic of significant interest in scientific and engineering problems. In this manuscript, we deal with the numerical solution of delay differential equations containing piecewise constant delays. The present method is based on general Lagrange-hybrid functions (GLHFs) and collocation method. First, we define GLHFs without considering the nodes of Lagrange polynomials. The integration operational matrix and delay operational matrix of GLHFs are obtained, generally. Using the integration and delay operational matrices and collocation method, the proposed problem transforms into a system of algebraic equations. An estimation of the error is derived in the sense of the Sobolev norm. Several numerical examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy and validity of the proposed computational procedure, as the mathematical model of tumor growth in mice and HIV infection of C D 4 + T-cells. Moreover, delay differential equations are studied through a bibliometric viewpoint.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we revisit the Markovian queueing system with a single server, infinite capacity queue and one special queue skipping policy. Customers arrive in batches but are served one by one in any order. The size of the arriving batch becomes known upon its arrival and at any time instant the total number of customers in the system is also known. According to the adopted queue skipping policy if a batch, which size is greater than the current total number of customers in the system, arrives, all customers currently residing in the system are removed from it and the new batch is placed in the queue. Otherwise the new batch is lost and does not have effect on the system. The distribution of the total number of customers in the system is under consideration under assumption that the arrival intensity λ ( t ) λ(t) and/or the service intensity μ ( t ) μ(t) are non-random functions of time. We provide the method for the computation of the upper bounds for the rate of convergence of system size to the limiting regime, whenever it exists, for any bounded λ ( t ) λ(t) and μ ( t ) μ(t) (not necessarily periodic) and any distribution of the batch size. For periodic intensities λ ( t ) λ(t) and/or μ ( t ) μ(t) and light-tailed distribution of the batch size it is shown how the obtained bounds can be used to numerically compute the limiting distribution of the queue size with the given error.

The approach of this paper is also applicable to a class of time-inhomogeneous Markov processes that have jumps only at integer times, where the path-independent Girsanov transform have to be given by discontinuous but piecewise differentiable functions .

Firstly, the formation problem is transformed into a tracking problem with a certain deviation from the reference trajectory. And a distributed kinematics control algorithm is designed by using leader-follower strategy and graph theory. Then, to solve the problem of unknown dynamic model, the relationship between WMR’s output and input is first derived by utilizing the iteration-domain dynamical linearization technique. After that, the improved data-driven iterative learning dynamics control algorithm is provided, which includes both proportional and integral terms along the iteration axis. This algorithm can ensure a group of WMRs to realize formation and only use I/O data of each WMR. Compared with DDILC, PI-DDILC can significantly enhance the response speed and transient performance of WMR system formation. The excellence of the improved algorithm is certified by simulation, and a performance index is designed to quantify the results of the two on formation performance.},

Especially in some fields such as data mining and computing, interior operators and closure operators play very important roles. However, we all know that it is not easy to find the interior or the closure of a set by definition generally in a finite topological space, even if the space contains very few elements. In this paper, we introduce the concept of base matrix of the topology, then we give the matrix computation formulas of the interior, the closure, the boundary, as well as the Kuratowski 14 sets of any subset in a n n -element topological space where n n is any positive integer. Moreover, a Generalized 14 Sets Theorem is introduced and the matrix representations of the generalized 14 sets are also given. We finally summarized the calculation steps and demonstrate the computations through an example. If n n is very big, the most important merits of the matrix methods is making the computations simpler, more efficient, more accurate, and can be easily implemented by computer programs. So, these results can greatly improve the application scope and the application operability of finite topological spaces in other fields.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the design of fully-distributed edge-based leader-following consensus controller for the higher-order locally Lipschitz nonlinear multi-agents. The proposed fully-distributed consensus approach deals with the local scenario as compared to the traditional consensus control for the globally Lipschitz models. The dynamics of nonlinear systems are considered to satisfy the Lipschitz condition locally and an adaptive fully-distributed relative-state consensus protocol has been established for ensuring a coherent behavior of agents. A local leader-following adaptive consensus controller design condition, for obtaining the adaptive consensus protocol gain, has been formulated using the proposed local treatment, adaptation law for coupling weights, ellipsoidal regional investigation, asymptotic stability consideration, and Lyapunov redesign. The developed results are enriched for attaining a robust adaptive consensus of the locally Lipschitz multi-agents against disturbances by using the local L 2 stability approach. This developed technique can be effective for minimizing the effect of external disturbances on the consensus error. From technical point of view, the proposed method can be used for the locally Lipschitz models, like systems having polynomial approximations in their models. Further, the proposed approach adapts (similar to routing in communication) in accordance with the requirement of control gains for a communication topology. Furthermore, our method can be applied to deal with the unwanted disturbance (like change in air flow speed or direction and external perturbations) for attaining a robust design. In contrast to existing studies, the proposed results consider adaptive and H ∞ consensus schemes for the higher-order locally Lipschitz multi-agents. The developed results are verified for a network of six vendor pol multi-agent systems and modified Chua&#39;s circuits.},

Social exclusion has been considered a powerful sanction for promoting and sustaining cooperation. However, whether the heterogeneity of the ability-to-pay of individuals can still favor cooperation when exclusion is introduced remains unclear. On the basis of this consideration, the dynamic cost of pool exclusion is taken into account in the public goods game, which focuses on the evolution process of each strategy in a square lattice . Specifically, we describe the cost of exclusion behavior as a function of payoff, while the probability of exclusion depends on the former. Through conducting Monte Carlo simulations, the effects of parameters on the evolution of cooperation are investigated. The results indicate that pool exclusion can promote cooperative behaviors within a wide range of parameters. Moreover, structured populations can form an effective alliance to sweep out defection, which requires a few excluders. This alliance continues to function even under strong dilemma strength. We further confirm that overinvestment in exclusion is unwanted. These results may help researchers better understand the emergence and implementation of social exclusion, and provide new insight into the analysis of the origin of cooperation for further exploration.},

The first optimization stage evaluates the equilibrium points and eigenvalues of the individuals or particles to verify if they accomplish the minimum fractional-order value to guarantee chaotic behavior. The individuals or particles accomplishing this requirement are passed to the second optimization stage evaluating their D K Y DKY . This saves computing time because the individuals or particles that do not accomplish the minimum fractional-order value, are not simulated in the time domain. We show that this optimization approach generates feasible values of the parameters of the FOCOs, providing better D K Y DKY values compared to the ones already reported in the literature.},

  abstract     = {In some previous works, two of the authors have introduced a strategy to develop high-order numerical methods for systems of balance laws that preserve all the stationary solutions of the system. The key ingredient of these methods is a well-balanced reconstruction operator. A strategy has been also introduced to modify any standard reconstruction operator like MUSCL, ENO, CWENO, etc. in order to be well-balanced. This strategy involves a non-linear problem at every cell at every time step that consists in finding the stationary solution whose average is the given cell value. So far this strategy has been only applied to systems whose stationary solution are known either in explicit or implicit form . The goal of this paper is to present a general implementation of this technique that can be applied to any system of balance laws. To do this, the nonlinear problems to be solved in the reconstruction procedure are interpreted as control problems: they consist in finding a solution of an ODE system whose average at the computation interval is given. These problems are written in functional form and the gradient of the functional is computed on the basis of the adjoint problem. Newton’s method is applied then to solve the problems. Special care is put to analyze the effects of computing the averages and the source terms using quadrature formulas . To test their efficiency and well-balancedness, the methods are applied to a number of systems of balance laws, ranging from easy academic systems consisting of Burgers equation with some nonlinear source terms to the shallow water equations or Euler equations of gas dynamics with gravity effects.},

  abstract     = {This work conducts a comparison study of matched interface and boundary (MIB) method and its interpolation formulation for free vibration analysis of stepped beams and plates. Two types of schemes are used to describe the relations between interfaces and grid points in one-dimensional and two-dimensional domains. In the first scheme, the interfaces are located on grid points, while, in the second scheme, the interfaces lie between grid points. Detailed procedures of MIB and the interpolation formulation of MIB (IMIB) are presented in these two schemes. Based on the in-depth understanding of MIB, a new algorithm is also developed to deal with cross derivatives of interface conditions of plates with interfaces lying between grid points to improve the accuracy. Various examples of stepped beams and plates are chosen to illustrate the performance of MIB and IMIB. This research work reveals that on the whole, MIB and IMIB are equivalent in the solutions of eigenvalues of beams and plates. However, some differences can also be observed for very large computational bandwidths. Some important conclusions are drawn at the end of this study.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, Honey Formation Optimization (HFO) Framework is proposed for design problems where the functions of the objective functions are known or under design. We applied HFO framework to three ABC variants, namely, ABC, GABC and ABC/Best/1 by adapting their local search strategies into HFO. Thus, 6 algorithms consisting of 3 ABC variants (ABC, GABC, ABC/Best/1) and 3 HFO variants (HFO-ABC, HFO-GABC, HFO-ABC/Best/1) are comparatively studied. The HFO-GABC and HFO-ABC/Best/1 algorithms are our new contributions to the literature. The HFO considers a food source consisting of multiple components, and models the honey formation inside bees as a process of mixing the components with their special enzymes according to a honey function. Each food source has its own associated honey form. Thus, HFO looks for the best honey form. HFO requires component design where component function measures the amount of component (component fitness) in a food source and the honey function maps the components to honey amount (quality) to measure the honey fitness. HFO generalises the ABC by considering worker bees that exploit only the selected components of the food sources. In this paper, the 6 algorithms are compared on the basis of 14 benchmark functions, alongside demonstration of the component design. The results show that HFO variants increase the exploitation and exploration abilities of ABC variants significantly.},

This paper targets at reducing the overall solution time of the classical AMG by improving the quality of the coarse-variable set obtained by the coarsening algorithm. We combine the classical coarsening algorithm with the compatible relaxation (CR)-based coarsening algorithm to construct the coarse-variable set. The combined coarsening algorithm constructs the coarse-variable set within two stages. In the first stage, a basic coarse-variable set is built by the classical coarsening algorithm, e.g., PMIS. In the second stage, the quality of the set is measured based on compatible relaxation, and the variables that converge slowly in the CR relaxation are added into the previous set. We test various model problems, as well as some linear equation systems arising from real applications, to verify the effectiveness of our method.},

In real ecosystems, however, species richness, which can be defined by spatial size and competition strength, can sensitively affect species coexistence as a competition among individuals becomes complicated. In this paper, we investigate the structural stability of coexistence of mobile species in three cyclic competition games due to network complexity in which imposes a size of a square lattice and competition strength among species. By exploiting the coexistence probability , our computations quantitatively reveal that the network complexity due to changes in the competition rate and lattice size can strongly affect the structural stability of coexistence in each model. In particular, intense intraspecific competition can yield the robust coexistence at small-sized lattices regardless of mobility, and strengthening interspecific competition simultaneously induces changes in critical mobility that hampers coexistence and in spatial size for stable coexistence. Qualitatively, we find that such structural stability of coexistence relates to the degree of stability of fixed points in deterministic systems. Our finding can be useful to gain insights into species coexistence on spatially extended systems with respect to network complexity.},

The plane wave, spherical wave and refracted wave approximations of local eikonal solver are used to simulate the seismic traveltimes, respectively. Then, a novel updating strategy based on Fermat principle is proposed to make the accurate choice of factor and traveltime, adaptively. The new algorithm can guarantee the high accuracy of traveltime simulation at the grid point not only near the source point, but also at a great distance from the source point. With the combination of global fast sweeping method, the traveltime simulation is unconditionally stable and all possible propagating directions of different seismic waves are considered to describe the complex propagating process due to the velocity model with sharp variations. Several numerical examples were solved to demonstrate that the adaptive finite-difference method can fulfill the accurate, efficient and robust simulation of first-arrival traveltimes.},

On the one hand, it can automatically adjust the amount of stored data to obtain a weighting error that more dependents on performance changes. On the other hand, its threshold is also adaptively changeable depending on system performance. Both make the strategy more accurately reflect changes in system performance requirements to trigger ‘more necessary’ events. Moreover, actual factors that stochastic cyber attacks and transmission delays are taken into account in the modeling of time-delay filtering error system. Based on Lyapunov functions and average dwell time approach, a set of criteria is provided to guarantee the realization of H ∞ H∞ performance of filtering error system. Furthermore, the sub-filter gains and DAS-ETS parameters can be calculated by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). At last, a numerical simulation is given to confirm the advantages of the proposed solution.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on designing an H ∞ H∞ load-frequency controller for power systems suffering from deception attacks based on the event-based secure control scheme. Firstly, to alleviate the occurrence of congestion phenomenon in the bandwidth-limited communication network, an event-triggered scheme is introduced into the sensor-to-controller channel. Subsequently, a mathematical model with regard to the event-triggered load frequency control is established under considering the existence of deception attacks. Then, in terms of Lyapunov stability theory and an improved inequality technique, some sufficient conditions that can ensure the mean-square asymptotic stability with a prescribed H ∞ H∞ performance index of the closed-loop system are deduced. Besides, the corresponding controller gain is obtained by solving those conditions. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we examine numerical solutions of Zakharov–Rubenchik system which is a coupled nonlinear partial differential equation . The numerical method in the current study is based on radial basis function finite difference (RBF-FD) meshless method and an explicit Runge–Kutta method. As a radial basis function we choose polyharmonic spline augmented with polynomials. The essential motivation for choosing polyharmonic spline is that it is free of shape parameter which has a crucial role in accuracy and stability of meshless methods. The main benefit of the proposed method is the approximation of the differential operators is performed on local-support domain which produces sparse differentiation matrices. This reduces computational cost remarkably. To see performance of the proposed method, some test problems are solved. L ∞ L∞ error norms and conserved quantities such as mass and energy are calculated. Numerical outcomes are presented and compared with other methods available in the literature. From the comparison it can be deduced that the proposed method gives reliable and precise results with low computational cost. Stability of the proposed method is also discussed.},

For this issue, the second-order differential equations are processed to establish the first-order ones by means of the variable transformation. Next, under the framework of drive-response, a mode dependent feedback controller is designed to implement passive synchronization of Markov switched inertial neural networks.

In this paper, we investigate the evolutionary outcomes with a stochastic evolutionary game dynamic that combined the imitation update rule and the average payoff-driven update rule in finite populations, in which both one-shot and iterated Prisoner’s dilemma game with positive assortment are implemented. The average abundance of cooperators is obtained through the transition probabilities and the properties of Markov chain. Both numerical and analytical results show that the effectiveness of the average payoff-driven update rule for the promotion of cooperation depends on whether there is a reciprocity mechanism in the system. In detail, average payoff-driven update rule is better than imitation update rule only when our model has one of the following three conditions: (1) small probability of the positive assortment; (2) small probability to the next round; (3) small probability of knowing one’s reputation. If the above conditions are not satisfied, then imitation update rule is most effective for the promotion of cooperation. We thus provide a deeper understanding for the effectiveness of these rules regarding the promotion of cooperation.},

Motivated by the aforementioned considerations and the advantages of the degenerate functionals, this paper aims to weaken the global Lipschitz condition for the delay parts of the drift coefficients and investigate the delay-dependent exponential stability and asymptotic boundedness for highly nonlinear Markov jump neutral SFDSs with the method of multiple degenerate functionals.

But in the realistic economy experiences, the participants’ conditions of complete rationality and information are usually hard to be fulfilled. The mutations, un-fixed mechanisms, and policy variations usually challenge the process of natural game evolution. In this work, we mainly study how to make the iterative transformation of policy updating rules to maximize their own benefits in the case of heterogeneous updating rules. In particular, a novel mutation mechanism is developed to study the cooperation situation in natural selection by introducing two different proportion groups in the population, one is based on imitation, the other is based on aspiration level, and both proportions can transform each other under certain conditions at the end of each generation. The mutation of the individual mechanism may occur, it is found that the population proportion and individual rule mutation rate have a strong stabilizing effect on population cooperation under this mixed mechanism, and the lower aspiration level has a certain promoting effect on cooperation as well.},

  abstract     = {The difference between conventional replicator dynamics and pairwise (PW) nonlinear Fermi dynamics can be discerned by studying the evolutionary dynamics of the interactions between the symmetric cyclic structure in the rock–paper–scissors game and inter- and intraspecific competitions. Often, conventional replicator models presume that the payoff difference among species is a linear function (a linear benefit). This study introduces a PW contrast under the properties of the well-known Fermi rule, where species play against one another in pairs. To model a PW nonlinear evolutionary environment (a nonlinear benefit) within this framework, both analytical and numerical approaches are applied. It is determined that the dynamics of the linear and nonlinear benefits can present the same stability conditions at equilibrium. Moreover, it is also demonstrated that, even in an identical equilibrium condition for both dynamics, the numerical result run by a deterministic approach presents a faster stability state for nonlinear benefit dynamics. This study also suggests that introducing mutation as demographic noise can effectively disrupt the phase regions and show the different relationships between linear and nonlinear dynamics. The symmetric bidirectional mutation among all the species reduced to the stable limit cycle by an arbitrary small mutation rate is also explored. Due to the environmental noise, however, linear and nonlinear exhibit the same steady state. Nevertheless, non-linearity illustrates more stable and faster stability situations. Our result suggests that environmental and demographic noise on the evolutionary dynamic framework can serve as a mechanism for supporting PW nonlinear dynamics in multi-species games.},

Secondly, a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is designed in consideration of the output constraint to prevent the considered system from escaping from the output constraint. Moreover, the output constraint can be either symmetric or asymmetric. Thirdly, by embedding the above BLF into the adding a power integrator technique, a SOSM controller can be eventually constructed for the SOSM dynamics with the mismatched uncertainty to solve the output constraint problem. The finite-time stability analysis is proved by Lyapunov theory. The simulation results considering the symmetric constraint as well as the asymmetric constraint are provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed control method.},

Because of the uncertainty of energy collection and the limitation of battery storage, the adversary needs to tailor jamming power to maximize finite and infinite horizon average estimation error covariance on the remote estimator side, respectively. The energy allocation problem of imperfect feedback is transformed into Markov decision process (MDP) of perfect acknowledgments via the iteration of state information.

  abstract     = {Multi-attribute decision making has become a topic of interest for scholars because it can comprehensively and effectively be used to make decisions in situations in which there are multiple homogeneous options. Attribute weighting is an important step and has a significant impact on decision-making, and the subjective weighting method is commonly used in reality. However, as experts have different knowledge, experiences, preferences and so on, the weights of attributes given by experts are subjective. So expert credibility affects the final weights, and the correctness of the weights calculated in this case cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, the dynamic expert credibility model (DECM) is proposed. First, based on the decision matrix and the weight evaluation matrix, the method for calculating distance-based expert credibility calculates the distance between expert evaluations via the score deviation and ranking deviation. Second, considering the differences in the weight evaluation matrix caused by changes in the individual background of the experts, the expert background change process (EBCP) is proposed. Third, the dynamic value of credibility before and after the EBCP can be calculated. To prove the validity of the model, a test method is proposed from the perspective of data envelopment analysis . Finally, evaluations on industrial economic benefits of 16 provinces or municipalities in China are conducted to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model in practice. Using the test, DECM effectively eliminates the influence of the weight calculation due to expert credibility. After the EBCP, the target value of the DECM reaches 6.0989 and the validity of attribute weights is improved by 2.30%. Compared with the traditional weight determination method, the decision-making result under the DECM is consistent.},

  abstract     = {Self-assembly of proteins towards amyloid aggregates is a significant event in many neurodegenerative diseases. Aggregates of low-molecular weight called oligomers are largely the primary toxic agents in many of these maladies. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in understanding their formation and behavior. In this paper, we build on our previously established theoretical investigations on the interactions between A β β and lipids (L) that induces off-pathway aggregates under the control of L concentrations. Here, our previously developed competing game theoretic framework between the on- and off-pathway dynamics has been expanded to understand the underlying network topological structures in the reaction kinetics of amyloid formation. The mass-action based dynamical systems are solved to identify dominant pathways in the system with fixed initial conditions, and variations in the occurrence of these dominant pathways are identified as a function of various seeding conditions. The mechanistic approach is supported by thermodynamic free energy computations which helps identify stable reactions. The resulting analysis provides possible intervention strategies that can draw the dynamics away from the off-pathways and potential toxic intermediates. We also draw upon the classic literature on network thermodynamics to suggest new approaches to better understand such complex systems.},

  abstract     = {The present study concerns the dynamics of ferrofluid droplets in a Newtonian fluid. The incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations are applied for the dynamics of the immiscible magnetic and Newtonian fluids while the Cahn-Hilliard (C-H) equation is adopted to describe the behavior of their interface. A magnetic field coupling lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is developed to solve both the NS equations and the C-H equation. Specially, a mass-correcting term is introduced into the C-H equation, which strongly enforces the mass conservation. The magnetic field is evaluated by a Poisson equation solver with a self-correcting procedure for the static Maxwell equations. The magnetic dipole force is transformed into the magnetic surface force by a rigorous mathematical procedure, which can physically describe the magnetic effect on the interface. Moreover, the magnetic force after this treatment becomes easy-to-implement, which can be directly incorporated into the external force term of the LB model. The capability of the present combination method to simulate the magnetic multiphase flows is demonstrated by three typical numerical examples, i.e., Laplace law for a stationary droplet, a stationary cylinder under an external uniform magnetic field, the deformation of a single ferrofluid droplet. Further, the merging process of multiple-ferrofluid-droplet system in organic oil is investigated. It is found that the elongation of ferrofluid droplet in the direction of magnetic field shows positive impact on the merging process when the orientation of ferrofluid droplets is parallel to the external magnetic field, while negative impact on the merging process when their orientation is perpendicular to the external magnetic field.},

A novel time-scale transformation is recommended which can change the original nonsingular prescribed-time stabilization problem into the finite-time stabilization problem of converted time-varying system. On basis of this, a new framework of studying state feedback stabilization within prescribed-time of SNSs is established with the aid of the common lyapunov function-based adding one power integrator (CLF-based-AOPI) technique. For arbitrary switchings, it is showed that the states of the closed-loop system (CLS) are rendered to zero in prescribed finite time.

  abstract     = {The impact of Zika virus (ZIKV) is a global public health issue and its severity is ongoing. It is primarily transmitted via mosquitoes and sexual contacts. Sexual transmission experiences a longer period and strongly depends on the topological structure of sexual networks. However, relatively little work has been done to explore the characteristics of ZIKV infection in sexual networks, and further control ZIKV by changing contact patterns between individuals. In this paper, using the settings of Costa Rica as a case study, we developed a heterosexual network-based model, to study the effect of changing the degree heterogeneity by the measure of deleting the sexual contacts of individuals with small number but large degree in the sexually active places at different time, on ZIKV spread. We obtained a threshold time, which is later than the peak time of ZIKV infected cases. If applied prior to the threshold time, the measure will inhibit ZIKV infection and lower the final size; surprisingly if past the threshold time, the measure will boost ZIKV infection and increase the final size. In addition, our model yielded higher cumulative infection among females, which is in line with observations. Our results provide some guidelines for preventing and controlling mosquito-human and sexual transmissions against ZIKV, particularly for countries with a high rate of sexually transmitted infections.},

Rigorous analysis is carried out to ensure the numerical stability of the compact aPC Crank-Nicolson finite difference method accomplished. Numerical results acquired are compared with solutions via standard Monte Carlo schemes (MCSs) and generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) with different random volatilities.

  abstract     = {The problems of Acoustic-Structural Interaction (ASI) are commonly encountered in the simulation of the thin-walled structures immersed in the fluid. This interaction can affect the acoustic properties of the fluid and the dynamic characteristics of the structure. In this paper, a Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS)-based Isogeometric Finite Element (FE) - Boundary Element (BE) symmetric coupling method is developed to study the ASI problems and the free vibration of the elastic structures submerged in the fluid. The geometry of the thin-walled structures is exactly modelled and discretized by utilizing the Isogeometric Reissner-Mindlin shell elements. This shell theory simplifies the continuity enforcement between NURBS patch boundaries. The Isogeometric Boundary Element Method (IGABEM) is applied to describe the acoustic field. In order to impose coupling constraints, a transformation equation of unknown variables on the interface between sound field and structure field is established, that is, sound pressure versus external force and particle velocity versus displacement. Different from the non-symmetric matrix obtained by the traditional direct BEM, a new variational formulation is introduced to obtain the symmetric coupling coefficient matrix, which maks this coupling approach suitable for a broad class of solvers and improves the robustness of the computation. The reliability and stability of the symmetric coupling method are verified by numerical examples considering acoustic and structural loadings. It is concluded that the symmetric coupling method possesses high accuracy, and can circumvent the limitation of traditional coupling method in solving open boundary problems.},

The heat transportation, velocity of the fluid, and the temperature behaviour toward the mixed convection of nanofluids are obtained from the simulation of the Galerkin finite element technique and the Navier-Stokes equations. The other surfaces are considered adiabatic as well as both sides of the lid-driven cavity. It should be noted that the Grashof number, the volume fraction of alumina-nanoparticles, and the differentially-moving vertical walls are fixed at 10 5 , 105, 0.02, the upward (right) and downward (left), respectively. To verify the computational code of derivation, the experimental and theoretical data from other researchers are compared. The results of the non-primitive variables, including the Richardson number, Reynolds number, number of undulations, dimensionless length, and the location of the heat source are compared. The numerical results indicate that larger values of the Richardson number and the Reynolds number enhance the rate of heat transfer. Not only two waves appear at the upper surface, but the heat source located at the centre with optimum height causes the entire cavity to have maximum heat transfer performance. The current problem is solved to benefit the installation of microelectronic cooling of a water-to-air heat exchanger or a pin-fin MHS heat transfer media.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines a new Noether theorem for Hamiltonian systems with Caputo Δ Δ derivatives based on fractional time-scales calculus, which overcomes the difficulties unified to study the Noether theorems of fractional continuous systems and fractional discrete systems. To begin with, the fractional time-scales definitions and properties with Caputo Δ Δ derivatives are introduced. Next, the fractional time-scales Hamilton canonical equations with Caputo Δ Δ derivatives are formulated. For the fractional time-scales Hamiltonian system, the definitions and criteria of Noether symmetries without transforming time and with transforming time are given, respectively. Furthermore, the corresponding Noether theorem without transforming time and its Noether theorem with transforming time are obtained. The latter one can reduce to the time-scales Noether theorem with Δ Δ derivatives or the fractional Noether theorem with Caputo derivatives for Hamiltonian systems. Finally, the fractional time-scales damped oscillator and Kepler problem are taken as examples to verify the correctness of the results.},

In 1983, Bouchet (JCTB) conjectured that every flow-admissible signed graph has flow number at most 6. This conjecture remains open for general signed graphs even for signed planar graphs. A Halin graph is a plane graph consisting of a tree without vertices of degree two and a circuit connecting all leaves of the tree. In this paper, we prove that every flow-admissible signed Halin graph has flow number at most 5, and determine the flow numbers of signed Halin graphs with a (3,1)-caterpillar tree as its characteristic tree.},

In this paper, a class of structure-preserving discontinuous Galerkin variational integrators (DGVIs) is presented. Start from the Pfaff action functional, the technique of variational integrators combined with discontinuous Galerkin time discretization is used to derive numerical schemes for Birkhoffian systems. For the derived DGVIs, symplecticity is proved rigorously through the preserving of particular 2-forms induced by these integrators. Linear stability and order of accuracy of the DGVIs are illustrated considering the example of linear damped oscillators. The order of accuracy and the property of preserving conserved quantities of the developed DGVIs are also confirmed by numerical examples. Comparisons are made with several numerical schemes such as backward/forward Euler, Runge–Kutta and RBF methods to show the advantages of DGVIs in preserving the Birkhoffians.},

  abstract     = {Neighborhood size is an important factor in the spatial prisoner’s dilemma game. Traditional static interaction range does not adapt to the dynamic social environment. Therefore, it is necessary to study the adaptive adjustment mechanism of the interaction range. In order to enhance the adaptability of individuals to the dynamic social environment, in this paper we propose an interaction range adjustment mechanism based on the aspiration of payoff. Specifically, the interaction range tends to expand according to a certain probability when the current actual payoff reaches or exceeds the aspired payoff. Otherwise, the interaction range will shrink with a certain probability. Simulation results show that such a mechanism of interaction range adjustment can remarkably promote cooperation. The probability of adjusting the interaction range has a great impact on cooperation evolution. Cooperation can be effectively established in a population in which individuals are with higher shrinkage and lower expansion probabilities. Moreover, the aspiration level is an important factor to affect the effectiveness of the interaction range adjustment. Larger aspiration level is more advantageous to promoting cooperation when the aspiration level is less than 1, while cooperators cannot survive when the aspiration level is larger than 1. The underlying mechanism is furthermore explored, revealing that the ‘isolation zones’ composed of individuals with zero interaction radius play an important role in promoting cooperation.},

Then, some new criteria that guarantee the systems’ stability and H ∞ H∞ disturbance attenuation performance are established in terms of linear matrix inequality .

  abstract     = {A simple and physically sound model has been proposed to investigate the transient free surface flow behavior in porous media. Instead of the continuum-based model, the pore space between solid grains is conceptualized as a network of horizontal and vertical flow paths and then the flow paths are characterized by straight line elements. Based on the Darcy&#39;s law and flux equivalence between the continuum-based model and line element model, equivalent hydraulic parameters and continuity equation are derived through the control volume. By introducing a local coordinate system, unified governing equations and equivalent boundary conditions of the line element model are obtained in the form of one-dimensional formulations. The two-dimensional transient free surface flow problem is reduced to a one-dimensional problem of line element network and a finite-element algorithm is developed. The proposed one-dimensional line element model is verified by three illustrative examples, which indicate that the numerical results can satisfactorily match the analytical solutions and experimental observations from different sources. It is found that the solution accuracy has weak sensitivity of time-step size but sensitive to the spacing size, while numerical efficiency can be well guaranteed for different time-step sizes and spacing sizes. Based on the numerical results, the proposed model can give better performance for the evolution of free surfaces than the residual flow procedure, and is efficient to model transient surface flow with a complex drainage system.},

  abstract     = {Hairtail, Trichiurus Lepturus , is the major fishery resource in Korea and so has been occupying a large portion of total catches for a longtime. However, since the 1980s, the catch has fallen sharply. A climatic change and over-fishing of immature hairtails have decreased the resource in Korea Sea, which caused reduction in the catch. So, we should analyze this phenomenon and need to manage them. Thus, in this study, we first propose a discrete time age-structured model of hairtails from their biological features. Especially, since hairtail is the representative fish with characteristics of cannibalism in the marine ecosystem, we set the recruitment as Ricker type. Furthermore, for the environmental effect on its spawning, the sea surface temperature in the spawning ground is included in the model. Next, we find an optimal harvesting strategy for preserving the immature hairtails while simultaneously maximizing the corresponding profit of the fishing. The discrete-time optimal control problem is conducted as the extension of Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle to discrete system. Moreover, to suggest the optimal harvesting strategy in the future, the forecast of sea surface temperature should be accompanied. This is carried out by wavelet-ARIMA forecasting method. By using numerical simulations, we obtain that in the perspective of conservation, the limited fishing is the best for management of hairtails. On the other hand, in terms of balance between the conservation and economic profits, the optimal harvesting strategy is better than the limited fishing.},

The smallest integer k such that G admits a star edge-coloring with k colors is the star chromatic index of G . In the seminal paper on the topic, Dvořák, Mohar, and Šámal asked if the star chromatic index of complete graphs is linear in the number of vertices and gave an almost linear upper bound. Their question remains open, and consequently, to better understand the behavior of the star chromatic index, this parameter has been studied for a number of other classes of graphs. In this paper, we consider star edge-colorings of square grids; namely, the Cartesian products of paths and cycles and the Cartesian products of two cycles. We improve previously established bounds and, as a main contribution, we prove that the star chromatic index of graphs in both classes is either 6 or 7 except for prisms. Additionally, we give a number of exact values for many considered graphs.},

  abstract     = {The average abundance function reflects the level of cooperation in the population. So it is important to analyze how to increase the average abundance function in order to facilitate the proliferation of cooperative behavior. The characteristics of average abundance function based on multi-player threshold public goods evolutionary game model under redistribution mechanism have been explored by analytical analysis and numerical simulation in this article. The main research findings contain four aspects. Firstly, we deduce the concrete expression of expected payoff function. In addition, we obtain the intuitive expression of average abundance function by taking the detailed balance condition as the point of penetration. Secondly, we obtain the approximate expression of average abundance function when selection intensity is sufficient small. In this case, average abundance function can be simplified from composite function to linear function. In addition, this conclusion will play a significant role when analyzing the results of the numerical simulation. Thridly, we deduce the approximate expression of average abundance function when selection intensity is large enough. Because of this approximation expression, the range of summation will be reduced, the number of operations for average abundance function will be reduced, and the operating efficiency for numerical simulation will be improved. Fourthly, we explore the influences of parameters (the size of group d , multiplication factor r , cost c , aspiration level α and the proportion of income redistribution τ ) on the average abundance function through numerical simulation. Also the corresponding results have been explained based on the expected payoff function and function h ( i, ω ). It can be concluded that when selection intensity ω is small, the effects of parameters ( d, r, c, α and τ ) on average abundance function is slight. When selection intensity ω is large, there will be five conditions. (1) Average abundance function will decrease with d regardless of whether threshold m is small or large. (2) Average abundance function will decrease at first and then increase with r when threshold m is small. Average abundance function will increase with r when threshold m is large. (3) Average abundance function will basically remain unchanged with c regardless of whether threshold m is small or large. (4) Average abundance function will remain stable at first and then increase with α when threshold m is small. Average abundance function will remain stable at first and then decrease with α when threshold m is large. It should be noted that average abundance function will get close to 1/2 when α is large enough. (5) Average abundance function will increase with τ regardless of whether threshold m is small or large.},

This recently developed topological index can predict total surface area for octane isomers. It is known that the star S n uniquely minimizes the ISI index among n -vertex trees. However, characterizing n -vertex tree(s) with maximal ISI index (optimal trees, for convenience) appears to be difficult. There are even no sound conjectures on their structure up to now. Let π be a degree sequence , and C ( π ) C(π) the set of connected graphs whose degree sequence is π . In the present paper, it is proven that, there exists a so-called BFS-graph that maximizes the ISI index in C ( π ) C(π) . This enables us to conduct a computer search for n -vertex optimal tree(s) up to n = 150 n=150 . Based on the search outputs, some structural properties of an optimal tree are observed and proven. Finally, some problems and conjectures are proposed, which may indicate the directions for further work towards the complete characterization of optimal trees.},

In an earlier work, we represented this phenomenon by dividing the dynamical process of knowledge transmission into initial and retransmission stages, and applied mean field theory to identify an approximate condition for knowledge survival on homogeneous networks. In this work we move beyond our earlier, approximate results for homogeneous networks to provide rigorous results applicable to complex networks of arbitrary topology - including heterogeneous real world social networks. Specifically, we extend the Intertwined Continuous Markov Chain (ICMC) and Probabilistic Discrete Markov Chain (PDMC) models to address the Naive-Evangelical-Agnostic-Evangelical (VEAE) knowledge transmission process in complex networks. We identify the corresponding basic reproduction number R 0 , the quantity which dictates whether or not knowledge survives, and deduce simple upper and lower bounds for this measure. Moreover, simulations are performed to verify both the theoretical results, and the mutual consistency of the ICMC, PDMC and Monte Carlo methods . The simulations demonstrate that the initial transmission process directly affects the initial rate of change of the number of evangelical individuals, but has no effect on evangelical density in the steady state. However, the retransmission process has a direct effect on the steady state density of evangelical individuals.},

  abstract     = {Conflicts occur when different parties have different evaluations regarding the resolution of some issue and each one of them can change the conflict scenario in more than one way. These conflicts may occur at various levels from the personal scale to conflicts involving large blocks of countries and various types of conflict costs might be involved, such as: economic, social and environmental. In many situations, offering incentives to alter the preferences of some decision makers (DMs) might be an effective way to achieve desirable stable scenarios. The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) is a model that has long been used to model and analyze conflicts because it is flexible and easy to calibrate. The purpose of this paper is to present ideas on how to work with the inverse GMCR to optimize costs in changing the preferences of each DM to achieve desired equilibrium states within the conflict. We propose some methods to aggregate costs of changing DMs’ preferences. The purpose is to determine the lowest aggregate cost of preference changes that makes a given desired state an equilibrium according to a given stability notion. Besides formally describing the problem, we study some properties of the minimum costs for different stability notions and show that the computational complexity of the optimal preference manipulation problem is NP-hard. We apply this method to analyze the Cuban missile conflict.},

Based on this intuition, we use the voluntary prisoner&#39;s dilemma (VPD) game as the mathematical model to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of cooperation among different populations. By using parameter α as a key quantity that takes into account the strength of connections between populations, we observe that a fascinating spiral pattern is spontaneously formed, adding a new population always brings additional prey to cooperators in other populations, leading to competing spatial dynamics and pattern formation. Moreover, the system gradually changes from the C + D + L state to the C + D state and finally to the full C state. The inherent cyclic dominance of the strategies results in the self-organization of populations on the square lattice and ultimately effectively promotes cooperation. Our work emphasizes that the complexity of the evolutionary dynamics of structural populations is significantly increased by the simultaneous existence of different populations.},

By using neural networks , the unknown nonlinear functions of the system under consideration are approximated, while its unmeasurable states are estimated by establishing a switched observer. Furthermore, the “explosion of complexity” issue, which arises from the derivatives of virtual controllers, is addressed with the command filter method. In order to reduce filter errors and overcome the drawbacks of the most traditional approaches, such as the ones based on dynamic surface control techniques, an error compensation mechanism was developed. In summary, by taking advantage of the command filter approach, backstepping algorithm, and average dwell time method, an adaptive NNs fault-tolerant controller is established for the system under consideration. Finally, the designed controller has the ability to make the reference signal which can be tracked by the output of the system as close as possible and the boundness of all signals within the closed-loop system can be guaranteed. The usefulness of the designed controller is illustrated by the simulation example.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies how the purchase of insurance policies against epidemic security risks, a voluntary strategy of individuals, impacts the controlling of epidemic security risk propagation in networks and the profit of the insurer. For this purpose, we first formulated a modified agent-based framework that characterizes the coupled dynamics of individual security-protection investment behaviors and epidemic security risk propagation process, to study the effectiveness of insurance policies. Second, we proposed a novel insurance policy that follows the designed “precaution and dynamic post-indemnity” (PDPI) principle, taking the correlated and interdependent characteristics of epidemic security risks into account. We determined how the PDPI insurance policy affects security-protection investment coverage and epidemiological dynamics by tuning the allocation coefficient of insurance funds α and the ratio between the premium and the cost of investment R . The results indicated that, although insurance policies have negative influences on voluntary investment behaviors, the risk propagation can be controlled effectively by appropriate combination of α and R , because the precaution mechanism in the PDPI insurance policy can counteract this side effect by guaranteeing the security-protection investment coverage among insured individuals with larger degrees. We further found that, although the insurance policy cannot lead to the maximal profit when the policy has the best performance on risk propagation prevent, the insurer still can earn positive profits. Finally, some effective PDPI insurance policies against specific investment costs are given. The models and findings shed new and meaningful insights into designing and measuring effective insurance policies associated with security-protection investment in controlling the propagation of epidemic security risks.},

  abstract     = {Forward–backward methods are valid tools to solve a variety of optimization problems where the objective function is the sum of a smooth, possibly nonconvex term plus a convex, possibly nonsmooth function. The corresponding iteration is built on two main ingredients: the computation of the gradient of the smooth part and the evaluation of the proximity (or resolvent) operator associated with the convex term. One of the main difficulties, from both implementation and theoretical point of view, arises when the proximity operator is computed in an inexact way. The aim of this paper is to provide new convergence results about forward–backward methods with inexact computation of the proximity operator, under the assumption that the objective function satisfies the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property. In particular, we adopt an inexactness criterion which can be implemented in practice, while preserving the main theoretical properties of the proximity operator. The main result is the proof of the convergence of the iterates generated by the forward–backward algorithm in Bonettini et al. (2017) to a stationary point. Convergence rate estimates are also provided. At the best of our knowledge, there exists no other inexact forward–backward algorithm with proved convergence in the nonconvex case and equipped with an explicit procedure to inexactly compute the proximity operator.},

  abstract     = {In the Galerkin weak form technique based on various kernels that they do not have δ -Kronecker property, in order to apply the essential boundary condition, there are two straight strategies that one of them is the Lagrange multiplier method and another one is the penalty method. In the penalty method the main boundary value problem (BVP) is converted to a new BVP with Robin boundary condition. So, we obtain a new BVP that it must be solved. The main purpose of this paper is to propose an error analysis to verify that the solutions of penalty method obtained by applying the essential boundary condition are convergent to the solution of main BVP with essential boundary condition. For this aim, we select fractional modified distributed-order anomalous sub-diffusion equation. At the first stage, we propose a second-order difference scheme for the temporal variable. The convergence and stability analysis for the time-discrete scheme are proposed. At the second stage, we derive the full-discrete scheme based on the Galerkin weak form and shape functions of reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) as the mentioned shape functions do not have the δ -Kronecker property. Furthermore, it is shown that when the penalty parameter goes to infinity then the solutions of BVP with Robin boundary condition are convergent to the solutions of BVP based on the essential boundary condition. The proposed examples verify that the present error estimate is true.},

  abstract     = {Many papers have applied the meshless method to approximate a function by using a set of scattered data. To use a meshless method, we need to predefine a positive real number as a radius of the local sphere or a positive integer as the number of interior points. This is while the effect of a fixed number as the radius of a local sphere or as the number of interior points could be different for different parts of a complex domain. This paper contains the construction of ellipsoidal neighborhoods for the meshless interpolation and approximation methods with local support functions and local behavior. By using these new neighborhoods, the trend of local data could be found easily. The advantage of this method over the current methods is the use of ellipsoidal local neighborhoods which include points with the most impact on the approximation of the function. We applied these methods to the data of the daily temperature and humidity of Alberta, Canada.},

  abstract     = {The paper aims to investigate the H ∞ H∞ control problem for systems perturbed by jump random noise, i.e., Poisson-driven stochastic systems (SSs). Firstly, this paper uses the Doob-Meyer decomposition and measure theory to give a model transformation method, and Poisson-driven SSs, which are SSs driven by semi-martingale, are transformed into SSs driven by compensated Poisson process. Since SSs driven by compensated Poisson process are SSs driven by martingale, we can use effective properties and tools in martingale theory to investigate the H ∞ H∞ control problem. Secondly, this paper utilizes martingale theory to deal with the jump item and the sum of stochastic integrals (SIs) with respect to (w.r.t.) the continuous part of states in Itô formula, and then gives an equivalent Itô formula for SDEs driven by compensated Poisson process. Thirdly, on the basis of these, this paper presents a simple H ∞ H∞ controller design method. Furthermore, the design criterion contains information about the average number of jump random events in a unit time, and one can utilize convex optimization algorithm to estimate the maximum average number of jump random events in a unit time, which the closed-loop system can tolerate to achieve the stability and H ∞ H∞ performance. Finally, the usefulness of the design result is verified by two numerical examples .},

Our setting is a multi-period one, where the aim is to make a plan for allocating all of wealth among the n assets within a time horizon of m periods. In addition, the investor can rebalance the portfolio at the beginning of each period. We develop a model in Markowitz context, based on a fused lasso approach. According to it, both wealth and its variation across periods are penalized using the l 1 norm, so to produce sparse portfolios, with limited number of transactions. The model leads to a non-smooth constrained optimization problem, where the inequality constraints are aimed to guarantee at least a minimum level of expected wealth at each date. We solve it by using split Bregman method, that has proved to be efficient in the solution of this type of problems. Due to the additive structure of the objective function, the alternating split Bregman at each iteration yields to easier subproblems to be solved, which either admit closed form solutions or can be solved very quickly. Numerical results on data sets generated using real-world price values show the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

We also show that every planar perihamiltonian graph of connectivity k contains a vertex of degree k . This strengthens a theorem of Thomassen, and entails that if in a polyhedral graph of minimum degree at least 4 the set of vertices whose removal yields a non-hamiltonian graph is independent, the graph itself must be hamiltonian. Finally, while we here prove that there are infinitely many polyhedral perihamiltonian graphs containing no adjacent cubic vertices, whether an analogous result holds for the hypohamiltonian case remains open.},

The effect of seasonal changes in weather on the malaria transmission is considered by applying a non-autonomous model where mosquito birth, death and biting rates are time-dependent. We show that the global dynamics of the system is determined by the basic reproduction number , which we define as the spectral radius of a linear integral operator. For values of the basic reproduction number less than unity, the disease-free periodic solution is globally asymptotically stable, while if R 0 &gt; 1 , R0&amp;gt;1, then the disease remains endemic in the population.

Assisted by the estimated terms, a robust non-fragile tracking control protocol that takes into account communication delays is proposed to eliminate the influence of the combined input signal. With the help of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, a delay-dependent sufficient criterion is established to ensure that the resulting tracking error system states are uniformly bounded. On the basis of this criterion, the design procedure of the considered non-fragile control gain and the intermediate estimator gain matrices are presented.

We first derive an optimization formulation for matrix recovery under the considered model and propose a novel algorithm, called A lternating T ikhonov regularization and Las so (A-T-LAS 2,1 ), to solve it. The algorithm is based on a multi-penalty regularization, which is able to leverage both structures (low-rankness and sparsity) simultaneously. The algorithm is a fast first order method, and straightforward to implement. We prove global convergence for any linear measurement model to stationary points and local convergence to global minimizers . By adapting the concept of restricted isometry property from compressed sensing to our novel model class, we prove error bounds between global minimizers and ground truth, up to noise level, from a number of subgaussian measurements scaling as R ( s 1 + s 2 ) , R(s1+s2), up to log-factors in the dimension, and relative-to-diameter distortion. Simulation results demonstrate both the accuracy and efficacy of the algorithm, as well as its superiority to the state-of-the-art algorithms in strong noise regimes and for matrices whose singular vectors do not possess exact (joint-) sparse support.},

We mainly analyze the effects of link weight boundary control parameter and link weight adjustment amplitude on the evolution of fairness. Through Monte Carlo simulations , we find that the coevolutionary mechanism of game strategy and link weight can promote the emergence of fairness. More specifically, the fairness is strikingly promoted with the increase of the link weight boundary control parameter, while the influence of link weight adjustment amplitude is not so significant. Moreover, the introduction of this coevolutionary mechanism results in heterogeneous link weight distribution, and the larger link weight boundary control parameter can generate a higher network heterogeneity.},

Based on the Lie algebra technique in nonlinear control theory, a discrete-time predictor-based multi-rate sampled-data state feedback control law with a series expansion form is proposed to ensure that the resulting system is globally asymptotically stable under some conditions. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed control algorithm just needs to know the approximate prediction of state variables, and the faster decrease of Lyapunov function may be provided for each subsystem. Performance of approximate versions of the proposed controller is given by theoretical analyses. It is showed that the approximate controllers achieve practical stability of the sampled-data closed-loop system. Finally, the obtained stabilization results are applied to a trajectory tracking problem for a high-order planar system.},

In the temporal direction, the time derivative is approximated by the backward-Euler method and the first-order convolution quadrature is used for the discretization of the Riemann-Liouville (R-L) fractional integral terms. Then a fully discrete scheme is constructed with the discretization of space via the Sinc approximation based on the double exponential (DE) transformation. The convergence analysis of proposed method is obtained. Some numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Meanwhile, the results via employing the single exponential (SE) transformation are provided to be compared with our method in order to manifest the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

With the combination of time scale mechanism which bridges the feedback between strategy-updating time scale and the performance of individuals, we find that influential cooperators locating at medium- or small-degrees are able to spread their behaviors among neighbors in a more efficient way than hubs with large-degrees. Hence, collective influence with proper path length can efficiently identify influencers and may promote the emergence of cooperation on heterogeneous interaction networks.},

  abstract     = {How cooperation could have evolved is a puzzle for evolutionary ecologists. If cooperators try to keep the partnership with those who cooperated and try to break the partnership with those who defected, the evolution of cooperation can be facilitated by natural selection. In dyadic relationships, the number of the opponent player is only one and the situation is simple; therefore, it is obvious how players should behave. When more than two individuals make interactions, the situation under which both cooperators and defectors are contained in the opponent players can take place. Thus, the situation becomes complicated, and under such circumstances it is not intuitive how players should behave. Previous theoretical work studied the case where players can choose either to try to keep the partnership or try to break the partnership based on what the opponent players did, in social interactions involving more than two individuals, and investigated the evolution of tolerance. However, all of the previous studies only dealt with a disbandment rule in which the interaction stops if at least one player hopes to break the partnership with the current partners (i.e., one vote is enough to dissolve a group). In this article, we study the evolution of tolerance for a variety of disbandment rules, in which the interaction can continue even if somebody hopes to break the partnership with the current partners. By analyzing three-player prisoner&#39;s dilemma games, we reveal that the evolution of tolerance can be sensitive to different disbandment rules.},

Taking as a basis the Adapted PageRank Algorithm for monoplex networks with data and the two-layer PageRank approach, an algorithm for biplex networks is designed with two main characteristics. First, it solves the drawback of the existence of isolated nodes in any of the layers. Second, the algorithm allows us to choose the value of the parameter α controlling the importance assigned to the network topology and the data associated to the nodes in the Adapted PageRank Algorithm, respectively. The proposed algorithm inherits this ability to determine the importance of node attribute data in the calculation of the centrality; yet, going further, it allows to choose different α values for each of the two layers. The biplex algorithm is then generalised to the case of multiple layers, that is, for multiplex networks. Its possibilities and characteristics are demonstrated using a dataset of aggregate origin-destination flows of private cars in Rome . This dataset is augmented with attribute data describing city locations. In particular, a biplex network is constructed by taking the data about car mobility for layer 1. Layer 2 is generated from data describing the local bus transport system. The algorithm establishes the most central locations in the city when these layers are intertwined with the location attributes in the biplex network. Four cases are evaluated and compared for different values of the parameter that modulates the importance of data in the network.},

Owing to several reasons, a bilinear relation between the fluid velocity and the pressure gradient is considered, and the problem can be seen as an extension of a special one-phase free boundary problem reported in literature to a two-phase situation. An analytical solution for the problem is established based on the similarity type general solution of the governing equation. The analytical solution contains an unknown coefficient , which describes the free boundary movement and needs to be determined by a nonlinear equation , and the existence and uniqueness of this coefficient is proven. A numerical solution is also developed using the finite volume method , and special attention is spent on the two control volumes near the free boundary location so as to track the movement of the free boundary accurately. Computational examples are presented. The application of the analytical solution as a benchmark is introduced, and the accuracy of the numerical solution is verified. The non-Darcy flow for boreholes with different radii is studied, and the error caused by neglecting the size of borehole is discussed. The non-Darcy flow with a bilinear relation is compared with that with a threshold pressure gradient, and the error caused by neglecting the permeability under low pressure gradients is analyzed.},

A universal analog-digital hybrid mechanism is proposed, in which an analog chaotic system is introduced to construct digital chaos. Meanwhile, in order to achieve secure synchronization, the impulsive synchronization signals generated by the constructed digital chaotic systems have been used to control the local analog chaotic systems instead of sending a driving signal to the receiver. Remarkably, a previously unknown chaotic attractor has been discovered under such mutual control. The matching theoretical analyses are given to guarantee the validity of the constructed digital chaos and the synchronization of the analog chaotic systems. Simulation studies of a concrete scheme are conducted to illustrate the universality of the hybrid mechanism.},

In particular, in this setting, there are a coupling of independent jobs arriving online over time with the flexibility of rejection, which implies that each job will be either accepted and scheduled on one of identical machines or rejected at the cost of penalty cost. Our objective is minimizing the total completion time of the accepted jobs plus the total penalty cost of the rejected jobs. For this problem, we design a deterministic polynomial time semi-online algorithm entitled as α Delayed Shortest Processing Time with Rejection (ADSPTR).

In order to prolong operational time and enhance mission completion efficiency subject to limited onboard power, a switching threshold event-triggered strategy is embedded in controller-to-actuator and sensor-to-controller channels, where switching threshold event-triggered based extended state observers (SET-ESO) are respectively established in the trajectory and attitude subsystems to accomplish the real-time estimation of linear velocity, angular velocity along with lumped disturbances using intermittent measurements, and the quantitative analysis between the ultimate observation error and parameters of SET-ESO is revealed. Based on the estimation results, an event-triggered output feedback control law including a robust compensation term is established to realize an anti-disturbance time-varying trajectory tracking without involving Zeno phenomena. Moreover, to eliminate severe fluctuations at the transient inherent in traditional prescribed performance control (TPPC) with a fast convergent rate, a tracking differentiator-based prescribed performance control (TDPPC) mechanism is exploited to ensure the trajectory state converge to a pre-given region with a preassigned prescribed time, such that a smooth and pre-specified finite-time tracking capability independent of control parameters is preserved. Next, with the aid of Lyapunov synthesis, all the signals involved in the closed-loop quadrotor system are proved to be bounded, and the preassigned time performance constraints are not violated. The simulation and comparison results are shown to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

The primary objective of this work is to synthesis a resilient controller such that the underlying MJSs is stochastically stable while meeting an expected ( Q , S , R ) − ϑ (Q,S,R)−ϑ dissipative performance index in the presence of ROCGFs. First and foremost, the randomly occurring actuator faults (ROAFs) and their failures rates are characterized by a series of mutually independent stochastic variables that satisfy prescribed probabilistic distributions for each actuator. The distortion degree and failure rate of each actuator can be quantized and calculated with the help of mathematical variance and expectation respectively. Secondly, the sampling controller with stochastically variable operation periods is considered and just assumed to switch between two different values in stochastic circumstances with certain probability. Thirdly, the nonfragile controller gain fluctuations also happens in a random framework which are obedient to Bernoulli distribution sequence (BDS). Fourthly, by resorting to an appropriately Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) and adopting matrix inequality decoupling technique, several sufficient conditions for the solvability of the addressed problem are eventually formulated in the shape of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Ultimately, three real-life numerical examples are exploited to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the presented theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {For nonlinear Kalman filtering , process noise and observation noise affect the accuracy of system filtering, and filtering accuracy is related to observable degree. That is, the calculation of observable degree will be affected by process noise and observation noise. Traditional solutions for observable degree of nonlinear systems do not take noise into account. In this paper, the observable degree theory is solved by using the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound and the Lie derivative in differential geometry theory. The process noise and the observation noise are taken into account in the calculation matrix of the nonlinear observable degree. The paper proposes a new method based on condition number fusion. The iterative algorithm is used to make the condition number of the fused matrix reach the minimum value. In the result, the error of observable degree calculation can be reduced. The validity of the proposed method is verified by simulation, and the calculation theory of nonlinear observable degree is improved.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to investigate the event-triggered adaptive dynamic surface full state constraints control for a class of stochastic nonlinear systems with Markov jumping parameters. Using the backstepping method, we propose two adaptive dynamic surface controllers with average dwell time and the event-triggered strategies simultaneously. The existed assumption of stochastic input-to-state stability (ISS) on the stochastic systems can be avoided by adding a correction terms into the controller to compensate for the measurement error. The method designed in this work can make all signals remain bounded in probability , all the states satisfy the constraints in probability and the tracking error signals eventually converge to the compact set in the sense of mean quartic value (SMQV) for closed-loop stochastic Markov jump nonlinear uncertain system. Furthermore, the designed relative threshold strategy which relies on the control signal reduces the frequency of events triggered. Finally, the validity of put forward method is shown in simulation results.},

The feasibility of the method relies on closed form formulae for cumulants and moments recovered from the Laplace transform of the probability density function and using the algebra of formal power series. To improve the approximation, sufficient conditions on cumulants are stated. The resulting procedure is made easier to implement by the symbolic calculus and a rational choice of the polynomial degree depending on skewness, kurtosis and hyperskewness. Some case studies coming from neuronal and financial fields show the goodness of the approximation even for a low number of terms. Open problems are addressed at the end of the paper.},

Regardless of the reason, however, moving frequently also means alienation, which in turn means bearing costs for seeking new opportunities. With this motivation, we study a prisoner’s dilemma game, where individuals with defectors in their communities either move or update their strategy. We find that the alienation from defectors reinforces larger and more compact cooperative clusters. However, the number of cooperative clusters depends on the viscosity of the interaction network, where network reciprocity still works well. And it is the fine-tuned interplay between the mobility to alienate from defectors and a still functioning network reciprocity that works best in promoting cooperation. Our results suggest that a limited mobility of minorities could spare public resources in social dilemma situations more effectively than reward and punishment.},

New classes of similarity are obtained and compared with Freudenthal’s simplicial class. The degeneracy measure of each simplicial class grows up to infinity when the dimensions of the Euclidean spaces increase unboundedly. Naturally, the question arises: how fast degenerate the elements from each simplicial class? To give an answer to this question we calculate the exact rate of divergence for all considered sequences of simplicial classes. Analytic relations between the investigated simplicial classes are proved. Examples supporting the theoretical results are presented. The cosine of the abstract angle between multidimensional finite element spaces is calculated in the isotropic and anisotropic cases. The dependence of the Cauchy–Bunyakovsky–Schwarz (CBS) constant on the shape of the used elements is illustrated. We confirm the Brandts et al.

At the best, the earlier studies on this topic avoided the incidence of inhomogeneous waves. On the other hand, in recent times, each study is found to be forcing the isotropic elastic Snell’s law to define the anisotropic propagation of inhomogeneous reflected waves. To illustrate the common mistakes committed, this study revisits and corrects a previous work on reflection at the boundary of an orthotropic thermoelastic medium. For chosen directions of propagation with attenuation, a real finite parameter represents the inhomogeneity. A complex slowness vector is specified to define the propagation of inhomogeneous incident wave. In this incidence, horizontal slowness determines the slowness vectors for all reflected waves. For each reflected wave, the corresponding slowness vector is resolved to define its phase direction, phase velocity and attenuation coefficients. The slowness vectors of incident and reflected waves define the aggregate wave-field in thermoelastic medium. Appropriate boundary conditions on this wave-field determines the amplitude ratios and phase shifts for reflected waves relative to the incident wave. A square matrix of order four determines the partition of incident energy flux among the reflected waves.},

This is done in a Monte Carlo simulation setting, based on a theoretical hedging framework discussed in existing literature. We look at hedging CVA market risk for a portfolio with European options on a stock, first in a Black-Scholes setting, then in a Merton jump-diffusion setting. Furthermore, we analyze the trading business at a bank after including xVAs in pricing. We provide insights into the hedging of derivatives and their xVAs by analyzing and visualizing the cash-flows of a portfolio from a desk structure perspective. The case study shows that not charging CVA at trade inception results in an expected loss. Furthermore, hedging CVA market risk is crucial to end up with a stable trading strategy. In the Black-Scholes setting this can be done using the underlying stock, whereas in the Merton jump-diffusion setting we need to add extra options to the hedge portfolio to properly hedge the jump risk. In addition to the simulation, we derive analytical results that explain our observations from the numerical experiments.

Under the proposed control strategy, unknown time delays are estimated with the help of adaptation mechanism and projection operator, which abandons the use of the conventional Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method and avoids the discussion of controller singularity problem. It is mentioned that most of current reported results on adaptive control of nonlinear delay systems under fuzzy approximation are semi-globally bounded. To achieve the asymptotic control objective , the upper bounds of approximation errors and other residual errors are properly estimated by establishing appropriate adaptive laws. Based on the estimation information of time delays and errors bounds, a novel adaptive sliding tracking control scheme is developed such that the tracking error will be forced to keep sliding along the origin once the upper bounds are reached. Therefore, the asymptotic tracking control objective is achieved. Simulation example verifies the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {The knuckleball is perhaps the most enigmatic pitch in baseball. Relying on the presence of raised seams on the surface of the ball to create asymmetric flow, a knuckleball’s trajectory has proven very challenging to predict compared to other baseball pitches, such as fastballs or curveballs. Previous experimental tracking of large numbers of knuckleballs has shown that they can move in essentially any direction relative to what would be expected from a drag-only trajectory. This has led to speculation that knuckleballs exhibit chaotic motion. Here we develop a relatively simple model of a knuckleball that includes quadratic drag and lift from asymmetric flow which is taken from experimental measurements of slowly rotating baseballs. Our models can indeed exhibit dynamical chaos as long as torque on the ball from the asymmetric flow is included. In contrast, models that omit torques on the ball in flight do not show chaotic behavior. Uncertainties in the phase space position of the knuckleball are shown to grow by factors as large as 10 6 over the flight of the ball from the pitcher to home plate. We quantify the impact of our model parameters on the chaos realized in our models, specifically showing that maximum Lyapunov exponent is roughly proportional to the square root of the effective lever arm of the torque, and also roughly proportional to the initial velocity of the pitch. We demonstrate the existence of bifurcations that can produce changes in the location of the ball when it reaches the plate of as much as 1.2 m for specific initial conditions similar to those used by professional knuckleball pitchers. As we introduce additional complexity in the form of more faithful representations of the empirical asymmetry force measurements, we find that a larger fraction of the possible initial conditions result in dynamical chaos. The chaotic behavior seen in our simplified model combined with the additional complex and nonlinear effects likely present in real knuckleballs provide strong evidence that knuckleballs are in fact chaotic, and that the chaotic uncertainty is likely a significant factor in the unpredictability of the pitch.},

Adopting canonical coordinates to fix the initial/final point and tangent, a closed-form solution for a two-parameter family of interpolants to the given data can be constructed in terms of degree 7 Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) space curves, and continuity of the torsion is also obtained when one of the parameters is set to zero. The geometrical properties of these closed-loop PH curves are elucidated, and certain symmetry properties and degenerate cases are identified. The two-parameter family of closed-loop​ C 2 C2 PH curves is also used to construct certain swept surfaces and tubular surfaces, and a selection of computed examples is included to illustrate the methodology.},

As an application, the complete Lie group classification is performed up to the equivalence transformations for all special cases of the coefficients. Some similarity reductions are obtained for implicit cases. The analytical invariant subspace method is used in order to find some exact solutions. The work is concluded by the fractional Chebyshev pseudo-spectral (FCPS) method for constructing a numerical simulation for some of the reduced equations in the symmetry analysis section.},

By simulating the model numerically, we observe the chaotic behaviours of the model. We find that the system has chaotic behaviours over a wide range of the values of the system parameters. The numerical results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed controllers.

To compare γ with γ ^ L γ^L specific mapping ϕ : I → I ^ ϕ:I→I^ must also be selected. For certain applications and theoretical considerations ϕ ϕ should be an injective mapping (e.g. in length estimation of γ which fits Q m ). We justify two sufficient conditions yielding ϕ as injective and analyze their asymptotic representatives for Q m getting dense . The algebraic constraints established here are also geometrically visualized with the aid of Mathematica 2 D and 3 D plots. Examples illustrating the latter and numerical investigation for the convergence rate in length estimation of γ are also supplemented. The reparameterization issue has its applications among all in computer graphics and robot navigation for trajectory planning once e.g. a new curve γ ˜ = γ ∘ ϕ γ˜=γ∘ϕ controlled by the appropriate choice of interpolation knots and ϕ (and/or possibly Q m ) needs to be constructed.},

To prove that the proposed filled function satisfies the filling properties required by the filled function definition, the analytical properties are explored.

In this paper, we define an analogue version of this transform in discrete Hermitian Clifford analysis, where functions are defined on a grid rather than the continuous space. This new transform is based on the classical definition, in combination with a discrete version of the Gaussian function and discrete counterparts of the classical Hermite polynomials . Furthermore, a discrete Weierstrass space with appropriate inner product is constructed, for which the discrete Hermite polynomials form a basis. In this setting, we also investigate the behaviour of the discrete delta functions and check if they are elements of this newly defined Weierstrass space.},

This work, based on Biot viscosity-extended theory, investigates the torsional vibrations of infinite fully saturated, axial-symmetric, poroelastic cylinders. Two complex frequency equations are obtained when the stresses-free boundary conditions are taking into account: one associated with the fast S wave and another to the slow S wave. One of the challenges is finding the analytical expressions for phase velocity and attenuation from the frequency equation. In this work, these expressions were obtained and compared with those corresponding to the Biot theory. When comparing the results with both theoretical frameworks, as expected, the torsional waves were attenuated more in the Biot viscosity-extended theory framework. The influence of the slow S wave causes the torsional waves to travel slower than Biot’s theoretical framework.},

Results show that the isotherms, the streamlines and the heat exchange rate are strongly changed by applying a magnetic field. A recirculation region is created near the magnetic source where the thermal boundary layer is removed enhancing so the local heat exchange. The overall heat exchange is enhanced by suspending nanoparticles and/or by increasing magnetic field strength. In the absence of a magnetic field, suspending nanoparticles can enhance heat exchange rate up to 20%. Under the only action of magnetic field a maximum 60% heat exchange enhancement is obtained.

Firstly, a new mode-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is introduced, where more than one Lyapunov matrices are dependent on jumping modes. Secondly, sufficient conditions are established by employing the Lyapunov stability theory together with Wirtinger-based inequality, under which the filtering error system is stochastically stable with strict dissipative. Thirdly, the co-design scheme of the filter parameters and event-triggered matrices is proposed. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the usefulness of the proposed scheme.},

So far indeed, we investigated the univariate case, its extension to rational polynomial interpolation and its natural application to numerical integration. The concept of mapped bases has been widely studied, but all the proposed methods show convergence provided that the function is resampled at the mapped nodes. In applications, this is often physically unfeasible. Thus, we propose an effective method for interpolating via mapped bases in the multivariate setting. We might refer to the method as Fake Nodes Approach (FNA). Our theoretical results are confirmed by various numerical experiments devoted to point out the robustness of the proposed scheme.},

As an application, the representative heat diffusion process is remodeled with it. In fact, due to the existence of heat-conduction paradox, the time-space evolution mechanisms of this process are challenges to the modelers. The paradox cann’t be ascribed to the classical Fourier law , and the results show that the newly-constructed temporal MDD model is more reasonable than the Maxwell-Cattaneo, the temporal FD, the spatial FD and the common ones. Moreover, different mediums may accord with different memory times and weighted functions. This freedom of choice reflects the flexibility of MDD in modelling.

  abstract     = {We formulated a mechanistic model for the cancer-immune system associated with therapy. In this model, cancer is divided into two types: cancer that is sensitive to treatment (CST) and cancer that gradually acquires resistance to therapeutic agents (CRT). Cancer activates various mechanisms to evade the actions of therapeutic agents, including chemotherapy or targeted therapy. A positive response is observed at the early stage of treatment when cancer therapy is administered through subcutaneous or intravenous injection. However, over time, cancer acquires resistance against the treatment and begins to show rapid growth. Previous models have suggested strategies that can effectively suppress cancer by determining an appropriate dosing regimen but are limited in that cancer inhibition depends only on the dose amount and regimen. In contrast to a model in which there is a steady decline in cancer due to continuous-infusion therapy, the proposed model incorporates the fact that cancer cells may grow despite successive therapy administration, owing to the transition from CST to CRT. This consideration indicates that cancer suppression can be determined by the delay of therapy delivery to the site of action and the transition time. The delay of therapy and the transition time thus determine the period of cancer growth and the increase or decrease in cancer cell growth, respectively. This model was then used to the ratio of CST to CRT and to explore the therapy infusion rate under constant and periodic conditions in association with a pharmacokinetic model.},

Whereas European and American options considering counterparty risk have already been priced under Black-Scholes dynamics in [1], here the novel contribution is the introduction of stochastic volatility resulting in a Heston stochastic volatility type partial differential equation to be solved. We derive the partial differential equation modeling the XVA when stochastic volatility is assumed. For both European and American options, a linear and a nonlinear problem have been deduced. In order to obtain a numerical solution, suitable and appropriate boundary conditions have been considered. In addition, a method of characteristics for the time discretization combined with a finite element method in the spatial discretization has been implemented.

There is an additional condition: no legion can move if doing so leaves its base city defenceless. In this manuscript we start the study of a variant of Roman domination in graphs: the triple Roman domination. We consider that any city of the Roman Empire must be able to be defended by at least three legions. These legions should be either in the attacked city or in one of its neighbours. We determine various bounds on the triple Roman domination number for general graphs, and we give exact values for some graph families. Moreover, complexity results are also obtained.},

In order to quantify the influence of the uncertainty in the strain modal information on the identification results, this paper treats measurement noise as probabilistic and interval variable and deduces the corresponding formula of structural elemental stiffness parameters. Due to the definition of uncertainties, different damage indexes including deterministic index, uncertainty index and combination index are established or introduced to quantify the damage extent and damage possibility. The validity of the proposed method is verified by a numerical example and an experimental work.

Considering the subjective attitudes and objective abilities, this paper proposes a compromise game to model the dynamic change of subjective compromise value of individuals, which is a kind of psychological game. Here, the compromise value represented by parameter α is the strategy in game, which ranges from 0 to 1. And in terms of the continuous nature of compromise value α , we use particle swarm optimization to update strategies. Moreover, the subjective attitudes are profoundly affected by social surroundings, and thus we simulate this model on diverse assortative mixing networks by regulating the assortativity coefficient r . Simulations show that the compromise value of individuals gradually decreases as the assortativity of networks increases, and the compromise values of high-degree individuals are much higher than that of low-degree individuals in networks. Through the simulation results, we find that the subjective compromise of individual is greatly relevant with environment, which is important for the development of individuals. When meeting the individuals who have the similar ability, individuals from disassortative network tend to persist himself compared with individuals from assortative networks.},

In this article, an impulsive disturbed neural network model with delays is constructed in quaternion space, and the exponential stability conditions of the delayed system are derived by utilizing generalized norms. Firstly, a general impulsive disturbed quaternion-valued delayed neural network (IQVDNN) is given by combining impulsive differential system with quaternion-valued neural networks. Since quaternion multiplication is noncommutative, the IQVDNN system is decomposed into real-valued impulsive delayed neural networks. Then, the generalized ∞-norm and 1-norm are used to research its stability, respectively. By constructing special Lyapunov-type functional, several exponential stability sufficient criteria are obtained, which can guarantee that the stability can’t be destroyed by abrupt impulsive perturbations. Finally, two numerical examples and their simulation figures are given to show the effectiveness of the obtained conclusions.},

The research on the influence of memory mechanism on human cooperative behavior has been a hot issue in recent years. However, most previous researchers usually concentrated their efforts on the single-layer networks and the impact of memory length on cooperative behavior, but paid less attention to the interdependent networks and other factors affecting the decision-making. In this paper, we presented a two-layer interdependent Holme-Kim network model with scale-free, high clustering and interconnection characteristics and a history optimal strategy learning mechanism fully considering the historical strategy, payoffs information and memory length, and combined them to discuss the emergence and maintenance of cooperation behavior. Through modeling simulation, we studied the parameter r for network construction, memory length M and defection to temptation T . Game participants, equipped with the same memory length, played Prisoner&#39;s dilemma games with their neighbors located on home or adjacent layer (if any), and selected their following strategies for the next game round through the history optimal strategy learning mechanism. The results show that density of cooperation is inversely related to parameter r and positively related to memory length M . The newly proposed network model can improve network reciprocity and the history optimal strategy learning mechanism can find out the strategy that can bring the maximum revenue in a certain period of time. The smaller r is, the larger M is, the more conductive to cooperation.},

As a result, we pose a mathematical model in the form of reaction-diffusion equations to reveal the effects of global warming on the vegetation patterns. Based on mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, we obtain the typical distributions of vegetation which is consistent with the results in Wuwei, China. It was found that, if the temperature increases 1.5 or more degrees, then the isolation of the vegetation pattern increases and thus desertification may emerge. Meanwhile, we show that the vegetation biomass will increase as precipitation increases, but slow down with increased temperature. We also show the desertification degree as a function of precipitation. Our results may suggest that temperature and precipitation are key factors of climatic factors for vegetation formation.},

We consider a functional parameter of ψ -Caputo derivatives in power and sigmoid forms and use particle swarm optimization algorithm to identify model’s parameters. Input data for the identification were acquired on the irrigated field in the South of Ukraine within one irrigation cycle. Direct problems were solved using a finite-difference scheme. In these conditions, application of a fractional model with the classic Caputo derivative allowed more than  ~ 2-times lowering of average absolute error compared to the integer-order model. The usage of functional parameter in power form allowed up to 19% accuracy enhancement compared to the classic Caputo derivative while the usage of sigmoid function up to 2.6-times lowers the error. Such behaviour remains when predicting soil moisture dynamics within the following irrigation cycles.},

Moreover, these results can be shown by corollaries and numerical examples : (1) the greater uncertain level parameter is, the less revenue is; (2) revenue in model without considering uncertainty is too high, and revenues in robust models are less than it; (3) the revenue does not always increase with total auction sequence increases; (4) value strategies are not optimal for auctioneer in despite of whether to consider uncertainty.},

Effects of the localization assumption on the accuracy of the MsFV are investigated by comparing the results associated with different boundary conditions of local problems producing the basis functions. The total number of six boundary conditions of two general types, including Dirichlet and Dirichlet-Neumann types, are compared. For the former, the linear, variable (reduced), and step-type boundary conditions are considered and a modified variable boundary condition is proposed. For the latter, a basic and a step-type Neumann-Dirichlet boundary condition are suggested. To estimate the errors in the MsFV solutions for continuous problems, a heterogeneous two-dimensional problem with continuous permeability field is designed and solved analytically. Synthetic two-scale permeability fields as well as highly heterogeneous random fields are used to assess the accuracy of the MsFV solutions with different localization schemes, in comparison with the fine-scale reference solution. Numerical results indicate that the modified variable boundary condition, with a proper value of its weighting factor, can generally produce the most accurate results, when compared with the other localization schemes.},

Incidentally, global stability for the SVEIS models with saturated incidence in Cai and Li (2009), Sahu and Dhar (2012) is completely solved. Furthermore, employing the DEDiscover simulation tool, the parameters in Sahu and Dhar’model are estimated with the 2009–2010 pandemic H1N1 case data in Hong Kong China, and it is validated that the vaccination programme indeed avoided subsequent potential outbreak waves of the pandemic. Finally, global sensitivity analysis reveals that multiple control measures should be utilized jointly to cut down the peak of the waves dramatically and delay the arrival of the second wave, thereinto timely vaccination is particularly effective.},

Almost all parameter estimation techniques in ordinary differential equation models suffer from either a small convergence region or enormous computational cost. The method of multiple shooting, on the other hand, takes its place in between these two extremes. The computational cost of the algorithm is mostly due to the calculation of directional derivatives of objective and constraint functions. Here we modify the multiple shooting algorithm to use the adjoint method in calculating these derivatives. In the literature, this method is known to be a more stable and computationally efficient way of computing gradients of scalar functions. A predator-prey system is used to show the performance of the method and supply all necessary information for a successful and efficient implementation.},

In addition to the usual binary strategies—perfect cooperator and perfect defector—we introduce “fence-sitters”, who either cooperate or defect with equal probability, as a third strategy. In regions with larger Stag-Hunt-type dilemmas but smaller Chicken-type dilemmas, the existence of the fence-sitters works as a buffer, hampering the exploitation of cooperators by neighboring defectors and significantly enhancing the cooperative phase. Conversely, in regions with larger Chicken-type dilemmas but smaller Stag-Hunt-type dilemmas, the existence of the fence-sitters expands the critical dilemma strength for the survival of cooperation, but it reduces the cooperating fraction more than in the conventional model. What we have found may justify the conclusion that the existence of people with neutral opinions—often regarded betwixt and between—absorbs the severe competition between two extreme groups, bringing a more accommodationist situation to our society, backed with greater cooperation.},

Firstly, a state feedback distributed control scheme is designed to achieve COR problem and eliminate Zeno behavior of the MASs with only intermittent communication between neighbors. The design of such a controller requires the assumption that the states of all agents are measurable. Secondly, we design a dynamic output feedback control law which does not need to assume that all states are measurable in the MASs. The COR problem of MASs is also implemented without Zeno behavior existing. Under the proposed two kinds of triggering mechanisms, each agent sends information to its neighbors only at its switching and triggering times. Finally, several examples are introduced to illustrate effectiveness and practicability of the theoretical results. And we add a comparative experiment to highlight the advantages of the design methods in this paper.},

This procedure – as well as some general interconnections between the micro- and mesocopic descriptions of such systems – are also discussed. The main result of the paper is the numerical study (by the Runge-Kutta method) of the solutions of the kinetic equation revealing a number of interesting peculiarities of the dynamics and clarifying the particular role of the jumps and the coalescence in the system’s evolution.

To relax some limitations of the classical Lipschitz condition , the one-sided Lipschitz and quadratically inner-bounded conditions are employed to handle nonlinearities . The control inputs are subject to bounded unknown time-varying delays. To deal with this open and interesting problem, we propose a sliding mode observer based method to simultaneously estimate the states and identify the unknown delays of the systems without making assumption on differentiability of the delays. Furthermore, our method does not require the minimum phase condition that is common in sliding mode observer based schemes.

  abstract     = {The combination of chemical, physical, electrical, and structural properties of the neurons has made them highly complex dynamical units. One of the best tools to deal with such high-level complexity is to study the neural spatiotemporal patterns. In this work, we have focused specifically on the spiral spatiotemporal pattern. Spirals make an important contribution to some of the cortical activities. However, they also may misregulate the neural activities and lead to neurological disorders such as epilepsy or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Here, we have studied the effect of amplitude and frequency of an external force on the dynamics of the spiral wave in one- and two-layer neural network. We have also examined the role of synaptic connections between the neurons. For each examination, three modes of zero-, low-, and high-frequency external magnetic induction are considered. In the one-layer neural network with low frequency magnetic excitation, the frequency of the stimuli overtakes the stimuli amplitude and significantly changes the dynamics of the spirals. Nonetheless, in the case of high-frequency magnetic induction, neither the amplitude nor the frequency of the electrical force have control over the existing spirals. We also have shown how the timely pattern of neural synchronization changes when the neurons are allowed to more communicate with one another. In the two-layer neural network, on the other hand, we have shown that both the amplitude and frequency of the electrical stimuli can help to control or even eliminate the spiral waves.},

The existence of reputation could stimulate cooperation. In this work, individuals’ reputation has been divided into being good, bad and medium according to their neighbors’ judgement. Considering people with different requirements of reputation, we put forward a new reputation scoring mechanism with tolerance based on historical donations. First, we study the effect of different scoring rules on players’ strategies. Based on this, we discuss the effect of neighbors’ reputation on players’ simulation process. In addition, we explore the population structure’s influence on cooperation. Through numerical simulations, we are glad to find that the strict scoring rules could better stimulate cooperation in most circumstances. Moreover, imitation which depends on both reputation and payoff could promote cooperation. And individuals with good reputation have better effect on cooperation compared to those with bad reputation. This work provides a new reference for organizers to promote more people to participate and cooperate in Public Goods Game (PGG).},

PIE is a noninvasive technique to calculate the internal electrical potentials from measured body surface electromyographic data, which can be considered as an inverse Cauchy problem with potential equation. In the proposed LCTM, the electrical potential at every node is expressed as a linear combination of 3D Trefftz basis in each stencil support, and the sparse linear system is yield by satisfying governing equation at interior nodes and boundary conditions at boundary nodes . The proposed LCTM inherits the properties of easy-to-use and meshless from the collocation Trefftz method (CTM), and mitigates the ill-conditioning resultant matrix encountered in the CTM. Numerical efficiency of the proposed method is investigated in comparison with the CTM and experimental data .},

However, current methods fail to reveal the full community structure and its formation process. Thus, here we present SIMGT, an effective and S calable approach that detects overlapping communities: I ntegrating social identity M odel and G ame T heory. Inspired by social identity theory and nodes’ high-order proximities, first we weight and rewire the original network, then we associate each node with a new utility function. Next, we model community formation as a non-cooperative game among all nodes, and we regard the nodes as self-interested players. Further, we use a stochastic gradient-ascent method to update players’ strategies toward different communities, and prove that our game greatly resembles and matches how a potential game works (in the classical sense in game theory), indicating that the Nash equilibrium point must exist. Finally, we implement comprehensive experiments on several synthetic and real-life networks. The results show that whatever weighting strategy we choose, SIMGT can gain better performance on community detection task. In particular, SIMGT achieves a best result when we choose the Jaccard coefficient. After comparing SIMGT with six benchmark algorithms, we obtain convincing results in terms of how well the algorithms reveal communities, as well as algorithms’ scalability.},

  abstract     = {The role of incentive institutions on promoting cooperation in public goods game (PGG) has attracted much attention. Theoretical studies based on Nash equilibrium analysis predict that the punishment effect is often stronger than the reward effect. Although this result is confirmed by empirical studies, subjects do not always play these rational strategies. Recent experiments indicate that most subjects in PGGs are conditional cooperators who tend to contribute the group average. In this paper, we consider PGGs with three types of subjects, namely, cooperators, defectors, and conditional cooperators. Evolutionary game method is applied to investigate how conditional cooperators affect the effectiveness of different types of incentives. Overall, having conditional cooperators cannot lead to a higher contribution level in the standard PGG or the PGG with institutional rewards. However, they can enhance the effectiveness of institutional punishment, where a high contribution level can be maintained even for small punishments. As a consequence, in PGGs with conditional cooperators, punishment always leads to a higher contribution rate than do rewards. Numerical analysis indicates that this result is robust to errors in decision making.},

The degree sequence of a tree is the sequence of the degrees (in descending order) of the non-leaf vertices. This paper determines those trees with a given degree sequence which have the greatest Mostar index. Consequently, all extremal trees with the greatest Mostar index are obtained in the sets of all trees of order n with the maximum degree , the number of leaves, the independence number and the matching number , respectively. On the other hand, some properties of trees with a given degree sequence which have the least Mostar index are given. We also determine those trees with exactly n − 3 n−3 or n − 4 n−4 leaves when the degree sequence is given, which have the least Mostar index. At last some numerical results are discussed, in which we calculate the Mostar indices of two sets of molecular graphs: octane isomers and benzenoid hydrocarbons; We compare their Mostar indices with some other distance-based topological indices through their correlations with the chemical properties. The linear model for the Mostar index is better than or as good as the models corresponding to the other distance-based indices.},

Systems of fractional differential equations are also used, for example in the study of electric circuits, but they are more difficult to analyse mathematically. We present explicit solutions for several families of such systems, both homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases, both commensurate and incommensurate. The results can be written, in several interesting special cases, in terms of a recently defined bivariate Mittag-Leffler function and the associated operators of fractional calculus.},

  abstract     = {Natural, forced and mixed convection heat transfer problems are solved by the meshless Method of Approximate Particular Solutions (MAPS). Particular solutions of Poisson and Stokes equations are employed to approximate temperature and velocity, respectively. The latter is used to obtained a closed expression for pressure particular solution. In both cases, the source terms are multiquadric radial basis functions which allow to obtain analytical expressions for these auxiliary problems. In order to couple momentum and energy equations, a relaxation strategy is implemented to avoid convergence problems due to the difference between successive temperature and velocity changes when solving the steady problem from an initial guess . The developed and validated numerical scheme is used to study flow and heat transfer in two two-dimensional problems: natural convection in concentric annulus between a square and a circular cylinder and non-isothermal flow past a staggered tube bundle. Numerical solutions obtained by MAPS are comparable in accuracy to solutions reported by authors who uses denser nodal distributions, showing the capability of the present method to accurately solve heat convection problems with temperature and heat flux boundary conditions as well as curve geometries and internal flow situations.},

Using special atomic orders on the protein molecule, the MDGP can be solved iteratively using a combinatorial method, called Branch-and-Prune (BP). In order to deal with uncertainties of NMR data, there is an extension of the BP algorithm, called interval BP, where the idea is to sample values from the interval distances associated to such uncertainties. We propose a method to improve this sampling process, by reducing the interval of uncertain distances before taking the samples. All the mathematical details necessary to understand the proposal and its implementation are provided, along with some computational experiments that indicate the proposed strategy improves the interval BP algorithm.},

The relationship with Radon transform, the real and complex Paley-Wiener theorem, as well as the sampling formula for the 2-sided QFT are established in an easy way. Moreover, a two parameter fractional Fourier transform is introduced based on a new direct sum decomposition of the L 2 space. The explicit formula and bound of the kernel are obtained. Compared with the Clifford-Fourier transform defined using eigenfunctions, the main adventure of this transform is that the integral kernel has a uniform bound for all dimensions.},

In this context, the core concept is the information potential (IP) S [ s ] ( x ) : = ∫ R p s ( t , x ) d t , S[s](x):=∫Rps(t,x)dt, s &gt; 0 of a PDF p ( t, x ) depending on a parameter x ; it is naturally related to the Rényi and Tsallis entropies. We present several such PDF, viewed also as kernels of integral operators, for which a precise relation exists between S [2] ( x ) and the variance Var [ p ( t, x )]. For these PDF we determine explicitly the IP and the Shannon entropy . As an application to Information Theoretic Learning we determine two essential indices used in this theory: the expected value E [log p ( t, x )] and the variance Var [log p ( t, x )]. The latter is an index of the intrinsic shape of p ( t, x ) having more statistical power than kurtosis . For a sequence of B -spline functions, considered as kernels of Steklov operators and also as PDF, we investigate the sequence of IP and its asymptotic behaviour . Another special sequence of PDF consists of kernels of Kantorovich modifications of the classical Bernstein operators. Convexity properties and bounds of the associated IP, useful in Information Theoretic Learning, are discussed. Several examples and numerical computations illustrate the general results.},

  abstract     = {We study reflectionless properties at the boundary for the wave equation in one space dimension and time, in terms of a well-known matrix that arises from a simple discretisation of space. It is known that all matrix functions of the familiar second difference matrix representing the Laplacian in this setting are the sum of a Toeplitz matrix and a Hankel matrix . The solution to the wave equation is one such matrix function. Here, we study the behaviour of the corresponding waves that we call Toeplitz waves and Hankel waves. We show that these waves can be written as certain linear combinations of even Bessel functions of the first kind . We find exact and explicit formulae for these waves. We also show that the Toeplitz and Hankel waves are reflectionless on even, respectively odd, traversals of the domain. Our analysis naturally suggests a new method of computer simulation that allows control, so that it is possible to choose — in advance — the number of reflections. An attractive result that comes out of our analysis is the appearance of the well-known shift matrix, and also other matrices that might be thought of as Hankel versions of the shift matrix. By revealing the algebraic structure of the solution in terms of shift matrices, we make it clear how the Toeplitz and Hankel waves are indeed reflectionless at the boundary on even or odd traversals. Although the subject of the reflectionless boundary condition has a long history, we believe the point of view that we adopt here in terms of matrix functions is new.},

  abstract     = {This work studies the asynchronous fault-tolerant sliding mode control for uncertain stochastic jumping systems subject to singular perturbations, in which the controller is assumed to be able to estimate the hidden system mode through a detector with a conditional probability via the hidden-Markov model. Additionally, in consideration of avoiding the system performance decreases generated by the actuator degradation, the synthesized fault-tolerant sliding mode control scheme is first employed. Through applying a common singularly perturbed parameter based sliding surface, this paper attempts to construct a proper asynchronous sliding mode control law that can ensure not only the reachability but also the closed-loop system is stable with an expected H ∞ performance index. By virtue of the mode-dependent Lyapunov function and the hidden-Markov model approach, sufficient conditions are acquired. Besides, solving linear matrix inequalities for obtaining the control gain matrices are given through the convex optimization theory. Eventually, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed asynchronous fault-tolerant sliding mode control scheme are verified by a numerical example.},

In particular, rational functions exhibit accurate estimations to nonsmooth and non-Lipschitz functions, where polynomial approximations are not efficient. We prove that the optimisation problems appearing in the best uniform rational approximation and its generalisation to a ratio of linear combinations of basis functions are quasiconvex even when the basis functions are not restricted to monomials . Then we show how this fact can be used in the development of computational methods. This paper presents a theoretical study of the arising optimisation problems and provides results of several numerical experiments. We apply our approximation as a preprocessing step to deep learning classifiers and demonstrate that the classification accuracy is significantly improved compared to the classification of the raw signals.},

First, the sensor faults are equivalent to virtual internal system faults in system by filtering, and dynamic event-triggered fault/state observer is designed to estimate the system state and fault at the same time. Therefore, a sliding mode surface under event-triggering is constructed considering system faults and network delay. By the Lyapunov-Krasovskii function, a novel design condition in the form of linear matrix inequality is obtained with H ∞ performance to gain observer and controller parameters. In addition, a sliding mode FTC law is constructed to guarantee that the trajectories of system states can be arrived to the sliding surface in a finite time .

JS optimizer is tested using a comprehensive set of mathematical benchmark functions and applied to a series of structural engineering problems. Fifty small/average-scale and twenty-five large-scale functions involving various dimensions were used to validate JS optimizer, which was compared with ten well-known metaheuristic algorithms. JS optimizer was found to outperform those algorithms in solving mathematical benchmark functions. The JS algorithm was then used to solve structural optimization problems, including 25-bar tower design, 52-bar tower design and 582-bar tower design problems. In those cases, JS not only performed best but also required the fewest evaluations of objective functions. Therefore, JS is potentially an excellent metaheuristic algorithm for solving optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Polynomial Viscosity Matrix (PVM) methods can be considered as approximations of the Roe method in which the absolute value of the Roe matrix appearing in the numerical viscosity is replaced by the evaluation of the Roe matrix at a chosen polynomial that approximates the absolute value function. They are in principle cheaper than the Roe method since the computation and the inversion of the eigenvector matrix is not necessary. In this article, an efficient implementation of the PVM based on polynomials that interpolate the absolute value function at some points is presented. This implementation is based on the Newton form of the polynomials. Moreover, many numerical methods based on simple Riemann solvers (SRS) may be interpreted as PVM methods and thus this implementation can be also applied to them: the close relation between PVM methods and simple Riemann solvers is revisited here and new shorter proofs based on the classical interpolation theory are given. In particular, Roe method can be interpreted both as a SRS and as a PVM method so that the new implementation can be used. This implementation, that avoids the computation and the inversion of the eigenvector matrix, is called Newton Roe method. Newton Roe method yields the same numerical results of the standard Roe method, with less runtime for large PDE systems. Numerical results for two-layer Shallow Water Equations and Quadrature-Based Moment Equations show a significant speedup if the number of equations is large enough.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the role of network structure in the evolution of cooperation is a key research goal at the intersection between physics and biology. Recent studies have particularly focused on multiplex networks given that multiple social domains are interrelated and cannot be represented by single-layer networks. However, the role of network multiplexity is not fully understood when combined with another important network characteristic: network dynamics. In the present study, we investigated evolutionary prisoner’s dilemma games played on dynamic two-layer multiplex networks in which the payoff combined across the two layers determined strategy evolution. In addition, we introduced network dynamics where agents can sever links with defecting neighbors and construct new links. Our simulation showed that link updating enhances cooperation but the resultant states are far from those of full cooperation. This modest enhancement in cooperation was related to symmetry breaking whereby the cooperation frequency in one layer disproportionately increased while that in the other layer remained the same or even diminished. However, this broken symmetry disappeared with sufficiently fast link updating. Our results show that the introduction of network dynamics enhances cooperation in the prisoner’s dilemma as previously reported, but this enhancement is accompanied by significant asymmetry once network multiplexity is considered.},

The top of the rod may come in contact with a rigid support. Two conditions are applied to the contacting end; Signorini’s contact condition and Barber’s heat exchange condition. We formulate a partial differential equation (PDE) system with the relevant boundary conditions that describes the motion of the combined rod-beam, taking into account the dynamic contact and thermal interaction. A variational formulation to the model is obtained in an abstract setting. Then, a hybrid of several numerical methods is employed to abstract formulations. It guarantees that all the conditions at each time step are satisfied. Convergence of numerical trajectories is shown, by passing to the limits as time step sizes approach zero. We derive a new energy balance form that plays an important role in establishing the numerical stability . The fully discrete numerical schemes are then used to compute numerical solutions and some representative numerical simulations are presented.},

In shape classification, there is no natural way to represent an object but the similarity measure, distance between representations or descriptors, depends heavily on the strategy of computing optimal correspondences. In this paper we introduce a new numerical method for registering surfaces. Thus, finding an optimal one-to-one correspondence between their shapes. Unfortunately, solving this type of optimization problem is generally hard because the solutions space is nonlinear with no natural manifold structure on it. To overcome such limitations we make use of recent methods to represent objects then we find optimal correspondences using a discretized approximation of the search space . The proposed method has the advantage of extending the Riemannian analysis of 3D curves in a natural way for surfaces. We demonstrate the proposed algorithms using different public datasets for 2D and 3D objects matching and classification.},

Using rather general and minimal assumptions on the population distribution and age-dependent transmission rate, we prove the existence of those equilibria. Furthermore, the convergence of an iteration scheme to either of the two equilibria in relation to the basic reproductive number is analytically shown.

  abstract     = {The interaction between epidemic spreading and information diffusion is an interdisciplinary research problem. During an epidemic, people tend to take self-protective measures to reduce the infection risk. However, with the diffusion of rumor, people may be difficult to make an appropriate choice. How to reduce the negative impact of rumor and to control epidemic has become a critical issue in the social network. Elaborate mathematical model is instructive to understand such complex dynamics. In this paper, we develop a two-layer network to model the interaction between the spread of epidemic and the competitive diffusions of information. The results show that knowledge diffusion can eradicate both rumor and epidemic, where the penetration intensity of knowledge into rumor plays a vital role. Specifically, the penetration intensity of knowledge significantly increases the thresholds for rumor and epidemic to break out, even when the self-protective measure is not perfectly effective. But eradicating rumor shouldn’t be equated with eradicating epidemic. The epidemic can be eradicated with rumor still diffusing, and the epidemic may keep spreading with rumor being eradicated. Moreover, the communication-layer network structure greatly affects the spread of epidemic in the contact-layer network. When people have more connections in the communication-layer network, the knowledge is more likely to diffuse widely, and the rumor and epidemic can be eradicated more efficiently. When the communication-layer network is sparse, a larger penetration intensity of knowledge into rumor is required to promote the diffusion of knowledge.},

Without using any model transformations, some new criteria that ensure the closed-loop system to be robustly normal and stable for all admissible uncertainties are exactly deduced by means of the free-weighting matrix method, and clearly expressed as strict linear matrix inequalities . Meanwhile, the prescribed H ∞ performance is also achieved. Then, based on the obtained criteria, the specific expression of desired fuzzy PDSFC is given.

This study proposes a collective interdependence characterizing the functioning of interdependent groups between subnetworks. Via the establishment of global group interactions across subnetwork layers, we show a double-edged sword of collective interdependence in promoting cooperation. Enhancement of collective interdependence hinders the evolution of cooperation whenever global synergy factor is small, while an optimal collective interdependence emerges most favoring the evolution of cooperation for high global synergy factors. However, for such high global synergy factors a low level of interdependence puts cooperators to a most disadvantaged place. A combination of low levels of collective interdependence and high local synergy factors shows that a moderate global synergetic effect most favors the evolution of cooperation. Our work reveals that collective interdependence impacts interdependent network reciprocity significantly and highlights the importance of network reciprocity in enhancing the evolution of cooperation.},

Adult predators may easily achieve success in overcoming prey strategies designed to protect themselves from attack but juvenile predators, which are in the learning stage of predation, may be vulnerable to counterattack by preys in self-defence due to their comparatively smaller size and eventually get killed. Our main objective is to understand how the dynamics of counter-attacking by the preys against juvenile predators help in its survival. Both exponential and logistic growth of the preys are considered in this investigation. In qualitative analysis, permanence, impermanence, and stabilities of all the equilibrium points of the system are discussed to investigate the dynamical behavior of the system. The inclusion of sub-critical and super-critical Hopf bifurcations makes the dynamics more interesting.

Patterns in inversion sequences have been studied by Corteel–Martinez–Savage–Weselcouch and Mansour–Shattuck in the classical case, where patterns can occur in any positions, and by Auli–Elizalde in the consecutive case, where only adjacent entries can form an occurrence of a pattern. These papers classify classical and consecutive patterns of length 3 into Wilf equivalence classes according to the number of inversion sequences avoiding them. In this paper we consider vincular patterns in inversion sequences, which, in analogy to Babson–Steingrímsson patterns in permutations, require only certain entries of an occurrence to be adjacent, and thus generalize both classical and consecutive patterns. Solving three conjectures of Lin and Yan, we provide a complete classification of vincular patterns of length 3 in inversion sequences into Wilf equivalence classes, and into more restrictive classes that consider the number of occurrences of the pattern and the positions of such occurrences. We find the first known instance of patterns in inversion sequences where these two more restrictive classes do not coincide.},

It is shown that large-scale G -SDEs are exponentially stable in mean square if and only if each of the subsystems are exponentially stable in mean square. Finally, some interesting examples will be put forward to verifying the main results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider supply chains modelled by partial and ordinary differential equations , for densities of parts on suppliers and queues among consecutive arcs, respectively. The considered numerical schemes , whose properties are discussed, foresee the upwind method for goods densities, described by conservation laws, and a Differential Quadrature based explicit formula for queues evolutions. An optimization scheme is also discussed, by considering a cost functional that, according to a pre-defined outflow, weights the queues through variations of processing velocities of suppliers. We get the minimization of the cost functional via a genetic algorithm, which uses mechanisms of selection, crossover and mutation for the processing velocities. An example application is discussed in light of the numerical approaches and the optimization procedure.},

  abstract     = {We establish a ternary Cahn-Hilliard type Nakazawa-Ohta phase-field model for the triblock copolymer, and study its numerical approximation . The model is a highly coupled nonlinear system , consisting of two Cahn-Hilliard equations and two nonlocal equations. We solve the model by constructing a second-order accurate, time-marching scheme via the Scalar Auxiliary Variable (SAV) approach combined with the stabilization technique. At every time step, the scheme is composed of several decoupled type bi-Laplace equations, which makes it the first linear and fully-decoupled scheme. We further prove the unconditional energy stability rigorously and perform numerous numerical simulations in 2D and 3D to illustrate it numerically.},
