  abstract     = {This manuscript considers the homogeneous Neumann initial-boundary value problem for a three-component chemotaxis system describing the spatio-temporal Alopecia Areata dynamics. The model addresses the complex interactions between CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells and interferon-gamma (IFN- γ ): Both types of immune cells secrete the chemical that diffuses and degrades; conversely, the T cells are activated by the chemical but decay due to density-dependent death. In addition to random motion, the T cells bias their movement toward the concentration gradient of IFN- γ . To compare with previous chemotaxis models, a distinctive feature of this system is that CD8 + T cells additionally proliferate in a nonlinear manner with the help of CD4 + T cells. Given suitably regular initial data , it is shown that either small logistic damping in the two-dimensional case or strong logistic damping in the three-dimensional setting can prevent any blow-up of classical solutions to the problem. Moreover, we find a specific parameter regime for which the unique coexistence equilibrium is globally convergent.},

  abstract     = {We illustrate with several new applications the power and elegance of the Bendixson–Dulac theorem to obtain upper bounds of the number of limit cycles for several families of planar vector fields. In some cases we propose to use a function related with the curvature of the orbits of the vector field as a Dulac function. We get some general results for Liénard type equations and for rigid planar systems. We also present a remarkable phenomenon: for each integer m ≥ 2 m≥2 , we provide a simple 1-parametric differential system for which we prove that it has limit cycles only for the values of the parameter in a subset of an interval of length smaller that 3 2 ( 3 / m ) m / 2 32(3/m)m/2 that decreases exponentially when m grows. One of the strengths of the results presented in this work is that although they are obtained with simple calculations, that can be easily checked by hand, they improve and extend previous studies. Another one is that, for certain systems, it is possible to reduce the question of the number of limit cycles to the study of the shape of a planar curve and the sign of an associated function in one or two variables.},

  abstract     = {The intrinsic nature of a problem usually suggests a first suitable method to deal with it. Unfortunately, the apparent ease of application of these initial approaches may make their possible flaws seem to be inherent to the problem and often no alternative ways to solve it are searched for. For instance, since linear systems of differential equations are easy to integrate, Poincaré half-maps for piecewise linear systems are always studied by using the direct integration of the system in each zone of linearity. However, this approach is accompanied by two important defects: due to the different spectra of the involved matrices, many cases and strategies must be considered and, since the flight time appears as a new variable, nonlinear complicated equations arise. This manuscript is devoted to present a novel theory to characterize Poincaré half-maps in planar linear systems, that avoids the computation of their solutions and the problems it causes. This new perspective rests on the use of line integrals of a specific conservative vector field which is orthogonal to the flow of the linear system. Besides the obvious mathematical interest, this approach is attractive because it allows to simplify the study of piecewise-linear systems and deal with open problems in this field.},

  abstract     = {Spatial memory has been considered significant in animal movement modeling. In this paper, we formulate a two-species interaction model by incorporating both random walk and spatial memory-based walk in their movement. The spatial memory-based walk, described by a chemotactic-like term, is derived by a modified Fick&#39;s law involving a directed movement toward the gradient of the density distribution function at a past time. For the proposed model, local stability and bifurcations are studied at constant steady states. Unlike a classical reaction-diffusion equation, we show that the accumulation points of eigenvalues for the model will locate at a vertical line in the complex plane, which will make the model generate spatially inhomogeneous time-periodic patterns through Hopf bifurcation . As illustrations, we apply these results to competition and cooperative models with memory-based diffusion. For the competition model, it turns out that the outcomes are far more complicated than those of classic Lotka-Volterra reaction-diffusion models, due to the consideration of memory-based diffusion. In particular, the existence of periodic oscillations is proved under weak competition. Similar conclusions hold for the cooperative model.},

The problem is written in terms of the phase formulation, i.e. the saturation of one phase and the pressure of the second phase are primary unknowns. This formulation leads to a coupled system consisting of a nonlinear degenerate parabolic equation for the gas pressure and a nonlinear degenerate parabolic diffusion-convection equation for the liquid saturation, subject to appropriate boundary and initial conditions. We consider the behavior of compressible two-phase flow in heterogeneous reservoirs with permeability and porosity being realizations of given statistically homogeneous random fields. We derive the effective (macroscopic) problem and prove the convergence of solutions. Our approach relies on stochastic two-scale convergence techniques, the realization-wise notion of stochastic two-scale convergence being used. Also, we exploit various a priori estimates as well as monotonicity and compactness arguments. To our best knowledge, this is the first stochastic homogenization result in the case of compressible two-phase flow in random porous media.},

In a recent paper [10] , the authors considered the problem without advection (i.e., β = 0 β=0 ) and constructed a new type of entire solution U ( x , t ) U(x,t) , which, under the additional assumption f ″ ( u ) ≤ 0 f″(u)≤0 , is concave and U ( ∞ , t ) = 1 U(∞,t)=1 for all t ∈ R t∈R . In this paper, we consider the equation with advection and without the additional assumption f ″ ( u ) ≤ 0 f″(u)≤0 . In case β = 0 β=0 , using a quite different approach from [10] we construct an entire solution U ˜ U˜ which is similar as U in the sense that U ˜ ( ∞ , t ) ≡ 1 U˜(∞,t)≡1 and U ˜ ( ⋅ , t ) U˜(⋅,t) is asymptotically flat as t → − ∞ t→−∞ , but different from U in the sense that it does not have to be concave. Our result reveals that the asymptotically flat (as t → − ∞ t→−∞ ) property rather than the concavity is more essential for such entire solutions. In case β &lt; 0 β&amp;lt;0 , we construct another new entire solution U ˆ Uˆ which is completely different from the previous ones in the sense that U ˆ ( ∞ , t ) Uˆ(∞,t) increases from 0 to 1 as t increasing from −∞ to ∞.},

  abstract     = {We consider a class of linear second order differential equations with damping and external force. We investigate the link between a uniform bound on the forcing term and the corresponding ultimate bound on the velocity of solutions, and we study the dependence of that bound on the damping and on the “elastic force”. We prove three results. First of all, in a rather general setting we show that different notions of bound are actually equivalent. Then we compute the optimal constants in the scalar case . Finally, we extend the results of the scalar case to abstract dissipative wave-type equations in Hilbert spaces . In that setting we obtain rather sharp estimates that are quite different from the scalar case, in both finite and infinite dimensional frameworks. The abstract theory applies, in particular, to dissipative wave, plate and beam equations.},

Making use of the normal form, we verify that observations of focus-fold bifurcation in some special piecewise linear systems also hold for general PWS systems, including the existence of two types of sliding limit cycles and coexistence of crossing and sliding limit cycles. It is shown that two nested crossing limit cycles can be bifurcated from the focus-fold singularity. This result is the improvement of the work [Han and Zhang (2010) [29] ], in which only one bifurcated limit cycle is obtained. In addition, the sliding limit cycles are proved to be convergent in finite time.},

In this paper we prove that for every combinatorial vector field on a finite simplicial complex X X one can construct a semiflow on the underlying polytope X which exhibits the same dynamics. The equivalence of the dynamical behavior is established in the sense of Conley-Morse graphs and uses a tiling of the topological space X which makes it possible to directly construct isolating blocks for all involved isolated invariant sets based purely on the combinatorial information.},

Under suitable restriction on the rotation frequency, by searching critical points of the corresponding energy functional on the mass-sphere, we obtain a local minimizer u c uc and a mountain pass solution u ˆ c uˆc . Furthermore, we show that u c uc is a ground state for small mass c &gt; 0 c&amp;gt;0 and describe a mass collapse behavior of the minimizers as c → 0 c→0 , while u ˆ c uˆc is an excited state . Finally, we prove that the standing wave associated with u c uc is stable. Notice that the pioneering works [2] , [8] imply that finite time blow-up of solutions to this model occurred in the mass-supercritical setting, therefore, we in the present paper obtain a new stability result. The main contribution of this paper is to extend the main results in [4] , [17] concerning the same model from mass-subcritical and mass-critical regimes to mass-supercritical regime, where the physically most relevant case is covered.},

Our results apply to DDEs with multiple discrete state-dependent delays, which may be nonautonomous for the Lyapunov stability result, but autonomous (or periodically forced) for the asymptotic stability result. Our main technique is to replace the DDE by a nonautonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE) where the delayed terms become source terms in the ODE. The asymptotic stability result is based on a contradiction argument together with the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem. This approach alleviates the need to construct auxiliary functions to ensure the asymptotic contraction, which is a feature of other Lyapunov-Razumikhin asymptotic stability results of which we are aware. We apply our results to a state-dependent model equation which includes Hayes equation as a special case, to directly establish asymptotic stability in parts of the stability domain together with lower bounds on the size of the basin of attraction .},

We show that the system is well-posed and that the solutions define a continuous semiflow on a state space of Lipschitz functions . Moreover we establish for an associated system a convex and compact set that is invariant under the time- t -map for a finite time . It is known that, due to the state dependence of the delay, necessary and sufficient conditions for well-posedness can be related to functionals being almost locally Lipschitz, which roughly means locally Lipschitz on the restriction of the domain to Lipschitz functions, and our methodology involves such conditions. To achieve transparency and wider applicability, we elaborate a general class of two component functional differential equation systems, that contains the SD-DDE from cell biology and formulate our results also for this class.},

  abstract     = {We consider homoclinic solutions for Hamiltonian systems in symplectic Hilbert spaces and generalise spectral flow formulas that were proved by Pejsachowicz and the author in finite dimensions some years ago. Roughly speaking, our main theorem relates the spectra of infinite dimensional Hamiltonian systems under homoclinic boundary conditions to intersections of their stable and unstable spaces. Our proof has some interest in its own. Firstly, we extend a celebrated theorem by Cappell, Lee and Miller about the classical Maslov index in R 2 n R2n to symplectic Hilbert spaces. Secondly, we generalise the classical index bundle for families of Fredholm operators of Atiyah and Jänich to unbounded operators for applying it to Hamiltonian systems under varying boundary conditions. Finally, we substantially make use of striking results by Abbondandolo and Majer to study Fredholm properties of infinite dimensional Hamiltonian systems.},

Particles proliferate and die depending on the local concentration of other particles. Opposite to discrete models, controlling concentration of particles is a major difficulty in Brownian particle interaction; local interactions instead of mean field or moderate ones makes it more difficult to implement the law of large numbers properties. The approach taken here to overcome these difficulties is largely inspired by A. Hammond and F.

We apply the MAE (matched asymptotic expansion) method to construct solutions and the SLEP (singular limit eigenvalue problem) method to evaluate their stability. This approach is not just an alternative approach to geometric singular perturbation and the associated Evans function, it also yields two advantages: one is extendability to higher dimensional cases, and the other is that it allows us to obtain more precise information about the behaviors of critical eigenvalues. This implies the existence of codimension-two singularities of drift and Hopf bifurcations for the standing pulse solution. Moreover, it is numerically confirmed that stable standing and traveling breathers emerge around the singularity in a physically acceptable region.},

We show fast convergence of the primal-dual gap, the feasibility measure, and the objective function value along the generated trajectories. In case the objective function has Lipschitz continuous gradient, we show that the primal-dual trajectory asymptotically weakly converges to a primal-dual optimal solution of the underlying minimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result which guarantees the convergence of the trajectory generated by a primal-dual dynamical system with asymptotic vanishing damping.

The approximation considers the mild solutions ( z δ ) δ &gt; 0 (zδ)δ&amp;gt;0 of the corresponding family of differential equations with piecewise constant argument, varying the semilinear term with a parameter δ . Our main results is about the obtaining of the solution z δ zδ in terms of a difference equation on X and conditions to ensure uniform convergence of z δ zδ to y as δ → 0 δ→0 , on compact and unbounded intervals . We obtain explicit exponential decay estimates for the error function using the stability of the semigroup and the Halanay&#39;s inequality. Also with a new idea and method we prove that the approximation is stable and there exists a preservation of asymptotic stability between the solution of delayed differential equation and its corresponding difference equation, obtained by piecewise constant argument.},

Such waves are the connecting orbits of an autonomous second-order Lagrangian system and the corresponding kinetic energy is an indefinite quadratic form in the velocity terms. When the system has two stable hyperbolic equilibria, there exist two stable standing fronts, which will be used in this paper as building blocks , to construct stable standing waves with multiple fronts in case the equilibria are of saddle-focus type. The idea to prove existence is somewhat close in spirit to [6] ; however several differences are required in the argument: facing a strongly indefinite functional, we need to perform a nonlocal Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction; in order to justify the stability of multiple front standing waves, we rely on a more precise variational characterization of such critical points . Based on this approach, both stable and unstable standing waves are found.},

Then we address the persistence or extinction of the prey and the predator separately in various moving frames, and achieve a complete picture in the local diffusion case.

We first propose a full state feedback control to stabilize the system ( A , B ) (A,B) with input delay and then design a Luenberger-like observer for the system ( A , C ) (A,C) in terms of the delayed output. We formulate the delay compensation in the framework of regular linear systems. The developed approach builds upon an upper-block-triangle transform that is associated with a Sylvester operator equation. It is found that the controllability/observability map of system ( − A , B ) (−A,B) / ( − A , − C ) (−A,−C) happens to be the solution of the corresponding Sylvester equation. As an immediate consequence, both the feedback law and the state observer can be expressed explicitly in the operator form. The exponential stability of the resulting closed-loop system and the exponential convergence of the observation error are established without using the Lyapunov functional approach. The theoretical results are validated through the delay compensation for a benchmark one-dimensional wave equation.},

  abstract     = {We consider the evolution of triple junction clusters driven by the surface diffusion flow. On the triple line we use the boundary conditions derived by Garcke and Novick-Cohen as the singular limit of a Cahn-Hilliard equation with degenerated mobility. These conditions are the concurrency of the triple junction, angle conditions between the hypersurfaces , continuity of the chemical potentials and a flux-balance. For this system we show stability of its energy minimizers, i.e., standard double bubbles. The main argument relies on a Łojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality. The proof of it differs from others works due to the fully non-linear boundary conditions and problems with the (non-local) tangential part.},

  abstract     = {We study convergence analysis of the first-order stochastic consensus model with random batch interactions. The proposed model can be obtained via random batch method (RBM) from the first-order nonlinear consensus model. This model has two competing mechanisms, namely intrinsic free flow and nonlinear consensus interaction terms. From the competition between the two mechanisms, the original (full batch) model can admit relative equilibria and relaxation of the dynamics to the relative equilibrium in a large coupling regime. In authors&#39; earlier work, we have studied the RBM approximation and its uniform error analysis . In this paper, we present two convergence analysis of RBM solutions toward the relative equilibrium. More precisely, we show that the variances of displacement processes between the full batch and random batch solutions tend to zero exponentially fast, as time goes to infinity. Second, we also show that, almost surely, the diameter process of displacement tends to zero exponentially.},

Moreover we provide a suitable dissipativity condition under which the ergodic hypothesis and the L 2 L2 -bound of the fast component, which are implicit conditions, are satisfied. In the second part we propose a financial application: we consider a slow-fast local stochastic volatility model and prove the weak convergence of the model to a local volatility one.

In particular, the presence of p -ellipticity ensures higher regularity of solutions of such equations. In this work we extend the notion of p -ellipticity to second order elliptic systems. Recall that for systems, there is no single notion of ellipticity , rather a more complicated picture emerges with ellipticity conditions of varying strength such as the Legendre, Legendre-Hadamard and integral conditions. A similar picture emerges when p -ellipticity is considered. In this paper, we define three new notions of p -ellipticity, establish relationships between them and show that each of them does play an important role in solving boundary value problems. These important roles are demonstrated by establishing extrapolation results for solvability of the L p Lp Dirichlet problem for elliptic systems, followed by applications of this result in two different scenarios: one for the Lamé system of linear elasticity and another in the theory of homogenization.},

While there is a substantial literature for the case of a linear inhibitor equation, the study of nonlinear inhibitor effect is still limited. To fill this research gap, we investigate standing pulse solutions to a skew-gradient system in which both activator and inhibitor reaction terms inherit nonlinear structures. Using a variational approach that involves several nonlocal terms, we establish the existence of standing pulse solutions with a sign change.

  abstract     = {We investigate two linear conductivity problems, with strongly contrasting conductivity, in a thin heterogeneous cylinder with a small cross-section of radius h n hn , n in N N . In this cylinder we distinguish an inner cylindrical core C ˆ n Cˆn with cross-section of radius r n &lt; &lt; h n rn&amp;lt;&amp;lt;hn and its complementary annulus I ˆ n Iˆn and we treat two complementary cases. In the first case we consider a low conductivity of order δ n 2 δn2 in the core C ˆ n Cˆn and a conductivity of order 1 in the annulus I ˆ n Iˆn ; the opposite situation in the second case. We study the asymptotic behavior of these problems with three small parameters: h n hn , r n rn , and δ n δn , as h n → 0 hn→0 , r n → 0 rn→0 , r n h n → 0 rnhn→0 , and δ n → 0 δn→0 . In the first case we prove that the inner core has not any influence on the limit behavior. In the second case, we pinpoint three different limit regimes depending on the ratio μ = lim n ⁡ δ n h n μ=limn⁡δnhn , according to μ = 0 μ=0 , 0 &lt; μ &lt; + ∞ 0&amp;lt;μ&amp;lt;+∞ , or μ = + ∞ μ=+∞ . We obtain L 2 L2 -strong convergence for the solution and its gradient. We examine the limit problems and compare them with other models.},

These pointwise regularities seem to be more essential and characterize the solutions for fractional equations, and our proofs are more direct which can also provide optimal conditions for the above regularities. Furthermore, the classical regularity can be regarded as a consequence of pointwise regularity. The method we developed here can also be applied to many other equations, especially for the Poisson equations .},

The main difficulty of studying the bipolar isentropic/non-isentropic CNS-M systems lies in the appearance of the electromagnetic fields satisfying the hyperbolic Maxwell equations . The large time-decay rates of global smooth solutions with small amplitude in L q ( R 3 ) Lq(R3) for 2 ≤ q ≤ ∞ 2≤q≤∞ are established. For the bipolar non-isentropic CNS-M system, the difference of velocities of two charged carriers decay at the rate ( 1 + t ) − 3 4 + 1 4 q (1+t)−34+14q which is faster than the rate ( 1 + t ) − 3 4 + 1 4 q ( ln ⁡ ( 3 + t ) ) 1 − 2 q (1+t)−34+14q(ln⁡(3+t))1−2q of the bipolar isentropic CNS-M system, meanwhile, the magnetic field decay at the rate ( 1 + t ) − 3 4 + 3 4 q ( ln ⁡ ( 3 + t ) ) 1 − 2 q (1+t)−34+34q(ln⁡(3+t))1−2q which is slower than the rate ( 1 + t ) − 3 4 + 3 4 q (1+t)−34+34q for the bipolar isentropic CNS-M system. The approach adopted is the classical energy method but with some new developments, where the techniques of choosing symmetrizers and the spectrum analysis on the linearized homogeneous system play the crucial roles.},

For the half line , we refine the earlier approach by Hupkes and Verduyn Lunel. For the full line, we construct these splittings by generalizing the finite-range results obtained by Mallet-Paret and Verduyn Lunel. The finite dimensional space that is ‘missed’ by these splittings can be characterized using the Hale inner product, but the resulting degeneracy issues raise subtle questions that are much harder to resolve than in the finite-range case. Indeed, there is no direct analogue for the standard ‘atomicity’ condition that is typically used to rule out degeneracies, since it explicitly references the smallest and largest shifts. We construct alternative criteria that exploit finer information on the structure of the MFDE. Our results are optimal when the coefficients are cyclic with respect to appropriate shift semigroups or when the standard positivity conditions typically associated to comparison principles are satisfied. We illustrate these results with explicit examples and counter-examples that involve the Nagumo equation .},

Stability estimates in this general non-entropic setting are of interest in connection with large deviation principles for the hydrodynamic limit of asymmetric interacting particle systems. Our proof adapts the scheme devised by Leger and Vasseur, where one constructs a shift x ( t ) x(t) which allows to bound from above the time-derivative of the left-hand side. The main difference lies in the fact that our solution u ( t , ⋅ ) u(t,⋅) may present a non-entropic shock at x = x ( t ) x=x(t) and new bounds are needed in that situation. We also generalize this stability estimate to initial data with bounded variation .},

  abstract     = {We consider an overdetermined fourth order boundary value problem in which the boundary value of the Laplacian of the solution is prescribed, in addition to the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition . It is known that, in the case where the prescribed boundary value is a constant, this overdetermined problem has a solution if and only if the domain under consideration is a ball. In this paper, we study the shape of a domain admitting a solution to the overdetermined problem when the prescribed boundary value is slightly perturbed from a constant. We derive an integral identity for the fourth order Dirichlet problem and a nonlinear weighted trace inequality, and the combination of them results in a quantitative stability estimate which measures the deviation of a domain from a ball in terms of the perturbation of the boundary value.},

  abstract     = {Using a novel formulation based on flow force, we prove the existence of a global continuum of periodic traveling wave solutions to the irrotational water wave problem in finite depth where the flow force is held fixed, instead of fixing the mass flux. We further establish the limiting behaviour of solutions in this continuum where the flow force remains fixed throughout the continuum of the solutions. The global solutions, with a fixed flow force, show the possibility that a weak stagnation point can be approached at the surface, which is a characteristic of large amplitude irrotational water waves. The formulation is suitable for applications to numerical studies on water waves.},

  abstract     = {To understand the “self-trapping” mechanism inducing spatio-temporal pattern formations observed in the experiment of [21] for bacterial motion, the following density-suppressed motility model { u t = Δ ( γ ( v ) u ) + u ( a − b u ) , v t = Δ v + u − v , {ut=Δ(γ(v)u)+u(a−bu),vt=Δv+u−v, was proposed in [6] , [21] , where u ( x , t ) u(x,t) and v ( x , t ) v(x,t) represent the densities of bacteria and the chemical emitted by the bacteria, respectively; γ ( v ) γ(v) is called the motility function satisfying γ ′ ( v ) &lt; 0 γ′(v)&amp;lt;0 and a , b &gt; 0 a,b&amp;gt;0 are positive constants accounting for the growth and death rates of bacterial cells. The analysis of the above system is highly non-trivial due to the cross-diffusion and possible degeneracy resulting from the nonlinear motility function γ ( v ) γ(v) and mathematical progresses on the global well-posedness and asymptotics of solutions were just made recently. Among other things, the purpose of this paper is to consider the above system with motility function γ ( v ) = 1 ( 1 + v ) m ( m &gt; 0 ) γ(v)=1(1+v)m(m&amp;gt;0) and investigate the traveling wave solutions which are genuine patterns observed in the experiment of [21] . By introducing an auxiliary parabolic problem to which the comparison principle applies and constructing relaxed super- and sub-solutions with spatially inhomogeneous decay rates, we show that there exist two constants ⁎ b ⁎ ( m , a ) b⁎(m,a) and K ( m , a ) K(m,a) , for ⁎ b &gt; b ⁎ ( m , a ) b&amp;gt;b⁎(m,a) and K ( m , a ) &lt; 1 K(m,a)&amp;lt;1 , the above density-suppressed motility model admits traveling wave solutions ( u , v ) ( x , t ) = : ( U , V ) ( x ⋅ ξ − c t ) (u,v)(x,t)=:(U,V)(x⋅ξ−ct) in R N RN along the direction ξ ∈ S N − 1 ξ∈SN−1 for all wave speed c ≥ 2 a c≥2a connecting the equilibrium ( a / b , a / b ) (a/b,a/b) to ( 0 , 0 ) (0,0) , while positive traveling wave solutions will not exist if c &lt; 2 a c&amp;lt;2a . As m → 0 m→0 , we have ⁎ b ⁎ ( m , a ) → 0 b⁎(m,a)→0 and K ( m , a ) → 0 K(m,a)→0 , our results are well consistent with the relevant results for the well-known Fisher-KPP equation (i.e. the first equation of the above system with γ ( v ) = 1 γ(v)=1 ). The main novel idea in the analysis of this paper is the construction of super- and sub-solutions with spatially inhomogeneous (i.e. non-constant) decay rates, in contrast to the constant decay rates used in the literature for reaction-diffusion equations, which was developed to cope with the difficulty caused by the density-dependent nonlinear diffusion in the system. We further discuss the selection of wave patterns and wave speeds for given initial value and use numerical simulations to illustrate that both monotone and non-monotone traveling wavefronts exist depending on whether the motility function γ ( v ) γ(v) changes its convexity at v = a / b v=a/b . Two-dimensional simulations demonstrate that the system can generate outward expanding ring (strip) pattern as observed in the experiment.}}},

It has long been recognized that dynamical methods can be helpful in solving static problems. As an example, the bifurcation of elliptic equations on bounded domains associated with homogenous Dirichlet boundary condition is addressed. By considering the corresponding nonclassical parabolic flows and applying the global dynamic bifurcation theorems given here for local semiflows, some new results with global features are derived.},

  abstract     = {The memory-based diffusion systems have wide applications in practice. Hopf bifurcations are observed from such systems. To meet the demand for computing the normal forms of the Hopf bifurcations of such systems, we develop an effective new algorithm where the memory delay is treated as the perturbation parameter. To illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, we consider a diffusive predator-prey system with memory-based diffusion and Holling type-II functional response. By employing this newly developed procedure, we investigate the direction and stability of the delay-induced mode-1 and mode-2 Hopf bifurcations. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical findings, that is the existence of stable spatially inhomogeneous periodic solutions with mode-1 and mode-2 spatial patterns, and the transition from the unstable mode-2 spatially inhomogeneous periodic solution to the stable mode-1 spatially inhomogeneous periodic solution.},

  abstract     = {In planar analytic vector fields, a monodromic singularity can be distinguished between a focus or a center by means of the Lyapunov coefficients, which are given in terms of the power series coefficients of the first-return map defined around the singularity. In this paper, we are interested in an analogous problem for monodromic tangential singularities of piecewise analytic vector fields Z = ( Z + , Z − ) Z=(Z+,Z−) . First, we prove that the first-return map, defined in a neighborhood of a monodromic tangential singularity, is analytic, which allows the definition of the Lyapunov coefficients. Then, as a consequence of a general property for pair of involutions, we obtain that the index of the first non-vanishing Lyapunov coefficient is always even. In addition, a general recursive formula together with a Mathematica algorithm for computing the Lyapunov coefficients is obtained. We also provide results regarding limit cycles bifurcating from monodromic tangential singularities. Several examples are analyzed.},

  abstract     = {We study the emergent dynamics of the continuum thermodynamic Kuramoto model which arises from the continuum limit of the lattice thermodynamic Kuramoto (TK) model [17] . The continuum TK model governs the time-evolution of the Kuramoto phase field in a temperature field, and the solution to the lattice TK model corresponds to the simple function-valued solution to the continuum TK model on a compact spatial region. Asymptotic emergent estimates for the continuum TK model consist of two sequential processes (temperature homogenization and phase-locking). First, we show that the temperature field relaxes to a positive constant temperature exponentially fast pointwise depending on the nature of the communication weight function. In contrast, the emergent dynamics of phase field exhibits a more rich phenomena. For the phase field in a constant natural frequency field, the phase field concentrates to either one-point cluster or bi-polar cluster, whereas in a nonconstant natural frequency field, the phase field exhibits a phased-locked state asymptotically. We also provide several numerical simulations and compare them with analytical results.},

A global existence result of nonnegative solutions is obtained by applying a classical Schauder fixed point theorem . The proof is upgraded for enhancing the regularity of the solution, namely its gradient belongs to the space L r ( ( 0 , T ) × Ω ) Lr((0,T)×Ω) for some r &gt; 2 r&amp;gt;2 . To this aim, the Schauder&#39;s strategy is coupled with an extension of Meyers regularity result for linear parabolic equations . We show how this approach allows to prove the well-posedness of the problem using only assumptions prescribing and admissibility range for the ratios between the diffusion and cross-diffusion coefficients. The results are compared with those that are reachable with an additional regularity assumption on the parabolic operator, namely a small BMO assumption for its coefficients. Finally, the question of the maximal principle is also addressed, especially when source terms are incorporated in the equation in order to ensure the confinement of the solution.},

Then, the exponential behavior of pulsating fronts as they approach their limiting states is obtained. Finally, by considering the interactions of two different pulsating fronts coming from two opposite/same directions and applying the super-/subsolutions techniques as well as the comparison principle, we establish the existence and various qualitative properties of some different types of entire solutions defined for all time and whole space. Moreover, we give some numerical simulations to describe intuitively these obtained entire solutions.},

When the background flow ψ 0 ψ0 is nontrivial, we construct a family of solutions which has nonzero vorticity in small neighborhoods of a given collection of points. One prescribed set of points comprises minimizers of the Kirchhoff-Routh function, while another part of points is on the boundary determined by both ψ 0 ψ0 and Green&#39;s function. Moreover, heights and circulation of solutions have two kinds of scale. We prove the results by considering maximization problem for the vorticity and analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the maximizers.},

This issue has to do with the notion of cross-nonnegativity of a nonlinear map relative to a cone. We study this property in-depth and derive various characterizations of it. We deviate from the classical literature in at least two ways. First of all, K is allowed to be unpointed and nonsolid. These nontrivial relaxations are needed to cover some interesting examples arising in applications. On the other hand, taking into account the possible lack of differentiability of F , we bring the machinery of Clarke&#39;s nonsmooth analysis into the picture.},

For α : = u ( 0 ) α:=u(0) bifurcation structure in the α – δ plane occurs that for small ε leads to families of singular asymptotic solutions with interior transition layers between outer solutions. In contrast, bifurcation in the α – λ plane produces families of oscillatory solutions that for small ε have large numbers, n , of oscillations between envelope outer solutions. The n label of the solution branch is defined by its local bifurcation at ε 2 n 2 = λ &gt; 0 ε2n2=λ&amp;gt;0 . Further the bifurcation structure on the n branch is classified by the integer n being either even or odd. When n is even the pitchfork bifurcation in the α – δ plane leads to connected branches of solutions in the α – λ – δ space. But when n is odd the presence of g ( x ) g(x) leads to cusp catastrophes (for small ε ) in the α – δ plane and these give rise to disconnected (or isolated) branches of solution in the α – λ plane that appear to be torn from the main solution branch. The integer n acts as a count of the number of oscillations on these solution branches. As ε 2 λ − 1 → 0 ε2λ−1→0 we see layer behaviour occurring about the top and bottom outer solutions and as ε 2 λ − 1 → ∞ ε2λ−1→∞ we find convergence to the middle outer solution.},

Due to the difficulty coming from the degeneracy, our result is quite different from L. Chierchia and D. Qian&#39;s work [8] (non-degenerate case). An interesting phenomenon shown in degenerate case is the ℓ -regularity of above Hamiltonian system not only relies on the tori&#39;s dimension n but also strongly relies on the degenerate index d . Under arbitrary small perturbation P , we prove that if ℓ ≥ ( 5 d + 2 ) ( 8 τ + 3 ) ℓ≥(5d+2)(8τ+3) , where τ &gt; n − 1 τ&amp;gt;n−1 , the above hyperbolic-type degenerate Hamiltonian system admits lower dimensional Diophantine tori which are proved to be of class C β Cβ for any β ≤ 8 τ + 2 β≤8τ+2 .

  abstract     = {The well-posedness theory is studied for the linearized free boundary problem of incompressible ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations in a bounded domain . We express the magnetic field in terms of the velocity field and the deformation tensors in Lagrangian coordinates , and substitute it into the momentum equation to get an equation of the velocity in which the initial magnetic field serves only as a parameter. Then, the velocity equation is linearized with respect to the position vector field whose time derivative is the velocity. In this formulation, a key idea is to use the Lie derivative of the magnetic field taking the advantage that the magnetic field is tangential to the free boundary and divergence free. This paper contributes to the program of developing geometric approaches to study the well-posedness of free boundary problems of ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations under the condition of Taylor sign type for general free boundaries not restricted to graphs.},

When the initial data is a small perturbation around a selected profile, and such a profile is governed by an one dimensional heat equation with a source term , we establish the global in time existence and uniqueness of analytic solutions to the two dimensional (2D) MHD boundary layer equations. It is noted that the far-field state of velocity is not required to be small initially, but decays to zero as time tends to infinity with suitable decay rates. The whole analysis is divided into two parts: When the initial far-field states are not small, we reformulate the original problem into a small perturbation problem by extracting a suitable background profile which is governed by a heat equation, then we prove a long-time existence of solutions, and the lower bound of lifespan of solutions is given in term of the small parameter of initial perturbation; After establishing the long-time existence, combining the decay properties of far-field state and the properties of solutions to the heat equation, it is shown that both the solution obtained in the first part and the background profile indeed satisfy some smallness requirements when time goes to the lower bound of lifespan of solutions.

We establish a sharp threshold dynamic result: there exists a critical value λ ( a ) such that if λ ( a ) &lt; 0 the positive steady state solution of the equation is globally attractive, while if λ ( a ) ≥ 0 the trivial steady state is globally attractive. To this end, we analyze the ω -limit set of the equation and prove that it is a singleton. Moreover, we apply our method to obtain global attractivity of the positive steady state of a spatially nonlocal diffusive logistic model.},

The weakly averaged horseshoe can be constructed as a mean hyperbolic invariant set in the Poincare section for high dimensional phase space . Due to the non-periodic property, the Poincare return map restricted to the weakly averaged horseshoe region can semi-conjugate to the full Bernoulli shift on infinite symbols, which implies the infinitely many independent choices on the length of return time. As a direct application of mean hyperbolicity, we extend the shadowing lemma due to Liao to the general nonautonomous dynamical systems .},

We explore the natural question of the large population limit with two approaches: the now classical mean-field limit and the more recent graph limit. After establishing the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the models that we will consider, we provide a rigorous mathematical justification for taking the graph limit in a general context. Then, establishing the key notion of indistinguishability , which is a necessary framework to consider the mean-field limit, we prove the subordination of the mean-field limit to the graph one in that context. This actually provides an alternative proof for the mean-field limit. We conclude by showing some numerical simulations to illustrate our results.},

We show that strong/weak continuity of the semigroups depends on the support of the boundary damping. The complications are related to supercritical nonlinearity exhibited by the plate along with the compromised boundary regularity of the acoustic waves. Compensated compactness methods along with a hidden boundary regularity of hyperbolic traces are exploited in order to establish weak (resp. strong) generation of a nonlinear semigroup subjected to feedback forces placed on the boundary of the acoustic medium.},

In general, the coefficients of the operator need not be continuous but only bounded and Borel measurable. Some of our results may be considered “quantitative” versions of the Hopf lemma, as they provide the lower bound on the outward normal directional derivative at the maximum point of a subsolution in terms of its value at the point. We shall also show lower bounds on the subsolution around its maximum point by the principal eigenfunction associated with A and the domain. Additional results, among them the weak and strong maximum principles , the weak Harnack inequality are also proven.},

  abstract     = {Finite time blow up vs global regularity question for 3D Euler equation of fluid mechanics is a major open problem. Several years ago, Luo and Hou [16] proposed a new finite time blow up scenario based on extensive numerical simulations. The scenario is axi-symmetric and features fast growth of vorticity near a ring of hyperbolic points of the flow located at the boundary of a cylinder containing the fluid. An important role is played by a small boundary layer where intense growth is observed. Several simplified models of the scenario have been considered, all leading to finite time blow up [3] , [2] , [9] , [13] , [11] , [15] . In this paper, we propose two models that are designed specifically to gain insight in the evolution of fluid near the hyperbolic stagnation point of the flow located at the boundary. One model focuses on analysis of the depletion of nonlinearity effect present in the problem. Solutions to this model are shown to be globally regular. The second model can be seen as an attempt to capture the velocity field near the boundary to the next order of accuracy compared with the one-dimensional models such as [3] , [2] . Solutions to this model blow up in finite time.},

  abstract     = {It is rather well-known that hyperbolic operators have the shadowing property. In the setting of finite dimensional Banach spaces , having the shadowing property is equivalent to being hyperbolic. In 2018, Bernardes et al. constructed an operator with the shadowing property which is not hyperbolic, settling an open question. In the process, they introduced a class of operators which has come to be known as generalized hyperbolic operators. This class of operators seems to be an important bridge between hyperbolicity and the shadowing property. In this article, we show that for a large natural class of operators on L p ( X ) Lp(X) the notion of generalized hyperbolicity and the shadowing property coincide. We do this by giving sufficient and necessary conditions for a certain class of operators to have the shadowing property. We also introduce computational tools which allow construction of operators with and without the shadowing property. Utilizing these tools, we show how some natural probability distributions, such as the Laplace distribution and the Cauchy distribution , lead to operators with and without the shadowing property on L p ( X ) Lp(X) .},

The results are new even in the completely controllable case. As the main tool we use the limit theorem for monotone matrix-valued functions by Kratz (1993). The methods allow to present a new proof of the known monotonicity property of the Lidskii angles. The results and methods can also be potentially applied in the singular Sturmian theory on unbounded intervals , in the oscillation theory of linear Hamiltonian systems without the Legendre condition, in the comparative index theory , or in linear algebra in the theory of matrices.},

  abstract     = {We consider a nonautonomous system x ˙ = A ( t ) x + f ( t , x , y ) , y ˙ = g ( t , y ) x˙=A(t)x+f(t,x,y),y˙=g(t,y) and give conditions under which there is a transformation of the form H ( t , x , y ) = ( x + h ( t , x , y ) , y ) H(t,x,y)=(x+h(t,x,y),y) taking its solutions onto the solutions of the partially linearized system x ˙ = A ( t ) x , y ˙ = g ( t , y ) . x˙=A(t)x,y˙=g(t,y). Shi and Xiong [28] proved a special case where g ( t , y ) g(t,y) was a linear function of y and x ˙ = A ( t ) x x˙=A(t)x had an exponential dichotomy. Our assumptions on A and f are of the general form considered by Reinfelds and Steinberga [25] , which include many of the generalizations of Palmer&#39;s theorem proved by other authors. Inspired by the work of Shi and Xiong, we also prove Hölder continuity of H and its inverse in x and y . Again the proofs are given in the context of Reinfelds and Steinberga but we show what the results reduce to when x ˙ = A ( t ) x x˙=A(t)x is assumed to have an exponential dichotomy. The paper is concluded with the discrete version of the results.},

We study various types of almost periodic sequences arising in the literature and adapt their notions to the parametric framework. Then, similarly to the continuous case , we aim to prove variational principles . These variational principles are used to obtain some structural results and some theorems of existence in a Hilbert framework. We give, in particular, a discrete version of Amerio&#39;s criterion, and adapt a known method to the discrete time case in order to get an existence result on Hilbert space . The condition we obtain allows to find a classical known condition in the case where the system is linear with constant coefficients .},

Using the nonlinear steepest-descent method for analyzing Riemann-Hilbert problems, we compute the leading-order asymptotic behavior in the algebraic-decay, non-oscillatory, and oscillatory regions.},

It is shown that the topological or measure-theoretical entropy tuples are correspondingly mean sensitive tuples under certain conditions (minimal in the topological setting or ergodic in the measure-theoretical setting). Characterizations of the question when every non-diagonal tuple is mean sensitive are presented. Among other results we show that under minimality assumption a topological dynamical system is weakly mixing if and only if every non-diagonal tuple is mean sensitive and so as a consequence every minimal weakly mixing topological dynamical system is mean n -sensitive for any integer n ≥ 2 n≥2 . Moreover, the notion of weakly sensitive in the mean tuple is introduced and it turns out that this property has some special lift property. As an application we obtain that the maximal mean equicontinuous factor for any topological dynamical system can be induced by the smallest closed invariant equivalence relation containing all weakly sensitive in the mean pairs.},

The system under investigation couples the Navier–Stokes equations for the fluid velocity, a convective Cahn–Hilliard equation with physically relevant singular potential for the phase-field variable and an advection-diffusion-reaction equation for the nutrient density. For the initial boundary value problem in a smooth bounded domain Ω ⊂ R 2 Ω⊂R2 , we first prove the existence and uniqueness of global strong solutions that are strictly separated from the pure states ±1 over time. Then we prove the continuous dependence with respect to the initial data and source term for the strong solution in energy norms. Finally, we show the propagation of regularity for global weak solutions.},

In this article, the authors investigate global (weighted) estimates for the gradient of solutions to Robin boundary value problems of second-order elliptic equations of divergence form with real-valued, bounded, measurable coefficients on Ω. More precisely, let p ∈ ( n / ( n − 1 ) , ∞ ) p∈(n/(n−1),∞) . Using a real-variable argument, the authors obtain two necessary and sufficient conditions for W 1 , p W1,p estimates of solutions to Robin boundary value problems, respectively, in terms of a weak reverse Hölder inequality with exponent p or weighted W 1 , q W1,q estimates of solutions with q ∈ ( n / ( n − 1 ) , p ] q∈(n/(n−1),p] and some Muckenhoupt weights. As applications, the authors establish some global regularity estimates for solutions to Robin boundary value problems of second-order elliptic equations of divergence form with small BMO coefficients, respectively, on bounded Lipschitz domains, C 1 C1 domains or (semi-)convex domains, in the scale of weighted Lebesgue spaces, via some quite subtle approach which is different from the existing ones and, even when n = 3 n=3 in case of bounded C 1 C1 domains, also gives an alternative correct proof of some known result under an additional assumption. By this and some technique from harmonic analysis , the authors further obtain the global regularity estimates, respectively, in Morrey spaces, (Musielak–)Orlicz spaces, and variable Lebesgue spaces.},

After deriving a suitable local normal form, we study the dynamics for the smooth system with sufficiently small but non-zero ϵ , using a combination of geometric singular perturbation theory and blow-up . We show that the type of BF bifurcation in the PWS system determines the bifurcation structure for the smooth system within an ϵ −dependent domain which shrinks to zero as ϵ → 0 ϵ→0 , identifying a supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation in one case, and a supercritical Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation in two other cases. We also show that PWS cycles associated with BF bifurcations persist as relaxation oscillations in the smooth system, and prove existence of a family of stable limit cycles which connects the relaxation oscillations to regular cycles within the ϵ −dependent domain described above. Our results are applied to models for Gause predator-prey interaction and mechanical oscillation subject to friction.},

The dislocation potential is a periodic potential for x &lt; 0 x&amp;lt;0 and the same potential but shifted by t ∈ R t∈R for x &gt; 0 x&amp;gt;0 . Its spectrum has an absolutely continuous part (the union of bands separated by gaps) plus at most two eigenvalues in each gap. Its resolvent admits a meromorphic continuation onto a two-sheeted Riemann surface . We prove that it has only two simple poles on each open gap: eigenvalues or resonances. These poles are called states and there are no other poles. We prove: 1) states are continuous functions of t , and we obtain their local asymptotics; 2) for each t states in the gap are distinct; 3) states can be monotone or non-monotone functions of t ; 4) we construct examples of operators with different types of states in gaps.},

  abstract     = {The paper is concerned with two-person zero-sum mean-field linear-quadratic stochastic differential games over finite horizons. By a Hilbert space method, a necessary condition and a sufficient condition are derived for the existence of an open-loop saddle point. It is shown that under the sufficient condition, the associated two Riccati equations admit unique strongly regular solutions, in terms of which the open-loop saddle point can be represented as a linear feedback of the current state. When the game only satisfies the necessary condition, an approximate sequence is constructed by solving a family of Riccati equations and closed-loop systems. The convergence of the approximate sequence turns out to be equivalent to the open-loop solvability of the game, and the limit is exactly an open-loop saddle point, provided that the game is open-loop solvable.},

The main feature of this model is a nonlinear coupling of pressure and dilation through the system&#39;s permeability tensor. Such a model has been analyzed previously from the point of view of constructing weak solutions through a fully discretized approach. In this treatment, we consider simplified Dirichlet type boundary conditions in both the elastic displacement and pressure variables and give a full treatment of weak solutions. Our construction of weak solutions for the nonlinear problem is based on a priori estimates , a requisite feature in addressing the nonlinearity . We utilize a spatial semi-discretization and employ a multi-valued fixed point argument for a clear construction of weak solutions. We also provide regularity criteria for uniqueness of solutions.},

Under this special case of the weak null condition, which we refer to as the bounded weak null condition , we prove the existence of solutions to these systems of wave equations on neighborhoods of spatial infinity under a small initial data assumption. Existence is established using the Fuchsian method. This method involves transforming the wave equations into a Fuchsian equation defined on a bounded spacetime region. The existence of solutions to the Fuchsian equation then follows from an application of the existence theory developed in [11] . This, in turn, yields, by construction, solutions to the original system of wave equations on a neighborhood of spatial infinity.},

We develop a Bautin-type method to study the ν -cyclicity of the equilibrium, that is, the maximum number of small-amplitude ν -limit cycles (isolated periodic ν -orbits) that can be made to bifurcate from the equilibrium by moving the parameters of the family restricted to some open semi-algebraic sets. The method uses branching theory based on Newton-Puiseux Theorem to get a finite number of an analytic reduced one-dimensional Poincaré maps with associated Bautin ideal on certain Noetherian ring of rational functions on an extended parameter space. We derive global upper bounds on the number of bifurcated ν -limit cycles even in the infinite codimension case for which the perturbation of a local two-dimensional invariant manifold through the singularity completely foliated by periodic ν -orbits needs to be performed. A cubic normal form serves as an example of this procedure.},

In this model, farmers are assumed to be divided into two subpopulations according to a mobility rule, namely, into sedentary and migrating farming populations. The conversion between the farming subpopulations depends on the total density of farmers and it is superimposed on the classical Lotka-Volterra competition model, so that it is described by a three-component reaction-diffusion-ODE system. In this article we consider a singular limit problem when the conversion rate tends to infinity and prove under appropriate conditions that solutions of the three component system converge to solutions of a two-component system with a linear diffusion and nonlinear degenerate diffusion.},

The primaries of masses m 1 = m 2 m1=m2 move along a degenerate Keplerian elliptic collision orbit (on a line) under their gravitational attraction, whereas the third, massless particle, moves on the plane perpendicular to their line of motion and passing through the center of mass of the primaries. By symmetry, the component of the angular momentum G of the massless particle along the direction of the line of the primaries is conserved. We show the existence of symbolic dynamics in the REI3BP for large G by building a Smale horseshoe on a certain subset of the phase space. As a consequence we deduce that the REI3BP possesses oscillatory motions, namely orbits which leave every bounded region but return infinitely often to some fixed bounded region. The proof relies on the existence of transversal homoclinic connections associated to an invariant manifold at infinity. Since the distance between the stable and unstable manifolds of infinity is exponentially small, Melnikov theory does not apply.},

Because of the complexity of the problems, it is natural to divide our contributions into two parts to answer a long-standing question in biology and ecology. What are the minimal conditions for long-term persistence and extinction of a population? Part I of our work provides characterization of persistence, whereas in this part, extinction is the main focus. The techniques used in this paper are combination of the newly developed functional Itô formula and a dynamic system approach. Compared to the study of stochastic Kolmogorov systems without delays, the main difficulty is that infinite dimensional systems have to be treated. The extinction is characterized after investigating random occupation measures and examining behavior of functional systems around boundaries. Our characterizations of long-term behavior of the systems reduce to that of Kolmogorov systems without delay when there is no past dependence. A number of applications are also examined.},

  abstract     = {This work is devoted to the study of long-term qualitative behavior of randomly perturbed dynamical systems . The focus is on certain stochastic differential equations (SDE) with Markovian switching, when the switching is fast varying and the diffusion (white noise) is slowly changing. Consider the system d X ε , δ ( t ) = f ( X ε , δ ( t ) , α ε ( t ) ) d t + δ σ ( X ε , δ ( t ) , α ε ( t ) ) d W ( t ) , X ε , δ ( 0 ) = x , α ε ( 0 ) = i , dXε,δ(t)=f(Xε,δ(t),αε(t))dt+δσ(Xε,δ(t),αε(t))dW(t),Xε,δ(0)=x,αε(0)=i, where α ε ( t ) αε(t) is a finite state Markov chain with irreducible generator Q = ( q ι ℓ ) Q=(qιℓ) . The relative changing rates of the switching and the diffusion are highlighted by two small parameters ε and δ . Associated with the above stochastic differential equation, there is an averaged ordinary differential equation (ODE) d X ‾ ( t ) = f ‾ ( X ‾ ( t ) ) d t , X ‾ ( 0 ) = x , dX‾(t)=f‾(X‾(t))dt,X‾(0)=x, where f ‾ ( ⋅ ) = ∑ ι = 1 m 0 f ( ⋅ , ι ) ν ι f‾(⋅)=∑ι=1m0f(⋅,ι)νι and ( ν 1 , … , ν m 0 ) (ν1,…,νm0) is the unique stationary distribution of the Markov chain with generator Q . Suppose that for each pair ( ε , δ ) (ε,δ) , the process has an invariant probability measure μ ε , δ με,δ , and that the averaged ODE has a limit cycle in which there is an averaged occupation measure μ 0 μ0 for the averaged equation. It is proved in this paper that under weak conditions, if f ‾ f‾ has finitely many stable or hyperbolic fixed points, then μ ε , δ με,δ converges weakly to μ 0 μ0 as ε → 0 ε→0 and δ → 0 δ→0 . Our results generalize to the setting where the switching process α ε αε is state-dependent in that P { α ε ( t + Δ ) = ℓ | α ε = ι , X ε , δ ( s ) , α ε ( s ) , s ≤ t } = q ι ℓ ( X ε , δ ( t ) ) Δ + o ( Δ ) , ι ≠ ℓ P{αε(t+Δ)=ℓ|αε=ι,Xε,δ(s),αε(s),s≤t}=qιℓ(Xε,δ(t))Δ+o(Δ),ι≠ℓ as long as the generator Q ( ⋅ ) = ( q ι ℓ ( ⋅ ) ) Q(⋅)=(qιℓ(⋅)) is locally bounded, locally Lipschitz, and irreducible for all x ∈ R d x∈Rd . Finally, we provide two examples in two and three dimensions to showcase our results.},

  abstract     = {Qualitative changes in sound intensities frequently occur in musical signals and Hopf bifurcation control is the most natural mathematical approach to study them. We propose a natural formulation for investigating and generating varieties of pitch simultaneity and sound intensity using Eulerian flows with n -tuple Hopf singularity for a sufficiently large n . Chord leaves and chord limit sets are defined as two critical flow-invariant manifolds. The reduction of flows on chord leaves facilitate the study and bifurcation control through a generic codimension-three (a three-parametric family) scalar bifurcation problem. There is a one-to-one correspondence between bifurcations of positive equilibria in the scalar equation and bifurcations of invariant chord limit sets. An ordered set of double saddle-node and pitchfork bifurcation control of subcritical and supercritical types can describe and generate the sound intensity bifurcations of a sheet music. These scalar bifurcations are interpreted in terms of appearances and disappearances of various chord leaf-stable and unstable flow-invariant chord limit sets. We apply our proposed method to the first three bars of a sheet music. This is implemented in Matlab so that one can hear the smooth dynamic effect of bifurcations using a computer through a classical sheet music. Then, one can hear how pitchfork (subcritical and supercritical) and double fold-bifurcations of invariant hypertori sound in music.},

In this paper we address the problem of persistence of TWS of a given PDE under small perturbations. Our main results deal with the situation where the associated ODE has a center and, as a consequence, the original PDE has a continuum of periodic traveling wave solutions. We prove that the TWS that persist are controlled by the zeroes of some Abelian integrals. We apply our results to several famous PDE, like the Ostrovsky, Klein-Gordon, sine-Gordon, Korteweg-de Vries, Rosenau-Hyman, Camassa-Holm, and Boussinesq equations.},

In this paper, for every q &gt; 1 q&amp;gt;1 and θ ∈ R θ∈R , we prove that the elliptic problem ( ⋆ ) (⋆) − Δ u − λ | x | − 2 u + | x | θ u q = 0 −Δu−λ|x|−2u+|x|θuq=0 in R N ∖ { 0 } RN∖{0} with u &gt; 0 u&amp;gt;0 has a C 1 ( R N ∖ { 0 } ) C1(RN∖{0}) solution if and only if ⁎ λ &gt; λ ⁎ λ&amp;gt;λ⁎ , where ⁎ λ ⁎ = Θ ( N − 2 − Θ ) λ⁎=Θ(N−2−Θ) with Θ = ( θ + 2 ) / ( q − 1 ) Θ=(θ+2)/(q−1) .

We fix our attention to lower bounds of local criticality for low degree planar polynomial centers. The main technique is the study of perturbations of reversible holomorphic (isochronous) centers, inside the reversible centers class. More concretely, we study the Taylor developments of the period constants with respect to the perturbation parameters. First, we see that there are systems of degree 3 ≤ n ≤ 16 3≤n≤16 for which up to first order at least ( n 2 + n − 4 ) / 2 (n2+n−4)/2 critical periods bifurcate from the center. Second, we improve this number for centers with degree from 3 to 9. In particular, we obtain 6 and 10 critical periods for cubic and quartic degree systems, respectively.},

At the same time, sufficient conditions ensuring the existence of non-constant solutions are obtained by using Leray-Schauder degree theory.

However, for systems of Friedrichs type, there is a sharp disparity between established well-posedness theories, which are not variational, and the very successful discontinuous Galerkin methods that have been developed for such systems, which are variational. In an attempt to override this dichotomy, we present, through three specific examples of increasing complexity, well-posed variational formulations of boundary and initial–boundary-value problems of Friedrichs type. The variational forms we introduce are generalizations of those used for discontinuous Galerkin methods, in the sense that inhomogeneous boundary and initial conditions are enforced weakly through integrals in the variational forms. In the variational forms we introduce, the solution space is defined as a subspace V of the graph space associated with the differential operator in question, whereas the test function space L is a tuple of L 2 L2 spaces that separately enforce the equation, boundary conditions of characteristic type, and initial conditions.},

In the limit of thin but non-zero interfacial width, ε ≪ 1 ε≪1 , the bilayer manifold is parameterized by meandering modes that describe the interfacial evolution. The normal coercivity of the manifold is limited by “pearling” modes that control the structure of the profile near the interface, these are weakly damped and can lead to the dynamic rupture of the interface. Amphiphilic interfaces may decrease energy by either lengthening or shortening, depending upon the amphiphilic mass distributed in the bulk. We introduce an implicitly defined parameterization of the interfacial shape that uncouples the length change from the parameters describing the shape and introduce a nonlinear projection onto the manifold from a surrounding neighborhood. The bilayer manifold has asymptotically large but finite dimension tuned to maximize normal coercivity while preserving the wave-number gap between the meandering and the pearling modes. Modulo a pearling stability assumption, we show that the manifold attracts nearby orbits into a tubular neighborhood about itself so long as the interfacial shape remains sufficiently smooth and far from self-intersection. In a companion paper, [8] , we identify open sets of initial data whose orbits converge to circular equilibrium after a significant transient, and derive a singularly perturbed interfacial evolution comprised of motion against curvature regularized by an asymptotically weak Willmore term.},

The proof utilises a commutator estimate which allows for an extension of the relative entropy method to the required regularity setting. The systems of elasticity, shallow water magnetohydrodynamics, and isentropic Euler are investigated, recovering recent results for the latter. Moreover, the article explores a triangular system motivated by studies in chromatography and constructs an explicit solution which fails to be Lipschitz, yet satisfies the conditions of the presented uniqueness result.},

Thus the low contrast material acts as near insulation in-between the conducting materials. In the first part, we study the homogenization problem of an elliptic equation . The main discussion in this article is the study of optimal control problems based on the unfolding method. The interesting result is the difference in the limit behavior of the optimal control problem, which crucially depends on the action of the control, whether it is on the conductivity part or insulating part. In both cases, we derive the two-scale limit controls problems which are quite similar as far as analysis is concerned. But, if the controls are acting on the conductive region, a complete scale separation is available, whereas a complete separation is not visible in the insulating case due to the intrinsic nature of the problem. In this case, to obtain the limit optimal control problem in the macro scale, two cross-sectional cell problems are introduced. We do obtain the homogenized equation for the state, but the two-scale cost functional remains as it is.},

This leads to a renewal equation which occurs in many evolutionary biology problems. We aim to describe precisely the asymptotic behavior of the solution, to infer properties that illustrate the concentration and adaptive dynamics of such a population. This work is a continuation of [38] where the case without mutations is considered. When mutations are taken into account, it is necessary to control the corrector which is the main novelty of the present paper. Our approach consists in defining, by the Hopf transform, a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with an effective Hamiltonian as in homogenization problems. Its solution carries the singular part of the limiting density (typically Dirac masses) and the corrector defines the weights. The main new result of this paper is to prove that the corrector is uniformly bounded, using only the global Lipschitz and semi-convexity estimates for the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We also establish the limiting equation satisfied by the corrector. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example where such bounds can be proved in such a context.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, motivated by recent papers on the stabilization of evolution problems with nonlocal degenerate damping terms, we address an extensible beam model with degenerate nonlocal damping of Balakrishnan-Taylor type. We discuss initially on the well-posedness with respect to weak and regular solutions. Then we show for the first time how hard is to guarantee the stability of the energy solution (related to regular solutions) in the scenarios of constant and non-constant coefficient of extensibility. The degeneracy (in time) of the single nonlocal damping coefficient and the methodology employed in the stability approach are the main novelty for this kind of beam models with degenerate damping.},

Exploiting the harmonic analysis tools (especially Littlewood-Paley theory), we first study the global well-posedness of the model with small initial data in spaces with low regularity. Then, under some suitable conditions involving only the low frequency of the initial data, we also obtain the optimal decay rates of the solutions. Compared with the result by Wang and Wen (Math.

  abstract     = {Stability and large-time behavior are essential properties of solutions to many partial differential equations (PDEs) and play crucial roles in many practical applications. When there is full Laplacian, many techniques such as the Fourier splitting method have been created to obtain the large-time decay rates. However, when a PDE is anisotropic and involves only partial dissipation, these methods no longer apply and no effective approach is currently available. This paper aims at the stability and large-time behavior of the 3D anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations. We present a systematic approach to obtain the optimal decay rates of the stable solutions emanating from a small data. We establish that, if the initial velocity is small in the Sobolev space H 4 ( R 3 ) ∩ H h − σ ( R 3 ) H4(R3)∩Hh−σ(R3) , then the anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations have a unique global solution, and the solution and its first-order derivatives all decay at the optimal rates. Here H h − σ Hh−σ with σ &gt; 0 σ&amp;gt;0 denotes a Sobolev space with negative horizontal index.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by various physical, cellular and ecological applications, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in studying the boundary adsorption-desorption of diffusive substances between a bulk (body) and a surface, by using “bulk-surface models” (involving volumetric densities and surface densities) or by using models involving dynamical boundary conditions for volumetric densities. The surface in the models has no thickness. However, in some real world applications, the “surface” is actually a thin membrane, having positive, albeit small thickness δ , as in the cases of thermal barrier coatings for turbine engine blades and cell membranes. In such situations, rigorous derivations for these models seem lacking and desirable. In this paper, we start with two full models each of which contains reaction-diffusion equations in the bulk and the thin membrane, respectively, with two types of reasonable transmission conditions linking the two. Then in the limit of δ → 0 δ→0 , we obtain two effective models, with one being a bulk-surface model and the other being the dynamical boundary value problem model, from which we can also recover the surface density of the other substance. Our analysis reveals that to have such effective models, it is crucial that (i) appropriate transmission conditions are satisfied on the interface between the bulk and the thin membrane, and (ii) the diffusion tensor in the thin membrane is “optimally aligned”, which means the principal axes of the tensor are either normal or tangential to the interface.},

In this paper, we study the bifurcation of a highly nonlinear and highly coupled PDE model describing the growth of an arterial plaque in the early stage of atherosclerosis. The model involves LDL and HDL cholesterols, macrophage cells, and foam cells, with the interface separating the plaque and blood flow regions being a free boundary. We establish finite branches of symmetry-breaking stationary solutions which bifurcate from the radially symmetric solution. Since plaques in reality are unlikely to be strictly radially symmetric, our result would be useful to explain the asymmetric shapes of plaques.},

This connects local and nonlocal Calderón type problems. We prove two main results on these type of problems: On the one hand, we derive simultaneous bulk and boundary Runge approximation results. Building on these, we deduce uniqueness for localized bulk and boundary potentials. On the other hand, we construct a family of CGO solutions associated with the corresponding equations. These allow us to deduce uniqueness results for arbitrary bounded, not necessarily localized bulk and boundary potentials. The CGO solutions are constructed by duality to a new Carleman estimate.},

The model, when regularised, reduces to a nonlinear degenerate parabolic equation coupled to an ordinary differential equation . This PDE–ODE coupled system, also studied in the fields of bio-film and cellular biology, possesses an interesting mathematical structure which, to our knowledge, remains relatively unexplored. The existence of solutions for the non-degenerate version of the model is shown using the Rothe&#39;s method. Furthermore, an L ∞ L∞ bound is obtained for the solutions under certain restrictions. Existence of solutions for the degenerate case is then shown assuming that the initial condition is bounded away from the degenerate points. Finally, it is proven that if the solution for the unregularised case exists, then it is contained within physically consistent bounds.},

  abstract     = {This paper concerns with the existence of transonic shocks for steady Euler flows in a 3-D axisymmetric cylindrical nozzle, which are governed by the Euler equations with the slip boundary condition on the wall of the nozzle and a receiver pressure at the exit. Mathematically, it can be formulated as a free boundary problem with the shock front being the free boundary to be determined. In dealing with the free boundary problem, one of the key points is determining the position of the shock front. To this end, a free boundary problem for the linearized Euler system will be proposed, whose solution gives an initial approximating position of the shock front. Compared with the 2-D case, new difficulties arise due to the additional 0-order terms and singularities along the symmetric axis. New observations and careful analysis will be done to overcome these difficulties. Once the initial approximation is obtained, a nonlinear iteration scheme can be carried out, which converges to a transonic shock solution to the problem.},

We first establish a global-in-time existence of measure-valued solutions to the kinetic CS equation. For this, we use a proper change of variable to reformulate the particle CS model as a first-order particle system and provide the uniform-in-time stability for that particle system. We then extend this stability estimate for the singular CS particle system. By using that stability estimate, we construct the measure-valued solutions to the kinetic CS equation globally in time. Moreover, as a direct application of the uniform-in-time stability estimate, we show the quantitative uniform-in-time mean-field limit from the particle system to that kinetic CS equation in p -Wasserstein distance with p ∈ [ 1 , ∞ ] p∈[1,∞] . Our result gives the uniqueness of measure-valued solution in the sense of mean-field limits, i.e., the measure-valued solutions, approximated by the empirical measures associated to the particle system, uniquely exist. Similar results for the first-order model also follow as a by-product. We also reformulate the continuity-type equation, which is derived from the first-order model, as an integro-differential equation by employing the pseudo-inverse of the accumulative particle distribution. By making use of a modified p -Wasserstein distance, we provide the contractivity estimate for absolutely continuous solutions of the continuum equation.},

In particular, the closer the value of p is to 2, the more difficult the study becomes.

However, not much is known for other types of boundary configurations. In this paper, we consider minimizers connecting two free boundaries and study possible quadruple collisions under the following four symmetric configurations: isosceles trapezoid configuration, rectangular configuration, double isosceles configuration and diamond configuration. Whenever the boundary configuration of four bodies coincides with one of the four symmetric configurations, we show that these four bodies are free of quadruple collision on that boundary set. New ideas and detailed analysis are introduced in order to construct deformed paths in some of the cases and estimate their action values. As its applications, we show the existence of several sets of periodic orbits in the planar four-body and five-body problems.},

A detailed exploration of (0.1) on solvability will be presented. More precisely, we will prove that for p ∈ ( 0 , 2 ) p∈(0,2) , there exists a positive function f ∈ C α ( S 1 ) , α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) f∈Cα(S1),α∈(0,1) such that (0.1) admits a nonnegative solution vanishes somewhere on S 1 S1 . In case p ∈ ( − 1 , 0 ] p∈(−1,0] , a surprising a-priori upper/lower bound for solution was established, which implies the existence of positive classical solution to each positive function f ∈ C α ( S 1 ) f∈Cα(S1) . When p ∈ ( − 2 , − 1 ] p∈(−2,−1] , the existence of some special positive classical solution has already been known using the Blaschke-Santalo inequality [7] . Upon the final case p ≤ − 2 p≤−2 , we show that there exist some positive functions f ∈ C α ( S 1 ) f∈Cα(S1) such that (0.1) admits no solution.

The principal feature of our study is the assumption that the twist deformation of the nematic director incurs much higher energy penalty than other modes of deformation. The appropriate ratio of the elastic constants then gives a small parameter ε entering an Allen-Cahn-type energy functional augmented by a twist term. We consider the behavior of the energy as ε tends to zero. We demonstrate existence of the local energy minimizers classified by their overall twist, find the Γ-limit of the relaxed energies and show that it consists of the twist and jump terms. Further, we extend our results to include the situation when the cholesteric pitch vanishes along with ε .},

In order to overcome the lack of a-priori estimates, our proof uses the formal gradient flow structure of the system and an extension of the boundedness by entropy method which involves a careful analysis of an auxiliary variational problem . This allows to obtain solutions to an approximate, time-discrete system. Letting the time step size go to zero, we recover the desired weak solution where, due to their low regularity, the Cahn-Hilliard terms require a special treatment.},

It is well-known that the three-dimensional viscous PEs is globally well-posed in Sobolev spaces . On the other hand, the inviscid PEs without rotation is known to be ill-posed in Sobolev spaces, and its smooth solutions can form singularity in finite time . In this paper, we extend the above results in the presence of rotation. We construct finite-time blowup solutions to the inviscid PEs with rotation, and establish that the inviscid PEs with rotation is ill-posed in Sobolev spaces in the sense that its perturbation around a certain steady state background flow is both linearly and nonlinearly ill-posed in Sobolev spaces. Its linear instability is of the Kelvin-Helmholtz type similar to the one appears in the context of vortex sheets problem. This implies that the inviscid PEs is also linearly ill-posed in Gevrey class of order s &gt; 1 s&amp;gt;1 , and suggests that a suitable space for the well-posedness is Gevrey class of order s = 1 s=1 , which is exactly the space of analytic functions.},

We solve the equation in vectorial spherical harmonics basis to obtain modal equations for the different components of the unknown wave motions. These equations are then decoupled and written in Schrödinger form, whose coefficients are shown to be C 2 C2 apart from at most two regular singular points , and to decay like a Coulomb potential at infinity. These properties allow us to construct an outgoing Green&#39;s kernel for each spherical mode. We also compute asymptotic expansions of coefficients up to order r − 3 r−3 as r tends to infinity, and show numerically that their accuracy is improved by including the contribution from the gravity although this term is of order r − 3 r−3 .},

Thus, this equation has both properties of hyperbolic equations and those of parabolic equations . Accordingly, it is difficult to investigate the behavior of solutions to (CP). Therefore, it is necessary to construct particular solutions and investigate their properties. In pure hyperbolic case, Riemann solutions are well studied because they are self-similar solutions. However, it cannot be expected in this paper. Hence, we focus on the traveling wave structure instead of the self-similar structure. At first, we construct traveling waves to (CP) and investigate their properties. Next, we discuss the asymptotic behavior of entropy solutions to (CP) using the constructed traveling waves. Finally, we estimate the propagation speed of support for entropy solutions to (CP) using the modified traveling waves.},

One of the main motivations is to elucidate the role played by the angular velocity in the structure of steady inviscid compressible flows. We give a complete classification of flow patterns in terms of boundary conditions at the inner and outer circle. Due to the nonzero angular velocity, many new flow patterns will appear. There exists accelerating or decelerating smooth transonic flows in an annulus satisfying one side boundary conditions at the inner or outer circle with all sonic points being nonexceptional and noncharacteristically degenerate. More importantly, it is found that besides the well-known supersonic-subsonic shock in a divergent nozzle as in the case without angular velocity, there exists a supersonic-supersonic shock solution, where the downstream state may change smoothly from supersonic to subsonic. Furthermore, there exists a supersonic-sonic shock solution where the shock circle and the sonic circle coincide, which is new and interesting.},

As a consequence, we lose the strong continuity of the solution operators and this, in turn, has as a consequence that the Riemann integral no longer suffices for giving meaning to the variation-of-constants formula. To compensate, we develop the Stieltjes-Pettis integral in the setting of a norming dual pair of spaces. Part I provides general theory, Part II deals with “retarded” equations, and in Part III we show how the Stieltjes integral enables incorporation of unbounded perturbations corresponding to neutral delay equations.},

Together with the FitzHugh-Nagumo model for the nonlinearity they represent defibrillation processes of the human heart. We study a fairly general type with co-located inputs and outputs describing both boundary and distributed control and observation. The control objective is output trajectory tracking with prescribed performance. To achieve this we employ the funnel controller, which is model-free and of low complexity. The controller introduces a nonlinear and time-varying term in the closed-loop system, for which we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions. Additionally, exploiting the parabolic nature of the problem, we obtain Hölder continuity of the state, inputs and outputs. We illustrate our results by a simulation of a standard test example for the termination of reentry waves.},

Recent works have explored spectral techniques to show that, for some low-order delay-differential equations of retarded type, spectral values of maximal multiplicity are dominant, and hence determine the asymptotic behavior of the system, a property known as multiplicity-induced-dominancy . This work further explores such a property and shows its validity for general linear delay-differential equations of retarded type of arbitrary order including a single delay in the system&#39;s representation. More precisely, an interesting link between characteristic functions with a real root of maximal multiplicity and Kummer&#39;s confluent hypergeometric functions is exploited.

This formulation uses suitable rotating coordinates based on an ellipsoidal model for the Earth&#39;s geoid and allows for thermodynamic forcing. We invoke only the thin-shell approximation and the geometrical approximation (nearly spherical), retaining all other parameters. Thus we present a general theory for atmospheric flows, based on well-defined approximation methods. This leads to a perturbation of the stationary background state which produces a somewhat familiar, general structure, but with a forcing that is generated by a suitable form of the perturbation temperature field. We show how the new system recovers the classical Ekman, geostrophic and thermal-wind models, expressed more generally in rotating, spheroidal geometry. The new system is also used to present solutions for the Hadley-Ferrel-polar cell structure, for the Walker circulation and to describe the flow in the middle atmosphere. In all these examples, our approach enables us to describe in detail the velocity field and to show how it is possible to identify the heat sources required to maintain the motion.},

A general explicit expression of the first and second order Melnikov functions is presented for such piecewise Hamiltonian systems. In addition, the maximum number of limit cycles for piecewise linear differential system is an important topic that many researchers are concerned with. Different from considering a piecewise linear perturbation of a linear center in the previous research, we apply our explicit expression to estimate the number of limit cycles bifurcated from a class of piecewise linear Hamiltonian systems. More specifically, the unperturbed system we study is piecewise smooth and constructed by a linear center and a constant differential system, which is difficult to be considered by a polar coordinate transformation. And we obtain the upper bounds to be 4 and 5 for the limit cycles bifurcated from the periodic orbits by using the first and second order Melnikov functions, respectively. Moreover the upper bounds are sharp.},

Two free boundaries represent the expanding front of species u and v , respectively, and the time periodicity accounts for the effect of two different seasons. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of global solutions. Under the weak competition assumption, we then study the long-time behaviors and sharp criteria for spreading and vanishing. Moreover, sharper estimates of asymptotic speeds of ( g , h ) (g,h) and asymptotic spreading speeds of ( u , v ) (u,v) are also given.},

Then the time asymptotic stability of rarefaction waves to compressible Euler equations is proved for the bipolar Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system. Moreover, the exponential time decay rates of the disparity between two species and the electric field are obtained. Our analysis is based on the two different sets of decompositions of the solutions and a time velocity weight function which is designed to control the large velocity growth in the nonlinear term .},

The main technique we employ is essentially based on a compact embedding of some auxiliary Banach space into the phase space and a corresponding smoothing effect between these spaces. Our bounds on the fractal dimension of uniform attractors are given in terms of the dimension of the symbol space and the Kolmogorov entropy number of the embedding. In addition, a dynamical analysis on the symbol space is also given, showing that the finite-dimensionality of the hull of a time-dependent function is fully determined by the tails of the function, which allows us to consider more general non-autonomous terms than quasi-periodic functions. As applications, we show that the uniform attractor of the 2D Navier-Stokes equation is finite-dimensional in H and in V , and that of a reaction-diffusion equation is finite-dimensional in L 2 L2 and in L p Lp , with p &gt; 2 p&amp;gt;2 .},

Moreover, by investigating the associated linearized eigenvalue problem , we establish the linear stability of the solutions above. Iron, Wei, and Winter (2004) established the existence and stability of multi-peak symmetric stationary solutions in non-heterogeneity case. In their work, the one-peak solution is always stable. For the symmetric heterogeneity case, Ishii and Kurata (2019) gave the analysis of one-peak symmetric solutions in details and revealed a destabilization effect of the heterogeneity. In this paper, we reveal that the mechanism which the location of the concentration point and the stability with respect to eigenvalues of order o ( 1 ) o(1) are determined by the interaction of the heterogeneity with the associated Green&#39;s function. In particular, we not suppose that the heterogeneity is symmetric. Also, by a typical example, we performed several numerical simulations to illustrate our main results.},

We begin by extending the global continuation theory of Alexander, Alligood, Mallet-Paret, Yorke, and others to this situation, formulating a new notion of global continuability and a new global continuation theorem tailored for this situation. In particular, we show that the existence of such a 1-form ensures that local continuability of periodic orbits implies global continuability. Using our general theory, we then develop continuation-based techniques for proving the existence of periodic orbits. In contrast to previous work, a key feature of our results is that existence of periodic orbits can be proven (i) without finding trapping regions for the dynamics and (ii) without establishing a priori upper bounds on the periods of orbits. We illustrate the theory in examples inspired by the synthetic biology literature.},

Strong regularity of solutions is shown to imply generalized differentiation index one holding, a concept from nonsmooth differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) theory. Well-posedness of NCSs is established, including continuation and maximal continuation of strongly-regular solutions. It is demonstrated that strongly-regular NCS solutions are lexicographically smooth (in the sense of Nesterov) with respect to parameters, implying Lipschitzian parametric dependence of solutions. These results are accomplished by relating strong regularity to complete coherent orientation from the theory of piecewise continuously differentiable functions , and an extended nonsmooth implicit function theorem useful for analyzing NCSs. The findings in this article lay the foundation for computationally-relevant sensitivity analysis theory and dynamic optimization methods for practical problems modeled using NCSs. Along the way, theory of semi-explicit DAEs with piecewise continuously differentiable right-hand side functions, which encompass a number of frameworks, is formalized.},

  abstract     = {We consider the Cauchy problem for a stochastic scalar parabolic-hyperbolic equation in any space dimension with nonlocal, nonlinear, and possibly degenerate diffusion terms. The equations are nonlocal because they involve fractional diffusion operators. We adapt the notion of stochastic entropy solution and provide a new technical framework to prove the uniqueness. The existence proof relies on the vanishing viscosity method . Moreover, using bounded variation (BV) estimates for vanishing viscosity approximations, we derive an explicit continuous dependence estimate on the nonlinearities and derive error estimate for the stochastic vanishing viscosity method. In addition, we develop uniqueness method “à la Kružkov” for more general equations where the noise coefficient may depend explicitly on the spatial variable.},

In particular, classes of non-Helmholtz domains, i.e., domains for which the Helmholtz decomposition does not exist, are addressed. On the one hand, it is proved that the Stokes equations subject to partial slip in general are not well-posed in the standard setting that usually applies for Helmholtz domains. On the other hand, it is proved that under certain reasonable assumptions the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations subject to partial slip are well-posed in a generalized setting. This setting relies on a generalized version of the Helmholtz decomposition which exists under suitable conditions on the intersection and the sum of gradient and solenoidal fields in L q Lq . The proved well-posedness of the Stokes resolvent problem turns even out to be equivalent to the existence of the generalized Helmholtz decomposition. The presented approach, for instance, includes the sector-like non-Helmholtz domains introduced by Bogovskiĭ and Maslennikova as well as further wide classes of uniform C 2 , 1 C2,1 -domains.},

As in previous works, the proof reduces to an integral identity involving the tensor product of the gradients of 3 or more harmonic functions . Employing a construction method using Gaussian quasi-modes, we obtain a convenient family of harmonic functions to plug into the integral identity and establish our result.},

  abstract     = {This paper contributes to the study of large data problems for C 1 C1 solutions of the relativistic Euler equations . First, in the ( 1 + 1 ) (1+1) –dimensional spacetime setting, if the initial data are strictly away from the vacuum, a key difficulty in considering the singularity formation is coming up with a way to obtain sharp enough control on the lower bound of the mass–energy density function ρ . For this reason, via an elaborate argument on a certain ODE inequality and introducing some key artificial (new) quantities, we provide one time-dependent lower bound of ρ of the (1+1)-dimensional relativistic Euler equations, which involves looking at the difference of the two Riemann invariants, along with certain weighted gradients of them. Ultimately, for C 1 C1 solutions with uniformly positive initial mass–energy density of the corresponding Cauchy problem, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the singularity formation in finite time . Second, for the (3+1)–dimensional relativistic fluids, under the assumption that the initial mass–energy density vanishes in some open domain, we give a sufficient condition for C 1 C1 solutions to blow up in finite time, no matter how small or smooth the initial data are. Moreover, we present some interesting study on the asymptotic behaviour of the relativistic velocity, which shows that one cannot obtain any global regular solution whose L ∞ L∞ norm of u decays to zero as time t goes to infinity.},

It is a regularised and inertial version of the Dean–Kawasaki model. A high-probability well-posedness theory for this model is developed. This theory improves significantly on the spatial scaling restrictions imposed in an earlier work of the same authors, which applied only to significantly larger particles in one dimension . The well-posedness theory now applies in d -dimensions when the particle-width ϵ is proportional to N − 1 / θ N−1/θ for θ &gt; 2 d θ&amp;gt;2d and N is the number of particles. This scaling is optimal in a certain Sobolev norm. Key tools of the analysis are fractional Sobolev spaces , sharp bounds on Bessel functions , separability of the regularisation in the d -spatial dimensions, and use of the Faà di Bruno&#39;s formula.},

The main innovation is our assumption on φ S φS , namely that it be a semi-Riemannian submersion. This implies that the background solution has infinite total energy, making this, to the best of our knowledge, the first stability result for factored wave maps with infinite energy backgrounds. We prove that the equations of motion for the perturbation decouple into a nonlinear wave–Klein-Gordon system.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a three-stage tick population model with three development delays. Using the total delay τ as the bifurcation parameter, we conduct local and global Hopf bifurcation analysis. Especially, we examine the onset and termination of Hopf bifurcations of periodic solutions from the unique positive equilibrium. We locate all of the stability switches for the equilibrium and demonstrate that the global Hopf bifurcation branches are bounded. This result implies the system undergoes oscillatory behavior only with bounded delays. The key step in the proof is the exclusion of 2 τ -periodic solutions due to the negative Lozinskiĭ measure of the corresponding compound matrix. Numerical simulations are provided to show the complicated patterns of the tick population when the development delays are altered by the temperature and other environmental factors.},

  abstract     = {Spruce budworm is a major defoliator of forests in North America and its periodic outbreak can cause severe economic growth loss. In 2008, Vaidya and Wu proposed a delayed spruce budworm population model and studied the impact of physiological structure on outbreak control (Vaidya and Wu, 2008 [27] ). In this paper, we revisit this model and study its global dynamics that has not been analyzed previously. By carefully dealing with the major difficulty caused jointly by the time delay and the nonlinearity , we give a rather complete stability analysis for the model, including global asymptotic stability , bistability , semi-stability and Hopf bifurcation . Moreover, we show that the time delay can induce interesting dynamics including multitype bistability and long transients.},

In particular, we investigate the existence of open-loop controls which are independent of the parameter θ ∈ P θ∈P and steer a given family of initial states x 0 ( θ ) x0(θ) arbitrarily close to a desired family of terminal states f ( θ ) f(θ) in finite time . Here, the maps θ ↦ x 0 ( θ ) θ↦x0(θ) and θ ↦ f ( θ ) θ↦f(θ) are assumed to lie in a common appropriately chosen Banach space X n ( P ) Xn(P) of C n Cn -valued functions. If this task is solvable for all initial and terminal states, the pair ( A ( θ ) , B ( θ ) ) (A(θ),B(θ)) is called (completely) ensemble controllable with respect to X n ( P ) Xn(P) . Using a well-known infinite-dimensional version of the Kalman rank condition for systems on Banach spaces, we derive sufficient conditions for cascade and parallel connections of linear ensembles. Moreover, we prove an abstract decomposition theorem which results from a spectral splitting of the matrix family A ( θ ) A(θ) . Based on these findings as well as on cyclicity conditions for multiplication operators and approximation theory , we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for ensemble controllability (reachability) with respect to the space of continuous functions and the space of L q Lq -functions. In the last section, results on averaged controllability (reachability) for linear families ( A ( θ ) , B ( θ ) , C ( θ ) ) (A(θ),B(θ),C(θ)) are presented.},

The proof relies on the Fourier transform with respect to the wave numbers and the unique continuation theorems. To study the increasing stability in the source identification, we consider homogeneous media and measure the absorbing data or the tangential component of the electric field at the boundary of the reference domain as additional data. By using the Fourier transform with respect to the wave numbers, explicit bounds for analytic continuation , Huygens&#39; principle and bounds for initial boundary value problems , increasing (with larger wave numbers intervals) stability estimate is obtained.},

The result shows the transition from the microscopic reversible dynamics to the irreversible macroscopic equation at the level of partial differential equations . This resolves the issue arising from [15] , where the singular region has been removed artificially. Since the singularity appears in the Landau equation due to the geometry of particle interactions, it is an intrinsic physical property of the weak-coupling limit which is crucial to the understanding of the transition from particle systems to the Landau equation.},

  abstract     = {In this article we consider the stability and damping problem for the 2D Boussinesq equations with partial dissipation near a two parameter family of stationary solutions which includes Couette flow and hydrostatic balance. In the first part we show that for the linearized problem in an infinite periodic channel the evolution is asymptotically stable if any diffusion coefficient is non-zero. In particular, this imposes weaker conditions than for example vertical diffusion. Furthermore, we study the interaction of shear flow, hydrostatic balance and partial dissipation. In a second part we establish stability and enhanced dissipation results for the nonlinear Boussinesq problem around flows combining Couette flow and hydrostatic balance for the setting of full dissipation. Here we adapt the methods used by Bedrossian, Vicol and Wang [4] in the Navier-Stokes problem and combine them with cancellation properties of the Boussinesq equations.},

When the dissipation is large enough and a suitable function involving the forcing has a simple zero, response solutions are known to exist without assuming any non-resonance condition on the frequency vector. We analyse the case of non-simple zeroes and, in order to deal with the small divisors, we confine ourselves to two-dimensional frequency vectors, so as to use the properties of continued fractions. We show that, if the order of the zero is odd (if it is even, in general no response solution exists), a response solution still exists provided the inverse of the parameter measuring the dissipation belongs to a set given by the union of infinite intervals depending on the convergents of the ratio of the two components of the frequency vector. The intervals may be disjoint and as a consequence we obtain the existence of response solutions in a set with “holes”. If we want the set to be connected we have to require some non-resonance condition on the frequency: in fact, we need a condition weaker than the Bryuno condition usually considered in small divisors problems.},

In this work, well-posedness, regularity of solutions, existence of density, and existence of an invariant measure for stochastic reaction-diffusion systems with non-Lipschitz and non-linear growth coefficients and multiplicative noise are considered. By combining the random field approach and infinite integration theory approach in SPDEs for mild solutions, analysis is carried out.

Our analysis yields, for any wave speed c &gt; 0 c&amp;gt;0 , the density-dependent dispersal population models with shifting habitats admit forced traveling waves. To overcome the difficulties caused by peculiar structure of forced waves and degeneracy, we develop a novel weighted estimate technique to prove the global and exponential stability of these waves.

Besides more advanced justification of numerical simulations, the uniform stability can reveal the nature of an inverse problem to a significantly greater extent. For example, it allows obtaining global solvability of an inverse problem as a corollary of its solvability for any dense subclass of input data . In this paper, we obtain uniform stability of an inverse problem for one important class of integro-differential operators, which is a natural generalization of the classical Sturm–Liouville operator. For this purpose, we develop a new method, which is different from that used for the classical problem. Moreover, the considered situation arose relevance of the so-called full stability, i.e. the stability with respect to the full set of the input data including all a priori known components of the operator. The obtained results illustrate some essential difference from the inverse Sturm–Liouville problem.},

Moreover, if N ≥ 4 N≥4 , then there is at least one nonradial solution and if, in addition, N ≠ 5 N≠5 , then there are infinitely many nonradial solutions of the nonlinear scalar field equation. The energy functional associated with the problem may be infinite on D 1 , 2 ( R N ) D1,2(RN) and is not Fréchet differentiable in its domain.

Our results show how the predation may affect this dynamics. More precisely, we describe several situations where the environment is initially inhabited by the predator and by either one of the two preys. When the weak competing prey is an aboriginal species, we show that there exist traveling waves where the strong prey invades the environment and either replaces its weak counterpart, or more surprisingly the three species eventually co-exist. Furthermore, depending on the parameters, we can also construct traveling waves where the weaker prey actually invades the environment initially inhabited by its strong competitor and the predator. In all those situations, we find the infimum of the set of admissible wave speeds; these results are sharp at least when the three species diffusive at the same speed.},

We assume that the relaxation system satisfies the structural stability condition proposed by the second author previously and the boundary is characteristic of type I (characteristic for the relaxation system but non-characteristic for the corresponding equilibrium system). For this kind of characteristic initial-boundary-value problems, we propose a modified Generalized Kreiss condition (GKC). This extends the GKC proposed by W.-A. Yong (1999) [28] for the non-characteristic boundaries to the present characteristic case. Under this modified GKC, we derive the reduced boundary condition and verify its validity by combining an energy estimate with the Laplace transform .

Second, we obtain analogous results for the Bresse-Maxwell-Cattaneo system, completing an analysis recently initiated in the literature. Finally, we consider the Timoshenko-Gurtin-Pipkin system and we find the optimal polynomial decay rate when the known exponential stability condition does not hold. As a byproduct, we fully recover the stability characterization of the Timoshenko-Maxwell-Cattaneo system. The classical “equal wave speeds” conditions are also recovered through singular limit procedures. Our conditions are compatible with some physical constraints on the coefficients as the positivity of the Poisson&#39;s ratio of the material. The analysis faces several challenges connected with the thermal damping, whose resolution rests on recently developed mathematical tools such as quantitative Riemann-Lebesgue lemmas.},

The main intermediary step is to reduce the scalar problem to the study of a non-Lipschitz vector field in dimension 2. The latter is treated by qualitative topological methods based on the Poincaré-Bendixson Theorem. The phase portrait is determined and the existence of a stable manifold at the origin is proved. A significant result is that the settling time to reach the origin is finite, meaning that the trailing interface is finite in contrast to the case α = 1 α=1 , but in accordance with α = 0 α=0 .

Here in accordance with recent developments in the literature on refined modeling of chemotactic migration, the introduction of suitably decaying F is supposed to adequately account for saturation mechanisms that limit cross-diffusive fluxes near regions of large signal gradients. In the context of such nonlinearities which suitably generalize the prototype given by F ( ξ ) = K F ( 1 + ξ ) − α 2 F(ξ)=KF(1+ξ)−α2 , ξ ≥ 0 ξ≥0 , with K F &gt; 0 KF&amp;gt;0 , known results addressing a fluid-free parabolic-elliptic simplification of (⋆) have identified the value α c = 1 2 αc=12 as critical with regard to the occurrence of blow-up in the sense that some exploding solutions can be found when α &lt; 1 2 α&amp;lt;12 , whereas all suitably regular initial data give rise to global bounded solutions when α &gt; 1 2 α&amp;gt;12 . The intention of the present study consists in making sure that the latter feature of blow-up prevention by suitably strong flux limitation persists also in the more complex framework of the fully coupled chemotaxis-fluid system (⋆). To achieve this, as a secondary objective of possibly independent interest the manuscript separately establishes some conditional bounds for corresponding fluid fields and taxis gradients in a fairly general setting that particularly includes the subsystem of (⋆) concerned with the evolution of ( c , u , P ) (c,u,P) . These estimates relate respective regularity features to certain integrability properties of associated forcing terms , as in the context of (⋆) essentially represented by the quantity n . The application of this tool to the specific problem under consideration thereafter facilitates the derivation of a result on global existence of bounded classical solutions to (⋆) for widely arbitrary initial data actually within the entire range α &gt; 1 2 α&amp;gt;12 , and by means of an argument which appears to be significantly condensed when compared to reasonings pursued in previous works concerned with related problems.}}},

The system consists of a diffusive species and a non-diffusive species and models biological pattern formation. We prove the existence of (i) stationary solutions for all values of the diffusion coefficient D by applying a generalized mountain pass lemma, (ii) stationary solutions with transition layer for D sufficiently small by applying the singular perturbation method, and (iii) monotone stationary solutions for D sufficiently large by the upper and lower solution method. Also, the asymptotic stability of stationary solutions is studied.},

The collision kernel may feature a stronger singularity for small volumes than the ones considered in previous contributions. In addition, when the collision kernel is locally bounded, the class of fragment daughter distribution functions included in the analysis is broader. Mass-conserving solutions are also constructed when the collision kernel grows at most linearly at infinity and are proved to be unique for initial conditions decaying sufficiently fast at infinity. The existence proof relies on a weak compactness approach in L 1 L1 .},

Such T -periodic solutions are nonlinearly stable to NT -periodic, i.e. subharmonic, perturbations for each N ∈ N N∈N with exponential decay rates of perturbations of the form e − δ N t e−δNt . However, both the exponential rates of decay δ N δN and the allowable size of the initial perturbations tend to 0 as N → ∞ N→∞ , so that this result is non-uniform in N and, in fact, empty in the limit N = ∞ N=∞ . The primary goal of this paper is to introduce a methodology, in the context of the LLE, by which a uniform stability result for subharmonic perturbations may be achieved, at least at the linear level. The obtained uniform decay rates are shown to agree precisely with the polynomial decay rates of localized, i.e. integrable on the real line, perturbations of such spectrally stable periodic solutions of the LLE. This work both unifies and expands on several existing works in the literature concerning the stability and dynamics of such waves, and sets forth a general methodology for studying such problems in other contexts.},

Various dynamic boundary conditions have already been introduced in the literature to model interactions of the materials with the boundary more precisely. To take long-range interactions into account, we propose a new model consisting of a nonlocal Cahn–Hilliard equation with a nonlocal dynamic boundary condition comprising an additional boundary penalization term. We rigorously derive our model as the gradient flow of a nonlocal free energy with respect to a suitable inner product of order H − 1 H−1 containing both bulk and surface contributions. In the main model, the chemical potentials are coupled by a Robin type boundary condition depending on a specific relaxation parameter. We prove weak and strong well-posedness of this system, and we investigate the singular limits attained when this relaxation parameter tends to zero or infinity.},

The well-posedness theory for this model has been intensively studied in recent years, but much less is understood compared to the classical NLS model where α = 0 α=0 . The conventional approach does not work particularly for the critical case β = 4 − 2 α d − 2 s β=4−2αd−2s . It is still an open problem. The main contribution of this paper is to develop the well-posedness theory in this critical case (as well as non-critical cases). To this end, we approach to the matter in a new way based on a weighted L p Lp setting which seems to be more suitable to perform a finer analysis for this model. This is because it makes it possible to handle the spatially decaying factor | x | − α |x|−α in the nonlinearity more efficiently. This observation is a core of our approach that covers the critical case successfully.},

A detailed bifurcation analysis, depending on all four parameters, reveals a rich bifurcation structure, including supercritical and subcritical Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation, degenerate Hopf bifurcation of codimension at most 2, and a focus type degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 3, originating from a nilpotent focus of codimension 3 which acts as the organizing center for the bifurcation set. Moreover, some sufficient conditions to guarantee the global asymptotical stability of the semi-trivial equilibrium or the unique positive equilibrium are also given. Our analysis indicates that we can classify the long-time dynamics of the model with a threshold value c 0 c0 for the natural mortality rate c of predators, in detail, the following are true. (i) When c ≥ c 0 c≥c0 , the prey will persist and predators will eventually go extinct for all positive initial populations. (ii) When c &lt; c 0 c&amp;lt;c0 , the prey and predators will coexist, for all positive initial populations, in the form of multiple positive equilibria or multiple periodic orbits.

Therefore, if the maximum norm of the deformation tensor of velocity gradients remains bounded, it is not possible for other kinds of singularities. Our results are same as Beale-Kato-Majda type criterion for compressible viscous barotropic flows (Huang et al., 2011 [17] ), and do not depend on further sophistication of the non-isentropic MHD model, it is independent of the pressure and magnetic field . Furthermore, this extends the corresponding Zhong&#39;s results (Zhong, 2019 [46] ), and removes the viscous coefficients restriction condition 3 μ &gt; λ 3μ&amp;gt;λ and the boundedness of pressure.

A key ingredient is a commutator estimate involving the Hilbert transform and fractional derivatives. We also study local well-posedness for the associated periodic initial value problem . Additionally, by determining well-posedness in anisotropic weighted Sobolev spaces as well as some unique continuation principles, we characterize the spatial behavior of solutions of this model.

Our results reveal some essential differences from those results in the literature, due to the presence of centripetal forces.

We provide also estimates in (Muckenhoupt) weighted spaces which permit us to regain a duality pairing , which than can be used to prove existence. Our estimates are valid even in the presence of the convective term . They are obtained via a new comparison method that allows to “cut out” the singularities of the right hand side such that the skew symmetry of the convective term can be used for large parts of the right hand side.},

These results parallel those known for the Laplacian counterpart proved by Gidas and Spruck (1981) [21] , but the methods are very different, since the ODEs analysis is a missing ingredient in the fractional case. Our proofs are based on a monotonicity formula, combined with blow up (down) arguments, Kelvin transformation and uniqueness of solutions of related degenerate equations on S + n .

Meanwhile a positive subsolution provides the coercivity constant. The numerical simulations show that the nonlinear finite element approximate solutions do not oscillate if the DMP is fulfilled. The characterization of the DMP and the mesh sizes guaranteeing the existence of positive sub- and supersolutions of the nonlinear finite element approximate problem, in the case of variable coefficients and all types of boundary conditions are some of the novelties of this paper. The excellent performance of the method is tested in two examples with boundary layers caused by very small diffusion.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the one-side physical vacuum problem for the one dimensional compressible Euler equations with time-dependent damping is considered. Near the physical vacuum boundary, the sound speed is C 1 / 2 C1/2 -Hölder continuous. The coefficient of the time-dependent damping is given by μ ( 1 + t ) λ μ(1+t)λ , ( 0 &lt; λ , 0 &lt; μ ) (0&amp;lt;λ,0&amp;lt;μ) which decays by order − λ in time. First we give an one-side physical vacuum background solution whose density and velocity have a growing order with respect to time. Then the main purpose of this paper is to prove the stability of this background solution under the assumption that 0 &lt; λ &lt; 1 , 0 &lt; μ 0&amp;lt;λ&amp;lt;1,0&amp;lt;μ or λ = 1 , 2 &lt; μ λ=1,2&amp;lt;μ . The pointwise convergence rate of the density, velocity and the expanding rate of the physical vacuum boundary are also given. The proof is based on the space-time weighted energy estimates, elliptic estimates and the Hardy inequality in the Lagrangian coordinates .},

The entropy structure is important in the analysis for such equations since A ( u ) A(u) is typically neither symmetric nor positive definite. In particular, the normal ellipticity of A ( u ) A(u) for all u and the symmetry of the Onsager matrix implies its positive definiteness and hence an entropy structure. If A is constant or constant up to nonlinear perturbations , the existence of an entropy structure is equivalent to the normal ellipticity of A . The results are applied to various examples from physics and biology. Finally, the normal ellipticity of the n -species population model of Shigesada, Kawasaki, and Teramoto is proved.},

  abstract     = {The existence of stationary subsonic solutions and their stability for 3-D hydrodynamic model of unipolar semiconductors with the Ohmic contact boundary have been open for long time due to some technical reason, as we know. In this paper, we consider 3-D radial solutions to the system in a hollow ball, and prove that the 3-D radial subsonic stationary solutions uniquely exist and are asymptotically stable, when the initial perturbations around the subsonic steady-state are small enough. Different from the existing studies on the radial solutions for fluid dynamics where the inner boundary of the hollow ball must be far away from the singular origin, here we may allow the chosen inner boundary arbitrarily close to the singular origin and reveal the relationship between the inner boundary and the large time behavior of the radial solution. This partially answers the open question of the stability of stationary waves subjected to the Ohmic contact boundary conditions in the multiple dimensional space. We also prove the existence of non-flat stationary subsonic solution, which essentially improve and develop the previous studies in this subject. The proof is based on the technical energy estimates in certain weighted Sobolev spaces , where the weight functions are artfully selected to be the distance of the targeted spatial location and the singular point .},

Specifically, we show that, under suitable technical assumptions, there exists a local analytic isometric embedding u from ⁎ ( U ′ , Π ⁎ g ) (U′,Π⁎g) into Euclidean space E ( n 2 + 3 n − 4 ) / 2 E(n2+3n−4)/2 , where Π : U ′ → U \ { 0 } Π:U′→U{0} is a finite Riemannian branched cover of a deleted neighborhood of the origin. Our result can thus be thought of as a generalization of the classical Cartan-Janet Theorem to the singular setting in which the metric tensor is degenerate at an isolated point.

This latter is proved also in the quantum case for which a weak-strong uniqueness analysis is also discussed in the framework of the so-called “augmented” version of the system. Moreover, as byproduct of our results, in the case of a capillary fluid with a special choice of the initial velocity datum, we obtain an interesting property concerning the propagation of vacuum zones.},

In particular, we focus our attention on the metastable dynamics of solutions to the equation in a bounded interval of the real line with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions . It is shown that the evolution of profiles with N + 1 N+1 transition layers is very slow in time and we derive a system of ODEs , which describes the exponentially slow motion of the layers. A comparison with the classical Allen–Cahn and Cahn–Hilliard equations and theirs hyperbolic variations is also performed.},

We study this problem for the lower value function V λ Vλ of a stochastic differential game with recursive cost, i.e., the cost functional is defined through a backward stochastic differential equation with infinite time horizon. But unlike the ergodic control approach, we are interested in the case where the limit can be a function depending on the initial condition. For this we extend the so-called non-expansivity assumption from the case of control problems to that of stochastic differential games and we derive that λ V λ ( ⋅ ) λVλ(⋅) is bounded and Lipschitz uniformly with respect to λ &gt; 0 λ&amp;gt;0 . Using PDE methods and assuming radial monotonicity of the Hamiltonian of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs equation we obtain the monotone convergence of λ V λ ( . ) λVλ(.) and we characterize its limit W 0 W0 as maximal viscosity subsolution of a limit PDE. Using BSDE methods we prove that W 0 W0 satisfies a uniform dynamic programming principle involving the supremum and the infimum with respect to the time, and this is the key for an explicit representation formula for W 0 W0 .},

Using energy estimates, we provide sufficient conditions that guarantee existence in any dimension, and uniqueness in the case when X is divergence-free. We then focus on the one-dimensional scenario, with slightly more regular coefficients. Improving the a priori estimates of the first results, we prove existence of a class of solutions whose spatial derivatives satisfy a Ladyzhenskaya-Prodi-Serrin type condition. Uniqueness is shown in the same class, by obtaining an L ∞ ( L 1 ) L∞(L1) estimate on the difference of two solutions. The latter is obtained by establishing a link with a certain backward dual equation combined with a (rough) iteration lemma à la Moser.},

This is a new lower bound for the number of limit cycles bifurcating in cubic switching polynomial systems around foci, simultaneously obtained around the same time when more limit cycles are achieved by perturbing a cubic switching integral system.},

This covers the celebrated Hirsch&#39;s Generic Convergence Theorem in the case k = 1 k=1 , yields a generic Poincaré-Bendixson Theorem for the case k = 2 k=2 , and holds true with arbitrary dimension k .

We show (Theorems A and B, respectively) that, for any μ ˆ 0 ∈ W ˆ μˆ0∈Wˆ and L &gt; 0 L&amp;gt;0 , the functions T ( s ; μ ˆ ) T(s;μˆ) and D ( s ; μ ˆ ) D(s;μˆ) have an asymptotic expansion at s = 0 s=0 for μ ˆ ≈ μ ˆ 0 μˆ≈μˆ0 with the remainder being uniformly L -flat with respect to the parameters. The principal part of both asymptotic expansions is given in a monomial scale containing a deformation of the logarithm, the so-called Roussarie-Ecalle compensator. The coefficients of these monomials are C ∞ C∞ functions “universally” defined, meaning that their existence is established before fixing the flatness L of the remainder and the unfolded parameter μ ˆ 0 μˆ0 . Moreover the flatness L of the remainder is preserved after any derivation with respect to the parameters. We also provide (Theorem C) an explicit upper bound for the number of zeros of T ′ ( s ; μ ˆ ) T′(s;μˆ) bifurcating from s = 0 s=0 as μ ˆ ≈ μ ˆ 0 μˆ≈μˆ0 . This result enables to tackle finiteness problems for the number of critical periodic orbits along the lines of those theorems on finite cyclicity around Hilbert&#39;s 16th problem. As an application we prove two finiteness results (Corollaries D and E) about the number of critical periodic orbits of polynomial vector fields.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the minimal speed (spreading speed) selection mechanism of traveling waves to a periodic diffusive Lotka-Volterra model with monostable nonlinearity . The method of upper and lower solutions pair is applied to establish the existence of traveling waves. We prove that the nature of nonlinear selection is to find a lower solution pair with the first species decaying in a faster rate. By novel constructions of various upper and lower solutions, we obtain a number of new results on the minimal speed determinacy. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate all of our discoveries.},

As the vorticity strength goes to infinity, the limit of these rotating vortex patches is a rotating point vortex whose motion is described by the Kirchhoff-Routh equation. The construction is performed by solving a variational problem for the vorticity which is based on an adaption of Arnold&#39;s variational principle . We also prove nonlinear orbital stability of the set of maximizers in the variational problem under L p Lp perturbation when p ∈ [ 3 / 2 , + ∞ ) p∈[3/2,+∞) .},

In this family, there is a special center such that at least twelve limit cycles of small amplitude bifurcate from the origin when we perturb it in the cubic polynomial general class. The original proof has some crucial missing points in the arguments that we correct here. We take advantage of a better understanding of the bifurcation phenomenon in nongeneric cases to show two new cubic systems exhibiting 11 limit cycles and another exhibiting 12. Finally, using the same techniques, we study the local cyclicity of holomorphic quartic centers, proving that 21 limit cycles of small amplitude bifurcate from the origin, when we perturb in the class of quartic polynomial vector fields.},

In this way, we construct explicit solutions of systems with non-vanishing at infinity potentials, including steplike and power-law growth potentials. Thus, the constructed potentials (systems) differ fundamentally from the actively studied case of GBDT for the trivial initial systems. Generalised matrix eigenvalues A (not necessarily diagonal) and corresponding generalised matrix eigenfunctions Π(x) of the nontrivial initial systems are used in the GBDT constructions in this paper. Explicit expressions for these Π(x) are new and the method of deriving these expressions may be applied to various other important problems. The case of Dirac–Weyl system, which is of interest in electron dynamics and graphene theory is studied in greater detail, and generalised separation of variables appears in our approach to the study of this system. Explicit expressions for Weyl–Titchmarsh functions (in the form of pseudo-realisations) are derived.},

This system describes the evolution of an incompressible isothermal mixture of binary fluids and it has been investigated by many authors. Here we consider a stochastic version of this model forced by a multiplicative white noise on a bounded domain of R d Rd , d = 2 , 3 d=2,3 . We prove the existence and uniqueness of a local maximal strong solution when the initial data ( u 0 , ϕ 0 ) (u0,ϕ0) takes values in H 1 × H 2 H1×H2 . Moreover in the two-dimensional case, we prove that our solution is global.},

  abstract     = {Planar wave trains are traveling wave solutions whose wave profiles are periodic in one spatial direction and constant in the transverse direction. In this paper, we investigate the stability of planar wave trains in reaction-diffusion systems. We establish nonlinear diffusive stability against perturbations that are bounded along a line in R 2 R2 and decay exponentially in the distance from this line. Our analysis is the first to treat spatially nonlocalized perturbations that do not originate from a phase modulation. We also consider perturbations that are fully localized and establish nonlinear stability with better decay rates, suggesting a trade-off between spatial localization of perturbations and temporal decay rate. Our stability analysis utilizes pointwise estimates to exploit the spatial structure of the perturbations. The nonlocalization of perturbations prevents the use of damping estimates in the nonlinear iteration scheme; instead, we track the perturbed solution in two different coordinate systems.},

The solution D is called as an optimal configuration for the data ( Ω , α , A ) (Ω,α,A) . Looking at the well-known extension definition for the fractional Laplacian, in the case s = 1 / 2 s=1/2 this is essentially the composite membrane problem for which the mass is concentrated at the boundary as one is trying to minimize the Steklov eigenvalue. We prove existence of solutions and study properties of optimal configuration D . This is a free boundary problem which could be formulated as a two-sided unstable obstacle problem . Moreover, we show that for some rotationally symmetric domains (thin annuli), the optimal configuration is not rotational symmetric, which implies the non-uniqueness of the optimal configuration D . On the other hand, we prove that for a convex domain Ω having reflection symmetries , the optimal configuration possesses the same symmetries, which implies uniqueness of the optimal configuration D in the ball case.},

Schimperna starting from the two fundamental laws of Thermodynamics, following M. Gurtin&#39;s two-scale approach. The main working assumptions are made on the behaviour of the heat flux as the absolute temperature tends to zero and to infinity. A suitable Ginzburg-Landau free energy is considered. Global-in-time existence for the initial-boundary value problem associated to the entropy formulation and, in a subcase, also to the weak formulation of the model is proved by deriving suitable a priori estimates and by showing weak sequential stability of families of approximating solutions. At last, some highlights are given regarding a possible approximation scheme compatible with the a-priori estimates available for the system.},

The crucial part of the proof lies in the evolution of negative Besov norms at low frequencies, which mainly depends on non standard L p Lp product estimates and some elaborate use of Sobolev embeddings and interpolations.

Our results show that in comparison with the well-known work for classic Camassa-Holm-type equations, the existence of global solution only relies on the L 1 L1 -integrability of the variable coefficients α ( t ) α(t) and γ ( t ) γ(t) , but nothing to do with the shape of the initial data . The key ingredient of the proof hinges on the careful analysis of the mutual effect among two component forms, the uniform bound of approximate solutions , and several crucial estimates of cubic nonlinearities in low-regularity Besov spaces via the Littlewood-Paley decomposition theory. A reduced case in our results yields the global existence of solutions in a Besov space for two kinds of well-known isospectral peakon system with weakly dissipative terms. Moreover, we derive two kinds of precise blow-up criteria for a strong solution in both critical and non-critical Besov spaces, as well as providing specific characterization for the lower bound of the blow-up time, which implies the global existence with additional conditions on the time-dependent parameters α ( t ) α(t) an γ ( t ) γ(t) .

It turns out that when α is large, the model has at most one steady state and it is stable (if it exists); however existence of multiple steady states is examined for large β , moreover asymptotic profiles of steady states are established as β tends to infinity.},

We study stability of the Riemann problem amongst a large class of solutions. We show stability among the family of solutions with shocks from any family. We assume solutions verify at least one entropy condition . We have no small data assumptions. The solutions we consider are bounded and satisfy a strong trace condition weaker than B V loc BVloc . We make only mild assumptions on the system. In particular, our work applies to gas dynamics, including the isentropic Euler system and the full Euler system for a polytropic gas. We use the theory of a-contraction (see Kang and Vasseur, 2016 [22] ), and introduce new ideas in this direction to allow for two shocks from different shock families to be controlled simultaneously. This paper shows L 2 L2 stability for the Riemann problem for all time. Our results compare to Chen et al., 2002 [8] and Chen and Li, 2004 [9] , which give uniqueness and long-time stability for perturbations of the Riemann problem – amongst a large class of solutions without smallness assumptions and which are locally BV . Although, these results lack global L 2 L2 stability.},

When M ‾ = R n + k M‾=Rn+k or M ‾ = S n + k − 1 M‾=Sn+k−1 , the equality between λ 1 λ1 and its bound implies that e ψ eψ is a Gaussian density ( ψ ( x ) = C 2 | x | 2 ψ(x)=C2|x|2 , C &lt; 0 C&amp;lt;0 ), and M is a shrinker for the mean curvature flow (MCF) on R n + k Rn+k . We prove also that λ 1 = − C λ1=−C on the standard shrinker torus of revolution . Based on this and on the Yau&#39;s conjecture on the first eigenvalue of minimal submanifolds of S n Sn , we conjecture that the equality λ 1 = − C λ1=−C is true for all the shrinkers of MCF in R n + k Rn+k .},

Next we apply these results to the eigenvalue problem for the 2 r -th order differential equation l [ y ] = λ Δ ( x ) y l[y]=λΔ(x)y on an interval [ a , b ) , − ∞ &lt; a &lt; b ≤ ∞ [a,b),−∞&amp;lt;a&amp;lt;b≤∞ , subject to λ -depending separated boundary conditions with entire operator-functions C 0 ( λ ) C0(λ) and C 1 ( λ ) C1(λ) , which form a Nevanlinna pair ( C 0 , C 1 ) (C0,C1) . The weight Δ ( x ) Δ(x) is nonnegative and may vanish on some intervals ( α , β ) ⊂ I (α,β)⊂I . We show that in the case when the minimal operator of the equation has the discrete spectrum (in particular, in the case of the quasiregular equation) the set of eigenvalues of the eigenvalue problem is an infinite subset of R R without finite limit points and each function y ∈ L Δ 2 ( I ) y∈LΔ2(I) admits the eigenfunction expansion y ( x ) = ∑ k = 1 ∞ y k ( x ) y(x)=∑k=1∞yk(x) converging in L Δ 2 ( I ) LΔ2(I) . Moreover, we give an explicit method for calculation of eigenfunctions y k yk in this expansion and specify boundary conditions on y implying the uniform convergence of the eigenfunction expansion of y. These results develop the known ones obtained for the case of the positive weight Δ and the more restrictive class of λ -depending boundary conditions.},

This is a free boundary problem : the interface between the fluid on the surface and the air above (modeled by a trivial fluid) is free to move and experiences capillary forces. The three-phase interface where the fluid, air, and solid vessel wall meet is known as a contact point, and the angle formed between the free interface and the flat surface is called the contact angle. We consider a model of this problem that allows for fully dynamic contact points and angles. We develop a scheme of a priori estimates for the model, which then allows us to show that for initial data sufficiently close to equilibrium, the model admits global solutions that decay to a shifted equilibrium exponentially fast.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we mainly investigate ground states of trapped attractive Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) passing an obstacle in the plane, which can be described by an L 2 L2 -critical constraint minimization problem in an exterior domain Ω = R 2 ∖ ω Ω=R2∖ω , where the bounded convex domain ω ⊂ R 2 ω⊂R2 with smooth boundary denotes the region of the obstacle. It is shown that minimizers (i.e. ground states) exist, if and only if the interaction strength a satisfies a &lt; a ⁎ = ‖ Q ‖ 2 2 ⁎ a&amp;lt;a⁎=‖Q‖22 , where Q &gt; 0 Q&amp;gt;0 is the unique positive radial solution of Δ u − u + u 3 = 0 Δu−u+u3=0 in R 2 R2 . If the trapping potential V ( x ) V(x) attains its global minima only along the whole boundary ∂Ω, the limit behavior of minimizers is analyzed as a ↗ a ⁎ ⁎ a↗a⁎ by employing the Pohozaev identity and the delicate energy analysis, where the mass concentration occurs at the flattest critical point of V ( x ) V(x) on ∂Ω.},

We call a subset E ⊂ R n E⊂Rn as a stabilizable set for (0.1) , if there is a linear bounded operator K on L 2 ( R n ) L2(Rn) so that the semigroup { e − t ( H − χ E K ) } t ≥ 0 {e−t(H−χEK)}t≥0 is exponentially stable. (Here, χ E χE denotes the characteristic function of E , which is treated as a linear operator on L 2 ( R n ) L2(Rn) .) This paper presents different geometric characterizations of the stabilizable sets for (0.1) with different H . In particular, when H is a shifted fractional Laplacian, E ⊂ R n E⊂Rn is a stabilizable set for (0.1) if and only if E ⊂ R n E⊂Rn is a thick set, while when H is a shifted Hermite operator, E ⊂ R n E⊂Rn is a stabilizable set for (0.1) if and only if E ⊂ R n E⊂Rn is a set of positive measure. Our results, together with the results on the observable sets for (0.1) obtained in [1] , [19] , [25] , [33] , reveal such phenomena: for some H , the class of stabilizable sets contains strictly the class of observable sets, while for some other H , the classes of stabilizable sets and observable sets coincide. Besides, this paper gives some sufficient conditions on the stabilizable sets for (0.1) where H is the Schrödinger operator with some general potentials.},

In this paper, we show that some measure-valued solutions to the two-dimensional isentropic compressible Euler equations , although they are energy admissible, can be discarded as unphysical, as they do not arise as vanishing viscosity limits. In fact, these measure-valued solutions also do not arise from a sequence of weak solutions of the Euler equations, in contrast to the incompressible case. Such a phenomenon has already been observed by Chiodaroli, Feireisl, Kreml, and Wiedemann using an A A -free rigidity argument, but only for non-deterministic initial datum . We develop their rigidity result to the case of non-constant states and combine this with a compression wave solution evolving into infinitely many weak solutions, constructed by Chiodaroli, De Lellis, and Kreml. Hereby, we show that there exist infinitely many generalized measure-valued solutions to the two-dimensional isentropic Euler system with quadratic pressure law, which behave deterministically up to a certain time and which cannot be generated by weak solutions with bounded energy or by vanishing viscosity sequences.},

Second, and more important: although the topological structure of the underlying functional reminds the one of the linking theorem, the nonlocal nature of the associated eigenfunctions prevents the use of such a classical theorem.

We are able to establish the global stability and the large-time behavior of the solutions. In particular, our results reveal that the buoyancy force actually stabilizes the fluids through the coupling and interaction. Without the coupling, the 2D Navier-Stokes equation with only vertical dissipation is not known to be stable. Mathematically the coupling allows us to deduce that both the velocity and the temperature obey degenerate damped wave equations , which generates the stabilization effect.},

The main novelty of our paper is a rigorous application of the period function for second-order differential equations towards understanding the symmetries and bifurcations of standing waves on metric graphs. We show that the positive single-lobe symmetric state (which is the ground state of energy for small fixed mass) undergoes exactly one bifurcation for larger mass, at which point ( N − 1 ) (N−1) branches of other positive single-lobe states appear: each branch has K larger components and ( N − K ) (N−K) smaller components, where 1 ≤ K ≤ N − 1 1≤K≤N−1 . We show that only the branch with K = 1 K=1 represents a local minimizer of energy for large fixed mass, however, the ground state of energy is not attained for large fixed mass if N ≥ 2 N≥2 .

We follow the method proposed by Chengzhi Li and provide more detailed analysis of the different types of double centers using the classification: Hamiltonian , reversible, Lotka-Volterra, Q 4 Q4 , currently used for centers of quadratic planar vector fields. We also describe completely the different possible phase portraits and their Poincaré compactification . We show that the double center set is a semi-algebraic set for which we give an explicit stratification (see figure 2). Then we initiate a study of the perturbations within quadratic planar vector fields of the most degenerated case which is the double Lotka-Volterra case. The perturbative analysis is made with the method of successive derivatives of return mappings. As usual, this involves relative cohomology of the first integral which is in that case a rational function. In this case, we have to deal with a kind of “relative logarithmic cohomology” already known in singularity theory . We succeed to compute the first bifurcation function by residue techniques around each centers and they differ from one center to the other.},

We introduce the weighted space to overcome the hurdle from advection term.

Our main result concerns the long-time behavior of the fluid and the point mass. Pointwise convergence estimates of the volume ratio and the velocity of the fluid to their equilibrium values are shown, and as a corollary, it is proved that the velocity V ( t ) V(t) of the point mass satisfies a decay estimate | V ( t ) | = O ( t − 3 / 2 ) |V(t)|=O(t−3/2) . The rate − 3 / 2 −3/2 is optimal and is essentially related to the compressibility and the nonlinearity . The main tool used in the proof is the pointwise estimates of Green&#39;s function. It turns out that the understanding of the time-decay properties of the transmitted and reflected waves at the point mass plays an essential role in the proof.},

In this short note, we propose an iterative procedure for finding nonnegative solutions of the following Kirchhoff-Carrier type equations { − A ( ‖ u ‖ p , ‖ ∇ u ‖ 2 ) Δ u = g ( x , u ) x ∈ Ω , u = 0 x ∈ ∂ Ω . {−A(‖u‖p,‖∇u‖2)Δu=g(x,u)x∈Ω,u=0x∈∂Ω. The main advantage of our procedure is that the convergent proof of the iterative sequence depends only on comparison principle of the Laplace operator instead of comparison principle of Kirchhoff-Carrier type operator itself. Therefore, we almost need no restrictions on A ( s , t ) A(s,t) except for continuous and a positive lower bound. This removes away the monotonicity assumption of A ( s , t ) A(s,t) used in most papers based on sub-supersolution method. As applications of the abstract result obtained by our iterative method, some concrete examples are also studied in Section 2 of this paper.}}},

Equations of this form arise in many applications, ranging from the description of phase transitions, to the dynamics of aggregating populations, and to image enhancing. The equation is ill-posed in the sense that it only has measure-valued solutions that in general are not unique. By using grid functions of nonstandard analysis, we derive a continuous-in-time and discrete-in-space formulation for the ill-posed problem. This nonstandard formulation is well-posed and formally equivalent to the classical PDE , and has a unique grid solution that satisfies the properties of an entropy measure-valued solution for the original problem. By exploiting the strength of the nonstandard formulation, we are able to characterize the asymptotic behaviour of the grid solutions and to prove that they satisfy a conjecture formulated by Smarrazzo for the measure-valued solutions to the ill-posed problem.},

Another example is the ODE system x ˙ = F 0 ( t , x ) + ∑ i = 1 m F i ( t , x ( t − r i ( t ) ) ) x˙=F0(t,x)+∑i=1mFi(t,x(t−ri(t))) on R n Rn with superlinear nonlinearities F i Fi ( 0 ≤ i ≤ m 0≤i≤m ).

The third example for application concerns the study of the dynamics of the functional cocycle system d u d t + A u = F ( θ t p , u t ) dudt+Au=F(θtp,ut) in a Banach space X with sublinear nonlinearity. In particular, the existence and uniqueness of a nonautonomous equilibrium solution Γ is obtained under the hyperbolicity assumption on operator A and some additional hypotheses, and the global asymptotic stability of Γ is also addressed.},

Using the vorticity method, we construct a family of steady vortex rings which constitute a desingularization of the classical circular vortex filament in several kinds of domains. The precise localization of the asymptotic singular vortex filament is proved to depend on the circulation and the velocity at far fields of the vortex ring, and the geometry of the domains.

Such study is made using a product of distributions that both extends the meaning of ϕ ( u ) ϕ(u) for certain distributions u and allows the definition of a solution concept consistent with the classical solution concept. From such study, it emerges that in several nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations Dirac δ -waves behave like classical solitons in the sine-Gordon equation. As particular cases, this work examines the phi-four equation and the sine-Gordon equation.},

Then, we obtain the asymptotic behavior of solutions far away from the boundary. Finally, we develop a sliding method for the fractional p -Laplacians and apply it to derive the monotonicity and uniqueness of solutions. There have been similar results for the classical Laplacian [3] and for the fractional Laplacian [39] , which are linear operators . Unfortunately, many approaches there no longer work for the fully non-linear fractional p -Laplacian here. To circumvent these difficulties, we introduce several new ideas, which enable us not only to deal with non-linear non-local equations, but also to remarkably weaken the conditions on f ( ⋅ ) f(⋅) and on the domain Ω. We believe that the new methods developed in our paper can be widely applied to many problems in unbounded domains involving non-linear non-local operators.}}},

In this paper we further study the nonlinear stability of the radially symmetric stationary solution, which introduces a significant mathematical difficulty : the center of the limiting sphere is not known in advance owing to the perturbation of mode 1 terms. We prove a new fixed point theorem to solve this problem, and finally obtain that the radially symmetric stationary solution is nonlinearly stable for ⁎ 0 &lt; μ &lt; μ ⁎ 0&amp;lt;μ&amp;lt;μ⁎ when neglecting translations.},

Here T denotes the maximal existence time of v . The first aim of the present paper is to prove unique global (in time) existence and asymptotic behavior of the solutions of associated integral equations to the Cauchy problem in the supercritical case γ ∈ ( 0 , 3 ) γ∈(0,3) , and show a lower estimate of the lifespan in the critical or subcritical case γ ∈ ( − 1 2 , 0 ] γ∈(−12,0] . The essential part for their proofs is to derive a weaker estimate under a weaker condition ( Proposition 3.1 and Theorem 3.1 ) than the case without damping (see [22] ) and to recover the weakness by the effect of the dissipative term. The second aim of the present paper is to prove a small data blow-up and the almost sharp upper estimate of the lifespan for positive data with a compact support in the subcritical case γ ∈ ( − 1 2 , 0 ) γ∈(−12,0) . The essential part for the proof is to refine the argument for the proof of Theorem 6.1 in [4] to obtain an upper estimate of the lifespan. Our two results determine that a critical exponent γ c γc which divides global existence and blow-up for small solutions is 0, namely γ c = 0 γc=0 . As the result, we can see that the critical exponent shifts from 2 to 0 due to the effect of the scale invariant damping term.},

We complement the convergence result proved in [2] using tools from dynamical systems theory. Our proof relies on two principal arguments in addition to a Picard-like iteration method . First, the linearized semigroup is positive which allows to precisely pinpoint the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator . Second, we use a time rescaling argument to transform the original quasilinear equation into another one for which the nonlinear flow is differentiable. Interestingly, this convergence result can be interpreted as the existence of a locally exponentially attracting center manifold for a hyperbolic equation.},

Examples of different scenarios of the evolution of an elliptical interface in Hele-Shaw cells with both constant and a uniformly changing distance between the plates are shown. In these examples, the sinks and sources are not only points, but also line distributions located in the exterior and the interior domains. The latter drastically enriches the family of exact solutions for zero surface tension compared to the literature. Asymptotic solutions for nonzero surface tension when the eccentricity of an ellipse is small are presented.},

By constructing appropriate Lyapunov functionals in terms of the characteristic delay terms, a deep analysis on stability and attractiveness of the stationary solutions is established. Furthermore, the existence of pullback attractors in L 2 ( Ω ) L2(Ω) , with bounded and unbounded delays, is shown. We emphasize that, to prove the existence of pullback attractors in the unbounded delay case, a new phase space, E γ Eγ , has to be constructed.},

In addition, we provide a gradient estimate, various energy estimates, Liouville theorems , monotonicity formulae and a formalization of surface tensions of the energy for solutions of the above system. Note that when λ = 0 λ=0 , the above system becomes decoupled and recovers the Allen-Cahn equation. The De Giorgi conjecture (1978) for the Allen-Cahn equation states that bounded monotone solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation are one-dimensional when n ≤ 8 n≤8 . This conjecture is already settled under certain assumptions. When 0 &lt; λ ≤ 1 0&amp;lt;λ≤1 , the system refers to the real-valued Ginzburg-Landau system and nonnegative solutions are trivial.}}},

In this paper, we employ both attractive and repulsive couplings to study the asymptotic behavior of the system accompanied by both p &gt; 0 p&amp;gt;0 (positive range) and p &lt; 0 p&amp;lt;0 (negative range), and this enables to yield richer dynamical phenomena. Firstly in an attractive regime, we focus on the emergence of the complete aggregation; however, the relaxation dynamics towards the aggregated state for the positive range differs from the one for the negative range. More precisely for p &gt; 0 p&amp;gt;0 , the complete aggregation occurs with an algebraic rate O ( t − 1 / p ) O(t−1/p) . On the other hand for p &lt; 0 p&amp;lt;0 , the issue of global existence arises due to the singular interaction and is crucially related to the aggregation estimate. To this end, we show that the complete aggregation emerges in finite time and thus a solution exists until such a time. Lastly in a repulsive regime, we mainly consider the splay state for both positive and negative ranges, and several case studies are presented to obtain the qualitative insight. Finally, we compare our results with the case of p = 0 p=0 .},

Let q be a harmonic function that corresponds to an irrotational flow. This paper proves that if q has k isolated local extremum points on the boundary, then there exist two kinds of steady Euler flows with small vorticity supported near these k points. For the first kind, near each maximum point the vorticity is positive and near each minimum point the vorticity is negative . For the second kind, near each minimum point the vorticity is positive and near each maximum point the vorticity is negative . Moreover, near these k points, the flow is characterized by a semilinear elliptic equation with a given profile function in terms of the stream function. The results are achieved by solving a certain variational problem for the vorticity and studying the limiting behavior of the extremizers.},
