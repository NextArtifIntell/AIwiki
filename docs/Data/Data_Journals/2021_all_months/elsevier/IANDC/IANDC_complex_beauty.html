An extremal synchronizing automaton is specially called an extreme synchronizing automaton if it is no longer an extremal synchronizing automaton after the removal of at least one letter. The Černý automata provide an infinite sequence of extreme synchronizing automata. Besides this, up to isomorphism, only eight isolated examples of extreme synchronizing automata on at least three states have been found. Since the Černý automata and one of the eight isolated examples are circular, one may say that almost all known extreme synchronizing automata are circular. In 2006, Trahtman conjectured that no other extreme synchronizing automaton on at least three states exists. In this paper, all extremal synchronizing circular automata and all extreme synchronizing circular automata are determined. As a consequence, Trahtman&#39;s conjecture is confirmed for circular automata.},

This can be achieved in two steps: first, by identifying expressive enough, yet tractable fragments of the whole algebra, and, second, by using such fragments to boost the performances of a backtracking algorithm for the whole language. In this paper we study the properties of several such fragments, both from the algebraic and the computational point of view, and we give an almost complete picture of tractable and non-tractable fragments of the Branching Algebra.},

However those systems are limited to point events. In this paper, we address the temporal aggregate computation issue in streams where events come with a duration, denoted as spanning event streams. After a short review of the new constraints ensued by event lifespan in a temporal sliding-window context, we propose a new structure for dealing with slices in such an environment, and prove that our technique is both correct and effective to deal with such spanning events. We then further extend this technique to compensate for the new constraints induced by the duration of spanning events with a multi-level structure able to reduce insertion costs.},

To investigate this hypothesis, we applied a multi-target regression Deep Neural Network (DNN) to data generated via numerical simulations of an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model of yeast metabolism, upon Monte Carlo sampling of the kinetic parameters . For each parameter configuration , we compared two steady states corresponding to different environmental conditions. We show that DNNs can predict relative fluxes impressively well even when a random subspace of input features is supplied, supporting the existence of recurrent variation patterns in abundances of chemical species , which can be recognized automatically.},

Inspired by the SKINNY competitions, multiple attacks on it were reported in different settings (e.g. single vs. related-tweakey) using different techniques (impossible differentials, zero-correlation, meet-in-the-middle, etc.). In this paper we revisit some of these attacks, identify issues with several of them, and offer a series of improved attacks which were experimentally verified.

  abstract     = {During the past two decades, data exchange has been explored in depth and in a variety of different settings. Even though temporal databases constitute a mature area of research studied over several decades, the investigation of temporal data exchange was initiated only very recently. We first present a chase algorithm for temporal data exchange settings with multiple temporal variables in the context of concrete time and show that this chase algorithm produces universal solutions, provided it does not fail. After this, we examine the relationship between universal solutions in the context of concrete time and universal solutions in the context of abstract time. We show that challenges arise even in the setting in which the data exchange specifications involve a single temporal variable, but also identify cases in which these challenges can be overcome.},

The cooperating processes establish temporal agreements in the form of constraints, representing timeliness obligations on the one hand and guarantees on the other hand. These constraints also form requirements for the design of the hidden implementation of the processes and are the basis of local control decisions. We present a comprehensive methodology for modeling the temporal aspects of cross-organizational business processes, checking the dynamic controllability of such processes, and supporting the reaching and the checking of temporal agreements. We do so by computing the consequences of temporal constraints and business secrecy requirements and by computing the weakest preconditions for the dynamic controllability of a participating process.},

  abstract     = {Simon&#39;s problem plays an important role in the history of quantum algorithms , as it inspired Shor to discover the celebrated quantum algorithm solving integer factorization in polynomial time . Besides, the quantum algorithm for Simon&#39;s problem has been recently applied to break symmetric cryptosystems. Generalized Simon&#39;s problem, denoted by GSP(p,n,k) , is a natural extension of Simon&#39;s problem: Given a function f:Zpn→X where X is a finite set and the promise that for any x,y∈Zpn,f(x)=f(y) iff x−y∈S for a subgroup S≤Zpn of rank k&amp;lt;n , the goal is to find S . In this paper we consider the query complexity of the problem, that is, the minimum number of queries to f required to find S . First, it is not difficult to design a quantum algorithm solving the above problem with query complexity of O(n−k) . However, so far it is not clear what is the classical query complexity of the problem, and revealing this complexity is necessary for clarifying the computational power gap between quantum and classical computing on the problem. To tackle this problem, we prove that any classical (deterministic or randomized) algorithm for GSP(p,n,k) has to query at least Ω(max⁡{k,pn−k}) values and any classical nonadaptive deterministic algorithm for GSP(p,n,k) has to query at least Ω(max⁡{k,k⋅pn−k}) values. Hence, we clearly show the classical computing model is less powerful than the quantum counterpart, in terms of query complexity for the generalized Simon&#39;s problem. Moreover, we obtain an upper bound O(max⁡{k,k⋅pn−k}) on the classical deterministic query complexity of GSP(p,n,k) , by devising a subtle classical algorithm based on group theory and the divide-and-conquer approach. Therefore, we have an almost full characterization of the classical deterministic query complexity of the generalized Simon&#39;s problem.},

  abstract     = {Predicting stochastic cellular dynamics emerging from chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is a long-standing challenge in systems biology. Deep learning was recently used to abstract the CRN dynamics by a mixture density neural network, trained with traces of the original process. Such abstraction is dramatically cheaper to execute, yet it preserves the statistical features of the training data. However, in practice, the modeller has to take care of finding the suitable neural network architecture manually, for each given CRN, through a trial-and-error cycle. In this paper, we propose to further automatise deep abstractions for stochastic CRNs, through learning the neural network architecture along with learning the transition kernel of the stochastic process. The method is applicable to any given CRN, time-saving for deep learning experts and crucial for non-specialists. We demonstrate performance over a number of CRNs with multi-modal phenotypes and a multi-scale scenario where CRNs interact across a spatial grid.},

Specifically, we propose heuristics that dynamically associate a weight with a relation in the branching decisions that occur during backtracking search , based on the count of local models that the relation is involved with in a given QCN QCN . Experimental results with a random and a structured dataset of QCN QCN s of Interval Algebra show that it is possible to achieve up to 5 times better performance for structured instances, whilst maintaining non-negligible gains of around 20\% for random ones. Finally, we show that these results may be notably improved via a selection protocol algorithm that synthesizes the involved heuristics into an overall better performing meta-heuristic in the phase transition.},

We investigate this issue, focusing on the case that the learner is given representations of input distributions (so it may generate queries of positive and negative labels). Our result is that assuming some new cryptographic primitives , the class is still unlearnable in the query model even if the learner has representations of the distributions. The result is established via a new argument.

As such, they have been used for defining the concurrent semantics of many formalisms, from Petri nets to (linear) graph rewriting systems . Stability however is restrictive for formalisms with “fusion”, where a computational step may merge parts of the state. This happens e.g. for graph rewriting systems with non-linear rules, which are used to cover some relevant applications (such as the graphical encoding of calculi with name passing). Guided by the need of giving semantics to such formalisms, we leave aside stability and characterise a class of domains, referred to as weak prime domains, naturally generalising prime algebraic domains. We then identify a corresponding class of event structures, that we call connected event structures, via a duality result formalised as an equivalence of categories.},

We study the information gathering problem, where each node has a piece of information called a rumor , and the objective is to transmit all rumors to the designated target node. For the model without any collision detection we provide an O˜(n1.5) deterministic protocol, significantly improving the trivial bound of O(n2) . We also consider a model with a mild form of collision detection, where a node receives a 1-bit acknowledgment if its transmission was received by at least one out-neighbor. For this model we give an O˜(n) deterministic protocol for information gathering in acyclic graphs.},

  abstract     = {Turi and Plotkin&#39;s bialgebraic semantics is an abstract approach to specifying the operational semantics of a system, by means of a distributive law between its syntax (encoded as a monad) and its dynamics (an endofunctor). This setup is instrumental in showing that a semantic specification (a coalgebra) is compositional. In this work, we use the bialgebraic approach to derive well-behaved structural operational semantics of string diagrams , a graphical syntax that is increasingly used in the study of interacting systems across different disciplines. Our analysis relies on representing the two-dimensional operations underlying string diagrams in various categories as a monad, and their semantics as a distributive law for that monad. As a proof of concept, we provide bialgebraic semantics for a versatile string diagrammatic language which has been used to model both signal flow graphs (control theory) and Petri nets (concurrency theory).},

We combine inspirations from both cell types as neural-like P systems with plasmids or NP P systems : bacteria are nodes in a digraph , with edges as communication links among bacteria. Bacteria use “transmit” and “kill” operations to send or remove plasmids. Another bio-inspiration is homogeneous bacteria, i.e. each bacterium has the same set of rules. Combining a neural-like structure with conjugation using plasmids proves useful: NP P systems are computationally complete even with homogeneous bacteria; bounding the number of plasmids reduces their computing power; we give an estimate of 164 bacteria for homogeneous NP P systems to remain complete.},

In order to combine the values of trees in forests, a wfa uses an associative multiplication operation that distributes over the addition of the M-monoid. We continue by introducing two semantics for wfa, an “initial algebra”-like semantic and a run-semantic, and prove that these semantics are equal for distributive M-monoids. We prove that our automaton model accepts finite products of recognizable weighted tree languages over M-monoids. Next, we introduce rational weighted forest expressions and forest M-expressions over M-monoids and show that the classes of languages generated by these formalisms coincide with recognizable weighted forest languages under certain conditions on the underlying M-monoid.},

A cellular automaton is asynchronous if at each time-step only one cell is updated. We define the problem AsyncUnstability , which consists in deciding there exists a sequential updating scheme that changes the state of a given cell. We begin showing that AsyncUnstability is in NL for any one-dimensional FCA. Then we focus on the family of life-like freezing CA (LFCA).

In this paper, a type of tissue P systems , called monodirectional tissue P systems with symport rules (MTS P systems) is considered, where communication happens between two regions only in one direction. Results show that MTS P systems are Turing universal with three cells and using a maximal length 2 of symport rules working in a maximally parallel way. Besides, the Turing universality of MTS P systems is also achieved by using two cells, and a maximal length 1 of symport rules working in a synchronized way by imposing a flat maximal parallelism among rules in the set. These results show that with the restrictive condition of “monodirectionality”, MTS P systems are still computationally powerful. Therefore, developing membrane algorithms for MTS P systems is potentially exploitable.},

We achieve this result by finding an interpretation in M of a free monoid , using only systems of equations together with length relations. It follows that each monoid in F F has undecidable positive AE-theory, hence in particular it has undecidable first-order theory. The family F F includes many one-relator monoids with torsion 〈 A | w n = 1 〉 〈A|wn=1〉 ( n &gt; 1 n&amp;gt;1 ). In contrast, all one-relator groups with torsion are hyperbolic, and all hyperbolic groups are known to have decidable Diophantine problem.

Partitioned earliest deadline first (EDF) is one of the most popular polynomial-time and practical scheduler on multiprocessor platforms, and it was shown to have a speedup factor of at most 2.6322 − 1 / m 2.6322−1/m . This paper further improves the factor to 2.5556 − 1 / m 2.5556−1/m for both the constrained-deadline case and the arbitrary-deadline case, and it is very close to the known (non-tight) lower bound of 2.5 − 1 / m 2.5−1/m . The key ideas are that we develop a novel method to discretize and regularize sporadic task sets that are schedulable on uniprocessors, and we find that the ratio ( ρ ) of the approximate demand bound value to the machine capacity is upper-bounded by 1.5556 for the arbitrary-deadline case, which plays an important role in estimating the speed factor of partitioned EDF.},

  abstract     = {Outsourcing computation has gained significant popularity in recent years due to the prevalence of cloud computing . There are two main security concerns in outsourcing computation: how to guarantee the cloud server performs the computation correctly and how to keep the client&#39;s data secret . The single-server verifiable computation (SSVC) of Gennaro, Gentry and Parno (Crypto&#39;10) enables a client to delegate the computation of a function f on any input x with both concerns highly relieved, but only results in computationally secure schemes that lack practical efficiency . While the SSVC schemes use a single server, in this paper we develop a multi-server verifiable computation (MSVC) model where the client shares both f and x among multiple servers, each server performs a set of computations on its shares, and finally the client reconstructs f ( x ) f(x) from all servers&#39; results. In this MSVC model we propose a generic construction for outsourcing computations of the form F x Fx , where F is a matrix and x is a vector. Our generic construction achieves information-theoretic security, input privacy and function privacy . By optimizing the parameters, we obtain both a 3-server scheme, which uses the least number of servers, and a 4-server scheme, which incurs the least workload. By decomposing many polynomial computations as a two-stage computation, where the first-stage has the form F x Fx and the second-stage is fast, and delegating the first-stage computation, we obtain MSVC schemes for these polynomials. We implement our MSVC schemes and show that they are among the most practical ones to date.},

This problem is known to be decidable when t ≤ 2 t≤2 but undecidable for integer matrices with sufficiently large t and k . We prove that for t = 3 t=3 this problem is Turing-equivalent to Skolem&#39;s problem and thus decidable for k ≤ 3 k≤3 (resp. k = 4 k=4 ) over (resp. real) algebraic numbers. Consequently, the set of triples ( m 1 , m 2 , m 3 ) (m1,m2,m3) for which the equation A 1 m 1 A 2 m 2 A 3 m 3 A1m1A2m2A3m3 equals the zero matrix is a finite union of direct products of semilinear sets.

  abstract     = {Given a set P P of points in the Euclidean plane and two triangulations of P P , the flip distance between these two triangulations is the minimum number of flips required to transform one triangulation into the other. The Parameterized Flip Distance problem is to decide if the flip distance between two given triangulations is equal to a given integer k . The previous best FPT algorithm runs in time ⁎ O ⁎ ( k ⋅ c k ) O⁎(k⋅ck) ( c ≤ 2 × 14 11 c≤2×1411 ), where each step has fourteen possible choices, and the length of the action sequence is bounded by 11 k . By analyzing the underlying properties of the flip sequence, each step of our algorithm has only five possible choices. Based on an auxiliary graph G , we prove that the length of the action sequence for our algorithm is bounded by 2 | G | 2|G| . As a result, we present an FPT algorithm running in time ⁎ O ⁎ ( k ⋅ 32 k ) O⁎(k⋅32k) .},

  abstract     = {Search trees are commonly used to implement access operations to a set of stored keys. If this set is static and the probabilities of membership queries are known in advance, then one can precompute an optimal search tree, namely one that minimizes the expected access cost. For a non-key query, a search tree can determine its approximate location by returning the inter-key interval containing the query. This is in contrast to other dictionary data structures , like hash tables , that only report a failed search. We address the question “what is the additional cost of determining approximate locations for non-key queries”? We prove that for two-way comparison trees this additional cost is at most 1. Our proof is based on a novel probabilistic argument that involves converting a search tree that does not identify non-key queries into a random tree that does.},

  abstract     = {For one-safe Petri nets or condition/event-systems, a process as defined by Carl Adam Petri provides a notion of a run of a system where causal dependencies are reflected in terms of a partial order. Goltz and Reisig have generalised this concept for nets where places carry multiple tokens, by distinguishing tokens according to their causal history. However, this so-called individual token interpretation is often considered too detailed. Here we identify a subclass of Petri nets, called structural conflict nets , where no interplay between conflict and concurrency due to token multiplicity occurs. For this subclass, we define abstract processes as equivalence classes of Goltz-Reisig processes. We justify this approach by showing that there is a largest abstract process if and only if the underlying net is conflict-free with respect to a canonical notion of conflict.},

We investigate the amount of information (advice complexity) needed for treasure hunt at cost linear in the length of a shortest path in the terrain from the initial position of the agent to the treasure. A polygon is c -fat if the ratio of the radius of the smallest disc containing it to the radius of the largest disc contained in it is at most c . For regular terrains, defined as convex polygons with convex c -fat obstacles, for some constant c &gt; 1 , we establish the exact advice complexity of treasure hunt.

The learning algorithm is based on learning a formalism called family of DFAs (FDFAs) recently proposed by Angluin and Fisman. The main catch is that we use a classification tree structure instead of the standard observation table structure. The worst case storage space required by our algorithm is quadratically better than that required by the table-based algorithm proposed by Angluin and Fisman. We implement the proposed learning algorithms in the learning library ROLL (Regular Omega Language Learning), which also consists of other complete ω -regular learning algorithms available in the literature. Experimental results show that our tree-based learning algorithms have the best performance among others regarding the number of solved learning tasks.},

An intriguing open question is its exact complexity for full HS HS : it is at least EXPSPACE -hard, and the only known upper bound, which exploits an abstract representation of Kripke structure paths (descriptor), is non-elementary. In this paper, we provide a uniform framework to MC for full HS and meaningful fragments of it, with a specific type of descriptor for each fragment. Then, we devise a general MC alternating algorithm, parameterized by the descriptor&#39;s type , which has a polynomially bounded number of alternations and whose running time is bounded by the length of minimal representatives of descriptors (certificates). We analyze its complexity and give tight bounds on the length of certificates. For two types of descriptor, we obtain exponential upper and lower bounds ; for the other ones, we provide non-elementary lower bounds.},

  abstract     = {We study the satisfiability and model-checking problems for timed hyperproperties specified with HyperMITL , a timed extension of HyperLTL . While the satisfiability problem can be solved similarly as for HyperLTL , we show that the model-checking problem for HyperMITL , unless the specification is alternation-free, is undecidable even when very restricted timing constraints are allowed. On the positive side, we show that model checking HyperMITL with quantifier alternations is possible under certain semantic restrictions. As an intermediate tool, we give an ‘asynchronous’ interpretation of Wilke&#39;s monadic logic of relative distance ( L d ↔ Ld↔ ) and show that it characterises timed languages recognised by timed automata with silent transitions.},

  abstract     = {Given a qualitative constraint network ( QCN QCN ), a singleton-style consistency focuses on each base relation (atom) of a constraint separately, rather than the entire constraint altogether. This local consistency is essential for tackling fundamental reasoning problems associated with QCN QCN s, such as minimal labeling, but can suffer from redundant constraint checks, especially when checks occur far from where the pruning usually takes place. In this paper, we propose singleton-style consistencies that are applied just on the neighbourhood of a singleton-checked constraint instead of the whole network. We make a theoretical comparison with existing consistencies and consequently prove some properties of the new ones. Further, we propose algorithms to enforce our consistencies, as well as parsimonious variants thereof, that are more efficient in practice than the state of the art. An experimental evaluation with random and structured QCN QCN s of Allen&#39;s Interval Algebra in the phase transition region demonstrates the potential of our approach.},

A Simple Temporal Network with Decisions (STND) extends an STN to model temporal plans with decisions. STNDs label time points and constraints by conjunctions of literals saying for which scenarios (i.e., complete truth value assignments to the propositions) they are relevant. In this paper, we deal with the use of STNDs for modeling and synthesizing execution strategies. We propose an incremental hybrid SAT-based consistency checking algorithm for STNDs that is faster than the one previously proposed and allows for the synthesis of all consistent scenarios and related early execution schedules (offline temporal planning). We carry out an experimental evaluation with Kappa, a tool that we developed for STNDs. We also show that any STND can be easily translated into a disjunctive temporal network and vice versa.},

We focus on issues regarding the interpretation of tachograph data and requirements on weekly rest periods. We first show that the interpretation of data prescribed by these regulations is highly sensitive to minor variations in input, such that near-identical driving patterns may be regarded both as lawful and as unlawful. We then show that the content of the regulation may be represented in monadic second order logic , but argue that a more computationally tame fragment would be preferable for applications. As a case study we consider its representation in linear temporal logic , but show that a representation of the legislation requires formulas of unfeasible complexity, if at all possible.},

Although CPSs can be found in several real-world domains, their verification often relies on simulation test systems rather than formal methodologies . We propose a hybrid probabilistic process calculus for modelling and reasoning on CPSs. The dynamics of the calculus is expressed in terms of a probabilistic labelled transition system in the SOS style of Plotkin. This is used to define a bisimulation-based probabilistic behavioural semantics which supports compositional reasonings. For a more careful comparison between CPSs, we provide two compositional probabilistic metrics to formalise the notion of behavioural distance between systems, also in the case of bounded computations. Finally, we provide a non-trivial case study, taken from an engineering application, and use it to illustrate our definitions and our compositional behavioural theory for CPSs.},

In this paper, we investigate the role of the alphabet size. For each possible alphabet size, we count DFAs on n ≤ 6 n≤6 states which synchronize in ( n − 1 ) 2 − e (n−1)2−e steps, for all e e&amp;lt;2⌈n/2⌉ . Furthermore, we give constructions of automata with any number of states, and 3, 4, or 5 symbols, which synchronize slowly, namely in n 2 − 3 n + O ( 1 ) n2−3n+O(1) steps. In addition, our results prove Černý&#39;s conjecture for n ≤ 6 n≤6 . Our computations lead to 31 DFAs on 3, 4, 5 or 6 states, which synchronize in ( n − 1 ) 2 (n−1)2 steps. Of these DFA&#39;s, 19 are new. The remaining 12, which were already known, are exactly the minimal ones. The 19 new DFAs are extensions of automata which were already known.

  abstract     = {Linear Temporal Logic ( LTL ) is one of the most commonly used formalisms for representing and reasoning about temporal properties of computations. Its application domains range from formal verification to artificial intelligence . Many real-time extensions of LTL have been proposed over the years, including Timed Propositional Temporal Logic ( TPTL ), that makes it possible to constrain the temporal ordering of pairs of events as well as the exact time elapsed between them. The paper focuses on TPTL and Bounded TPTL with Past ( ), a bounded variant of TPTL enriched with past operators, which has been recently introduced to formalise a meaningful class of timeline-based planning problems. allows one to refer to the past while keeping the computational complexity under control: in contrast to the full TPTL with Past ( TPTL+P ), whose satisfiability problem is non-elementary , the satisfiability problem for is -complete. The paper deals with the satisfiability problem for TPTL and by providing an original tableau system for each of them that suitably generalises Reynolds&#39; one-pass and tree-shaped tableau for LTL . First, we show how to handle past operators , by devising a one-pass and tree-shaped tableau system for LTL with Past ( LTL+P ). Then, we adapt it to TPTL and , providing full proofs of the soundness and completeness of the resulting systems. In particular, completeness is proved by exploiting a novel model-theoretic argument that, compared to the one originally employed for the LTL system, provides a deeper understanding of the crucial role of the prune rule of the system.},

  abstract     = {A regular language is almost fully characterized by its right congruence relation . The same does not hold for regular ω -languages. The right congruence of a regular ω -language may not be informative enough; many regular ω -languages have a trivial right congruence, and in general it is not always possible to define an ω -automaton recognizing a given language that is isomorphic to its right congruence. The weak regular ω-languages do have fully informative right congruences. That is, any weak regular ω -language can always be recognized by a deterministic B u ¨ u¨ chi automaton that is isomorphic to its right congruence. Weak regular ω -languages reside in the lower levels of the expressiveness hierarchy of regular ω -languages. Are there more expressive sub-classes of regular ω -languages that have fully informative right congruences? Can we characterize the class of languages that have trivial right congruences? In this paper we try to place some additional pieces of this big puzzle.},

  abstract     = {The usual S 5 n S5n epistemic model for a multi-agent system is based on a Kripke frame, which is a graph whose edges are labeled with agents that do not distinguish between two states. We propose to uncover the higher dimensional information implicit in this structure, by considering a dual, simplicial complex model . We use dynamic epistemic logic (DEL) to study how an epistemic simplicial complex model changes after a set of agents communicate with each other. We concentrate on an action model that represents the so-called immediate snapshot communication patterns of asynchronous agents, because it is central to distributed computability (but our setting works for other communication patterns). There are topological invariants preserved from the initial epistemic complex to the one after the action model is applied, which determine the knowledge that the agents gain after communication. Finally, we describe how a distributed task specification can be modeled as a DEL action model, and show that the topological invariants determine whether the task is solvable. We thus provide a bridge between DEL and the topological theory of distributed computability, which studies task solvability in a shared memory or message passing architecture.},

We provide quantitative reductions of quantitative request-response games and of quantitative Muller games to vertex-ranked games, thus showing ExpTime -completeness of solving the former two kinds of games. In addition, we exhibit the usefulness and flexibility of vertex-ranked games by using them to compute fault-resilient strategies for safety specifications.

Instead of the well-known notions of Nash equilibrium (NE) and subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE), we focus on the recent notion of weak subgame perfect equilibrium (weak SPE), a refinement of SPE. In this setting, players who deviate can only use the subclass of strategies that differ from the original one on a finite number of histories. We are interested in the constrained existence problem for weak SPEs. We provide a complete characterization of the computational complexity of this problem: it is P-complete for Explicit Muller objectives, NP-complete for Co-Büchi, Parity, Muller, Rabin, and Streett objectives, and PSPACE-complete for Reachability and Safety objectives (we only prove NP-membership for Büchi objectives). We also show that the constrained existence problem is fixed parameter tractable and is polynomial when the number of players is fixed. All these results are based on a fine-grained analysis of a fixpoint algorithm that computes the set of possible payoff profiles underlying weak SPEs.},

The resulting formalism is called well-structured broadcast networks . For various types of communication topologies, we prove the decidability of coverability in the static case, i.e., when the network topology is not allowed to change. We do this by showing that for these types of static communication topologies, the broadcast network itself is a well-structured transition system , hence proving the decidability of coverability in the broadcast network. We also give an algorithm to decide coverability of well-structured broadcast networks when reconfiguration of links between nodes is allowed. Finally, with minor modifications of this algorithm we prove decidability of coverability when the underlying process is a pushdown automaton .},

The question is formalized using valence automata over graph monoids, an abstract model of automata in which the storage mechanism is specified by a finite graph. In this framework, many important storage mechanisms can be realized. Examples include pushdown stacks, partially blind counters (which behave like Petri net places), blind counters (which may attain negative values), and combinations thereof. We study for which graphs the emptiness problem for valence automata is decidable. A particular model in our framework is that of Petri nets with a pushdown stack. For these, decidability is a long-standing open question and we do not answer it here. However, if one excludes subgraphs corresponding to this model, a characterization can be achieved. Moreover, we provide a description of those storage mechanisms for which decidability remains open. This leads to a model that naturally generalizes both (i) pushdown Petri nets and (ii) another model with high expressiveness: priority multicounter machines introduced by Reinhardt. The cases that are proven decidable constitute a natural and apparently new extension of Petri nets with decidable reachability. We finally present a further decidable generalization that also subsumes a decidable Petri net extension by Atig and Ganty.},

However, for several classes of systems, the generic upper bounds one can extract from the algorithm are far from optimal. In particular, in the case of vector addition systems (VAS) and several of their extensions, the known tight upper bounds were rather derived thanks to ad-hoc arguments based on Rackoff&#39;s small witness property. We show how to derive the same bounds directly on the computations of the VAS instantiation of the generic backward coverability algorithm. This relies on a dual view of the algorithm using ideal decompositions of downwards-closed sets, which exhibits a key structural invariant in the VAS case. This reasoning offers a uniform setting for all well-structured transition systems, including branching ones, and we further apply it to several VAS extensions, deriving optimal upper bounds.},

  abstract     = {A usual way to find positive invariant sets of ordinary differential equations is to restrict the search to predefined finitely generated shapes, such as linear templates, or ellipsoids as in classical quadratic Lyapunov function based approaches. One then looks for generators or parameters for which the corresponding shape has the property that the flow of the ODE goes inwards on its border. But for non-linear systems, where the structure of invariant sets may be very complicated, such simple predefined shapes are generally not well suited. The present work proposes a more general approach based on a topological property , namely Ważewski&#39;s property. Even for complicated non-linear dynamics, it is possible to successfully restrict the search for isolating blocks of simple shapes, that are bound to contain non-empty invariant sets. This approach generalizes the Lyapunov-like approaches, by allowing for inwards and outwards flow on the boundary of these shapes, with extra topological conditions. We developed and implemented an algorithm based on Ważewski&#39;s property, SOS optimization and some extra combinatorial and algebraic properties, that shows very nice results on a number of classical polynomial dynamical systems .},

In weighted Boolean games, players aim to maximise the total expected weight of a set of formulas by selecting behavioural strategies, that is, randomisations over the truth assignments for each propositional variable under their unique control. Behavioural strategies thus present a compact representation of mixed strategies. Two results are algorithmically significant: (a) behavioural equilibria satisfy a specific independence property; and (b) they allow for exponentially fewer supports than mixed equilibria. These findings suggest two ways in which one can leverage existing algorithms and heuristics for computing mixed equilibria: a naive approach where we check mixed equilibria for the aforesaid independence property, and a more sophisticated approach based on support enumeration. In addition, we explore a direct numerical approach inspired by finding correlated equilibria using linear programming. In an extensive experimental study, we compare the performance of these three approaches.},

In this paper, we investigate techniques for both the characterisation and verification of equilibria in multi-player games with goals/objectives expressed using logics based on LDL F LDLF . This study builds upon a generalisation of Boolean games , a logic-based game model of multi-agent systems where players have goals succinctly represented in a logical way. Because LDL F LDLF goals are considered, in the settings we study—Reactive Modules games and iterated Boolean games with goals over finite traces—players&#39; goals can be defined to be regular properties while achieved in a finite, but arbitrarily large, trace. In particular, using alternating automata , the paper investigates automata-theoretic approaches to the characterisation and verification of (pure strategy Nash) equilibria, shows that the set of Nash equilibria in multi-player games with LDL F LDLF objectives is regular, and provides complexity results for the associated automata constructions.},

  abstract     = {We develop a game-theoretic semantics ( GTS GTS ) for the fragment AT L + ATL+ of the alternating-time temporal logic ⁎ AT L ⁎ ATL⁎ , thereby extending the recently introduced GTS GTS for ATL ATL . We show that the game-theoretic semantics is equivalent to the standard compositional semantics of AT L + ATL+ with perfect-recall strategies. Based on the new semantics, we provide an analysis of the memory and time resources needed for model checking AT L + ATL+ and show that strategies of the verifier that use only a very limited amount of memory suffice. Furthermore, using the GTS GTS , we provide a new algorithm for model checking AT L + ATL+ and identify a natural hierarchy of tractable fragments of AT L + ATL+ that substantially extend ATL ATL .},

  abstract     = {We study multi-player turn-based games played on (potentially infinite) directed graphs . An outcome is assigned to every play of the game. Each player has a preference relation on the set of outcomes which allows him to compare plays. We focus on the recently introduced notion of weak subgame perfect equilibrium (weak SPE). This is a variant of the classical notion of SPE, where players who deviate can only use strategies deviating from their initial strategy in a finite number of histories. Having an SPE in a game implies having a weak SPE but the contrary is generally false. We propose general conditions on the structure of the game graph and on the preference relations of the players that guarantee the existence of a weak SPE, that additionally is finite-memory. From this general result, we derive two large classes of games for which there always exists a weak SPE: ( i ) the games with a finite-range outcome function, and ( i i ) (ii) the games with a finite underlying graph and a prefix-independent outcome function. For the second class, we identify conditions on the preference relations that guarantee memoryless strategies for the weak SPE.},

  abstract     = {We propose a notion of alternating bisimulation for strategic abilities under imperfect information. The bisimulation preserves formulas of ATL ⁎ for both the objective and subjective variants of the state-based semantics with imperfect information, which are commonly used in the modeling and verification of multi-agent systems. Furthermore, we apply the theoretical result to the verification of coercion-resistance in the ThreeBallot voting system, a voting protocol that does not use cryptography. In particular, we show that natural simplifications of an initial model of the protocol are in fact bisimulations of the original model, and therefore satisfy the same ATL ⁎ properties, including coercion-resistance. These simplifications allow the model-checking tool MCMAS to terminate on models with a larger number of voters and candidates, compared with the initial model.},
