In particular, the asymptotic normality of the trace of the product of four independent Wishart matrices is demonstrated for a high-dimensional asymptotic regime. As an application of the result, a statistical test procedure for the common principal components hypothesis is proposed. For this problem, the proposed test statistic is asymptotically normal under the null hypothesis and diverges to positive infinity in probability under the alternative hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {Many series of data record individual observations as intervals, such as stock market values with daily high-low values, or minimum and maximum monthly temperatures, recorded over time. With the advent of massively large data sets from contemporary computers, it is frequently the case that observations are aggregated into (meaningful) classes of observations, so that resulting data are perforce intervals (or histograms, or other forms of so-called symbolic data). What is known is that taking the average stock market price, or average temperature results in a loss of information. Therefore, this article looks at autocovariance/autocorrelation functions for interval-valued autoregressive series models. Maximum likelihood estimators are derived by exploiting the ideas of composite likelihood and the pairwise likelihood of Lindsay (1988) and Davis and Yau (2011). Different internal distributions of the intervals themselves are also studied. Asymptotic properties of these estimators are obtained. A simulation study shows that the new estimators perform considerably better than those obtained from the set-valued estimators of Wang et al. (2016).},

The framework that is adopted is very general, as it allows one to test various kinds of hypotheses about the dependence structure of random vectors like symmetry, radial symmetry and equality of copulas. The proposed procedure is based on a V-statistic computed from the ranks of the observations. Its asymptotic distribution is derived under the null and general alternatives, and resampling is based on the multiplier bootstrap for degenerate V-statistics.

In this paper, we propose distance-based variable importance measures to deal with these problems, which are inspired by the Multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP), Energy distance (ED) and Distance components (DISCO) analysis. The proposed variable importance assessments can effectively measure the importance of an individual dimension by quantifying its influence on the differences between multivariate distributions across treatment groups. An importance-measure-based backward selection (IM-BWS) algorithm is developed that can be used in variable selection for multi-sample problems to discover important variables. We propose a modified MRPP based on the IM-BWS procedure for improving the power performance of the original MRPP. Our proposed methods are model-free, work for high-dimensional data, and can capture important variables under different models. Both simulations and real data applications demonstrate that our proposed method enjoys good properties and has advantages over other existing methods.},

Of interest is to test the null hypothesis that the covariates have a specific effect. This paper proposes an omnibus test for testing the null hypothesis of a specified effect of the covariates. The test statistic is designed for having power against many alternatives, and can be used to test for a variety of covariate effects (no effects, linear effects, partial effects, etc.). A special case is the testing problem that the covariates do not affect the dependence structure . In this semiparametric framework the marginal distribution functions are estimated using nonparametric kernel techniques and the parametric dependence model is estimated using maximum likelihood estimation . We establish the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis, and evaluate the finite-sample performance of the test via a simulation study, which also includes comparisons with alternative tests. A real data analysis illustrates the practical use of the test.},

This result is known as Efron’s “monotonicity property”. Under the condition that the random variables entering in the sum have density functions with bounded second derivatives, we investigate whether Efron’s monotonicity property generalizes when sums involve a large number of terms to which a central-limit theorem applies.},

In the first step, a mass transportation problem from a spherical reference measure to the copula is solved and combined in the second step with a marginal quantile transformation in the sample space. Also, generalized quantiles given by suitable Markov morphisms are introduced there. In the present paper, this approach is further extended by a functional approach in terms of membership functions, and by the introduction of randomized quantile regions. In addition, in the case of continuous marginals, a smoothed version of the empirical quantile regions is obtained by smoothing the empirical copula . All three extended approaches give empirical quantile ares of exact level and improved stability. The resulting depth areas give a valid representation of the central quantile areas of a multivariate distribution and provide a valuable tool for their analysis.},

Among these, only multivariate Kendall’s τ τ proves to take the dynamical dependence of random vectors stemming from multidimensional time series into account. Consequently, the article focuses on a comparison of ordinal pattern dependence and multivariate Kendall’s τ τ in this context. To this end, limit theorems for multivariate Kendall’s τ τ are established under the assumption of near-epoch dependent data-generating time series. We analyze how ordinal pattern dependence compares to multivariate Kendall’s τ τ and Pearson’s correlation coefficient on theoretical grounds. Additionally, a simulation study illustrates differences in the kind of dependencies that are revealed by multivariate Kendall’s τ τ and ordinal pattern dependence.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new model-free exploratory method for descriptive modeling that identifies and measures the regression dependence between an ordinal response variable and categorical (ordinal or nominal) explanatory variables in a multi-way contingency table. The proposed methodology consists of three parts, checkerboard copula score, checkerboard copula regression, and checkerboard copula association measure. The checkerboard copula score is a new type of score for ordinal variables that preserves the natural ordering of the categorical scale and it will be exploited for developing the methods measuring the association between the variables of interest. The checkerboard copula regression identifies the regression dependence between an ordinal response variable and categorical explanatory variables. It enables delineating the identified dependence in an exploratory manner. The checkerboard copula association measure quantifies the strength of the dependence identified by the checkerboard copula regression. We investigate the properties of checkerboard copula scores, checkerboard copula regression, its association measure, and their estimators. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is illustrated with simulation and real data.},

  abstract     = {Large scale temporal data have flourished in a vast array of applications, and their sophisticated structures, especially the heteroscedasticity among subjects with inter- and intra-temporal dependence, have fueled a great demand for new statistical models. In this paper, with covariate information, we consider a flexible model for large scale temporal data with subject-specific heteroscedasticity . Formally, the model employs latent semiparametric factors to simultaneously account for the subject-specific heteroscedasticity and the contemporaneous and/or serial correlations . The subject-specific heteroscedasticity is modeled as the product of the unobserved factor process and subject’s covariate effect, which is further characterized via additive models . For estimation, we propose a two-step procedure. First, the latent factor process and nonparametric loading are recovered through projection-based methods, and following, we estimate the regression components by approaches motivated from the generalized least squares . By scrupulously examining the non-asymptotic rates for recovering the factor process and its loading, we show the consistency and efficiency of estimated regression coefficients in the absence of prior knowledge of latent factor process and subject’s covariate effect. The statistical guarantees remain valid even for finite time points that makes our method particularly appealing when the subjects significantly outnumber the observation time points . Using comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate the finite sample performance of our method, which corroborates the theoretical findings. Finally, we apply our method to a data set of air quality and energy consumption collected at 129 monitoring sites in the United States in 2015.},

  abstract     = {There is a long history of spatial regression analysis where it is important to accommodate the spatial correlations among the responses from neighboring locations for any valid inferences. Among numerous modeling approaches, the so-called spatial auto-regression (SAR) model in a linear setup, and the conditional auto-regression (CAR) model in a binary setup, are widely used. For spatial binary analysis, there exists two other competitive approaches, namely the bivariate probit models (BPM) based composite likelihood approach using local lattices ; and a ‘Working’ correlations based QL (quasi-likelihood) (WCQL) approach. These correlation models, however, fail to accommodate both within and between correlations among spatial families, where a spatial family is naturally formed within a threshold distance of a selected location, and the member locations between two neighboring families may also be correlated. In this paper, we exploit this latter two-ways, within and between correlations among spatial families and develop a unified correlation model for all exponential family based such as linear, count or binary data. We further exploit the proposed correlation structure based generalized quasi-likelihood (GQL) and method of moments (MM) approaches for model parameters estimation. As far as the estimation properties are concerned, because in practice one encounters a large spatial sample, we make sure that the proposed GQL and MM estimators are consistent.},

To treat the non-stationary setting, we introduce a novel, exponentially weighted estimator for the Spearman rank correlation, which allows the local nonparametric correlation of a bivariate data stream to be tracked. To the best of our knowledge this is the first algorithm to be proposed for estimating a time varying Spearman rank correlation that does not rely on a moving window approach. We explore the practical effectiveness of the Hermite series based estimators through real data and simulation studies demonstrating good practical performance. The simulation studies in particular reveal competitive performance compared to an existing algorithm. The potential applications of this work are manifold. The Hermite series based Spearman rank correlation estimator can be applied to fast and robust online calculation of correlation which may vary over time. Possible machine learning applications include, amongst others, fast feature selection and hierarchical clustering on massive data sets.},

The simplex is an important case as it is the natural domain of compositional data. In this paper, we make an effort to prove several asymptotic results (bias, variance, mean squared error (MSE), mean integrated squared error (MISE), asymptotic normality , uniform strong consistency) for Bernstein estimators of cumulative distribution functions and density functions on the d d -dimensional simplex. Our results generalize the ones in Leblanc (2012a) and Babu et al. (2002), who treated the case d = 1 d=1 , and significantly extend those found in Tenbusch (1994).

Recent developments in CCA have mainly focused on the high-dimensional setting, where the number of features in both matrices under analysis greatly exceeds the sample size. These approaches impose penalties in the optimization problems that are needed to be solve iteratively, and estimate multiple canonical vectors sequentially. In this work, we provide an explicit link between sparse multiple regression with sparse canonical correlation analysis, and an efficient algorithm that can estimate multiple canonical pairs simultaneously rather than sequentially. Furthermore, the algorithm naturally allows parallel computing. These properties make the algorithm much efficient. We provide theoretical results on the consistency of canonical pairs. The algorithm and theoretical development are based on solving an eigenvectors problem, which significantly differentiate our method with existing methods. Simulation results support the improved performance of the proposed approach. We apply eigenvector-based CCA to analysis of the GTEx thyroid histology images, analysis of SNPs and RNA-seq gene expression data, and a microbiome study. The real data analysis also shows improved performance compared to traditional sparse CCA.},

More recently, other mixture-type constructions have been introduced, where the core random component, on which the mixing operation operates, is not necessarily normal. The main aim of the present work is to show that many existing constructions can be encompassed by a formulation where normal variables are mixed using two univariate random variables. For this formulation, we derive various general properties, with focus on the multivariate context. Within the proposed framework, it is also simpler to formulate new proposals of parametric families , and we provide a few such instances. As a side product, the exposition provides a concise compendium of the main constructions of continuous normal-mixtures type, although a full overview of this vast theme is not attempted.},

A new test is proposed. The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is stated under the null hypothesis of equality of the k k mean functions as well as under alternatives, which allows us to study the consistency of the test. Specifically, it is shown that the test statistic is asymptotically free distributed under the null hypothesis. The finite sample performance of the test based on the asymptotic null distribution is studied via simulation. Although we start by assuming that the data are functions, the proposed test can also be applied to finite dimensional data.

The new robust statistical estimator ζ ˆ ζˆ called frequencies-based estimator (FBE) is constructed for the BiCNAR parameters under innovation outliers with arbitrary discrete probability distribution having some fixed known expectation. Under mild regularity conditions the constructed FBE is shown to have the robustness properties : consistency and asymptotic normality with obtained asymptotic covariance matrix . FBE also has computational advantages: an explicit form and a fast recursive re-estimation algorithm for extension of the model. Asymptotic risk functional and its minimum are evaluated using Fisher information matrix for the considered model. Sensitivity analysis of the statistical estimator ζ ̃ ζ̃ for the BiCNAR parameters, that is constructed for the hypothetical model without outliers, is carried out for the situation with innovation outliers: ζ ̃ ζ̃ is shown to be inconsistent in this situation, its bias and the instability coefficient are evaluated and analyzed.

For a set of intermediate variables that satisfies the front-door criterion, we provide the variance formula of the estimated mean outcome under an external intervention in which a treatment variable is set to a specified constant value. The variance formula proposed in this paper is exact, in contrast to those in most previous studies on estimating total effects. In addition, based on the variance formula, we formulate the mean squared error between a future sample and the estimated mean outcome with the external intervention.},

Outcomes are assumed to lie in a general real separable Hilbert space , H H , while parameters lie in a subspace known as a Cameron–Martin space, K K , which are closely related to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces , so that the parameter estimates inherit particular properties, such as smoothness or periodicity, without enforcing such properties on the data. We propose a regularization method in the style of an adaptive Elastic Net penalty that involves mixing two types of functional norms, providing a fine tune control of both the smoothing and variable selection in the estimated model. Asymptotic theory is provided in the form of a functional oracle property, and the paper concludes with a simulation study demonstrating the advantages of using AFSSEN over existing methods in terms of prediction error and variable selection.},

This article proposes a new high dimensional test by developing a bias correction to the existing test statistic constructed based on a scaled distance measure. The suggested test is nonparametric without requiring any specific parametric distribution such as the normality assumption. It can accommodate scenarios where the data dimension p p is greater than the sample size n n , namely the “large p p , small n n ” problem. With the aid of tools in modern probability theory , we study theoretical properties of the newly proposed test, which include the asymptotic normality and a power evaluation. We demonstrate empirically that our proposal has good size and power performances for a range of dimensions, sample sizes and distributions in comparison with the existing counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Dimension reduction methods for matrix or tensor data have been an active research field in recent years. Li et al. (2010) introduced the notion of the Kronecker envelope and proposed dimension folding estimators for supervised dimension reduction. In a data analysis of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images (Chen et al., 2014), Kronecker envelope principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimension of cryo-EM images. Kronecker envelope PCA is a two-step procedure, which consists of projecting data onto a multilinear envelope subspace as the first step, followed by ordinary PCA on the projected core tensor. The multilinear envelope subspace preserves the natural Kronecker product structure of observations when searching for the leading principal subspace. The main advantage of preserving the Kronecker product structure is the parsimonious usage of parameters in specifying the leading principal subspace, which mitigates the adverse influence of high-dimensionality. The method of PCA will convert possibly correlated variables to uncorrelated ones and further reduce the dimension of the projected core tensor. In this article we derive the asymptotic normality of Kronecker envelope PCA and compare it with ordinary PCA. Utilizing majorization theory, we show that Kronecker envelope PCA is asymptotically more efficient than ordinary PCA in the sense that the asymptotic total stochastic variation of Kronecker envelope PCA is smaller than that of ordinary PCA. A motivating real data example of cryo-EM image clustering and simulation studies are presented to show the merits of Kronecker envelope PCA.},

One of the phenotypic variables is of clinical interest but measured with error. As is standard in the literature, the high dimensional SNPs are assumed to be measured accurately. We show that the limiting distribution of our corrected decorrelated score test statistic is standard normal under the null hypothesis and retains power under the local alternatives around zero.

Multivariate expectiles and their extremes have been the focus of plentiful research in recent years. In particular, it has been noted that due to the difficulty in estimating these values for elevated levels of risk, an alternative formulation of the underlying optimization problem would be necessary. However, in such a scenario, estimators have only been provided for the limiting cases of tail dependence: independence and comonotonicity. In this paper, we extend the estimation of multivariate extreme expectiles (MEEs) by providing a consistent estimation scheme for random vectors with any arbitrary dependence structure . Specifically, we show that if the upper tail dependence function, tail index , and tail ratio can be consistently estimated, then one would be able to accurately estimate MEEs.

This paper proposes a weighted version of MAVE for the CMS with multivariate response. The proposed weighted MAVE method takes account of the correlations among the responses and is a natural extension of the original MAVE method that only targets the univariate response CMS. The algorithm to implement the weighted MAVE method is provided. Asymptotic distribution of the MAVE estimator under the multivariate response setting is also derived. In addition, for the goal of variable selection, we propose incorporating the adaptive group lasso regularization method to induce sparse solutions. We show that the resulting sparse estimator can be calculated in a computationally efficient manner, and the associated BIC-type criterion can consistently select relevant variables. Experimental simulations and a real data analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Statistical shape analysis (SSA) may be understood like a field of Multivariate Analysis and has assumed a prominent position due to its applicability in various areas; such as in imagery processing, biology, anatomy, among others. Biological hypotheses have been often formulating in the SSA framework, which is based on the concept of “shape” whose related data are in a non Euclidian space. Thus, tailored tests are sought to take accurate decision in this area. To that end, we first assume the complex Bingham ( CB CB ) distribution to describe preshape data which are extracted from two-dimensional objects, called planar shape. Adopting adequate distances is crucial in SSA; particularly at hypothesis tests, discriminant analysis and clustering processes. In this paper, we derive the Rényi, Kullback–Leibler (KL), Bhattacharyya and Hellinger distances for the CB CB distribution. These quantities are then used as distance-based hypothesis tests to assess if two planar shape samples come from the same distribution. Even though useful for many models having Euclidean supports, we prove that the CB CB KL discrepancy is invariant in rotation, what restricts its use. Four new homogeneity hypothesis tests are proposed, three among them may also be used like tests involving mean shape.

These choices determine the matrix of interactions which is subjected to rank constraints. Examples are provided where the new models fit substantially better than traditional ones; an intuitive explanation for this behavior is outlined and supported by numerical investigations. An extension of the optimality property in Kateri and Papaioannou (1994) is derived, leading to a general representation theorem and reconstruction formulas for the joint probabilities . These results are the key to show that, given marginal logits, the generalized interactions introduced in this paper determine uniquely the bivariate distribution ; in addition, for each pair of logit types, we establish which kind of positive association is implied by our extended interactions being non negative. Quick model selection within this wide class can be performed by an efficient algorithm for computing maximum likelihood estimates which allows for additional linear constraints both on marginal logits and interactions.},

An appropriate covariance structure not only improves the accuracy of covariance estimation but also increases the efficiency of mean parameter estimators in statistical models. In this paper, a novel statistical method is proposed, which selects the optimal Toeplitz covariance structure and estimates the covariance matrix , simultaneously. An entropy loss function with nonconvex penalty is employed as a matrix-discrepancy measure, under which the optimal selection of sparse or nearly sparse Toeplitz structure and the parameter estimators of covariance matrix are made, simultaneously, through its minimization. The cases of both low-dimensional ( p ≤ n p≤n ) and high-dimensional ( p &gt; n p&amp;gt;n ) covariance matrix estimation are considered. The resulting Toeplitz structured covariance estimators are guaranteed to be positive definite and consistent. Asymptotic properties are investigated and simulation studies are conducted, showing that very high accurate Toeplitz covariance structure estimation is made. The proposed method is then applied to practical data analysis, which demonstrates its good performance in covariance estimation in practice.},

In this paper, we explore the Heckman selection-t model where the random errors follow a bivariate Student’s-t distribution. We develop an analytically tractable and efficient EM-type algorithm for iteratively computing maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters, with standard errors as a by-product. The algorithm has closed-form expressions at the E-step, that rely on formulas for the mean and variance of the truncated Student’s-t distributions. Simulation studies show the vulnerability of the Heckman selection-normal model, as well as the robustness aspects of the Heckman selection-t model.

To address this issue, we present results on the tail dependence properties of some of the most widely studied vine copula classes. We focus our study on the coefficient of tail dependence and the asymptotic shape of the sample cloud, which we calculate using the geometric approach of Nolde (2014). We offer new insights by presenting results for trivariate vine copulas constructed from asymptotically dependent and asymptotically independent bivariate copulas, focusing on bivariate extreme value and inverted extreme value copulas, with additional detail provided for logistic and inverted logistic examples. We also present new theory for a class of higher dimensional vine copulas, constructed from bivariate inverted extreme value copulas.},

By introducing a robust and inherently geometric concept of data depth we propose a new type of geometrically-enhanced classification method for relational data that are in a form of a complex network with multiple node attributes. Starting from a logistic regression to describe the relationship between the class labels and node attributes, the key approach is based on modeling the link probability between any two nodes as a function of their class labels and their data depths within the respective classes. The approximate prediction rule is then obtained according to the posterior probability of the class labels. Integrating the depth concept into the classification process allows us to better capture the underlying geometry of the relational data and, as a result, to enhance its finite sample performance. We derive asymptotic properties of the new classification approach and validate its finite sample properties via extensive simulations. The proposed geometrically-enhanced classification method is illustrated in application to user analysis of the one of the largest Chinese social media platforms, Sina Weibo.},

  abstract     = {Most existing methods of variable selection in partially linear models (PLM) with ultrahigh dimensional covariates are based on partial residuals, which involve a two-step estimation procedure. While the estimation error produced in the first step may have an impact on the second step, multicollinearity among predictors adds additional challenges in the model selection procedure. In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian variable selection approach for PLM. This new proposal addresses those two issues simultaneously as (1) it is a one-step method which selects variables in PLM, even when the dimension of covariates increases at an exponential rate with the sample size, and (2) the method retains model selection consistency, and outperforms existing ones in the setting of highly correlated predictors . Distinguished from existing ones, our proposed procedure employs the difference-based method to reduce the impact from the estimation of the nonparametric component, and incorporates Bayesian subset modeling with diffusing prior (BSM-DP) to shrink the corresponding estimator in the linear component. The estimation is implemented by Gibbs sampling, and we prove that the posterior probability of the true model being selected converges to one asymptotically. Simulation studies support the theory and the efficiency of our methods as compared to other existing ones, followed by an application in a study of supermarket data.},

The newly defined tests are asymptotically distribution-free as both the sample size and the number of variables go to infinity and hence have well-known critical values, accommodate situations where the number of variables is not small relative to the sample size and are applicable without specifying an explicit relationship between the number of variables and the sample size. In practice, as the true alternative hypothesis is unknown, it is unclear how to choose a powerful test. For this, we further propose an adaptive test that maintains high power across a wide range of situations.

This study aims to explore the asymptotic behavior of the ridge-regularized high-dimensional multivariate M-estimator of β β in group II. By applying the double leave-one-out method, we successfully derive a nonlinear system comprised of two deterministic equations, which characterizes the risk behavior of the M-estimator. The system solution also enables us to yield asymptotic normality for each component of the M-estimator. Moreover, we present rigorous proofs to these approximations that play a critical role in deriving the system.

In a Bayesian framework they have been employed to introduce dependent nonparametric priors which allow to model heterogeneous data. This paper focuses on introducing a new class of Lévy copulas based on a class of subordinators recently appeared in the literature, called compound random measures.

The depth of μ μ quantifies how much centrally positioned a point x x is with respect to μ μ . This function is intended to serve as generalization of the quantile function to multivariate spaces. We consider the problem of finding the inverse mapping to the halfspace depth: knowing only the function x ↦ D x ; μ x↦Dx;μ , our objective is to reconstruct the measure μ μ . We focus on μ μ atomic with finitely many atoms, and present a simple method for the reconstruction of the position and the weights of all atoms of μ μ , from its depth only. As a consequence, (i) we recover generalizations of several related results known from the literature, with substantially simplified proofs, and (ii) design a novel reconstruction procedure that is numerically more stable, and considerably faster than the known algorithms. Our analysis presents a comprehensive treatment of the halfspace depth of those measures whose depths attain finitely many different values.},

Including, under the establishment of proportional reversed hazard rate model and proportional hazard rate model, we obtain bounds and inequalities for these two inaccuracy measures, and we show that the triangle inequality can also exist for both of these measures. Also, under the assumption of radial symmetry , we prove the equality of these two new inaccuracies. In addition, we obtain a characterization property using the equality of these two inaccuracy measures for radially symmetric distributions . We provide examples to evaluate the results.

  abstract     = {Seemingly unrelated regression is a natural framework for regressing multiple correlated responses on multiple predictors . The model is very flexible, with multiple linear regression and covariance selection models being special cases. However, its practical deployment in genomic data analysis under a Bayesian framework is limited due to both statistical and computational challenges. The statistical challenge is that one needs to infer both the mean vector and the inverse covariance matrix, a problem inherently more complex than separately estimating each. The computational challenge is due to the dimensionality of the parameter space that routinely exceeds the sample size. We propose the use of horseshoe priors on both the mean vector and the inverse covariance matrix. This prior has demonstrated excellent performance when estimating a mean vector or inverse covariance matrix separately. The current work shows these advantages are also present when addressing both simultaneously. A full Bayesian treatment is proposed, with a sampling algorithm that is linear in the number of predictors. MATLAB code implementing the algorithm is freely available from github at https://github.com/liyf1988/HS_GHS . Extensive performance comparisons are provided with both frequentist and Bayesian alternatives, and both estimation and prediction performances are verified on a genomic data set.},

  abstract     = {Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a common method used to estimate the associations between two different sets of variables by maximizing the Pearson correlation between linear combinations of the two sets of variables. We propose a version of CCA for transelliptical distributions with an elliptical copula using pairwise Kendall’s tau to estimate a latent scatter matrix. Because Kendall’s tau relies only on the ranks of the data this method does not make any assumptions about the marginal distributions of the variables, and is valid when moments do not exist. We establish consistency and asymptotic normality for canonical directions and correlations estimated using Kendall’s tau. Simulations indicate that this estimator outperforms standard CCA for data generated from heavy tailed elliptical distributions . Our method also identifies more meaningful relationships when the marginal distributions are skewed. We also propose a method for testing for non-zero canonical correlations using bootstrap methods . This testing procedure does not require any assumptions on the joint distribution of the variables and works for all elliptical copulas. This is in contrast to permutation tests which are only valid when data are generated from a distribution with a Gaussian copula . This method’s practical utility is shown in an analysis of the association between radial diffusivity in white matter tracts and cognitive tests scores for six-year-old children from the Early Brain Development Study at UNC-Chapel Hill. An R package implementing this method is available at github.com/blangworthy/transCCA.},

The power of the proposed test is studied under a high-dimensional asymptotic framework, and its finite-sample exactness is established under mild conditions.

As application, we obtain several results on risk bounds in elliptical classes of risk models under restrictions on the correlations or on the partial correlations. Furthermore, we obtain extensions and strengthening of recent results on risk bounds for various classes of partially specified risk factor models with elliptical dependence structure of the individual risks and the common risk factor. The moderate dependence assumptions on this type of models allow flexible applications and, in consequence, are relevant for improved risk bounds in comparison to the marginal based standard bounds.},

  abstract     = {We study the power of deep neural networks (DNNs) with sigmoid activation function. Recently, it was shown that DNNs approximate any d d -dimensional, smooth function on a compact set with a rate of order W − p ∕ d W−p∕d , where W W is the number of nonzero weights in the network and p p is the smoothness of the function. Unfortunately, these rates only hold for a special class of sparsely connected DNNs. We ask ourselves if we can show the same approximation rate for a simpler and more general class, i.e., DNNs which are only defined by its width and depth. In this article we show that DNNs with fixed depth and a width of order M d Md achieve an approximation rate of M − 2 p M−2p . As a conclusion we quantitatively characterize the approximation power of DNNs in terms of the overall weights W 0 W0 in the network and show an approximation rate of W 0 − p ∕ d W0−p∕d . This more general result finally helps us to understand which network topology guarantees a special target accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This article contributes to the current statistical theory of deep neural networks (DNNs). It was shown that DNNs are able to circumvent the so-called curse of dimensionality in case that suitable restrictions on the structure of the regression function hold. In most of those results the tuning parameter is the sparsity of the network, which describes the number of non-zero weights in the network. This constraint seemed to be the key factor for the good rate of convergence results. Recently, the assumption was disproved. In particular, it was shown that simple fully connected DNNs can achieve the same rate of convergence. Those fully connected DNNs are based on the unbounded ReLU activation function. In this article we extend the results to smooth activation functions, i.e., to the sigmoid activation function. It is shown that estimators based on fully connected DNNs with sigmoid activation function also achieve the minimax rates of convergence (up to ln n lnn -factors). In our result the number of hidden layers is fixed, the number of neurons per layer tends to infinity for sample size tending to infinity and a bound for the weights in the network is given.},

As an application of this generalization, the online PCA of a random vector Z Z can be performed when there is a data stream of i.i.d. observations of Z Z , even when both the metric M M used and the expectation of Z Z are unknown and estimated online. Moreover, in order to update the stochastic approximation process at each step, we are no longer bound to using only a mini-batch of observations of Z Z , but all previous observations up to the current step can be used without having to store them. This is useful not only when dealing with streaming data but also with Big Data as one can process the latter sequentially as a data stream. In addition the general framework of this process, unlike other algorithms in the literature, also covers the case of factorial methods related to PCA .},

Such a procedure is complicated and computationally burdensome because spurious correlations commonly exist among predictor variables , while important predictor variables may not have large marginal correlations with the response variable. To circumvent these issues, in this paper, we develop a new screening technique, the “dynamic tilted current correlation screening” (DTCCS), for high dimensional variable screening. DTCCS is capable of selecting the most relevant predictors within a finite number of steps, and takes the popularly used sure independence screening (SIS) method and the high-dimensional ordinary least squares projection (HOLP) approach as its special cases. The DTCCS technique has sure screening and consistency properties which are justified theoretically and demonstrated numerically. A real example of gene expression data is analyzed using the proposed DTCCS procedure.},

The cICA incorporates the correlation structure within sources through parametric time series models in the frequency domain and outperforms several existing ICA alternatives numerically. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the cICA estimates, which then enables statistical inference based on the estimates.

Therefore, in this paper we propose a new subgroup identification method based on concave fusion penalization and median regression for longitudinal data with dropouts. In order to deal with missingness , we introduce multiply robust weights which allow multiple models for the probability of being observed. As long as one of the models is correctly specified, the proposed estimator is able to achieve oracle property in the case of missingness . Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm and propose a modified Bayesian information criterion to select penalization parameter. The asymptotic properties of the proposed method are established under some regularity conditions . The numerical performance is illustrated in simulations and the proposed method is applied to the quality of life data from a breast cancer trail.},

Because some measures of skewness are scalar and some are vectors, in order to evaluate them properly, a simulation study is carried out to determine the power of tests, based on sample versions of skewness measures as test statistics for testing the fit of the MMNE MMNE distribution.

It is a weighted average of points in a sample, where each point’s weight is proportional to the fraction of directions in which that point is a univariate median. The projection median has the highest possible asymptotic breakdown and is easily approximated in any dimension. Previous works have established various geometric properties of the projection median. In this paper we examine further robustness and asymptotic properties of the projection median. We derive the influence function of the projection median which leads to bounds on the maximum bias and contamination sensitivity, as well as an exact expression for the gross error sensitivity. We discuss the degree to which the projection median satisfies these properties relative to other popular robust estimators : specifically, the Zuo projection median and the half-space median. A method for computing the robustness quantities for any distribution and dimension is provided. We then show that the projection median is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. A method for estimating and computing the asymptotic covariance of the projection median is provided. Lastly, we introduce a large sample multivariate test of location, demonstrating the use of the aforementioned properties. We conclude that the projection median performs very well in terms of the aforementioned robustness quantities but this comes at the cost of dependence on the coordinate system as the projection median is not affine equivariant .},

Parameter inference and model selection are thus reduced to two separate problems, preserving time and space complexity of the base models. Based on this principle, we introduce several new distributions.

In the meantime, additivity is imposed so that we can avoid high-dimensional kernels in the functional space, which causes the curse of dimensionality . Along with the NAFPCA, we also develop a method of selection of the number of principal components and the tuning parameters that determines the degree of nonlinearity, as well as the asymptotic results for both the fully observed and the incompletely observed functional data. Simulation results show that the new method performs better than functional principal component analysis when the relations among random functions are nonlinear.

  abstract     = {With the advent of the era of big data, high dimensional covariance matrices are increasingly encountered and testing covariance structure has become an active area in contemporary statistical inference . Conventional testing methods fail when addressing high dimensional data due to the singularity of the sample covariance matrices . In this paper, we propose a novel test for the prominent identity test and sphericity test based on posterior Bayes factor . For general population model with finite fourth order moment, the limiting null distribution of the test statistic is obtained. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic power function when the sample size and dimension are proportional against spiked alternatives. When the dimension is much larger than the sample size, under general alternatives, the limiting alternative distribution together with the consistency of the new test is also obtained. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the limiting approximation is quite accurate under the null for finite sample, and the proposed test outperforms some well-known tests in the literature in terms of Type I error rate and the empirical power.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to nonparametrically estimate the expectile regression in the case of a functional predictor and a scalar response. More precisely, we construct a kernel-type estimator of the expectile regression function . The main contribution of this study is the establishment of the asymptotic properties of the expectile regression estimator . Precisely, we establish the almost complete convergence with rate. Furthermore, we obtain the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator under some mild conditions. We provide how to apply our results to construct the confidence intervals. The case of functional predictor is of particular interest and challenge, both from theoretical as well as practical point of view. We discuss the potential impacts of functional expectile regression in NFDA with a particular focus on the supervised classification, prediction and financial risk analysis problems. Finally, the finite-sample performances of the model and the estimation method are illustrated using the analysis of simulated data and real data coming from the financial risk analysis .},

  abstract     = {A recursive max-linear vector models causal dependence between its components by expressing each node variable as a max-linear function of its parental nodes in a directed acyclic graph and some exogenous innovation. Motivated by extreme value theory , innovations are assumed to have regularly varying distribution tails. We propose a scaling technique in order to determine a causal order of the node variables. All dependence parameters are then estimated from the estimated scalings. Furthermore, we prove asymptotic normality of the estimated scalings and dependence parameters based on asymptotic normality of the empirical spectral measure. Finally, we apply our structure learning and estimation algorithm to financial data and food dietary interview data.},
