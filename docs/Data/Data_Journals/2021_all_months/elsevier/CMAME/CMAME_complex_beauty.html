  abstract     = {The hypercomplex finite element method, ZFEM, allows the analyst to compute highly-accurate arbitrary-order shape, material property, and loading derivatives by augmenting the traditional finite element method with multiple imaginary degrees of freedom. In ZFEM, the real variables are converted to hypercomplex variables such as multicomplex, multidual, or quaternions. By uplifting the real variables to hypercomplex, derivatives are computed in an automated fashion using a standard finite element formulation. The use of multicomplex or multidual numbers provides higher-order derivatives. The drawback of ZFEM is that it increases the number of degrees of freedom of the real variable system by a factor 2 n 2n , where n n is the order of the required derivative. In consequence, ZFEM increases the memory consumption and the solution time of the system of equations compared to the real variable system. The block forward substitution method (BFS), proposed in this work, addresses the memory and runtime issues. This new method solves the original real-valued FEM system once. Then, the derivatives are computed using pseudo-loads with the original system of equations. In contrast with the conventional solution method of ZFEM, BFS computes the hypercomplex contributions to the stiffness matrix element-wise, and it never assembles nor solves the full hypercomplex system of equations. In effect, the BFS method generalizes the first-order semi-analytical complex variable method to any order derivative. The BFS method provides the capability to allow a combination of real-variable and hypercomplex-variable elements within the same model. The numerical results indicate that a first-order derivative can be obtained with 1% to 8% additional computational time of the real-variable analysis. This allows the computation of multiple first-order derivatives by post-processing of a single FEM analysis. Additionally, it was shown that fourth-order shape sensitivities can be computed in less than 5% additional runtime of the real-variable FEM analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new family of very-high-order TENO schemes with adaptive accuracy order and adaptive dissipation control (TENO-AA) is proposed. The new framework allows for constructing arbitrarily high-order TENO schemes in a unified paradigm and the yielded nonlinear schemes gradually reduce to low-order reconstructions by judging the smoothness with the ENO-like stencil selection strategy. In order to control the nonlinear numerical dissipation adaptively, the flow scales are first measured by examining the first-order undivided difference and the cut-off constant C T CT in the TENO weighting strategy is adapted based on the corresponding measurement. With one set of optimal parameters, the newly proposed TENO schemes are designed to deliver excellent performance for predicting highly compressible flows with a wide range of Mach numbers . While the new very-high-order TENO schemes feature good robustness for conventional gas dynamics, the ENO-property is well preserved with the assistant of a positivity-preserving flux limiter for extreme simulations. Without loss of generality, the typical eight- and ten-point TENO-AA schemes are constructed. A set of benchmark simulations are computed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed TENO schemes.},

We discuss how one can set the range of values for both the weights between the input and hidden layer and the biases of the hidden layer in order to obtain a good underlying approximating subspace, and we explore the required number of collocation points . We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method with several one-dimensional diffusion–advection–reaction benchmark problems that exhibit steep behaviors, such as boundary layers. We point out that there is no need of iterative training of the network, as the proposed numerical approach results to a linear problem that can be easily solved using least-squares and regularization . Numerical results show that the proposed machine learning method achieves a good numerical accuracy, outperforming central Finite Differences, thus bypassing the time-consuming training phase of other machine learning approaches .},

  abstract     = {Penalty methods have proven to be particularly effective for achieving the required C 1 C1 -continuity in the context of multi-patch isogeometric Kirchhoff–Love shells. Due to their conceptual simplicity, these algorithms are readily applicable to the displacement and rotational coupling of trimmed, non-conforming surfaces. However, the accuracy of the resulting solution depends heavily on the choice of penalty parameters. Furthermore, the selection of these coefficients is generally problem-dependent and is based on a heuristic approach . Moreover, developing a penalty-like procedure that avoids interface locking while retaining optimal accuracy is still an open question. This work focuses on these challenges. In particular, we devise a penalty-like strategy based on the L 2 L2 -projection of displacement and rotational coupling terms onto a degree-reduced spline space defined on the corresponding interface. Additionally, the penalty factors are completely defined by the problem setup and are constructed to ensure optimality of the method. This method is particularly suited for spline spaces of moderate degrees p = 2 , 3 p=2,3 , where the projection is computationally efficient and the condition number related to our choice of parameters does not yield a significant deterioration of the solution accuracy. To demonstrate this, we assess the performance of the proposed numerical framework on a series of non-trimmed and trimmed multi-patch benchmarks discretized by non-conforming meshes. We remark that only water-tight geometries have been considered in this work. We systematically observe a significant gain of accuracy per degree-of-freedom and no interface locking phenomena compared to other penalty-like approaches. Lastly, we perform a static shell analysis of a complex engineering structure, namely the blade of a wind turbine .},

To achieve this goal, we introduce a dual-temperature effective medium theory in which the distinct constituent temperatures are homogenized independently whereas the heat exchange among the constituents is captured via phenomenological heat exchange laws in analog to the dual-permeability theory. To handle the different growth rates of the boundary layers in a stable and computationally efficient manner, an asynchronous time integrator is proposed and implemented in an operator-split algorithm that updates the displacement, pore pressure, phase field, and temperature of each constituent in an asynchronous manner. Numerical examples are introduced to verify the implementation and compare the path-dependent behaviors predicted by the dual-temperature and one-temperature models.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present a family of time and space high order finite volume schemes for the solution of the full Boltzmann equation. The velocity space is approximated by using a discrete ordinate approach while the collisional integral is approximated by spectral methods. The space reconstruction is implemented by integrating the distribution function, which describes the state of the system, over arbitrarily shaped and closed control volumes using a Central Weighted ENO (CWENO) technique. Compared to other reconstruction methods, this approach permits to keep compact stencil sizes which is a remarkable property in the context of kinetic equations due to the considerable demand of computational resources. The full discretization is then obtained by combining the previous phase-space approximation with high order Implicit–Explicit (IMEX) Runge–Kutta schemes. These methods guarantee stability, accuracy and preservation of the asymptotic state. Comparisons of the Boltzmann model with simpler relaxation type kinetic models (like BGK) are proposed showing the capability of the Boltzmann equation to capture different physical solutions. The theoretical order of convergence is numerically measured in different regimes and the methods are tested on several standard two-dimensional benchmark problems in comparison with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo results. The article ends with a prototype engineering problem consisting of a subsonic and a supersonic flow around a NACA 0012 airfoil. All test cases are run with MPI parallelization on several cores, thus making the proposed methods suitable for parallel distributed memory supercomputers.},

A node-based strain smoothing (SNS) PFEM is developed by combining a 3-node triangular element-based PFEM and a stable nodal integration method with strain gradient in the smooth domain for single solid phase. Its performance is examined by simulating two benchmark tests on elastic material (i.e., cantilever beam and infinite plate with a circular hole) and three cases on elastoplastic material (i.e., cavity expansion, penetration of a rigid footing in soft soil and progressive failure of slope). Results show that the integration of stabilisation term gives the SNS-PFEM ‘close to exact’ stiffness, thereby resolving the ‘overly soft’ and temporal instability issues seen with the NS-PFEM. The proposed method is powerful and easily extensible for analysing large deformation problems in geotechnical engineering .},

  abstract     = {This paper outlines a rigorous variational-based multilevel Global–Local formulation for ductile fracture . Here, a phase-field formulation is used to resolve failure mechanisms by regularizing the sharp crack topology on the local state. The coupling of plasticity to the crack phase-field is realized by a constitutive work density function, which is characterized through a degraded stored elastic energy and the accumulated dissipated energy due to plasticity and damage. Two different Global–Local approaches based on the idea of multiplicative Schwarz’ alternating method are proposed: (i) A global constitutive model with an elastic–plastic behavior is first proposed, while it is enhanced with a single local domain, which, in turn, describes an elastic–plastic fracturing response. (ii) The main objective of the second approach is to introduce an adoption of the Global–Local model toward the multilevel local setting. In (ii), an elastic–plastic global constitutive model is augmented with two distinct local domains; in which, the first local domain behaves as an elastic–plastic material and the second local domain is modeled due to the fractured state. To further reduce the computational cost, predictor–corrector adaptivity within the Global–Local concept is introduced. An adaptive scheme is devised through the evolution of the effective global plastic flow (for only elastic–plastic adaptivity), and through the evolution of the local crack phase-field state (for only fracture adaptivity). Thus, two local domains are dynamically updated during the computation, resulting in a two-way adaptivity procedure. The overall response of the Global–Local approach in terms of accuracy/robustness and efficiency is verified using single-scale problems. The resulting framework is algorithmically described in detail and substantiated with numerical examples .},

Time-stable model order reduction methods achieve model compaction while guaranteeing frequency domain models transform in a physically meaningful way. Efficiency and stability are of course of little consequence if the model is rendered inaccurate. Krylov subspaces inherently include system input and/or output behavior in the reduction basis making them ideal reduction bases for investigating system behavior outside of steady state. Realistic boundary conditions are demanded and must be preserved in the reduction basis. Frequency dependent impedance boundary conditions help in this regard but complicate both model reduction and time-integration strategies. Multiplications to enforce system damping in the frequency domain become time-domain convolutions. Recursively calculated minimal memory convolution formulations have long proven useful in lowering the associated computational burden. Complex frequency-dependent damping matrices create a challenge for Krylov subspace based model reduction due to the way the reduction basis is constructed. Arnoldi iterations implicitly match the moments of the system transfer function to span a Krylov subspace. This paper demonstrates how to maintain compatibility with such algorithms while including frequency dependent damping. This work proposes combining projection based model order reduction with an efficient time domain-impedance boundary condition formulation. An important benefit of working in the time domain is the ability to directly output binaural audio signals. To this end, discrepancies are discussed in the perceptual context of audibility. A reduction of system degrees of freedom from NDOF = 13125 NDOF=13125 to RDOF = 63 RDOF=63 and the inclusion of time-domain impedance boundary conditions are shown to enable computational speedups by a factor of 11–36 without introducing audible differences.},

  abstract     = {To reduce the computational burden for structural reliability analysis involving complex numerical models, many adaptive algorithms based on surrogate models have been developed. Among the various surrogate models, the support vector machine for regression (SVR) which is derived from statistical learning theory has demonstrated superior performance to handle nonlinear problems and to avoid overfitting with excellent generalization. Therefore, to take the advantage of the desirable features of SVR, an Adaptive algorithm based on the Bayesian SVR model (ABSVR) is proposed in this study. In ABSVR, a new learning function is devised for the effective selection of informative sample points following the concept of the penalty function method in optimization. To improve the uniformity of sample points in the design of experiments (DoE), a distance constraint term is added to the learning function. Besides, an adaptive sampling region scheme is employed to filter out samples with weak probability density to further enhance the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, a hybrid stopping criterion based on the error-based stopping criterion using the bootstrap confidence estimation is developed to terminate the active learning process to ensure that the learning algorithm stops at an appropriate stage. The proposed ABSVR is easy to implement since no embedded optimization algorithm nor iso-probabilistic transformation is required. The performance of ABSVR is evaluated using six numerical examples featuring different complexity, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of ABSVR for structural reliability analysis in terms of accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a general numerical framework for the modeling of ductile fracture in 3D meshes is introduced. The strategy is inspired from the phase field model and adaptive remeshing tools. The phase field model was introduced as a continuous model for predicting the initiation and propagation of cracks in materials. However, the model has a limitation on the choice of the characteristic length scale that controls the width of the cracked region. This work contributes to the full modeling of transition between the continuous damage using the phase field model to the discontinuous crack initiation and propagation within a unified numerical framework called CIPFAR. The contributions of the work include: (i). identification of the crack surface on arbitrary mesh topologies ; (ii). intersection by a Sequence Agnostic Partitioning strategy which is introduced to adapt the mesh to the computed crack surface; (iii). a nodal duplication by virtual non-manifold patch repair to open the mesh. Combining all the mentioned algorithms with adaptive remeshing allows modeling the initiation and propagation of cracks in materials efficiently. Different numerical examples are presented to prove the ability of the developed algorithm to model ductile fracture cases without the need to predefine the crack initiation region.},

  abstract     = {Dealing with numerical analysis of problems, especially ones with semi-infinite boundaries, scaled boundary finite element method has emerged as one of the efficient tools for the task. Combining the exactness of strong forms with the flexibility of weak formulations makes the method an improvement to its predecessors. Problem with the method arises when the analytical solution of the semi-discretized system is not available, which is the case for numerous problems. In the most recent attempt to solve the issue, a shooting method was proposed for elastostatic problems . Generality of the method removes any concerns regarding the type of governing equations since it no longer needs any analytical solutions. In this study, the method is further developed to deal with elastodynamic problems of viscoelastic media in the frequency domain, for which the closed-form solution is not available. Adopting the shooting method, the two-point boundary value problem of each subdomain is treated as a second-order initial value problem . Boundary conditions of the bounded subdomains are formulated by enforcing equilibrium at both ends. On the other hand, in contrast to linear elasticity , neither forces nor displacements vanish at infinity . As a result, a special treatment is required to deal with the boundary conditions of the unbounded subdomains. A Runge–Kutta–Nyström method, which consists of an embedded pair of adjacent order, is utilized to integrate the strong form of oscillatory equations enabling local error estimation and adaptive step-size control. This guarantees efficiency since the integration proceeds not by equal step-sizes, but by equal user-defined local errors. In the first step, analytical solution of a viscoelastic half-space subjected to a harmonic strip load is used for the verification process . First, the half-space is discretized by Voronoi cells and each truncated edge is defined using an unbounded subdomain. Next, one bounded subdomain is used to define the whole bounded area, and one unbounded subdomain resembles the radiation condition of the far-field boundaries. For the cases involving only bounded subdomains, three other numerical tests, including a perforated plate, an L-shaped panel, and a bi-material specimen are employed, and the effect of discretization method on the results is analyzed. The method is a huge step forward since the size of subdomains are not restricted, far-field boundaries can be arbitrary-shaped, hysteretic damping can be naturally included, no additional unknowns are introduced, no compound matrices are defined, no preconditioning matrices are needed, and a simple unified approach is used for both bounded and unbounded subdomains.},

  abstract     = {The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method has become a popular numerical tool to solve many challenging engineering applications. However, its application to solving anisotropic transient unsaturated–saturated seepage flow problems is still absent in the literature. Among several challenges involved in solving this important problem, the lack of a robust and general SPH formulation to obtain accurate approximations of second derivatives on disordered particle system is the key obstacle preventing this to happen. In this paper, we first propose a general SPH formulation for the second derivatives, capable of considering anisotropic diffusions, and demonstrate that the new formulation outperforms existing SPH formulations for the second derivatives and achieves high accuracy on the highly disordered particle systems. Subsequently, we utilise this newly developed SPH formulation to tackle the transient seepage flows through porous media for the first time, considering anisotropic flows and complete time-dependent transition from unsaturated to saturated states and vice-versa. This naturally leads to a general SPH framework for solving transient seepage problems in unsaturated/saturated porous media using one set of Lagrangian particles (or Lagrangian discretisation). Robust boundary conditions and their implementations for solving general seepage problems in SPH are also proposed, enabling the proposed SPH model to automatically capture seepage surface (including the free surface of unconfined seepage) without any difficulty or ad hoc treatment. Moreover, a simple method to generate a random particle system suitable for SPH simulations on large scale problems using the Voronoi tessellation technique is proposed to study transient seepage problems for the first time. Several verification examples are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed SPH framework in solving the complex seepage flow problems, including those on multi-resolution particle configurations. Excellent agreements with a wide range of numerical and theoretical solutions are achieved, suggesting that the newly proposed SPH model can be applied to solve complex transient seepage flow problems. This marks an important milestone for the future development of SPH to solve fully coupled flow deformation problems involved large deformation and failure of porous media, which are challenging for the most state-of-the-art mesh-based numerical methods.},

Such problems have poor-approximability in a linear space and therefore, are challenging for standard MOR techniques. We build upon the methodology of approximating the map between the parameter domain and the expansion coefficients of the reduced basis via regression. The online stage queries the regression model for the expansion coefficients and recovers a reduced approximation for the solution. We propose to apply this technique to a transformed solution that results from composing the solution with a spatial transform. Unlike the (untransformed) solution, it is sufficiently regular along the parameter domain and thus, is well-approximable in a low-dimensional linear space. To recover an approximation for the (untransformed) solution, we propose an online efficient regression-based technique that approximates the inverse of the spatial transform. Our method features a decoupled online and offline stage, and benchmark problems involving hyperbolic and parabolic equations demonstrate its effectiveness.},

First, a fractional stochastic partial differential equation is introduced and parameterized in order to automatically capture the complex features of additively manufactured parts. Information-theoretic transport maps are subsequently introduced with the aim of ensuring well-posedness in the forward propagation problem. The identification of stochastic elasticity tensors on titanium scaffolds produced by laser powder bed fusion is then discussed. To this end, we consider an isotropic approximation at a mesoscale where fluctuations are aggregated over several layers, and address both the calibration and validation of the probabilistic model by using different sets of physical structural experiments. Despite the high sensitivity of the forward map to applied boundary conditions, geometrical parameters, and structural porosity, it is shown that the calibrated stochastic model can generate non-vanishing probability levels for all experimental observations.},

A modified Voce-type law is assumed for the isotropic hardening behaviour. A novel law is proposed to account for an evolution of the damage depending on the loading directions.

In addition, the paper provides comparison and discussion of different SPH forms including: Classical SPH, Nonlocal, Local and Mixed SPH. The partition of unity approach was used to define the following two mixed forms: Local–Nonlocal and Local–Classical SPH. These mixed forms were intended for modelling of physical processes characterised with local and nonlocal effects (local and nonlocal constitutive equations), e.g. progressive damage and failure. The stabilising effect of the Local form on the Classical SPH, which is inherently unstable (tensile instability), are also illustrated. The stability analysis, presented in appendices A and B, demonstrate stability of the continuous and discrete form of the nonlocal SPH based on Eulerian kernels for elastic continuum.},

  abstract     = {Systems composed of numerous particles, as granular materials, can be simulated by the discrete element method (DEM). There are numerous versions of DEM considering particle shapes as spheres, superellipsoids, polyhedra and others. Classically, particles are considered rigid and the only flexibility present in the model is local, embedded in the contact interface model. Such treatment seems not to be adequate when one is interested in simulating phenomena dependent on the general flexibility of particles and investigating their effects in granular media. The present work proposes a method to introduce flexible particles of polyhedral shape within the DEM context. We employ the Virtual Element Method (VEM) for the spatial discretization of particles, taking advantage of its geometrical versatility, modeling each particle with a single-element. The dynamical behavior of the resulting particle system is predicted using an implicit time-integration. Contact between polyhedral particles (possibly non-convex) is addressed by the master–master contact technique and its degenerations, employing a barrier-based interface law. Examples include studies and discussions on the VEM’s stiffness and mass stabilization parameters, such as simulations of systems composed of flexible polyhedral particles as a sand-material pack under compression and a hopper discharging process.},

To enable the efficient analysis and design of LRAM beam/shell structural elements for practical applications, a computational homogenization method for modelling wave propagation phenomena in LRAM panels is presented in this work. The approach is based on the notion of a relaxed separation of scales, which tailors the methodology to the phenomena governed by local resonators embedded in a host medium. The macroscopic LRAM panel is modelled as a thin continuum beam/shell described by proper structural kinematics and momentum balance relations. At the microscale , a LRAM unit cell is considered with lamina-wise in-plane boundary conditions and zero out-of-plane tractions, representing the free top and bottom surfaces of the macroscopic LRAM panel. Under the assumption of linear elasticity , in the relaxed separation of scales regime, the microscale unit cell problem can be represented by the superposition of a static and a dynamic problem , hereby enabling a significant model reduction. As a result, the macroscale effective material properties can be computed once and for all off-line for a given unit cell. In addition, a new macroscale evolution equation emerges describing the effect of the microscale internal dynamics on the macroscopic fields through the introduction of new macroscale enrichment variables, which reflect the modal amplitudes of localized microscale modes. The proposed homogenization methodology reveals a high level of accuracy and numerical efficiency compared to the reference direct numerical simulation (DNS) for all relevant analyses: computation of real and complex dispersion spectra for an infinite LRAM panel, as well as steady-state frequency response and transient behaviour for a finite LRAM panel.},

  abstract     = {Biopolymer gels, such as those made out of fibrin or collagen, are widely used in tissue engineering applications and biomedical research. Moreover, fibrin naturally assembles into gels in vivo during wound healing and thrombus formation. The macroscale properties of fibrin and other biopolymer gels are dictated by the response of a microscale fiber network. Hence, accurate description of biopolymer gels can be achieved using representative volume elements (RVE) that explicitly model the discrete fiber networks of the microscale. These RVE models, however, cannot be efficiently used to model the macroscale due to the challenges and computational demands of multiscale coupling. Here, we propose the use of an artificial, fully connected neural network (FCNN) to efficiently capture the behavior of the RVE models. The FCNN was trained on 1100 fiber networks subjected to 121 biaxial deformations. The stress data from the RVE, together with the total energy on the fibers and the condition of incompressibility of the surrounding matrix, were used to determine the derivatives of an unknown strain energy function with respect to the deformation invariants. During training, the loss function was modified to ensure convexity of the strain energy function and symmetry of its Hessian. A general FCNN model was coded into a user material subroutine (UMAT) in the software Abaqus. The UMAT implementation takes in the structure and parameters of an arbitrary FCNN as material parameters from the input file. The inputs to the FCNN include the first two isochoric invariants of the deformation. The FCNN outputs the derivatives of the strain energy with respect to the isochoric invariants. In this work, the FCNN trained on the discrete fiber network data was used in finite element simulations of biopolymer gels using our UMAT. We anticipate that this work will enable further integration of machine learning tools with computational mechanics. It will also improve computational modeling of biological materials characterized by a multiscale structure.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new topology optimization method is discussed. The basic idea consists of exploring a combination of a density-based method together with a level-set description to form a new optimization frame. Due to the level-set description, solutions show clear and smooth boundaries that are deemed more materially efficient. Additionally, the checkerboarding issue, usually paired with an element-wise description, can be avoided. Thus, the filter scheme to tackle this problem becomes unnecessary, and the design space can be further exploited. The ingredient of material interpolation with penalty is utilized here, and its merit lies in making update information (i.e., sensitivity) more distinguished and in turn driving the optimization process to converge into solid–void solutions stably. An ordinary differential equation (ODE) established from optimal criteria builds the relationship between the level-set description and update information, and the structural updating procedure can be efficiently performed by solving the ODE. A regularization scheme for the level-set is introduced to enhance topological variation ability and address topological evolution defects, which helps deliver reasonable and well-posed topological configurations. The regularization strategy is a simple linear scaling manner that proves to be effective and efficient. This paper investigates three classes of optimization problems : compliance minimization, eigenfrequency maximization, and thermal conduction optimization. To validate the proposed method, both 2D and 3D benchmark examples in comparison with the widely accepted Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method are tested. By contrast, the solutions resulting from the proposed method show advantageous structural representations and better objective function values under specified conditions. In addition, several other numerical examples considering model parameter influences and some extensions are discussed to systematically demonstrate the proposed method’s characteristics. Finally, the MATLAB codes concerning the above-mentioned three classes of optimization problems are shared for educational purposes. The codes are compact and finely structured with only 58, 62, and 53 lines for 2D cases, and 105, 108, and 80 lines for 3D cases of minimum compliance, maximum eigenfrequency, and minimum thermal compliance problems, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This study presents new framework in which the representative volume element (RVE) method and machine learning (ML) model are used to construct continuous anisotropic effective material properties for simultaneous design of the overall topology configuration and local fiber material layout in functionally graded composite structures. It is an alternative to the asymptotic homogenization design method (AHDM) to obtain continuous effective material property functions. While the AHDM uses the asymptotic homogenization theory (AHT) and Legendre polynomials , the RVE method calculates anisotropic effective material properties having nonlinear behavior with respect to design variables of microstructures, and it is easier to implement than AHT given the governing equations and appropriate boundary conditions. More efficient and accurate than Legendre polynomials , ML is used to build a continuous model of the RVE results required for simultaneous design of the overall topology configuration and local fiber material layout. To show the convenience and expandability of the proposed method, a 3D RVE model is also proposed through the extension of the 2D model. The proposed method is verified through 2D and 3D numerical examples to minimize structural compliance and obtained results are compared with those from the application of AHDM.},

We present a multi-physics macro-scale model that can distinguish between the mechanics and transport interactions. The porous media is represented by a poroelastic domain incorporating non-local damage and non-local transport. The evolution of each of these processes is governed by a unique length scale and driving force , which allows for better flexibility in modeling hydraulic-deformation network systems . For consistency the governing equations of the non-local multi-physics problem are derived from thermodynamics principles. Hence, a four-field ( u , P , σ ̃ e q , D , κ ̃ u,P,σ̃eq,D,κ̃ ) mixed finite element formulation is developed. The non-linear system of equations is linearized and solved using Newton’s method and a backward Euler scheme is used to evolve the system in time, for which a consistent Jacobian matrix and residual vector are derived analytically. Two benchmark examples are investigated: hydraulic fracturing of rocks and soil consolidation. The numerical examples show the viability of this model, and how the variation of the two length scales and damage parameters can be used to describe different physical phenomena .},

Recently, Primal–Dual Active Set strategies (PDAS) have emerged as a promising method for solving contact problems. These methods are based on the following principle: the frictional contact conditions are restated as non-linear complementary functions for which the solution is provided by the iterative semi-smooth Newton method . Based on these prerequisites, this contribution aims to provide a generalization of the NSCD-PDAS for dynamic frictional contact problems. Several numerical experiments are reported for algorithm validation purposes and also to assess the efficiency and performances of PDAS methods with respect to the Newton/Augmented Lagrangian and the Bi-Potential methods.},

Even if the application domain of the proposed technique(s) is wide, these remedies are herein demonstrated in shape optimization problems with unsteady fluid flows. In these cases, the adjoint equations are integrated backwards in time, requiring the instantaneous flow fields to be available at each time-step of the adjoint solver, and this noticeably increases storage requirements. To avoid extreme treatments, such as the full storage of the computed instantaneous flow fields or their recomputations from scratch during the solution of the adjoint equations, or even the widely used check-pointing technique, lossy compression techniques are proposed. These are implemented within OpenFOAM, which is used to solve the flow and adjoint equations and conduct the optimization. In this paper, (a) the ZFP compression library, (b) the incremental Proper Generalized Decomposition (iPGD) algorithm and (c) an efficient hybridization of them are used. The compression strategies are assessed on aerodynamic shape optimization problems. Their effectiveness in data reduction, computational overhead and representation accuracy is considered, in relation to the continuous adjoint method which uses the decompressed fields to compute the gradient of objective functions as the reference method.},

For the latter, we take advantage of the splitting of barotropic and baroclinic modes and propose a new two-level method in which an ETD method is applied to solve the fast barotropic mode. These methods could improve the computational efficiency of numerical simulations because ETD methods allow for much larger time step sizes than traditional explicit time-stepping techniques that are commonly used in existing computational ocean models.

Many popular uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods require repeated simulations of the underlying physical system with different samples of the uncertain model parameters. This poses great challenges to many practical engineering applications due to the high demand for computational resources . In this report we propose highly efficient ensemble simulation algorithms for fast computation of coupled flow ensembles. The proposed ensemble algorithms are based on two recently developed numerical approaches : scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) and ensemble timestepping. We introduce a new decoupling strategy using the SAV idea and incorporate the ensemble timestepping method to develop two decoupled ensemble schemes for the Stokes–Darcy system: SAV-BE-En and SAV-BDF2-En. The two ensemble algorithms are specially designed for UQ computations where a number of realizations of the underlying coupled PDE system are required for analyzing and interpreting flow statistics . Compared with traditional methods which solve for each realization independently, our proposed ensemble algorithms result in a common coefficient matrix for all realizations and efficient iterative solvers such as block CG or block GMRES can be used to solve for all realizations simultaneously reducing both computer storage and overall simulation time. We prove that both ensemble algorithms are long time stable without any time step conditions. We also provide a comprehensive error analysis for the fully discrete SAV-BE-En algorithm, and present a few illustrative numerical examples to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of engineering structures are of great importance for topology optimization problems in both academia and industry. However, for design problems where broadband frequency responses are required, the computational burden becomes enormous, especially for large-scale applications. To remedy this numerical bottleneck, using the Reduced-Order Methods (ROMs) is an efficient approach by recasting the original problem into a subspace with a much smaller dimensionality than the full model. In this paper, a systematic comparative study of some typical and potential ROMs for solving the broadband frequency response optimization problems is provided, including the Quasi-Static Ritz Vector (QSRV), the Padé expansion and the second-order Krylov subspace method . Furthermore, the effects of the orthonormalization processes are discussed. Two representative test problems, a vibration problem and a wave propagation problem, are solved, analyzed, and compared based on the ROMs’ accuracy, their stability in approximating the state and adjoint equations and the applicability to topology optimization problems. From the extensive numerical results, we find that the second-order Krylov subspace with moment-matching Gram–Schmidt orthonormalization (SOMMG) and the Second-Order Arnoldi method (SOAR) provides superior accuracy and stability. Moreover, the results verify that the basis vectors computed for the state equation cannot be reused for solving the adjoint equation, and hence, that new basis vectors should be constructed. Analysis of the computational cost for the 3D test problems shows an improvement in numerical performance in the order of 100–10000 for the ROMs compared to the full approach.},

This system of nonlocal equations is first rewritten in terms of minimization of a nonlocal energy, then discretized with a meshfree approximation and finally solved via a Lagrange multiplier approach in a way that resembles the finite element tearing and interconnect method. Specifically, we propose a distributed projected gradient algorithm for the solution of the Lagrange multiplier system, whose unknowns determine the nonlocal interface conditions between subdomains. Several two-dimensional numerical tests on problems as large as 191 million unknowns illustrate the strong and the weak scalability of our algorithm, which outperforms the standard approach to the distributed numerical solution of the problem.

We prove sufficient and necessary conditions for a flat metric with cone singularities to be compatible with a quad-mesh, in terms of the deck-transformation, then develop an algorithm based on the theorem. The algorithm has two stages: first, a meromorphic quartic differential is generated to induce a T-mesh; second, the edge lengths of the T-mesh are adjusted by solving a linear system to satisfy the deck transformation condition, which produces a quad-mesh. In the first stage, the algorithm pipeline can be summarized as follows: calculate the homology group ; compute the holomorphic differential group; construct the period matrix of the surface and Jacobi variety; calculate the Abel–Jacobi map for a given divisor; optimize the divisor to satisfy the Abel–Jacobi condition by integer programming ; compute a flat Riemannian metric with cone singularities at the divisor by Ricci flow; isometrically immerse the surface punctured at the divisor onto the complex plane and pull back the canonical holomorphic differential to the surface to obtain the meromorphic quartic differential; construct a motorcycle graph to generate a T-Mesh. In the second stage, the deck transformation constraints are formulated as a linear equation system of the edge lengths of the T-mesh. The solution provides a flat metric with integral deck transformations, which leads to the final quad-mesh. The proposed method is rigorous and practical. The T-mesh and quad-mesh results can be applied for constructing Splines directly. The efficiency and efficacy of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated by experimental results on surfaces with complicated topologies and geometries.},

Based on the transfinite mapping technique, also known as Coons–Gordon interpolation, piece-wise shape functions are derived such that an arbitrary number of elements with different ansatz spaces is coupled conformingly. This is an important prerequisite to enable the use of local mesh refinement strategies for regular quadrilateral discretizations . Due to the special construction of the shape functions, there are no hanging nodes that need to be taken care of. The focus in this contribution is on dynamics, and therefore, Lagrange polynomials are taken as the basis to construct shape functions for arbitrary transition elements. As a consequence, the Kronecker-delta and partition of unity properties are recovered. These properties are crucial to diagonalize the mass matrix using standard mass lumping techniques such as row-summing and diagonal scaling. The performance of the proposed family of elements is assessed by means of several benchmark examples, where the numerical rates of convergence are determined for both consistent and lumped mass matrix formulations .},

  abstract     = {In the community of topology optimization , the contradiction between the frontier research with structured meshes and the complex geometry in the real-world problems has existed for a long time. Structured mesh is attractive in convenient application of loads and boundary conditions, and easy implementation of GPU parallel calculation. Therefore, unlike existing researches solving the issue through unstructured elements, this paper presents an easy-to-accomplish virtual phase method (VPM) based on structured meshes , to systematically solve the problems with complex geometries and arbitrary non-design domains. Structural geometry is denoted by the extended regular design domain and void region initially placed at the border of the extended domain. Based on the extended idea of composite material interpolation in multi-phase density-based topology optimization approaches, the extended structural design domains and the pre-defined non-design domains are considered as the optimized phases in the structure, and they are defined by discrete variable fields. Subsequently, the structural optimization is implemented like as the traditional multi-material topology optimization process. Numerical examples accounting for minimum compliance are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, including multi-phase macrostructural design, the ease with which the method can accommodate passive regions, and how the length scale constraints are used to devise graded porous infill morphology within a given shell. At last, the manufacturability of the optimized designs is discussed to further verify the applicability of the proposed method. Our approach provides those front researches based on structured meshes with an easily accessible access, to be straightforwardly applied for any complex-domain design problem.},

  abstract     = {In the present work, a computationally efficient and explicit algorithm for the rigorous enforcement of the irreversibility constraint in the phase-field modeling of brittle fracture is presented. The proposed approach is staggered and relies on the alternate minimization of the total energy functional. The phase-field evolution turns out to be governed by a complementarity boundary-value problem, where the complementarity stems from the irreversibility , while the boundary-value problem is originated by the presence of the gradient term in the phase-field functional. Several different techniques have been proposed in the literature to account for damage irreversibility in a computationally effective way. Following a similar approach proposed in the past for a gradient-plasticity problem, a particularly simple and effective solution strategy based on the Projected Successive Over-Relaxation (PSOR) method for constrained optimization , where an iterative explicit scheme is used for the solution of symmetric linear complementarity problems , is presented. Even though the proposed method is restricted to linear complementarity problems, it can be applied to the numerical simulation of a wide range of problems discussed in the literature. The performance of the suggested solution algorithm on a number of test cases is compared with that of a recently proposed penalty approach for the approximated enforcement of irreversibility.},

In this study, the IGABEM is employed to solve the Laplace equation for the velocity potentials of the liquid, and the singular integral is calculated by the Radial Integral Method (RIM). The Semi-Lagrange (SL) approach is adopted to capture the movement of the free surface , then the RK2 method is used to update the velocity potential and elevation of the free surface at each time step. The numerical results agree very well with the reference results in different situations including free sloshing and forced sloshing under different excitations, which illustrates the validity of the present method. Moreover, in comparison with the traditional element-based method with linear polynomial interpolation function , the present RK2-IGABEM can evaluate the velocity potential and elevation of the free surface more smoothly with only a few degrees of freedom added, leading to a high accuracy analysis of nonlinear sloshing problems.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a new computational damage approach based on localized mass loss concept and its detailed finite element implementation for brittle fracture under quasi-static loading condition. Formulation of this approach is derived in a general way by means of finite deformation regime and nonlinear isotropic materials. The underlying idea of the theory lies in the fact that cracks are created by massive breakage of atomic bonds, diffusing in a volume of characteristic size, resulting in highly localized mass loss area, and nor geometric description of cracks are required. In degraded domain, the traditional law of conservation of mass is violated locally and that is replaced by the local mass-balance equation, accounting for mass flow in the area of degraded material. A coupled system of equilibrium and local mass-balance equations is thus introduced to govern deformation of the body and evolution of the mass density. In this setting, the failure, in contrast to conventional damage models, is thus driven by localized mass loss, which has physical meaning, nor internal parameters such as phase-field or damage variables are defined. We also introduce new constitutive laws for mass source and mass flux by means of energy decomposition, where only the positive part of strain energy density (SED) function involves in the degradation of mass, accounting for distinction of fracture behavior in tension and compression. The discrete forms of governing equations are solved by a staggered nonlinear algorithm. Importantly, equally linear interpolations for the standard finite elements are used for both displacements and mass density, nor mismatch of approximation exits, convenient in the implementation. In addition, we present a special detection technique to find so-called updated nodes, which aims to prevent numerically unstable issues caused by random distortions of deleted elements. The staggered algorithm is thus modified so that the displacements and mass density are updated separately. This detection technique is then integrated into the staggered algorithm. We also present a procedure for calibration of the required quantities used for the localized mass loss analysis. Numerical experiments for brittle fracture are studied to show the accuracy and performance of the developed damage approach.},

  abstract     = {Many state-of-the-art approaches for predicting discrete fracture within the finite element framework were designed by enhancing the continuous displacement field with a discontinuous part. Broadly categorised into elemental and nodal enrichment approaches, they provided unprecedented versatility in discretising domains with prescribed and evolving boundaries. However, there can be an additional computational burden when global tracking schemes are used to enforce the continuity of tractions/jumps along crack paths. Many current approaches also entail involved integration procedures over cut subdomains , which pose challenges of efficiency and accuracy. In addition, although cracks do not need to conform to the geometry of the mesh, the discretisation of cracks is still linked to that of the underlying elements, which can lead to the inaccurate representation of traction profiles along stiff interfaces. Aiming at overcoming these issues, the present work introduces a new formulation with minimal enhanced degrees of freedom. This is achieved by decoupling the discretisation of bulk and cracks, a feature that is enabled by a novel clustered rigid body definition of enhancement field in the set of the variational equations . A new method, termed Cracked Zone Clustering Method (CZCM), is then proposed for discrete fracture propagation by deploying only one rotational degree of freedom per set of cracked elements within the same zone. The stability of the method is first studied using element examples. The method is also shown to resolve the issue of traction oscillations over stiff interfaces. The accuracy and efficiency of the independent discretisation strategy are studied using several known crack propagation benchmarks. Results are compared with the Extended/Generalised Finite Element Method (XFEM/GFEM) and the Discrete Strong Discontinuity Approach (DSDA). In summary, it is shown that the cracked zones can encompass a multitude of elements, thus significantly decreasing the required number of enhancement degrees of freedom by orders of magnitude and without compromising accuracy.},

  abstract     = {We present a neural network-based method for solving linear and nonlinear partial differential equations, by combining the ideas of extreme learning machines (ELM), domain decomposition and local neural networks. The field solution on each sub-domain is represented by a local feed-forward neural network, and C k Ck continuity conditions are imposed on the sub-domain boundaries. Each local neural network consists of a small number of hidden layers, while its last hidden layer can be wide. The weight/bias coefficients in all the hidden layers of the local neural networks are pre-set to random values and fixed throughout the computation, and only the weight coefficients in the output layers of the local neural networks are training parameters. The overall neural network is trained by a linear or nonlinear least squares computation, not by the back-propagation type algorithms. We introduce a block time-marching scheme together with the presented method for long-time simulations of time-dependent linear/nonlinear partial differential equations. The current method exhibits a clear sense of convergence with respect to the degrees of freedom in the neural network. Its numerical errors typically decrease exponentially or nearly exponentially as the number of training parameters, or the number of training data points, or the number of sub-domains increases. Extensive numerical experiments have been performed to demonstrate the computational performance of the presented method. We also demonstrate its capability for long-time dynamic simulations with some test problems. We compare the presented method with the deep Galerkin method (DGM) and the physics-informed neural network (PINN) method in terms of the accuracy and computational cost. The current method exhibits a clear superiority, with its numerical errors and network training time considerably smaller (typically by orders of magnitude) than those of DGM and PINN. We also compare the current method with the classical finite element method (FEM). The computational performance of the current method is on par with, and often exceeds, the FEM performance in terms of the accuracy and computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are ubiquitously used in sciences and engineering as metamodels. Standard GPs, however, can only handle numerical or quantitative variables. In this paper, we introduce latent map Gaussian processes (LMGPs) that inherit the attractive properties of GPs and are also applicable to mixed data which have both quantitative and qualitative inputs. The core idea behind LMGPs is to learn a continuous, low-dimensional latent space or manifold which encodes all qualitative inputs. To learn this manifold, we first assign a unique prior vector representation to each combination of qualitative inputs. We then use a low-rank linear map to project these priors on a manifold that characterizes the posterior representations. As the posteriors are quantitative, they can be directly used in any standard correlation function such as the Gaussian or Matern. Hence, the optimal map and the corresponding manifold, along with other hyperparameters of the correlation function, can be systematically learned via maximum likelihood estimation. Through a wide range of analytic and real-world examples, we demonstrate the advantages of LMGPs over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and versatility. In particular, we show that LMGPs can handle variable-length inputs, have an explainable neural network interpretation, and provide insights into how qualitative inputs affect the response or interact with each other. We also employ LMGPs in Bayesian optimization and illustrate that they can discover optimal compound compositions more efficiently than conventional methods that convert compositions to qualitative variables via manual featurization.},

In the present paper, an algorithm in which the values of phase field are regarded as the indicator to identify crack paths is proposed. Then physical patches are cut by the reconstructed crack paths to obtain explicit cracks and jump displacement field in the context of the numerical manifold method (NMM). The numerical examples investigate that various explicit cracks, including a straight crack, a curve crack , the branching cracks, and the merging cracks, predicted by the proposed method are in good agreement with the literature. Besides, the Sneddon’s example verifies that the discontinuous displacement field across explicit cracks is in line with the closed form solution .

  abstract     = {The optimal design , reliable manufacture and durable utilization of electromechanical systems demand objective modeling of failure under coupled electric field and mechanical actions. This is still a challenging and largely an open issue despite the large volumes of contributions from the discontinuous approach and the phase-field community for brittle fracture . In this work we propose a length scale insensitive phase-field cohesive zone model ( PF-CZM ) for electromechanical fracture in linear piezoelectric solids, overcoming all the issues of mesh dependence, crack tracking complexity, length scale sensitivity and crack nucleation inconsistency. More specifically, in the electromechanically coupled phase-field constitutive relations, the evolution law for the crack phase-field is established from the geometric regularization of sharp cracks and the energetic criterion in global form. In order to capture the unsymmetric mechanical and electrical fracture behavior , the mechanical energy release rate contributed from the positive cone of the effective stress in energy norm is employed as the crack driving force , resulting in a hybrid formulation. With a set of phase-field characteristic functions optimal for cohesive fracture, the critical stress upon crack nucleation and the post-peak softening regime are derived in close-form for the first time, and the experimentally observed effects of the electric field on the fracture load are predicted qualitatively. The proposed electromechanical PF-CZM is numerically implemented in the multi-field finite element method and applied to several representative examples. In all cases, as those for purely mechanical problems, the predicted crack patterns and fracture loads are insensitive to the phase-field length scale and the experimental results are well reproduced. In particular, the effect of electric field on the deflection of crack paths can be captured. These merits make the proposed PF-CZM promising in the modeling of electromechanical fracture in piezoelectric solids.},

We show that limited displacement data holds sufficient information to quantify the viscoelasticity behavior. We formulate the inverse computation – modeling viscoelasticity properties from observed displacement data – as a PDE-constrained optimization problem and minimize the error functional using a gradient-based optimization method.

The kinematics of the model are asymmetric in tension and compression. Other authors which follow this approach are often times concerned with cleavage systems with well-known cleavage planes. In our model the crack surface orientation is not known a priori and thus treated as a degree of freedom. The formulation within the generalized standard material framework yields thermodynamic consistency. Two outstanding features of our approach are the straightforward implementation of anisotropic damage behavior and the traction free crack surface which emerges from the model. We demonstrate our findings with numerical examples for different load cases, different sample geometries and isotropic as well as anisotropic damage behavior. We showcase advantages of our approach when compared to a model which features a spectral tension-compression split.},

The proposed formulation leverages and generalizes the principles of the Eigenstrain-based reduced order homogenization (EHM) approach. Asymptotic analysis with multiple scales is employed to describe the microscale problem in the deformed configuration . A two-term Taylor series approximation of the constitutive behavior along with a geometry-based basis reduction is employed to arrive at the reduced order model . An efficient implementation scheme is proposed to evaluate the multiscale system without the need to recompute the reduced basis as a function of evolving deformation. The ability of the proposed modeling approach in capturing homogenized and localized behavior as well as texture evolution is demonstrated in the context of single crystal and polycrystal microstructures.},

  abstract     = {A key advantage of isogeometric discretizations is their accurate and well-behaved eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes . For degree two and higher, however, a few spurious modes appear that possess inaccurate frequencies, denoted as “outliers”. The outlier frequencies and corresponding modes are at the root of several efficiency and robustness issues in isogeometric analysis. One example is explicit dynamics where outlier frequencies unnecessarily reduce the critical time step. Another example is wave propagation where the inaccurate outlier modes may participate in the solution. In this paper, we first investigate the spurious outlier frequencies and corresponding modes of isogeometric discretizations of second- and fourth-order model problems and provide a complete characterization. We then devise a new approach that removes all outliers modes without negatively affecting the accuracy of the discretizations . Our approach is variationally consistent and works for a range of common boundary conditions on tensor product domains. We finally demonstrate that our approach allows a much larger critical time step, irrespective of polynomial degree , providing a pathway towards efficient higher-order explicit dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Many subsurface engineering applications involve tight-coupling between fluid flow, solid deformation, fracturing, and similar processes. To better understand the complex interplay of different governing equations, and therefore design efficient and safe operations, numerical simulations are widely used. Given the relatively long time-scales of interest, fully-implicit time-stepping schemes are often necessary to avoid time-step stability restrictions. A major computational bottleneck for these methods, however, is the linear solver. These systems are extremely large and ill-conditioned. Because of the wide range of processes and couplings that may be involved – e.g. formation and propagation of fractures, deformation of the solid porous medium, viscous flow of one or more fluids in the pores and fractures, complicated well sources and sinks, etc. – it is difficult to develop general-purpose but scalable linear solver frameworks. This challenge is further aggravated by the range of different discretization schemes that may be adopted, which have a direct impact on the linear system structure. To address this obstacle, we describe a flexible strategy based on multigrid reduction (MGR) that can produce purely algebraic preconditioners for a wide spectrum of relevant physics and discretizations. We demonstrate that MGR, guided by physics and theory in block preconditioning, can tackle several distinct and challenging problems, notably: a hybrid discretization of single-phase flow, compositional multiphase flow with complex wells, and hydraulic fracturing simulations. Extension to other systems can be handled quite naturally. We demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the resulting solvers through numerical examples of difficult, field-scale problems.},

  abstract     = {We develop a fast multi-fidelity modeling method for very complex correlations between high- and low-fidelity data by working in modal space to extract the proper correlation function. We apply this method to infer the amplitude of motion of a flexible marine riser in cross-flow, subject to vortex-induced vibrations (VIV). VIV are driven by an absolute instability in the flow, which imposes a frequency (Strouhal) law that requires a matching with the impedance of the structure; this matching is easily achieved because of the rapid parametric variation of the added mass force. As a result, the wavenumber of the riser spatial response is within narrow bands of uncertainty. Hence, an error in wavenumber prediction can cause significant phase-related errors in the shape of the amplitude of response along the riser, rendering correlation between low- and high-fidelity data very complex. Working in modal space as outlined herein, dense data from low-fidelity data, provided by the semi-empirical computer code VIVA, can correlate in modal space with few high-fidelity data, obtained from experiments or fully-resolved CFD simulations , to correct both phase and amplitude and provide predictions that agree very well overall with the correct shape of the amplitude response. We also quantify the uncertainty in the prediction using Bayesian modeling and exploit this uncertainty to formulate an active learning strategy for the best possible location of the sensors providing the high fidelity measurements .},

  abstract     = {The ability to simulate the processes required to fabricate advanced microelectronic structures, commonly referred to as process technology computer aided design (TCAD), is essential for the semiconductor industry. It aids in the design and development of modern integrated circuits at low cost. Ongoing demands of high efficiency and simplicity lead to the development of process emulation techniques, which describe the effect of a fabrication step by using only the geometric properties gathered from experimental data or extracted from physical simulations. However, the accuracy of current emulation models is limited by their strong reliance on explicit surface representations, while traditional algorithms employing implicit surfaces, such as the level set , can frequently suffer from numerical limitations. A novel geometric advection algorithm for microelectronic process emulation is presented, which advances a level set surface over large distances in a single simulation step. It combines the advantages of explicit surface representations, such as fast access to surface data and efficient sorting, and the robustness of implicit surface representations. Furthermore, calculations are performed directly in the level set avoiding costly conversions to explicit surfaces. The performance and applicability of the algorithm to modern processes is demonstrated by emulating the fabrication of several high aspect ratio structures. Due to the almost universal applicability and computational efficiency of the presented geometric advection algorithm, it provides an entirely new way of emulating microelectronic fabrication processes and presents a promising alternative to long-standing and commonly used techniques.},

Stable convergence to high-quality designs without an excessive number of linear solver iterations is observed, and it is seen that the finite element formulation is not particularly sensitive to the choice of the pressure jump penalty parameter, thus making it a practically useful method.},

  abstract     = {Uncertainty propagation in complex engineering systems often poses significant computational challenges related to modeling and quantifying probability distributions of model outputs, as those emerge as the result of various sources of uncertainty that are inherent in the system under investigation. Gaussian Processes regression (GPs) is a robust meta-modeling technique that allows for fast model prediction and exploration of response surfaces. Multi-fidelity variations of GPs further leverage information from cheap and low fidelity model simulations in order to improve their predictive performance on the high fidelity model. In order to cope with the high volume of data required to train GPs in high dimensional design spaces, a common practice is to introduce latent design variables that are typically projections of the original input space to a lower dimensional subspace, and therefore substitute the problem of learning the initial high dimensional mapping, with that of training a GP on a low dimensional space. In this paper, we present a Bayesian approach to identify optimal transformations that map the input points to low dimensional latent variables. The “projection” mapping consists of an orthonormal matrix that is considered a priori unknown and needs to be inferred jointly with the GP parameters, conditioned on the available training data. The proposed Bayesian inference scheme relies on a two-step iterative algorithm that samples from the marginal posteriors of the GP parameters and the projection matrix respectively, both using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. In order to take into account the orthogonality constraints imposed on the orthonormal projection matrix, a Geodesic Monte Carlo sampling algorithm is employed, that is suitable for exploiting probability measures on manifolds. We extend the proposed framework to multi-fidelity models using GPs including the scenarios of training multiple outputs together. We validate our framework on three synthetic problems with a known lower-dimensional subspace. The benefits of our proposed framework, are illustrated on the computationally challenging aerodynamic optimization of a last-stage blade for an industrial gas turbine, where we study the effect of an 85-dimensional shape parameterization of a three-dimensional airfoil on two output quantities of interest, specifically on the aerodynamic efficiency and the degree of reaction.},

The problem is governed by an approximation to the compressible Navier–Stokes equations for the viscous fluid in the fracture cavity coupled to the elastic-wave equation in the surrounding solid. The solid is assumed to be isotropic linear elastic and the fluid to be Newtonian. The elastic-wave equation is discretized in space with a quadratic Generalized Finite Element Method (GFEM) and in time by Newmark’s method while the Krauklis waves equations are discretized in space by a quadratic standard FEM and in time by the α -method α-method . A monolithic solver is adopted for the coupled problem and is numerically shown to be stable for the adopted approximation spaces. The GFEM is particularly appealing for the discretization of 3-D fractures since it does not require meshes fitting their geometry. Furthermore, analytical asymptotic solutions are used to enrich the GFEM approximation spaces, increasing the accuracy of the method. Mesh adaptivity around the fracture fronts is employed to further decrease the discretization error while controlling the computational time . The methodology is verified with analytical solutions and compared with experimental data . Different fracture geometries are investigated to demonstrate the complex 3-D effects of the physical phenomenon and the robustness of the proposed GFEM methodology.},

  abstract     = {We present a modified model order reduction (MOR) technique for the FFT-based simulation of composite microstructures. It utilizes the earlier introduced MOR technique (Kochmann et al., 2019), which is based on solving the Lippmann–Schwinger equation in Fourier space by a reduced set of frequencies. Crucial for the accuracy of this MOR technique is on the one hand the amount of used frequencies and on the other hand the choice of frequencies used within the simulation. Kochmann et al. (2019) defined the reduced set of frequencies by using a fixed sampling pattern, which is most general but leads to poor microstructural results when considering only a few frequencies. Consequently, a reconstruction algorithm based on the T V 1 TV1 -algorithm (Candes et al., 2006) was used in a post-processing step to generate highly resolved micromechanical fields. The present work deals with a modified sampling pattern generation for this MOR technique. Based on the idea, that the micromechanical material response strongly depends on the phase-wise material behavior , we propose the usage of sampling patterns adapted to the spatial arrangement of the individual phases. This leads to significantly improved microscopic and overall results. Hence, the time-consuming reconstruction in the post-processing step that was necessary in the earlier work is no longer required. To show the adaptability and robustness of this new choice of sampling patterns, several two dimensional examples are investigated. In addition, also the 3D extension of the algorithm is presented.},

  abstract     = {Sparse representation of Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) has been widely used in the field of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) due to its simple model structure and low computational cost. The sample quality is a crucial issue that affects the precision of sparse PCE model. In this paper, a hybrid sequential sampling strategy is proposed to collect samples with high quality and in relatively small quantities for training PCE model. To achieve fast convergence rate and modelling stability, the proposed strategy takes into account both input information and target model feature by combining compressive sampling and Bayesian experimental design. First, a sequential sampling framework is established to collect samples that approximately match the coherence-optimal distribution, which is derived from the compressive sampling theory, during the iteration process. Then, by resorting to the Bayesian Compressive Sensing (BCS) method and information theory, favourable sampling points in each iteration are determined according to the modelling results, substituting for randomly selecting sampling points. The performance of the proposed sampling strategy is evaluated on several analytical functions through comparison with three input-dependent only sampling methods and two output-dependent only sampling methods. Results show that the proposed strategy outperforms the input-dependent only methods and has no worse performance than the output-dependent only methods in convergence rate and computational stability in most circumstances. The proposed strategy is further applied to two engineering cases for global sensitivity analysis of structural static and dynamic properties. It is illustrated that with automatically collected samples and observations, the PCE models can be obtained with desired accuracy, and the sensitivity analysis can be pursued with low computational cost and high precision.},

  abstract     = {The frequency sweep analysis is indispensable for the performance prediction and optimization design of structural–acoustic interaction problems. The coupled finite element and boundary element (FE–BE) method has been widely used to perform such simulations. However, the straightforward solution of the resulting hybrid model for a large number of frequencies is computationally prohibitive due to the unfavorable properties of involved matrices, e.g. large-scale, non-symmetric and especially frequency-dependent. In order to ease this challenge, a three-step structure-preserving model order reduction method is presented, which is based on an offline-online computing framework. As a first step, the second-order Arnoldi process is used to speed up calculations of the sparse structural part of the strongly coupled system. In a second step, the low-dimensional approximations of the FE unknown variables are eliminated from the global system of equations and after that the remaining dense BE degrees of freedom are reduced by application of the standard Arnoldi-based Krylov subspace algorithm. A transformation technique based on Taylor’s theorem is incorporated to decouple the frequency from the Green’s function and a column-by-column low-memory projection is further sought to favor the overall storage requirements. In the last step, a robust reduced order model can be quickly retrieved by simple algebraic manipulations , which allows a direct solver without any costly matrix operation to be used for the online sweeps, requiring only a very small fraction of the total CPU runtime. Two numerical cases are investigated to highlight the potential of the proposed approach in multi-frequency applications.},

  abstract     = {Various phenomena in the subsurface are characterised by the interplay between deforming structures such as fractures and coupled thermal, hydraulic and mechanical processes. Simulation of subsurface dynamics can provide valuable phenomenological understanding, but requires models which faithfully represent the dynamics involved; these models therefore are themselves highly complex. This paper presents a mixed-dimensional thermo-hydro-mechanical model designed to capture the process–structure interplay using a discrete–fracture–matrix framework. It incorporates tightly coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical processes based on balance laws for momentum, mass and energy in subdomains representing the matrix and the lower-dimensional fractures and fracture intersections. The deformation of explicitly represented fractures is modelled by contact mechanics relations and a Coulomb friction law, with a novel formulation consistently integrating fracture dilation in the governing equations. The model is discretised using multi-point finite volume methods for the balance equations and a semismooth Newton scheme for the contact conditions and is implemented in the open-source fracture simulation toolbox PorePy. Finally, simulation studies demonstrate the model’s convergence, investigate process–structure coupling effects, explore different fracture dilation models and show an application of the model to stimulation and long-term cooling of a three-dimensional geothermal reservoir.},

With great computational stability and preserved convexity features, the Twin Extended Support Vector Regression (T-X-SVR) method is adopted to imitate the underpinned and sophisticated constitutive relationship between the systematic inputs and outcomes in real-world applications. Various numerical simulations can be implemented on the virtual model with greatly reduced computational costs. The multi-type information from heterogeneous sources and multifarious engineering applications are supported by the proposed framework. For the virtual model aided numerical analysis with the multi-type information, fuzzy-valued probabilistic distributional characteristics of the bounds of the concerned structural responses are estimated. The capability of the modularity feature of the virtual model improves the operational flexibility which makes the implementation of such advance technique more user friendly. To demonstrate the applicability and computational efficiency of the proposed framework, three practical engineering stimulated problems (i.e., the mechanical dynamic system, multiphysics with heat transfer and gas flow interaction, and the expansion process of a biomedical stent with both material and geometry nonlinearities), involving multi-type information (i.e., random parameters and fuzzy sets), are fully investigated through the proposed virtual model architecture framework.},

  abstract     = {A data-driven closure modeling based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) temporal modes is used to obtain stable and accurate reduced order models (ROMs) of unsteady compressible flows . Model reduction is obtained via Galerkin and Petrov–Galerkin projection of the non-conservative compressible Navier–Stokes equations. The latter approach is implemented using the least-squares Petrov–Galerkin (LSPG) technique and the present methodology allows pre-computation (i.e., not requiring hyper-reduction) of both Galerkin and LSPG coefficients. Closure is performed by adding linear and non-linear coefficients to the original ROMs and minimizing the error with respect to the POD temporal modes. In order to further reduce the computational cost of the ROMs, an accelerated greedy missing point estimation (MPE) hyper-reduction method is employed. A canonical compressible cylinder flow is first analyzed and serves as a benchmark. The second problem studied consists of the turbulent flow over a plunging airfoil undergoing deep dynamic stall. For both cases, regularization is required and an iterative Tikhonov methodology is proposed. For the first case, linear and non-linear closure coefficients are both low in intrusiveness, capable of providing results in excellent agreement with the full order model. Regularization of calibrated models is also straightforward for this case. On the other hand, the dynamic stall flow is significantly more challenging, specially when only linear coefficients are used. Results show that non-linear calibration coefficients outperform their linear counterparts when a POD basis with fewer modes is used in the reconstruction. However, determining a correct level of regularization is more complicated with non-linear coefficients. Hyper-reduced models show good results when combined with non-linear calibration and an appropriate sized POD basis.},

We develop a robust and efficient numerical algorithm for hydraulic phase-field fracture toward transversely isotropic and orthotropy anisotropic fracture. In the fluid-driven coupled problem, three primary fields for pressure, displacements, and the crack phase-field are solved while direction-dependent responses (due to the preferred fiber orientation) are enforced via penalty-like parameters. A new crack driving state function is introduced by avoiding the compressible part of anisotropic energy to be degraded. Next, we use a successful extension of the anisotropic hydraulic phase-field fracture as a departure point for Bayesian inversion to estimate material parameters. To this end, we employ the delayed rejection adaptive Metropolis–Hastings (DRAM) algorithm to identify the parameters. The focus is on uncertainties arising from different variables, including elasticity modulus, Biot’s coefficient, Biot’s modulus, dynamic fluid viscosity and Griffith’s energy release rate in the case of the isotopic hydraulic fracture while in the anisotropic setting, we will have additional penalty-like parameters to be identified. Several numerical examples substantiate our algorithmic developments.},

However, the conventional MPM cannot deal with cracks directly because of the continuous nodal velocity field . Therefore, in this study, the conventional MPM is improved using three new algorithms to simulate the propagation of multiple branched cracks. The first proposed algorithm is the phantom node method using a particle cutting technique, which allows discontinuity of the velocity field around arbitrary cracks, and the second one is the multi-crack contact algorithm to deal with the contact problem between multiple objects cut by multiple cracks, avoiding crack penetration. The last one is particle interaction integral method based on classical fracture mechanics to get the dynamic stress intensity factors (DSIF) and realize the crack propagation . And all algorithms are validated by comparing with the extended finite element method . Subsequently, uniaxial compression tests of three rock samples with different pre-existing cracks are simulated using the extended MPM. Three types of crack coalescence are found, and the simulated results agree with the previous experimental results, which demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed extended MPM for simulating the propagation of multiple branched cracks.},

This paper aims to develop a new multi-material topology optimization algorithm and propose the guidelines for the selection of candidate materials from the database. The multi-material design variables and their inequality relationship are built on volume fractions of multiple materials within each element. The multi-material design variables are relaxed and multiple floating projection constraints simulate their discrete constraints by pushing design variables towards 0 or 1. Meanwhile, their inequality relationship is enforced by their variation limits. The proposed multi-material topology optimization algorithm can be applied to the compliance minimization problem constrained by a single mass or multiple volumes, as demonstrated in numerical examples . This paper mainly focuses on a single mass constraint , and 2D and 3D numerical examples systematically demonstrate that an optimized design under a mass constraint achieves a lower compliance when more materials appear in the final design simultaneously. Furthermore, we establish an approach to predict the inclusion or exclusion of a material from the final design, and propose the conditions for the co-existence of candidate materials, which guide users to select candidate materials from the database.},

  abstract     = {The presence of natural fractures in a porous medium strongly influences the fluid flow path. The complex geometric characteristics of the fracture network create preferential channels that change the permeability of the medium. In this context, this paper presents a novel discrete fracture model to address the hydrodynamic behavior of naturally fractured porous media by using a coupling scheme in which the initially independent standard finite element meshes of porous rock and fractures are coupled via coupling finite elements to enforce the continuity of the pressure field between the meshes through a penalty parameter. The main feature of the technique is the capacity to treat problems with non-matching, overlapping and interfacial meshes with no need to add extra degrees of freedom to describe the compatibility between the meshes. In addition, the proposed coupling finite elements also connect non-conforming meshes of fractures, so that their interaction emerges naturally from the coupling scheme. The new theoretical framework and finite element equations are described in detail and 2D and 3D numerical experiments are conducted to validate and verify the technique against results reported in the literature. The obtained results show that the proposed coupling scheme is efficient and able to capture the main phenomena associated with the fluid transport in fractured porous media.},

  abstract     = {Polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) provide an efficient approach to uncertainty quantification (UQ) and have been adapted to diverse applications across the spectrum of science and engineering. For situations involving large stochastic parameterizations, the curse of dimensionality renders PCE-based methods computationally prohibitive. A basis adaptation approach for PCE was proposed by Tipireddy and Ghanem (2014) which transforms the input random variables through an isometry such that sufficient probabilistic characterization of specific quantities of interest (QoI) is concentrated in an algebraic manifold embedded in the linear span of the dominant transformed variables. While quite versatile, that original version of the PCE basis adaptation exhibited slow convergence for a number of problems of practical significance. In the present paper, we propose two novel methods to accelerate the convergence of the original basis adaptation approach, thus expanding its reach while also providing insight into its performance. In the first method, information gained from a pilot PCE representation is used to correct the mean and Gaussian coefficients in the adapted space. By taking advantages of probabilistic information in higher dimensional adaptation gleaned from an initial adaptation, the second method updates the rotation matrix used to identify the dominant transformed variables. In this manner, the new rotation matrix concentrates even more probabilistic information in its first few dimensions. These two method can be combined to achieve even better performance, the combined method is referred to as sequentially optimized adaptation method. The methods are demonstrated on an analytical test function and a model of a space structure with several sub-components and a non-smooth quantity of interest representing the maximum acceleration over time. Both methods achieve accelerated convergence of the basis adaptation approach with negligible additional costs.},

The static interval-set model is first utilized to quantify multi-source uncertainty inputs and the transient interval-process model is then established to characterize unknown-but-bounded response results, which can be readily solved through the proposed interval-process collocation approach combined with a classical Newmark difference scheme. Different from the traditional deterministic design framework, the present DRBTO scheme will directly consider new reliability constraints, for which the non-probabilistic time-variant reliability (NTR) index is mathematically deduced using the first-passage principle.

The technique enables one-by-one extension of an experimental design while trying to obtain an optimal sample at each stage of the adaptive sequential surrogate model construction process . The proposed sequential sampling strategy selects from a pool of candidate points by trying to cover the design domain proportionally to their local variance contribution. The proposed criterion for the sample selection balances both exploitation of the surrogate model and exploration of the design domain. The adaptive sequential sampling technique can be used in tandem with any user-defined sampling method, and here was coupled with commonly used Latin Hypercube Sampling and advanced Coherence D-optimal sampling in order to present its general performance. The obtained numerical results confirm its superiority over standard non-sequential approaches in terms of surrogate model accuracy and estimation of the output variance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a new posteriori method to generate high order curved meshes directly from linear meshes through a recently developed poly-spline isogeometric (IGA) method. Given an input structured or unstructured linear quadrilateral or hexahedral mesh, our method constructs quadratic poly-spline IGA bases for each element and ensures continuity and smoothness across neighboring elements. With these smooth IGA bases, each element can be sampled into a high order element of arbitrary order while maintaining consistently continuous and smooth interfaces between elements. Several fitting algorithms are developed to adjust the IGA control points to ensure the final mesh interpolates or approximates the initial boundary closely. Our method requires no CAD geometry of the initial mesh and guarantee C 1 C1 smoothness in regular regions and C 0 C0 continuity across interfaces of spline-incompatible elements. The method is compared with an elastic analogy based approach and is shown to be superior in terms of computational performance and overall mesh quality and smoothness. The current method can also be extended for higher order IGA basis construction and smooth refinement of meshes that are important for high order physics simulations.},

  abstract     = {We present a new Lagrangian modal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) hydrodynamic method that supports a dynamic dislocation based crystal plasticity model for simulating the mechanical behavior of crystallographic materials, both single crystal and polycrystalline , under dynamic conditions. A modal DG approach is used to evolve fields relevant to conservation laws . These fields are approximated by Taylor series polynomials of varying degree. These polynomials describe macro-scale hydrodynamic behavior while their evolution is determined by evaluating the dynamic crystal plasticity model at material points within the element. The dynamic crystal plasticity model is sensitive to the time increment size, with too large of time increments leading to instability in the model. To mitigate this, the temporal evolution of the dynamic crystal plasticity model is achieved with the combination of a sub-incrementing scheme with Heun’s third-order time integration scheme, which is also used to temporally evolve the governing equations. The implementation of the dynamic crystal plasticity model within the DG framework is tested using a 2D approximation of the Taylor impact test with a single crystal material , using quadratic elements that have faces that can bend. In addition to the standard continuous material modeling, we propose a new simulation method that would represent the heterogeneous behavior of polycrystalline microstructures within an element by varying the position and material properties of the material points within the element. This method is demonstrated using random orientation distributions on materials points that are arranged in both structured and random configurations.},

This can be associated to several aspects such as the solution of large algebraic systems, the governing equations nonlinearities and numerical instabilities, computational limitations, among others. This work focuses on providing low cost solution for incompressible flows with low Reynolds numbers by means of a PGD reduced basis built under a space–time decomposition employing a mixed-stabilized approach for two-dimensional flows. The methodology is evaluated with a set of numerical examples, confirming its robustness and precision, as well as a reduction in the number of linear systems to be solved and the run time compared to the standard stabilized finite element approach.},

The natural heat convection problems of the square and cubic cavities are solved up to a Rayleigh number of 1 0 10 1010 and 3 . 3 × 1 0 7 3.3×107 , respectively.

In the context of master-to-master contact, the present work proposes a new formulation for solving the local contact problem between convex particles whose boundary is defined by non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). The proposed formulation is based on concepts employed in computer graphics : Minkowski sum , configuration space obstacle (CSO) and support mapping. With that, contact can be addressed through an optimization scheme. An objective function is based on a constrained distance between the particles. In case of contact, the maximum penetration between particles is related to the minimum of the objective function. Different examples underline the robustness of the formulation, which can handle contact between convex particles with general shapes.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present a Parametric Deep Energy Method (P-DEM) for elasticity problems accounting for strain gradient effects. The approach is based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the solution of the underlying potential energy. Therefore, a cost function related to the potential energy is subsequently minimized. P-DEM does not need any classical discretization and requires only a definition of the potential energy, which simplifies the implementation. Instead of training the model in the physical space, we define a parametric/reference space similar to isoparametric finite elements, which is in our example a unit square. The inputs are naturally normalized preventing the vanishing gradient problem and leading to much faster convergence compared to the original DEM. Forward–backward mapping is established by means of NURBS basis functions. Another advantage of this approach is that Gauss quadrature can be employed to approximate the total potential energy, which is the loss function calculated in the parametric domain. Backpropagation available in PyTorch with automatic differentiation is performed to calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases. Once the network is trained, a numerical solution can be obtained in the reference domain and then is mapped back to the physical domain. The performance of the method is demonstrated through various numerical benchmark problems in elasticity and compared to analytical solutions. We also consider strain gradient elasticity, which poses challenges to conventional finite elements due to the requirement for C 1 C1 continuity.},

The adjoint method is used to derive the sensitivities of the additive manufacturing constraints. The method is demonstrated with the 2D and 3D optimization of a bracket. Next to global topological changes, the obtained designs show features that are aimed at facilitating the printing process.

To this end, the suitable weak formulation of the underlying nonlinear eigenvalue problem is derived and additionally cast in a radial form.

  abstract     = {Computer models of cardiac electro-mechanics (EM) show promise as an effective means for the quantitative analysis of clinical data and, potentially, for predicting therapeutic responses. To realize such advanced applications methodological key challenges must be addressed. Enhanced computational efficiency and robustness is crucial to facilitate, within tractable time frames, model personalization, the simulation of prolonged observation periods under a broad range of conditions, and physiological completeness encompassing therapy-relevant mechanisms is needed to endow models with predictive capabilities beyond the mere replication of observations. Here, we introduce a universal feature-complete cardiac EM modeling framework that builds on a flexible method for coupling a 3D model of bi-ventricular EM to the physiologically comprehensive 0D CircAdapt model representing atrial mechanics and closed-loop circulation. A detailed mathematical description is given and efficiency, robustness, and accuracy of numerical scheme and solver implementation are evaluated. After parameterization and stabilization of the coupled 3D–0D model to a limit cycle under baseline conditions, the model’s ability to replicate physiological behaviors is demonstrated, by simulating the transient response to alterations in loading conditions and contractility, as induced by experimental protocols used for assessing systolic and diastolic ventricular properties. Mechanistic completeness and computational efficiency of this novel model render advanced applications geared towards predicting acute outcomes of EM therapies feasible.},

  abstract     = {Variational phase-field methods have been shown powerful for the modeling of complex crack propagation without a priori knowledge of the crack path or ad hoc criteria. However, phase-field models suffer from their energy functional being non-linear and non-convex, while requiring a very fine mesh to capture the damage gradient. This implies a high computational cost, limiting concrete engineering applications of the method. In this work, we propose an efficient and robust fully monolithic solver for phase-field fracture using a modified Newton method with inertia correction and an energy line-search. To illustrate the gains in efficiency obtained with our approach, we compare it to two popular methods for phase-field fracture, namely the alternating minimization and the quasi-monolithic schemes. To facilitate the evaluation of the time step dependent quasi-monolithic scheme, we couple the latter with an extrapolation correction loop controlled by a damage-based criterion. Finally, we show through four benchmark tests that the modified Newton method we propose is straightforward, robust, and leads to identical solutions, while offering a reduction in computation time by factors of up to 12 and 6 when compared to the alternating minimization and quasi-monolithic schemes.},

  abstract     = {We show that for the simulation of crack propagation in quasi-brittle, two-dimensional solids, very good results can be obtained with an embedded strong discontinuity quadrilateral finite element that has incompatible modes. Even more importantly, we demonstrate that these results can be obtained without using a crack tracking algorithm. Therefore, the simulation of crack patterns with several cracks, including branching, becomes possible. The avoidance of a tracking algorithm is mainly enabled by the application of a novel, local (Gauss-point based) criterion for crack nucleation, which determines the time of embedding the localisation line as well as its position and orientation. We treat the crack evolution in terms of a thermodynamical framework, with softening variables describing internal dissipative mechanisms of material degradation . As presented by numerical examples , many elements in the mesh may develop a crack, but only some of them actually open and/or slide, dissipate fracture energy , and eventually form the crack pattern. The novel approach has been implemented for statics and dynamics, and the results of computed difficult examples (including Kalthoff’s test) illustrate its very satisfying performance. It effectively overcomes unfavourable restrictions of the standard embedded strong discontinuity formulations, namely the simulation of the propagation of a single crack only. Moreover, it is computationally fast and straightforward to implement. Our numerical solutions match the results of experimental tests and previously reported numerical results in terms of crack pattern, dissipated fracture energy, and load–displacement curve.},

This model is called the nonlocal Allen–Cahn-Extended-Darcy (NACED) model. In the incompressible and/or the inertialess limit, it reduces to two limiting models that we focus on in this study: the incompressible, nonlocal Allen–Cahn-Extended-Darcy (NACED) model and nonlocal Allen–Cahn–Darcy (NACD) model, respectively. The weakly compressible model provides a pathway for us to develop thermodynamically consistent numerical algorithms for the incompressible models. Guided by the energy variational formulation of the models, we use the energy quadratization method in time and finite difference method in space on staggered grids to derive second-order, linear, coupled and decoupled, energy dissipation rate preserving schemes for the incompressible models. The decoupled schemes for NACED model are obtained by exploiting the intrinsic relation between the incompressible and weakly compressible model. We then prove that the linear systems resulted from the linear schemes are uniquely solvable. Mesh refinement tests are conducted to confirm the convergence rates and benchmark examples of binary fluid flow motion in porous media with and without gravity are presented to showcase the schemes’ accuracy and usefulness.},

Using duality theory, the computation of bounds is reduced to finding independent potential and equilibrated flux reconstructions. A generalization of this result is also introduced allowing to derive alternative guaranteed bounds from nearly-arbitrary H ( div ; Ω ) H(div;Ω) flux reconstructions (only zero-order equilibration is required). This approach is applicable to any numerical method used to compute the solution. In this work, the proposed approach is applied to derive bounds for the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method. An attractive feature of the proposed approach is that superconvergence on the bound gap is achieved, yielding accurate bounds even for very coarse meshes.

  abstract     = {Bayesian computation plays an important role in modern machine learning and statistics to reason about uncertainty. A key computational challenge in Bayesian inference is to develop efficient techniques to approximate, or draw samples from posterior distributions. Stein variational gradient decent (SVGD) has been shown to be a powerful approximate inference algorithm for this issue. However, the vanilla SVGD requires calculating the gradient of the target density and cannot be applied when the gradient is unavailable or too expensive to evaluate. In this paper we explore one way to address this challenge by the construction of a local surrogate for the target distribution in which the gradient can be obtained in a much more computationally feasible manner. More specifically, we approximate the forward model using a deep neural network (DNN) which is trained on a carefully chosen training set, which also determines the quality of the surrogate. To this end, we propose a general adaptation procedure to refine the local approximation online without destroying the convergence of the resulting SVGD. This significantly reduces the computational cost of SVGD and leads to a suite of algorithms that are straightforward to implement. The new algorithm is illustrated on a set of challenging Bayesian inverse problems, and numerical experiments demonstrate a clear improvement in performance and applicability of standard SVGD.},

Such feature is of special interest to describe the anisotropic fracture behavior in layered 3D printed materials. The present model introduces two phase field variables , one bulk fracture damage and one micro interfacial damage variables, describing two different micro damage mechanisms. Finally, we have proposed an original methodology to identify the macroscopic strain density as a function of the micro interfacial damage variable using numerical homogenization on Representative Volume Elements . Numerical investigations show that the present model is convergent with respect to mesh refinement, and allows to describe complex crack initiation and propagation in layered elastoplastic structures.

Our python software toolbox utilises the heterogeneous nature of OpenCL so that it can be executed on any platform with CPU or GPU cores. We illustrate the package use through a range of industrially motivated examples, which should enable other researchers to build on and extend the solver for use in their own applications. Step improvements in execution speed and functionality over existing techniques are presented. A comparison between this solver and an existing OpenCL implementation in the literature is presented, tested on benchmarks with hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of nodes. We demonstrate the scalability of the solver on the GeForce RTX 2080 TiGPU from NVIDIA, and the memory-bound limitations are analysed. In all test cases, the implementation is between 1.4 and 10.0 times faster than a similar existing GPU implementation in the literature. In particular, this improvement has been achieved by utilising local memory on the GPU.},

We present a hybrid energy-based approach based on a potential of mean force formulation of lattice element method for reliable and efficient modeling of fracture and crack propagation in heterogeneous materials. The proposed framework rests on direct application of the Griffith fracture criteria and removes material points to create fracture surfaces in energetically favorable directions. Computational efficiency is achieved through a probing of high energy bonds and quasi-static relaxation leading to near global imposition of the energy-based criteria for crack path resolution. We validate the proposed hybrid approach against results in literature and use it to examine fracture response of defective and layered materials. For layered materials with fracture energy heterogeneity, the effective toughness is shown to be the maximum of fracture energies of layers irrespective of their volume fraction and the direction of crack propagation. For layered materials with elastic modulus heterogeneity, the maximum energy release rate occurs when the crack approaches the compliant-stiff interface from within the compliant phase. We examine the scaling of fracture toughness with modulus contrast, the link to volume fraction of the layers and the relationship between toughness anisotropy and the gradient of elastic modulus heterogeneity, offering insights with potential to inform the design of materials for fracture.},

The combination of deep learning and topology optimization has become one of the hottest research fields at the moment. Different from most existing work, this paper conducts an in-depth study on the method of directly using neural networks (NN) to carry out topology optimization. Inspired by the idea from the field of “Inverting Representation of Image” and “Physics-Informed Neural Network”, a topology optimization via neural reparameterization framework (TONR) that can solve various topology optimization problems is formed. The core idea of TONR is Reparameterization , which means the update of the design variables (pseudo-density) in the conventional topology optimization method is transformed into the update of the NN’s parameters. The sensitivity analysis in the conventional topology optimization method is realized by automatic differentiation technology. With the update of NN’s parameters, the density field is optimized. Some strategies for dealing with design constraints, determining NN’s initial parameters, and accelerating training are proposed in the paper. In addition, the solution of the multi-constrained topology optimization problem is also embedded in the TONR framework. Numerical examples show that TONR can stably obtain optimized structures for different optimization problems, including the stress-constrained problem, structural natural frequency optimization problems, compliant mechanism design problems, heat conduction system design problems, and the optimization problem of hyperelastic structures. Compared with the existing methods that combine deep learning with topology optimization, TONR does not need to construct a dataset in advance and does not suffer from structural disconnection. The structures obtained by TONR can be comparable to the conventional methods.},

In this scheme, Roe’s approximate Riemann solver cooperated with a novel limiter is embedded into the SPH governing equations to capture shocks. This limiter is simple and effective to control numerical dissipations, and the use of this limiter eliminates the tunable artificial viscosity as required by the conventional SPH. Additionally, to restore the accuracy limited by heterogeneous particle distribution that is usually encountered in the simulation of strongly-compressible flows, the gradient operator in the continuity equation is corrected by a renormalization procedure. Last but not least, for initial particle distribution, unlike the equal mass particle distribution commonly used in compressible SPH simulations, the equal spacing particle distribution is adopted in this scheme, which makes it much easier to model multidimensional problems. The present scheme has been verified by a set of benchmark tests involving contact discontinuities, extreme shock waves and strong rarefaction waves, some of which are firstly simulated by the SPH method.},

  abstract     = {Modern machine learning (ML) techniques, in conjunction with simulation-based methods, present remarkable potential for various scientific and engineering applications . Within the materials science field, these data-based methods can be used to build efficient structure–property linkages that can be further integrated within multi-scale simulations, or guide experiments in a materials discovery setting. However, a critical shortcoming of state-of-the-art ML techniques is their lack of reliable uncertainty/error estimates, which severely limits their use for materials or other engineering applications where data is often scarce and uncertainties are substantial. This paper presents methods for Bayesian learning of neural networks (NN) that allow consideration of both aleatoric uncertainties that account for the inherent stochasticity of the data-generating process, and epistemic uncertainties , which arise from consideration of limited amounts of data. In particular, algorithms based on approximate variational inference and (pseudo-)Bayesian model averaging achieve an appropriate trade-off between accuracy of the uncertainty estimates and accessible computational cost. The performance of these algorithms is first presented on simple 1D examples to illustrate their behavior in both extrapolation and interpolation settings. The approach is then applied for the prediction of homogenized and localized properties of a composite material. In this setting, data is generated from a finite element model, which permits a study of the behavior of the probabilistic learning algorithms under various amounts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties .},

For purposes of comparison, we specifically consider the standard test case of a center-crack panel loaded in biaxial tension and assess the convergence of the energy error as the length scale parameter and mesh size tend to zero simultaneously. The panel is discretized by means of a regular mesh consisting of standard bilinear or Q Q 1 elements. The exact stresses from the known analytical linear elastic solution are applied to the boundary. All element integrals over the interior and the boundary of the domain are evaluated exactly using the symbolic computation program Mathematica. When the EE inelastic energy is enhanced by means of Richardson extrapolation , EE is found to converge at twice the rate of PF and to exhibit much better accuracy. In addition, EE affords a one-order-of-magnitude computational speed-up over PF.},

  abstract     = {This study develops a new procedure for solving cohesive and frictional crack growth problems in quasi-brittle materials such as concrete using the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM). In this procedure, the cohesive and contact tractions near the crack-tip region are modelled as linearised​ tractions on the ‘sidefaces’ of the cracked subdomains . The tractions away from the crack-tip region are implemented by utilising zero-thickness interface elements. A novel scheme is proposed to estimate the linearised sideface tractions in the cracked subdomain. The scheme utilises stress intensity factors (SIFs) iteratively within the load-step such that the crack-tip singularities vanish when the equilibrium position is reached. This leads to the stress fields in the crack-tip region being accurately captured without mesh refinement. A stress-based criterion is used to determine the crack propagation condition and direction, which requires minimal computational effort as the stresses in the crack-tip region are directly extracted from the semi-analytical formulation of SBFEM. The proposed method is versatile as it can solve both the cohesive and frictional crack growth problems. The efficacy of the method is shown through benchmark examples and practical applications.},

  abstract     = {This contribution presents a hierarchical multigrid approach for the solution of large-scale finite cell problems on both uniform grids and multi-level h p hp -discretizations. The proposed scheme takes advantage of the hierarchical basis functions utilized in the finite cell method and the multi-level h p hp -method, which is attributed to the use of high-order integrated Legendre basis functions and overlay meshes, to yield a simple and elegant multigrid scheme . This simplicity is reflected in the fact that transitioning between multigrid levels only involves the inclusion or exclusion of specific basis functions. All restriction and prolongation operators, therefore, reduce to binary matrices that do not need to be explicitly assembled or applied, saving computational time and memory. Elementwise and patchwise additive Schwarz smoothing techniques are used to mitigate the influence of the cut cells on the conditioning of the linear systems , while maintaining the parallelizability of the solver. The effectiveness of the scheme is numerically verified in various examples and convergence rates that are independent of the cut configuration, mesh size , refinement level and, in certain scenarios, even the polynomial order are shown. A series of numerical examples demonstrate the applicability of the scheme for solving large immersed systems with multiple millions and even billions of unknowns on massively parallel machines.},

Then, the circle-growing technique and the least squares method are combined to establish the Arcs-based particle that can represent the whole particle outline with multi-connected inward and outward arcs. Next, a new algorithm for efficient overlapping detection and precise contact resolution is developed for the Arcs-based particles. Finally, the ArcDEM is developed as a simulation tool with several implemented contact force laws and particle motions solved by an explicit time integration. To validate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed ArcDEM, several numerical examples are performed, including (1) random allocation of non-overlapping irregular particles, (2) random packing of super-elliptical particles of different aspect ratios and blockiness, and (3) simulation of repose angle and biaxial compression tests of realistic rock particles with various roundness .

  abstract     = {As a nonlocal extension of continuum mechanics, peridynamics has been widely and effectively applied in different fields where discontinuities in the field variables arise from an initially continuous body. An important component of the constitutive model in peridynamics is the influence function which weights the contribution of all the interactions over a nonlocal region surrounding a point of interest. Recent work has shown that in solid mechanics the influence function has a strong relationship with the heterogeneity of a material’s micro-structure. However, determining an accurate influence function analytically from a given micro-structure typically requires lengthy derivations and complex mathematical models. To avoid these complexities, the goal of this paper is to develop a data-driven regression algorithm to find the optimal bond-based peridynamic model to describe the macro-scale deformation of linear elastic medium with periodic heterogeneity. We generate macro-scale deformation training data by averaging over periodic micro-structure unit cells and add a physical energy constraint representing the homogenized elastic modulus of the micro-structure to the regression algorithm. We demonstrate this scheme for examples of one- and two-dimensional linear elastodynamics and show that the energy constraint improves the accuracy of the resulting peridynamic model.},

  abstract     = {Projection-based reduced-order models (PROMs) restrict the full-order model (FOM) to a low-dimensional subspace. Space–time PROMs in particular restrict the FOM to a temporally space–time trial subspace, and compute approximate solutions through a residual orthogonalization or minimization process. One such technique of interest is the space–time least-squares Petrov–Galerkin method (ST-LSPG), which reduces both the spatial and temporal dimensions. However, ST-LSPG is computationally expensive, because it requires solving a dense space–time system with a space–time basis that is calculated over the entire global time domain, which can be unfeasible for large-scale applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents the windowed space–time least-squares Petrov–Galerkin method (WST-LSPG) for model reduction of nonlinear parameterized dynamical systems. The proposed WST-LSPG approach addresses the aforementioned challenges by (1) dividing the time simulation into windows, (2) devising a unique low-dimensional high-fidelity space–time trial subspace for each window, and (3) minimizing the discrete-in-time space–time residual of the dynamical system over each window. In this formulation, the problem confines coupling within each window, but solves space–time residual minimization problems sequentially across the windows. WST-LSPG is equipped with hyper-reduction techniques to further reduce the computational cost. Numerical experiments for the one-dimensional Burgers’ equation and the two-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations for flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil demonstrate that WST-LSPG is superior to ST-LSPG in terms of accuracy and computational gain by as much as 99%.},

The quest for predictive nonlocal mechanical theories with well-defined internal length scales has been ongoing for more than a century since the seminal work of the Cosserats. We present here a novel framework for the nonlocal analysis of material behavior, which bypasses the need to define any internal length scale. This is achieved by extending the Data-Driven paradigm in mechanics, originally introduced for simple continua, into generalized continua. The problem is formulated directly on a material data set, comprised of higher-order kinematics and their conjugate kinetics, which are identified from experiments or inferred from lower scale computations. The case of a micropolar continuum is used as a vehicle to introduce the framework, which may also be adapted to strain-gradient and micromorphic media. Two applications are presented: a micropolar elastic plate with a hole, which is used to demonstrate the convergence properties of the method, and the shear banding problem of a triaxially compressed sample of quartz sand, which is used to demonstrate the applicability of the method in the case of complex history-dependent material behavior.},

A convolutional neural network architecture with dropout layers is first trained for vessel lumen segmentation using a regression approach, to enable Bayesian estimation of vessel lumen surfaces. This network is then integrated into a path-planning patient-specific modeling pipeline to generate families of cardiovascular models. We demonstrate our approach by quantifying the effect of geometric uncertainty on the hemodynamics for three patient-specific anatomies, an aorto-iliac bifurcation, an abdominal aortic aneurysm and a sub-model of the left coronary arteries. A key innovation introduced in the proposed approach is the ability to learn geometric uncertainty directly from training data. The results show how geometric uncertainty produces coefficients of variation comparable to or larger than other sources of uncertainty for wall shear stress and velocity magnitude, but has limited impact on pressure. Specifically, this is true for anatomies characterized by small vessel sizes, and for local vessel lesions seen infrequently during network training.},

The velocity, pressure, and relative temperature fields are additively decomposed into overlapping scales which leads to a set of coupled mixed-field sub-problems for the coarse- and the fine-scales. In the hierarchical application of the VMS method, the fine-scale velocity and relative temperature fields are further decomposed, leading to a nested system of two-way coupled fine-scale level-I and level-II variational subproblems. A direct application of bubble functions approach to the fine-scale variational equations helps derive fine-scale models that are nonlinear and time dependent. Embedding the derived model from the level-II variational equation in the level-I variational equation helps stabilize the convection-dominated mixed-field thermodynamic subproblem. Locally resolving the unconstrained level-I variational equation yields the residual-based turbulence model which is a function of the residual of the Euler–Lagrange equations of the conservation of momentum, mass, and energy. The derived model accommodates forward- and back-scatter of energy and entropy and embeds sub-grid scale physics in the computable scales of the problem. The steps of the derivation show that it is essential to apply the concept of scale separation systematically to the coupled system of equations and it is critical to preserve the coupling between flow and thermal phases in the fine-scale variational equations. The method has been implemented with hexahedral and tetrahedral elements with equal order interpolations for the velocity, pressure, and temperature fields. Several canonical flow cases are presented that include Rayleigh–Bénard instability, Rayleigh–Taylor instability, and turbulent plane Couette flow with stable stratification.},

The surface tension calculation is of importance for properly capturing free surface flows, and it is the case for particle methods. Since the presented model is a potential-based method, complex approximation for normal vector and curvature of the surface is not needed. The surface potential is formulated in combination with cohesive pressure potential and density gradient potential, and the interaction force with respect to surface tension is derived from the potential. It works mainly on the surface, and it also substitutes pressure force when the fluid is exposed on negative pressure. In addition, wettability is expressed by introducing an interaction ratio between fluid and wall, and the relation between the ratio and the contact angle is theoretically clarified. The surface tension and wettability models were verified via Laplace pressure calculation, droplet oscillation calculation, contact angle calculation, liquid bridge calculation and Plateau–Rayleigh instability calculation.},

Uncertainty quantification is achieved by an efficient surrogate model based on pseudospectral polynomial chaos expansion and artificial neural networks. An artificial neural network is trained on synthetic binary voxelized unit cells of composite materials with uncertain three dimensional microstructures, uncertain linear elastic material parameters and different loading directions. The prediction goals of the artificial neural network are the corresponding effective components of the elasticity tensor, where the labels for training are generated via a fast Fourier transform based numerical homogenization method. The trained artificial neural network is then used as a deterministic solver for a pseudospectral polynomial chaos expansion based surrogate model to achieve the corresponding statistics of the effective properties. Three numerical examples deal with the comparison of the presented method to the literature as well as the application to different microstructures.

As a first attempt to develop a comprehensive CPLPM framework, constitutive relations based on the Schmid’s law and rate-dependent crystal plasticity for infinitesimal deformations are formulated for single crystals of face-centered and body-centered cubic lattice structures. Slip-system-dependent plastic deformation is automatically handled using the underlying crystal topology incorporated in LPM. Numerical solution algorithms for global iteration and plasticity state variables update are discussed in detail. The validity and prediction accuracy of CPLPM are established using several numerical examples , e.g., perfectly plastic deformation of single crystals, plastic slip near crack tip, and the calibration and prediction of experimental results.

The main idea is to incorporate the proposed mathematical model , which calculates the exact deformation of the mesh elements, into the variational phase-field model to simulate the thermal fracture behavior in glass panes in an effective manner. The developed model improves upon previous attempts to predict thermal cracking in the following ways: (1) in a major departure from the classical phase-field simulation of thermomechanical fracture, crack evolution can be predicted using only temperature distributions ; the phase-field formulations are kept fixed to overcome mesh dependency and convergency ; (2) the new modeling framework directly transforms temperature variations into thermal strains (rate of loading) using fewer mesh elements and a larger time step, thus substantially reducing the computational effort ; and (3) the proposed model can simultaneously predict multiple cracks distributed in any arbitrary space in the glass panes more realistically than the previous numerical models, regardless of glass pane type and size, fixation method, and thermal loading variation. The proposed coupling model is validated through comparisons against experimental observations and ANSYS simulations. Moreover, the validated model is used to examine for the first time the effect of real engineering influential conditions, namely the heating rate , glass pane size ratio under non-uniform thermal loading, and glass pane fixation with a frame on three sides, on thermal cracking behavior .},

This treatment allows us to replicate the frictional heating of the evolving interfaces and predict the energy dissipation more precisely in the fragmentation process. By storing the temperature at material points, the resultant MPM model captures the thermal advection–diffusion in a Lagrangian frame during the fragmentation, which in return affects the structural heating and dissipation across the frictional interfaces. The resultant model is capable of replicating the crack growth and fragmentation without requiring dynamic adaptation of data structures or insertion of interface elements. A staggered algorithm is adopted to integrate the displacement and temperature sequentially. Numerical experiments are employed to validate the diffusion between the thermal contact, the multi-body contact interactions and demonstrate how these thermo-mechanical processes affect the path-dependent behaviors of the multi-body systems.},

  abstract     = {Cracking in quasi-brittle geomaterials is a complex mechanical phenomenon, driven by various dissipation mechanisms across multiple length scales . While some recent promising works have employed the phase-field method to model the damage and fracture of geomaterials, several open questions still remain. In particular, capturing frictional sliding along the lips of microcracks, incorporating lower scale physics, and calibrating the length scale parameter , are some examples. The present paper addresses these essential problems. By leveraging homogenization-based damage-friction coupling formulations for microcracked solids, the linkage is built between the macroscopic phase-field damage variable and the microcrack density parameter. The phase-field is thus treated not only as an indicator for the location of cracks but also accounts for the density of microcracks. A unified Helmholtz free energy function is then constructed as a sum of the bulk energy ( including elastic strain energy and plastic free energy) and the crack surface energy. Furthermore, a new set of degradation functions for the plastic free energy are provided, and a calibration procedure for the length scale parameter is proposed by reflecting a more realistic description of fracture process zone. In addition, an accelerated staggered iteration algorithm is developed to solve the strongly coupled problem more efficiently. Four numerical examples concerning a system of macroscopic cracks are investigated to illustrate the predictive capability of the proposed model in simulating tensile fracture, fault slippage and shear bands.},

  abstract     = {This work concerns the continuum basis and numerical formulation for deformable materials with viscous dissipative mechanisms. We derive a viscohyperelastic modeling framework based on fundamental thermomechanical principles. Since most large deformation problems exhibit isochoric properties, our modeling work is constructed based on the Gibbs free energy in order to develop a continuum theory using pressure-primitive variables, which is known to be well-behaved in the incompressible limit . A set of general evolution equations for the internal state variables is derived. With that, we focus on a family of free energies that leads to the so-called finite deformation linear model. Our derivation elucidates the origin of the evolution equations of that model, which was originally proposed heuristically and thus lacked formal compatibility with the underlying thermodynamics. In our derivation, the thermodynamic inconsistency is clarified and rectified. A classical model based on the identical polymer chain assumption is revisited and is found to have non-vanishing viscous stresses in the equilibrium limit, which is counter-intuitive in the physical sense. Because of that, we then discuss the relaxation property of the non-equilibrium stress in the thermodynamic equilibrium limit and its implication on the form of free energy. A modified version of the identical polymer chain model is then proposed, with a special case being the model proposed by G. Holzapfel and J. Simo. Based on the consistent modeling framework, a provably energy stable numerical scheme is constructed for incompressible viscohyperelasticity using inf–sup stable elements. In particular, we adopt a suite of smooth generalization of the Taylor–Hood element based on Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) for spatial discretization . The temporal discretization is performed via the generalized- α α scheme. We present a suite of numerical results to corroborate the proposed numerical properties, including the nonlinear stability, robustness under large deformation, and the stress accuracy resolved by the higher-order elements. Additionally, the pathological behavior of the original identical polymer chain model is numerically identified with an unbounded energy decaying. This again underlines the importance of demanding vanishing non-equilibrium stress in the equilibrium limit.},

  abstract     = {Non-probabilistic methods are usually more appropriate and feasible than probabilistic methods to quantify and propagate uncertainty with small samples in many engineering problems. However, some non-probabilistic methods are easily affected by an outlier in uncertainty quantification and only estimate the bounds of output responses in a feasible region in uncertainty propagation. Moreover, some such methods ignore the situation that its sample points have the characteristic of clustering to the center, which significantly affects the accuracy of uncertainty quantification and propagation. In this study, a novel non-probabilistic uncertainty analysis method is proposed to solve the situation and obtain detailed information within the response interval during the process of uncertainty propagation for some problems with small samples. First, an ellipsoid possibility model (EPM) including multiple ellipsoid domains is established using the estimated covariance matrix and predefined scaling rule, which takes into consideration the distribution characteristic of the sample points. The possibilities of all established ellipsoid domains can be calculated by transforming the oblique ellipsoid space into the standard ellipsoid space. Then, two uncertainty propagation approaches based on the established EPM are presented to obtain the interval of an uncertain response and the possibility on all the possible values of the system response, respectively. Finally, the calculation results based on the proposed uncertainty analysis method are in good agreement with those of the MCS in three numerical examples and two engineering applications. The comparison results with three traditional non-probabilistic methods demonstrate that the proposed non-probabilistic uncertainty analysis method is accurate and practical.},

Especially for metal lattices, the variations in the printed geometry cannot be neglected. Therefore, the evaluation of the influence of microstructural variability on their mechanical behavior is crucial for the quality assessment of the produced structures. Commonly, the as-manufactured geometry can be obtained by computed tomography (CT). However, to incorporate all process-induced defects into the numerical analysis is often computationally demanding. Thus, commonly this task is limited to a predefined set of considered variations, such as strut size or strut diameter. In this work, a CT-based binary random field is proposed to generate statistically equivalent geometries of periodic metal lattices. The proposed random field model in combination with the Finite Cell Method (FCM), an immersed boundary method, allows to efficiently evaluate the influence of the underlying microstructure on the variability of the mechanical behavior of AM products. Numerical analysis of two lattices manufactured at different scales shows an excellent agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, it provides a unique insight into the effects of the process on the occurring geometrical variations and final mechanical behavior.},

  abstract     = {Damage models have been successfully employed for many decades in the modelling of tensile failure, where the crack surfaces separate as a crack grows. The advantage of this approach is that crack trajectories can be computed simply and efficiently on a fixed finite element mesh without explicit tracking. The development of damage models for shear failure in compression, where the crack faces slide over each other subject to friction, is a non-trivial extension of this approach. A major difference is that part of the material stiffness in the damaged region must be retained to avoid interpenetration of the crack faces. This problem is resolved here by employing an anisotropic modification to the elastic stiffness tensor in the damaged region. This has the benefit of driving frictional cracks into the correct orientation, according to the Mohr–Coulomb failure criteria, but three issues remain. The first is that the shear discontinuity introduces some spurious stress perturbations around crack regions that are narrow (less than 3-4 elements wide). This is ameliorated by Helmholtz smoothing to allow efficient simulation on a coarse mesh. The second is that the complementarity of shear stress means that the shear stiffness is removed normal to the crack interface as well as parallel to it, and the third is that there are two potentially active failure planes at each point. Both these latter two issues are resolved by the introduction of a novel failure plane selection variable, which regulates either single plane or dual plane failure, and prevents the growth of erroneous cracks normal to the crack face. Both local and non-local models are investigated for linear and exponential strain softening responses. Unlike the non-local model, the local model demonstrates some mesh-size dependence, but it still retains some properties of interest, in that it supports narrower cracks and more rapidly forms a preference for the growth of a single crack when there are a number of competing cracks. The model is implemented in commercial finite element package COMSOL Multiphysics v5.5 and validated against two benchmark simulations: biaxial compression and the failure of a 45° slope. The correct crack angles, stipulated by the Mohr–Coulomb friction angle , are correctly reproduced, as is the post-failure residual frictional force in biaxial compression. The effect of the shear fracture energy on the force–displacement response is investigated, demonstrating successful simulation of the range of material behaviour expected in geological samples, from broad ranged gradual collapse to sharp, almost instantaneous failure.},

  abstract     = {Phase field method has proven capable of producing complex crack patterns in solids. It introduces a continuous phase field to regularize the sharp crack discontinuities. However, the applicability of this method to engineering problems is hindered by its computational costs. In this work, we proposed a mapped phase field method as a possible route to resolve this issue. The core of this method is a map that connects the physical domain to a parametric domain, which is essentially a local reparametrization of the physical domain where large gradients are expected. By the use of this map the strongly varying fields can be approximated by a much smoother function. The reparametrized solution is solved via standard finite element in the parametric domain and then mapped back to the physical domain. A simple analysis shows that, with a properly defined map, such method consumes much less computational resources compared with conventional phase field method, without loss in accuracy. The map can also be easily manipulated to adapt to the evolution of cracks, and thus providing a flexible framework to simulate complex crack patterns without any knowledge of the crack path in advance. The advantages of our proposed method are further shown by four different numerical examples : single edge crack under symmetric and anti-symmetric loading, three-point bending, and L-shape panel under cyclic loading.},

Firstly, a so-called fat skeleton of the given domain, represented by a multi-patch NURBS parameterization, is constructed, which determines the topology of a multi-patch NURBS parameterization suitable for the given domain. Then, we formulate an evolution process which successively transforms the initial shape represented by the fat skeleton to the target shape represented by the given domain. Moreover, a multi-patch optimization is applied in every time iteration to make the multi-patch NURBS parameterization as uniform and orthogonal as possible. The method is constructed such that it is fully automatic and it solves the biggest problems of the domain parameterization problem, i.e., it automatically determines a suitable topology of a multi-patch NURBS parameterization for the given domain and it also automatically solves the boundary correspondence problem. The functionality of the proposed method is demonstrated on several examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper extends the static contact problem of crack faces to include dynamic contact and crack propagation based on the relevant literature (Zhang et al., 2018). The scaled boundary finite element method is used to solve dynamic crack face contact and crack propagation problems. Based on the scaled boundary finite element shape function considering side-face loads, the system dynamic equilibrium equation and related characteristic matrix are presented. The Lagrange multiplier method is used to establish the contact model between the crack faces. The meshing and remeshing algorithm is carried out by using arbitrary polygonal meshes . When a crack propagates, the remeshing operation involves only a small region of polygons around the propagating crack tip. Mesh mapping technology is used to transfer the response parameters to newly generated nodes. The proposed method is validated by analysing the impact of two identical bars and the dynamic contact of crack faces in the Koyna Dam. The results show that the dynamic contact model can effectively simulate the opening and closing of crack faces, and the longer the crack is, the greater the influence of the non-linearity of the contact along a crack face on the dynamic stress intensity factor and dynamic response. Finally, a dynamic crack propagation problem is simulated. Compared with the dynamic crack response without considering the contact constraint, when considering the contact constraint, the crack initiation angle is closer to the corresponding theoretical solution, and the crack propagation path is closer to the corresponding experimental result. Thus, the dynamic contact constraint condition of crack faces has an important influence on crack propagation.},

  abstract     = {Material and structural non-destructive evaluations using guided-wave (GW) testing techniques rely on the knowledge of wave dispersion characteristics. When studying coupled fluid–solid waveguides having complex geometries using the semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) method, an excessive computational effort may be required, especially at high-frequency ranges. In this paper, we show the robustness of an efficient computational approach so-called the semi-analytical isogeometric analysis (SAIGA) for computing the wave dispersion in 3D anisotropic elastic waveguides coupled with acoustic fluids. This approach is based on the use of Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS) as the basis functions for the geometry representation as well as for the approximation of pressure/displacement fields. The obtained results are compared with the ones derived from using the conventional SAFE method which uses Lagrange polynomials. It is shown that for computing the dispersion of GWs, using SAIGA leads to a much faster convergence rate than using the conventional SAFE with the same shape function’s order. For hollow prismatic structures immersed in fluids, using high-order NURBS ( e.g , p = 8 p=8 ) is particularly efficient as it only requires a few elements to achieve solutions having the same precision as the ones obtained by SAFE which requires up to five times of number of DOFs. Moreover, the continuity of normal displacement at fluid–solid interfaces could be significantly improved thanks to the smoothness feature of NURBS, showing the advantage of SAIGA over SAFE in the evaluation of the shape modes of GWs in coupled fluid–solid systems.},

  abstract     = {Generating quality body-fitting meshes for complex composite microstructures is a non-trivial task. In particular, micro-CT images of composites can contain numerous irregularly-shaped inclusions. Among the methods available, immersed boundary methods that discretize bodies independently provide potential for tackling these types of problems since a matching discretization is not needed. However, these techniques still entail the explicit parameterization of the interfaces, which may be considerable in number. In this work, immersed volumetric Nitsche methods are developed in order to avoid the difficulty of generating body fitting meshes for composite materials with complicated microstructures, and overcome the issues in the surface-type methods. These approaches are developed using Nitsche’s techniques to enforce volumetric continuity between the inclusion and background domains. It is shown that the proposed weak forms are fully consistent with the strong form of the composite problem. The present approach permits C 0 approximations for the foreground discretization, and C 1 approximations for the background. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated by solving homogeneous and inhomogeneous composite benchmark problems, where it is shown that the non-symmetric version of Nitsche’s approach is the most robust in all settings.},

The natural idea of using the two-grid frame to optimize the domain decomposition method inherits the best features of both methods and can overcome some of the domain decomposition deficits. The resulting schemes can be implemented easily using many existing mature solvers or codes in a flexible way, which are much effective under smaller mesh sizes or some realistic physical parameters . Moreover, several error estimates are carried out to show the stability and convergence of the schemes.

The framework is built based on the Auto-Encoder (or Encoder–Decoder) architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN) via a theory-guided training process. In order to incorporate physical constraints for achieving theory-guided training, the governing equations of the studied problems can be discretized by the finite difference scheme, and then be embedded into the training of the CNN. The residual of the discretized governing equations, as well as the data mismatch, constitute the loss function of the TgAE. The trained TgAE can be utilized to construct a surrogate that approximates the relationship between the model parameters and model responses with limited labeled data. Several subsurface flow cases are designed to test the performance of the TgAE. The results demonstrate that satisfactory accuracy for surrogate modeling and higher efficiency for uncertainty quantification tasks can be achieved with the TgAE. The TgAE also shows good extrapolation ability for cases with different correlation lengths and variances. Furthermore, inverse modeling tasks are also implemented with the TgAE surrogate, and satisfactory results are obtained.},

  abstract     = {We propose a gauge theoretic model for quantifying and evolving spatial defects in the form of micro-cracks in deforming solids. A non-trivial affine connection — the gauge connection, is introduced to accommodate local changes in the configuration due to spatial defects. The gauge connection enables defining the covariant derivative, a procedure known as the minimal replacement. The configuration gradients in the Lagrangian are then determined using covariant derivatives, instead of partial derivatives, thereby incorporating kinematic information pertaining to the spatial defects. Minimal replacement ensures that the invariance of the Lagrangian under the local action of the symmetry group, which in this case is the scaling of the deformed coordinates, is restored. Introduction of the gauge field Lagrangian via yet another construct — the minimal coupling, obtains the additional energy contribution pertaining to defect evolution. The resulting Euler–Lagrange (EL) equations thus describe the coupled motion of the solid and the evolving defects. The EL equation for defect evolution presently accounts for microscopic inertia. Different features of brittle damage, viz. tension–compression asymmetry, stiffness degradation and an energy functional including the contribution from defects in the form of cracks, are described within the gauge theoretic model considering the kinematic aspects of deformation and damage. The usefulness of the model and its advantages over a phase-field based damage model are assessed through peridynamics-based numerical simulations on high-speed oscillatory crack-tip instabilities as observed experimentally during dynamic crack propagation in a pre-notched polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) plate. Simulations are also carried out for dynamic crack propagation in maraging steel subjected to impulsive loading and dynamic crack branching in a glass type material. We claim that the model offers a physically transparent and accurate tool to understand nonlinearities in the fracture process zone.},

Usual spaces, such as polynomial-based ones, cannot properly represent high-contrast channelized features such as fractures (high permeability) and barriers (low permeability) for flows in heterogeneous porous media. We propose here new interface spaces, which are based on physics, to deal with permeability fields in the simultaneous presence of fractures and barriers, accommodated respectively, by the pressure and flux spaces. Existing multiscale methods based on mixed formulations can take advantage of the proposed interface spaces, however, in order to present and test our results, we use the newly developed Multiscale Robin Coupled Method (MRCM) (Guiraldello et al., 2018), which generalizes most well-known multiscale mixed methods, and allows for the independent choice of the pressure and flux interface spaces. An adaptive version of the MRCM (Rocha et al., 2020) is considered that automatically selects the physics-based pressure space for fractured structures and the physics-based flux space for regions with barriers, resulting in a procedure with improved accuracy. The features of the proposed approach are investigated through several numerical simulations of single-phase and two-phase flows, in different heterogeneous porous media. The adaptive MRCM combined with the interface spaces based on physics provides promising results for challenging problems with the simultaneous presence of fractures and barriers.},

This paper introduces deep learning techniques under the data-driven framework to address these fundamental issues in nonlinear materials modeling. To this end, an autoencoder neural network architecture is introduced to learn the underlying low-dimensional representation (embedding) of the given material database. The offline trained autoencoder and the discovered embedding space are then incorporated in the online data-driven computation such that the search of optimal material state from database can be performed on a low-dimensional space, aiming to enhance the robustness and predictability with projected material data. To ensure numerical stability and representative constitutive manifold, a convexity-preserving interpolation scheme tailored to the proposed autoencoder-based data-driven solver is proposed for constructing the material state. In this study, the applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated by modeling nonlinear biological tissues. A parametric study on data noise, data size and sparsity, training initialization, and model architectures, is also conducted to examine the robustness and convergence property of the proposed approach.},

In particular, we recover classical adsorption isotherms from different forms of the surface free energy. The model is then numerically solved in two spatial dimensions. We present an Eulerian weak formulation for the Navier–Stokes equations together with an arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian weak formulation for the surfactant transport equations. Finite element approximations are proposed to discretize the two weak formulations on the moving mesh. The resulting numerical method is shown to conserve the total mass of the surfactants exactly.

  abstract     = {The kinetic energy of a flow is proportional to the square of the L 2 ( Ω ) L2(Ω) norm of the velocity. Given a sufficient regular velocity field and a velocity finite element space with polynomials of degree r r , then the best approximation error in L 2 ( Ω ) L2(Ω) is of order r + 1 r+1 . In this survey, the available finite element error analysis for the velocity error in L ∞ ( 0 , T ; L 2 ( Ω ) ) L∞(0,T;L2(Ω)) is reviewed, where T T is a final time. Since in practice the case of small viscosity coefficients or dominant convection is of particular interest, which may result in turbulent flows, robust error estimates are considered, i.e., estimates where the constant in the error bound does not depend on inverse powers of the viscosity coefficient. Methods for which robust estimates can be derived enable stable flow simulations for small viscosity coefficients on comparatively coarse grids, which is often the situation encountered in practice. To introduce stabilization techniques for the convection-dominated regime and tools used in the error analysis, evolutionary linear convection–diffusion equations are studied at the beginning. The main part of this survey considers robust finite element methods for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations of order r − 1 r−1 , r r , and r + 1 / 2 r+1/2 for the velocity error in L ∞ ( 0 , T ; L 2 ( Ω ) ) L∞(0,T;L2(Ω)) . All these methods are discussed in detail. In particular, a sketch of the proof for the error bound is given that explains the estimate of important terms which determine finally the order of convergence. Among them, there are methods for inf–sup stable pairs of finite element spaces as well as for pressure-stabilized discretizations. Numerical studies support the analytic results for several of these methods. In addition, methods are surveyed that behave in a robust way but for which only a non-robust error analysis is available. The conclusion of this survey is that the problem of whether or not there is a robust method with optimal convergence order for the kinetic energy is still open.},

  abstract     = {We propose an Exponential DG approach for numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The idea is to decompose the governing PDE operators into linear (fast dynamics extracted by linearization) and nonlinear (the remaining after removing the former) parts, on which we apply the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spatial discretization . The resulting semi-discrete system is then integrated using exponential time-integrators: exact for the former and approximate for the latter. By construction, our approach i) is stable with a large Courant number ( Cr&amp;gt;1 ); ii) supports high-order solutions both in time and space; iii) is computationally favorable compared to IMEX DG methods with no preconditioner ; iv) requires comparable computational time compared to explicit RKDG methods, while having time stepsizes orders magnitude larger than maximal stable time stepsizes for explicit RKDG methods; v) is scalable in a modern massively parallel computing architecture by exploiting Krylov-subspace matrix-free exponential time integrators and compact communication stencil of DG methods. Various numerical results for both Burgers and Euler equations are presented to showcase these expected properties. For Burgers equation, we present a detailed stability and convergence analyses for the exponential Euler DG scheme.},

  abstract     = {Because of its nonlinearity and path-dependency, analysis of the elasto-plastic behavior of the finite element (FE) model is computationally expensive. By directly learning sequential data, modeling plasticity via deep learning has shown successful performance in immediately predicting the path-dependent response. However, large-scale elasto-plastic FE models still have challenges in that they require numerous degrees of freedom and are accompanied by high-dimensional data. This study proposes a practical framework for the surrogate modeling of a large-scale elasto-plastic FE model by combining long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). First, displacement, plastic strain magnitude, and von Mises stress are generated using commercial FE analysis software, and then, the high-dimensional data are reduced to low-dimensional POD coefficient data before being used for training. With the drastically reduced data, a neural network architecture can be introduced in the form of individual and ensemble structures to achieve accurate and robust prediction. As the proposed POD-LSTM surrogate model operates on the structural level, POD-LSTM surrogate models are constructed and implemented for each of the three large-scale elasto-plastic FE models. In all three examples, the proposed POD-LSTM surrogate models were found to be efficient and accurate for predicting elasto-plastic responses.},

The CEC2019 multi-modal multi-objective benchmark functions are utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and compared with nine state-of-the-art multi-objective meta-heuristics algorithms.

The CSPM combining the kernel estimate with the Taylor series expansion is adopted, which resolves the general problems of low precision and particle deficiency in standard smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The discrete governing equations of the shell in the strong form are derived using the conservation condition and the CSPM interpolation function . Aiming at the sore point of the free boundary in the meshless method , the developed model enables the modified governing equations to automatically satisfy the free boundary condition without additional treatment. Moreover, the total Lagrangian kernel function and stress points are employed to eliminate tensile instability and instability induced by the rank deficiency.

This technique leads to a sequence of saddle-point problems that are discretely stable and deliver a robust error estimate that drives mesh adaptivity. In this work, we demonstrate the method’s efficiency in extreme scenarios, where the solutions’ quality and performance are comparable to classical discontinuous Galerkin formulations in the respective discrete space norm on a particular mesh. We focus on the practical implementation of the adaptive technology to a broad range of engineering applications , from singularly perturbed linear advection-dominated diffusion to highly non-linear problems.

With the evolution of the phase field and the transport phenomena all modeled and integrated within the same LB framework, this method preserves and combines the intrinsic advantages of the phase-field method (PFM) and the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). Particularly, the present PFM/LBM model has several improved features compared to the existing phase-field models including: (1) a novel multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) LB scheme for the phase-field evolution is proposed to effectively model solidification coupled with melt flow and thermosolutal convection–diffusion with improved numerical stability and accuracy, (2) convenient diffuse interface treatments are implemented for the melt flow and thermosolutal transport which can be applied to the entire domain without tracking the interface, and (3) the evolution of the phase field, flow, concentration, and temperature fields on the level of microscopic distribution functions in the LB schemes is decoupled with a multiple-time-scaling strategy (despite their full physical coupling), thus solidification at high Lewis numbers (ratios of the liquid thermal to solutal diffusivities) can be conveniently modeled. The applicability and accuracy of the present PFM/LBM model are verified with four numerical tests including isothermal, iso-solutal and thermosolutal convection–diffusion problems, where excellent agreement in terms of phase-field and thermosolutal distributions and dendritic tip growth velocity and radius with those reported in the literature is demonstrated. The proposed PFM/LBM model can be an attractive and powerful tool for large-scale dendritic growth simulations given the high scalability of the LBM.},

  abstract     = {The least-squares finite element method (LSFEM) has drawn much attention with desirable properties , such as always symmetric positive-definite stiffness matrix and approximation of primal and non-primal variables with equivalent accuracy. Despite a condition number comparable to that of Galerkin FEM, of O ( h − 2 ) O(h−2) , it is sometimes found that LSFEM with low-order elements does not show a satisfactory accuracy of solution. In this report, we propose an easy-to-implement technique that optimizes the condition number of the stiffness matrix . The least-squares functional is applied to the first-order governing equations and a linear combination of the weak form domain and boundary equations, with normalization (i.e., weighting) parameters is constructed. The impact of these parameters on the condition number of the resulting global stiffness matrix is proved to be independent of mesh size or shape function order. By use of a global optimization scheme that tunes these parameters, we observe notable decrease in the condition number compared to cases where the least-squares principle is directly applied to the governing equations, and hence convergence is significantly improved. It is further shown that the technique can be applied to the elemental stiffness matrix for a computationally efficient means of determining normalization parameters. To show the general applicability of the method, we also apply this technique to solve for a two-dimensional (2D) lid-driven flow problem and to calculate the electromagnetic field distribution in a 2D rectangular resonant cavity . In both problems, the LSFEM solution accuracy is poor prior to optimization of weighting parameters, and accuracy does not increase much by mesh refinement alone. Moreover, the process can be generalized to Galerkin FEM and other methods to improve convergence properties .},

The interaction between the granular material and immersed rigid bodies is posed and solved as a “fluid”–solid interaction (FSI) problem using boundary conditions enforcing (BCE) SPH particles rigidly attached onto the boundary of the body interacting with the granular material. A new penetration-based particle shifting technique (PPST) is proposed to enforce the particle regularity and thus a stable simulation. Several numerical experiments (angle of repose, ball drop, and cone penetration) are carried out to validate the accuracy of the proposed methodology. The approach is subsequently demonstrated in conjunction with a 3D landslide simulation and a plowing operation. The approach discussed has been implemented and can be used in an open source simulation platform publicly available on GitHub. The implementation leverages GPU computing.},

To infer these parameters, we use reported data on the number of confirmed, hospitalized, and deceased cases with suitable post-processing in both a deterministic inversion approach with appropriate regularization as a first step, followed by Bayesian inversion with proper prior distributions. To address the curse of dimensionality and the ill-posedness of the high-dimensional inference problem, we propose use of a dimension-independent projected Stein variational gradient descent method, and demonstrate the intrinsic low-dimensionality of the inverse problem. We present inference results with quantified uncertainties for both New Jersey and Texas, which experienced different epidemic phases and patterns.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a computational framework for simulating ductile fracture in multipatch shell structures is presented. A ductile fracture phase-field model at finite strains is combined with an isogeometric Kirchhoff–Love shell formulation. For the application to complex structures, we employ a penalty approach for imposing, at patch interfaces, displacement and rotational continuity and C 0 C0 and C 1 C1 continuity of the phase-field, the latter required if a higher-order phase-field formulation is adopted. We study the mesh dependency of the numerical model and we show that mesh refinement allows for capturing important features of ductile fracture such as cracking along shear bands. Therefore, we investigate the effectiveness of a predictor–corrector algorithm for adaptive mesh refinement based on LR NURBS. Thanks to the adoption of time- and space-adaptivity strategies, it is possible to simulate the failure of complex structures with a reasonable computational effort. Finally, we compare the predictions of the numerical model with experimental results.},

  abstract     = {The use of nonlinear projector matrix in co-rotational (CR) analysis was pioneered by Rankin and Nour-Omid in 1990s (Rankin and Nour-Omid, 1988; Nour-Omid and Rankin, 1991), and has almost became a standard manner for CR formulations deduction over the past thirty years. This matrix however relies heavily on a hysterical and sophisticated derivation of the variation of the local displacements to the global ones, leading to complicated expressions for the internal force vector and the tangent stiffness matrix , which may devalue the simplicity and convenience for the original intention of using CR approach. This paper begins by making a discussion on existing element independent CR formulation and the objective is to develop a new and simpler framework for general CR analysis that avoids using conventional nonlinear projector matrix. The methodology consists of two steps in the element internal force calculation. The first one is to obtain a preliminary result of the internal force. This is done by following the conventional element-independent CR formulation but dropping the terms involving projector matrix and therefore yields simple formulations of the internal force and the tangent stiffness matrix . The second one is a correction step to obtain a new internal force vector that satisfies the element self-equilibrium condition. This step inherits the spirit of using projector matrix but is conducted directly in the global frame, thus avoiding complicated entanglement of local–global rotation and is independent of the choice of the local CR frame used in the CR analysis. This further leads to a simple and unified formulation for different kinds of elements that can be cooperated in CR framework. Closed formulation of the correction force as well as the related consistent tangent stiffness matrix is derived for different correction approaches. It is also shown that the existing linear projector matrix used for infinitesimal rotation analysis is a special case of the current correction approaches. Multiple numerical examples involving various kinds of elements and different choices of element local CR frame are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework. The outcomes show that for all the examples the accuracy of the results is comparable with those obtained in conjunction with conventional nonlinear projector matrix.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop and study approximately smooth basis constructions for isogeometric analysis over two-patch domains. One key element of isogeometric analysis is that it allows high order smoothness within one patch. However, for representing complex geometries, a multi-patch construction is needed. In this case, a C 0 C0 -smooth basis is easy to obtain, whereas C 1 C1 -smooth isogeometric functions require a special construction. Such spaces are of interest when solving numerically fourth-order PDE problems, such as the biharmonic equation and the Kirchhoff–Love plate or shell formulation, using an isogeometric Galerkin method. With the construction of so-called analysis-suitable G 1 G1 (in short, AS- G 1 G1 ) parametrizations, as introduced in Collin et al. (2016), it is possible to construct C 1 C1 isogeometric spaces which possess optimal approximation properties, cf. (Kapl et al., 2019). These geometries need to satisfy certain constraints along the interfaces and additionally require that the regularity r r and degree p p of the underlying spline space satisfy 1 ≤ r ≤ p − 2 1≤r≤p−2 . The problem is that most complex geometries are not AS- G 1 G1 geometries. Therefore, we define basis functions for isogeometric spaces by enforcing approximate C 1 C1 conditions following the basis construction from Kapl et al. (2017). For this reason, the defined function spaces are not exactly C 1 C1 but only approximately. We study the convergence behavior and define function spaces that converge optimally under h h -refinement, by locally introducing functions of higher polynomial degree and lower regularity. The convergence rate is optimal in several numerical tests performed on domains with non-trivial interfaces. While an extension to more general multi-patch domains is possible, we restrict ourselves to the two-patch case and focus on the construction over a single interface.},

  abstract     = {We present a stochastic modeling framework to represent and simulate spatially-dependent geometrical uncertainties on complex geometries. While the consideration of random geometrical perturbations has long been a subject of interest in computational engineering, most studies proposed so far have addressed the case of regular geometries such as cylinders and plates. Here, standard random field representations, such as Karhunen–Loève expansions, can readily be used owing, in particular, to the relative simplicity to construct covariance operators on regular shapes. On the contrary, applying such techniques on arbitrary, non-convex domains remains difficult in general. In this work, we formulate a new representation for spatially-correlated geometrical uncertainties that allows complex domains to be efficiently handled. Building on previous contributions by the authors, the approach relies on the combination of a stochastic partial differential equation approach, introduced to capture salient features of the underlying geometry such as local curvature and singularities on the fly, and an information-theoretic model, aimed to enforce non-Gaussianity. More specifically, we propose a methodology where the interface of interest is immersed into a fictitious domain, and define algorithmic procedures to directly sample random perturbations on the manifold. A simple strategy based on statistical conditioning is also presented to update realizations and prevent self-intersections in the perturbed finite element mesh. We finally provide challenging examples to demonstrate the robustness of the framework, including the case of a gyroid structure produced by additive manufacturing and brain interfaces in patient-specific geometries. In both applications, we discuss suitable parameterization for the filtering operator and quantify the impact of the uncertainties through forward propagation.},

To obtain this result, it is key to redefine dissipative phenomena as driven by the free entropy thermodynamic potential. Such a reformulation provides a theoretical explanation of existing variational methods and paves the way for the formulation of variational updates applicable to nonlinear multi-field problems.

The performance of existing PINN approaches , however, may degrade in the presence of sharp gradients, as a result of the inability of the network to capture the solution behavior globally. We posit that this shortcoming may be remedied by introducing long-range (nonlocal) interactions into the network’s input, in addition to the short-range (local) space and time variables. Following this ansatz, here we develop a nonlocal PINN approach using the Peridynamic Differential Operator (PDDO)—a numerical method which incorporates long-range interactions and removes spatial derivatives in the governing equations. Because the PDDO functions can be readily incorporated in the neural network architecture , the nonlocality does not degrade the performance of modern deep-learning algorithms. We apply nonlocal PDDO-PINN to the solution and identification of material parameters in solid mechanics and, specifically, to elastoplastic deformation in a domain subjected to indentation by a rigid punch, for which the mixed displacement–traction boundary condition leads to localized deformation and sharp gradients in the solution. We document the superior behavior of nonlocal PINN with respect to local PINN in both solution accuracy and parameter inference, illustrating its potential for simulation and discovery of partial differential equations whose solution develops sharp gradients.},

  abstract     = {Fracture is a ubiquitous phenomenon in most composite engineering structures, and is often the responsible mechanism for catastrophic failure . Over the past several decades, many approaches have emerged to model and predict crack failure. The phase field method for fracture uses a surrogate damage field to model crack propagation , eliminating the arduous need for explicit crack meshing . In this work a novel numerical framework is proposed for implementing hybrid phase field fracture in heterogeneous materials. The proposed method is based on the “reflux-free” method for solving, in strong form , the equations of linear elasticity on a block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (BSAMR) mesh. The use of BSAMR enables highly efficient and scalable regridding, facilitates the use of temporal subcycling for explicit time integration, and allows for ultra-high refinement at crack boundaries with minimal computational cost. The method is applied to a variety of simple heterogeneous structures: laminates, wavy interfaces, and circular inclusions . In each case a non-dimensionalized parameter study is performed to identify regions of behavior, varying both the geometry of the problem and the relative fracture energy release rate . In the laminate and wavy interface cases, regions of delamination and fracture correspond to simple analytical predictions. For the circular inclusions, the modulus ratio of the inclusion is varied as well as the delamination energy release rate and the problem geometry. In this case, a wide variety of behaviors was observed, including deflection, splitting, delamination, and pure fracture.},

  abstract     = {Numerous engineering applications employ composite materials due to the advantages that the combination of their components can provide. Fiber-reinforced composites are a particular group of composites which allows designing optimized structures by tailoring the orientation of the fiber. For this reason, new additive manufacturing technologies have been developed nowadays. These tools allow the manufacturing of fiber-reinforced structures designed by using optimization algorithms. Consequently, there are several works in recent literature determining the optimized fiber orientation in composite structures, where the methods based on gradient stand out due to their better efficiency. There are two main approaches to determine the fiber orientation by using gradient-based methods, Continuous Fiber Angle Optimization (CFAO), where the angle is the design variable and commonly present local minima problems, and Discrete Fiber Angle Interpolation Models, which consider candidate angles a priori and by using weighting functions choose one of them as the optimized angle. This work proposes a method named HYMFO, which uses a combination of both approaches. To verify the efficiency of the method, two design problems of Laminated Piezocomposite Actuators (LAPA) are solved by using several mesh discretizations with the discrete methods DMO, HPDMO, BCP, and NDFO, the continuous method SPIMFO and the newly proposed hybrid method. Therefore, the method is not evaluated with the traditional problem of maximizing the stiffness in structural design. A new fiber orthogonality regularization is presented, facilitating the appearance of continuous paths in fiber distribution by imposing a specified maximum angle between adjacent fibers. A comparative analysis based on the performance of the structure and the computational cost is carried out to determine the most appropriate method for each situation.},

  abstract     = {Sensitivity analysis is a useful means to quantify the impact of a set of input variables on an output response. However, many traditional sensitivity analysis methods are applicable only to multi-input single-output (MISO) systems and are powerless for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. This paper presents a global sensitivity analysis method based on variance and covariance decomposition (VCD-GSA) of summatory functions for MIMO systems. For a MIMO system with n input variables and m output responses, a set of summatory functions can be constructed by the addition and subtraction of any two output response functions. Each output response function is represented using this set of summatory functions. The variances and covariances of all the output responses are obtained by the integral calculation of the high-dimensional model representations(HDMRs) of these summatory functions. We define the total fluctuation by the sum of the variances and covariances on multiple responses, and the partial fluctuations by the sum of partial variances of a series of summatory functions. Subsequently, we define the s-order sensitivity index of the MIMO system by the ratio of the partial fluctuation on s-order function terms in HDMRs and total fluctuation. The variable sensitivity index is the sum of all of the s-order sensitivity indices, including the contribution of the input variable. The proposed VCD-GSA method is suitable for a uniform or Gaussian distribution. It is also suitable for some complex problems involving variables with correlation. Several numerical examples and engineering applications demonstrate the advantage and practicality of the proposed VCD-GSA method.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel framework for predicting computer-aided engineering (CAE) simulation results using machine learning (ML). The framework is applied to finite element (FE) simulations of dynamic axial crushing of rectangular crush tubes that are typically used in vehicle crashworthiness applications. A virtual design of experiments that varies the size and wall thickness of the FE model is performed to generate the necessary training data. This process generates designs with varying numbers of nodes and elements that are handled by the ML system. However, the explicit design parameters and meshing techniques that were used to generate the training data remain unknown to the ML system. Instead, 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) autoencoders are used to process the initial FE model data (i.e., nodes, elements, thickness, etc.) to automatically determine these features in an unsupervised manner. A voxelization strategy that operates on the mass of individual nodes is proposed to handle the unstructured nature of the nodes and elements while capturing variations in the wall thickness of the FE models. The flattened latent space generated by the 3D-CNN-autoencoder is then used as input into long-short term memory neural networks (LSTM-NN) to predict the force–displacement response as well as the deformation of the mesh. The training process of both the 3D-CNN-autoencoders and LSTM-NN is systematically studied to highlight the robustness of the framework. The proposed ML system utilizes only 16% of the simulations generated in the virtual design of experiments to achieve good predictive capability. Once trained, the proposed framework can predict the deformation of the mesh and resulting force–displacement response of a new design up to ∼ ∼ 330 and ∼ ∼ 2,960,000 times faster, respectively, than the conventional FE approach with good accuracy. This computational speed up offers design engineers and scientists a potential tool for accelerating the design exploration process with CAE simulation tools, such as FE analysis.},

  abstract     = {Inferring arbitrary quantities of interest (QoI) using limited computational or, in realistic scenarios, financial budgets, is a challenging problem that requires sophisticated strategies for the optimal allocation of the available resources. Bayesian optimal experimental design identifies the optimal set of design locations for the purpose of solving a parameter inference problem and the optimality criterion is typically associated with maximizing the worth of information in the experimental measurements. Sequential design strategies further identify the optimal design in a sequential manner, starting from a initial budget and iteratively selecting new optimal points until either an accuracy threshold is reached, or a cost limit is exceeded. In this paper, we present a generic sequential Bayesian experimental design framework that relies on maximizing an information theoretic design criterion, namely the Expected Information Gain , in order to infer QoIs formed as nonlinear operators acting on black-box functions. Our framework relies on modeling the underlying response function using non-stationary Gaussian Processes , thus enabling efficient sampling from the QoI in order to provide Monte Carlo estimators for the design criterion. We demonstrate the performance of our method on an engineering problem of steel wire manufacturing and compare it with two classic approaches: uncertainty sampling and expected improvement.},

  abstract     = {The computational modeling of thin-walled structures based on isogeometric analysis (IGA), non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS), and Kirchhoff–Love (KL) shell formulations has attracted significant research attention in recent years. While these methods offer numerous benefits over the traditional finite element approach, including exact representation of the geometry, naturally satisfied high-order continuity within each NURBS patch, and computationally efficient rotation-free formulations, they also present a number of challenges in modeling real-world engineering structures of considerable complexity. Specifically, these NURBS-based engineering models are usually comprised of numerous patches, with discontinuous derivatives, non-conforming discretizations , and non-watertight connections at their interfaces. Moreover, the analysis of such structures often requires the full stress and strain tensors (i.e., including the transverse normal and shear components) for subsequent failure analysis and remaining life prediction. Despite the efficiency provided by the KL shell, the formulation cannot accurately predict the response in the transverse directions due to its kinematic assumptions . In this work, a penalty-based formulation for the blended coupling of KL and continuum shells is presented. The proposed approach embraces both the computational efficiency of KL shells and the availability of the full-scale stress/strain tensors of continuum shells where needed by modeling critical structural components using continuum shells and other components using KL shells. The proposed method enforces the displacement and rotational continuities in a variational manner and is applicable to non-conforming and non-smooth interfaces. The efficacy of the developed method is demonstrated through a number of benchmark studies with a variety of analysis configurations, including linear and nonlinear analyses, matching and non-matching discretizations , and isotropic and composite materials. Finally, an aircraft horizontal stabilizer is considered to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed blended shells to real-world engineering structures of significant complexity.},

The PR-RBC approach reduces the effective dimensionality of the parameter space and also provides flexibility in topology and geometry. In the online stage, for each query, we consider a given parameter value and associated global domain. In the first level of reduction, the PR-RBC reduced bases are used to approximate the frequency-domain solution at selected frequencies. In the second level of reduction, these instantiated PR-RBC approximations are used as surrogate truth solutions in a Strong Greedy approach to identify a reduced basis space ; the PDE of time-domain elastodynamics is then projected on this reduced space. We provide a numerical example to demonstrate the computational capability and assess the performance of the proposed two-level approach.},

Especially, the significance of considering correct surface loads rather than applying an equivalent load directly on the central axis is investigated. Incompatible linear in-plane strain components for the cross-section have been added to alleviate Poisson locking by using an enhanced assumed strain (EAS) method.

Compared to complex shifted ILU, the shifted Laplace preconditioner leads to a significant performance improvement in terms of reduced number of GMRES iterations. Through numerical examples , we show that the shifted Laplace preconditioner results in a wavenumber independent GMRES convergence for the frequency range considered. We also show in general that preconditioned GMRES performs better with PUIGA than for PUFEM. The improvement is explained in terms of the lower condition numbers with PUIGA at higher frequencies.

The simulation algorithm is built upon the staggered coupling of a fluid model that describes the viscous flow in the fractured domain and a model of the solid deformation and fracture response, driven by the pressure field induced by the fluid injection. The use of standard finite elements for the fluid model and a DG formulation for the solid tied together in a staggered fashion, allowing us to focus on the optimal solution strategy for each individual system, furnish the simulator with the robustness and parallel scalability properties needed to handle the strongly nonlinear processes associated with this physical phenomenon as well as the highly demanding computational requirements that come with large-scale field simulations. Importantly, the fluid is allowed to lag behind the crack front thus giving place to a lag region, which has recently been recognized as important in some hydraulic fracture applications, and further broadens the range of applicability of the simulator. We verify the proposed computational framework against known analytical results and we demonstrate its capabilities in complex scenarios such as the interaction with natural cracks and the propagation of simultaneous and sequential fractures, as well as its parallel scalability properties.},

  abstract     = {The explicit semi-Lagrangian method for solution of Lagrangian transport equations as developed in Natarajan and Jacobs (2020) is adopted for the solution of stochastic differential equations that is consistent with Discontinuous Spectral Element Method (DSEM) approximations of Eulerian conservation laws. The method extends the favorable properties of DSEM that include its high-order accuracy, its local and boundary fitted properties and its high performance on parallel platforms for the concurrent Monte-Carlo, semi-Lagrangian and Eulerian solution of a class of time-dependent problems that can be described by coupled Eulerian–Lagrangian formulations. Such formulations include the probabilistic models used for the simulation of chemically reacting turbulent flows or particle-laden flows. Consistent with an explicit, DSEM discretization, the semi-Lagrangian method seeds particles at Gauss quadrature collocation nodes within a spectral element. The particles are integrated explicitly in time according to a drift velocity and a Wiener increment forcing and form the nodal basis for an advected interpolant. This interpolant is mapped back in a semi-Lagrangian fashion to the Gauss quadrature points through a least squares fit using constraints for element boundary values. Stochastic Monte-Carlo samples are averaged element-wise on the quadrature nodes. The stable explicit time step Wiener increment is sufficiently small to prevent particles from leaving the element’s bounds. The semi-Lagrangian method is hence local and parallel and does not have the grid complexity, and parallelization challenges of the commonly used Lagrangian particle solvers in particle-mesh methods for solution of Eulerian–Lagrangian formulations. Formal proof is presented that the semi-Lagrangian algorithm evolves the solution according to the Eulerian Fokker–Planck equation. Numerical tests in one and two dimensions for drift–diffusion problems show that the method converges exponentially for constant and non-constant advection and diffusion velocities.},

The structural optimization problems : compliance minimization subject to mass constraint , and mass minimization subject to compliance constraint are used to design the multimaterial topologies in this work. The extended SIMP interpolation is used to interpolate the different materials available for structural design, and the material phases in each element are represented using binary design variables, one variable per available material. The Topology Optimization of Binary Structure (TOBS) method (Sivapuram and Picelli, 2018) is employed, wherein the nonlinear objective/constraint functions of optimization are sequentially approximated (herein, linearized) to obtain a sequence of Integer Linear Programs (ILPs). A novel truncation error-regulating constraint in terms of the Young’s moduli of the elements is introduced to maintain the sequential approximations valid, by restricting large changes in successive structural topologies. A commercial branch-and-bound solver is used to solve the integer subproblems yielding perfectly binary solutions which guarantee discrete structural topologies with clear material interfaces at each iteration. Adjoint sensitivities are computed to generate the integer subproblems , and the sensitivities are filtered using a conventional mesh-independent sensitivity filter. Few examples show the design of multimaterial structures in the presence of design-dependent loads: hydrostatic pressure loads and self-weight loads. This work also demonstrates through few examples, convergence of optimal multimaterial topologies at inactive constraint values when different type of loadings simultaneously act on the structure.},

  abstract     = {Recently we have developed the optimal local truncation error method (OLTEM) for PDEs with constant coefficients on irregular domains and unfitted Cartesian meshes. However, many important engineering applications include domains with different material properties (e.g., different inclusions, multi-material structural components, etc.) for which this technique cannot be directly applied. In the paper OLTEM is extended to a much more general case of PDEs with discontinuous coefficients and can treat the above-mentioned applications. We show the development of OLTEM for the 1-D and 2-D scalar wave equation as well as the heat equation using compact 3-point (in the 1-D case) and 9-point (in the 2-D case) stencils that are similar to those for linear quadrilateral finite elements . Trivial unfitted Cartesian meshes are used for OLTEM with complex interfaces between different materials. The interface conditions on the interfaces where the jumps in material properties occur are added to the expression for the local truncation error and do not change the width of the stencils. The calculation of the unknown stencil coefficients is based on the minimization of the local truncation error of the stencil equations and yields the optimal order of accuracy of the new technique at a given width of stencil equations. In contrast to the second order of accuracy for linear finite elements , OLTEM provides the fourth order of accuracy in the 1-D case and in the 2-D case for horizontal interfaces as well as the third order of accuracy for the general geometry of smooth interfaces. The numerical results for the domains with complex smooth interfaces show that at the same number of degrees of freedom, OLTEM is even much more accurate than quadratic finite elements and yields the results close to those for cubic finite elements with much wider stencils. The wave and heat equations are uniformly treated with OLTEM. OLTEM can be directly applied to other partial differential equations.},

  abstract     = {A novel domain-decomposition least-squares Petrov–Galerkin (DD-LSPG) model-reduction method applicable to parameterized systems of nonlinear algebraic equations (e.g., arising from discretizing a parameterized partial-differential-equations problem) is proposed. In contrast with previous works, we adopt an algebraically non-overlapping decomposition strategy rather than a spatial-decomposition strategy, which facilitates application to different spatial-discretization schemes. Rather than constructing a low-dimensional subspace for the entire state space in a monolithic fashion, the methodology constructs separate subspaces for the different subdomains/components characterizing the original model. During the offline stage, the method constructs low-dimensional bases for the interior and interface of subdomains/components. During the online stage, the approach constructs an LSPG reduced-order model for each subdomain/component (equipped with hyper-reduction in the case of nonlinear operators), and enforces strong or weak compatibility on the ‘ports’ connecting them. We propose several different strategies for defining the ingredients characterizing the methodology: (i) four different ways to construct reduced bases on the interface/ports of subdomains , and (ii) different ways to enforce compatibility across connecting ports. In particular, we show that the appropriate compatibility-constraint strategy depends strongly on the basis choice. In addition, we derive a posteriori and a priori error bounds for the DD-LSPG solutions. Numerical results performed on nonlinear benchmark problems in heat transfer and fluid dynamics that employ both finite-element and finite-difference spatial discretizations demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in terms of both accuracy and (parallel) computational cost, with different choices of basis and compatibility constraints yielding different performance profiles.},

  abstract     = {The scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is known for its inherent ability to simulate unbounded domains and singular fields, and its flexibility in the meshing procedure. Keeping the analytical form of the field variables along one coordinate intact, it transforms the governing partial differential equations of the problem into a system of one-dimensional (initial–)boundary value problems. However, closed-form solution of the said system is not available for most cases (e.g. transient heat transfer, acoustics, ultrasonics, etc.) since the system cannot be diagonalized in general. This paper aims to establish a numerical tool within the context of the shooting technique to evaluate the coefficient matrices of the subdomains without a priori knowledge of the analytical solution of the semi-discretized system. With proper choice of boundary conditions, the technique uses the strong form of the scaled boundary finite element equations to pass the required information and with the desired accuracy from one boundary to another. Due to generality of the technique, its procedure can be adjusted for any field equations. Since this technique is presented here for the first time, linear elastostatics, for which the closed-form solution is well-established, is formulated to provide valid comparisons. In addition, any direct solution method can be used for integrating the scaled boundary equations. Thus, without loss of generality, a Nyström extension of the classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta method is employed. A quantitative sensitivity analysis is also conducted, and efficiency of the classical and proposed solution techniques is compared in terms of computational time. Finally, some numerical examples, including bounded and unbounded domains, as well as singular stress fields are simulated based on the classical and proposed solution techniques.},

  abstract     = {Regularizing Finite-Element Digital Image Correlation (FE-DIC) problems is essential when using fine meshes, for instance to get a direct bridge with simulation tools or in view of performing data assimilation. Shape optimization brings comparable concerns so it is proposed to draw inspiration from this field of research. In this respect, a new general spline-based non-invasive regularization scheme is proposed, based on the Free-Form Deformation (FFD) concept that offers the opportunity to decouple the design space from that of the actual geometry to be updated. The main idea is to embed the input FE mesh, with any element type or size, into a simple cuboid B-spline box and to relate the nodal FE dof of the measured field to another more regular field discretized by the box. The regularization length is thus directly driven by the box refinement. A specific care is taken to handle possible conditioning problems caused by non-influential control points. From a practical point of view, the method can be interpreted as a projection on a reduced basis; therefore, it results in a regularized but conventional FE measured field which can be simply computed from a standard FE-DIC code. The developed scheme is applied for FE displacement measurement using DIC and for mesh-based measurement in stereo-DIC. For the latter, a novel procedure based on additional projections over local directions complements the FFD method for full efficiency. The performance of the strategy is assessed on real images coming from various experimental tests and comparisons are made with other published techniques to prove its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {We consider the quasi-static Biot’s consolidation model in a three-field formulation with the three unknown physical quantities of interest being the displacement u u of the solid matrix , the seepage velocity v v of the fluid and the pore pressure p p . As conservation of fluid mass is a leading physical principle in poromechanics, we preserve this property using an H ( div ) H(div) -conforming ansatz for u u and v v together with an appropriate pressure space. This results in Stokes and Darcy stability and exact, that is, pointwise mass conservation of the discrete model. The proposed discretization technique combines a hybridized discontinuous Galerkin method for the elasticity subproblem with a mixed method for the flow subproblem , also handled by hybridization. The latter allows for a static condensation step to eliminate the seepage velocity from the system while preserving mass conservation. The system to be solved finally only contains degrees of freedom related to u u and p p resulting from the hybridization process and thus provides, especially for higher-order approximations , a very cost-efficient family of physics-oriented space discretizations for poroelasticity problems. We present the construction of the discrete model, theoretical results related to its uniform well-posedness along with optimal error estimates and parameter-robust preconditioners as a key tool for developing uniformly convergent iterative solvers. Finally, the cost-efficiency of the proposed approach is illustrated in a series of numerical tests for three-dimensional test cases.},

  abstract     = {Time-variant reliability analysis (TRA) has attracted tremendous interest for evaluating product reliability in full life cycle. Discretization of stochastic process is considered one of the simplest ways to transform a time-variant problem into a time-invariant problem that becomes easier to handle. Its adoption in time-variant problem, nevertheless, requires overcoming two main issues on (1) the low efficiency of small discrete time interval, and (2) the low accuracy of large discrete time interval. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a Kriging-assisted time-variant reliability analysis method based upon stochastic process discretization (namely, K-TRPD for short). First, a complex time-variant reliability problem is converted into conventional time-invariant problem through discretization of stochastic process. Second, the most probable point (MPP) trajectory is approximated through a Kriging model over the entire time period concerned, whose input is identified from the discrete time points by an active learning approach; and the output is obtained by the first order reliability method (FORM) at the identified time points. Finally, the constructed Kriging model is utilized for time-invariant reliability analysis at each discrete time point, and the time-variant reliability is obtained by using the time-invariant reliability analysis results for analyzing the multivariate normal distribution function. In this study, three numerical analysis examples and one engineering design example are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The approach dynamically controls an acceleration method based on numerical relaxation. It is demonstrated in a Picard iterative solver but is applicable to other types of nonlinear solvers. The aim of the machine learning acceleration is to reduce the computational cost of the nonlinear solver by adjusting to the complexity/physics of the system. Using dimensionless parameters to train and control the machine learning enables the use of a simple two-dimensional layered reservoir for training, while also exploring a wide range of the parameter space. Hence, the training process is simplified and it does not need to be rerun when the machine learning acceleration is applied to other reservoir models. We show that the method can significantly reduce the number of nonlinear iterations without compromising the simulation results, including models that are considerably more complex than the training case.},

While these components are well developed, coupling them in a single system can be a significant challenge. Computational efficiency, accuracy, and stability are principal concerns. In this study we focus on these issues. In particular, implicit–explicit (IMEX) tight and loose coupling strategies are explored for handling different time scales. For a simplified model for the air–sea interaction problem, we consider coupled compressible Navier–Stokes equations with an interface condition. Under the rigid-lid assumption, horizontal momentum and heat flux are exchanged through the interface. Several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the stability of the coupling schemes. We show both numerically and theoretically that our IMEX coupling methods are mass conservative for a coupled compressible Navier–Stokes system with the rigid-lid condition.},

In order to obtain second order temporal accuracy, we apply a Crank–Nicolson-type method to the Cahn–Hilliard–Navier–Stokes system under the projection framework. The resulting system is solved by the Jacobi-type iteration method and bi-conjugate gradient stabilized method. The proposed scheme is proved to be unconditionally energy stable, which implies that a larger time step can be used. Additionally, our scheme has been proved to satisfy mass conservation property.

An advantage of this plate theory, beside its applicability to finite-strain problems, is its asymptotic consistency with the 3D field equations and surface traction conditions in a pointwise manner. Efficiency of the numerical algorithm and this consistency advantage of this plate model are examined for both Saint-Venant–Kirchhoff and incompressible neo-Hookean materials by comparing results using classical plate models. Moreover, a quantitative explanation of restabilization response is provided by exploring the difference of uniformly stretched sheets and ones with clamped–clamped boundaries. Effects of geometric and material parameters on the applicability of those classical plate models are carefully examined, and it is found that some of them may produce quantitative deviations in some situations.},

We employ continuum mixture theory with stochastic Cahn–Hilliard type phase-field models of tumor growth. The interstitial flow is governed by a mesoscale version of Darcy’s law. The flow in the blood vessels is controlled by Poiseuille flow, and Starling’s law is applied to model the mass transfer in and out of blood vessels. The evolution of the network of blood vessels is orchestrated by the concentration of the tumor angiogenesis factors (TAFs); blood vessels grow towards the increasing TAFs concentrations. This process is not deterministic, allowing random growth of blood vessels and, therefore, due to the coupling of nutrients in tissue and vessels, makes the growth of tumors stochastic. We demonstrate the performance of the model by applying it to a variety of scenarios. Numerical experiments illustrate the flexibility of the model and its ability to generate satellite tumors. Simulations of the effects of angiogenesis on tumor growth are presented as well as sample-independent features of cancer.},

  abstract     = {This work aims to advance computational methods for projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) of linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical systems. For such systems, current practice relies on ROM formulations expressing the state as a rank-1 tensor (i.e., a vector), leading to computational kernels that are memory bandwidth bound and, therefore, ill-suited for scalable performance on modern architectures. This weakness can be particularly limiting when tackling many-query studies, where one needs to run a large number of simulations. This work introduces a reformulation, called rank-2 Galerkin, of the Galerkin ROM for LTI dynamical systems which converts the nature of the ROM problem from memory bandwidth to compute bound. We present the details of the formulation and its implementation, and demonstrate its utility through numerical experiments using, as a test case, the simulation of elastic seismic shear waves in an axisymmetric domain. We quantify and analyze performance and scaling results for varying numbers of threads and problem sizes. Finally, we present an end-to-end demonstration of using the rank-2 Galerkin ROM for a Monte Carlo sampling study. We show that the rank-2 Galerkin ROM is one order of magnitude more efficient than the rank-1 Galerkin ROM (the current practice) and about 970 times more efficient than the full-order model, while maintaining accuracy in both the mean and statistics of the field.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel storage-and-access approach for Lagrangian particles in a multiresolution local-timestepping framework for multiphase flow simulations. The proposed method applies a block-particle mapping strategy for efficient access of all particles on a specific refinement level while traversing through the multiresolution tree. This allows for extending the local timestepping algorithm with its refinement level-dependent timestep sizes to the evolution of particles, which results in significant speed-up in comparison to standard timestepping. For multi-scale multiphase flow simulations, the particle model is combined with a level-set based multiphase model on a Cartesian grid . To maintain robustness of fluid-state interpolation for particles near the level set-based fluid–fluid interface, WENO-based interpolation is applied which includes both real- and ghost-fluid cells. This enforces the sharp interface property also for interpolated fluid states, and suppresses spurious oscillations in the event of discontinuities. We validate the particle model with a one-dimensional simulation of a single particle in an air–helium shock tube for one-way coupling, and with two-dimensional simulations of a particle injected in a quiescent domain for the feedback force . Simulations of two-dimensional aerodynamic fragmentation in shear-induced entrainment and Rayleigh–Taylor piercing regimes use Lagrangian particles as sub-grid scale representation of small droplets post-breakup. Finally, three-dimensional massively-parallel simulations of single- and triple-bubble collapse near a wall coated with free-floating particles are presented. The particle cleaning radius of the single-bubble setup agrees reasonably well with experimental reference data . These simulations consider 1 0 6 106 particles and an Eulerian grid with effectively 1 0 12 1012 finite-volume cells at compression rates of more than 90% for the particulate phase. This underlines the advantageous effect of embedding the particles in the multiresolution tree with its spatial and temporal adaptivity, which is necessary for performing such large scale simulations efficiently.},

  abstract     = {To model fiber failures in random fiber networks, we have developed an elastoplastic Timoshenko beam finite element with embedded discontinuities. The method is based on the theory of strong discontinuities where the generalized displacement field is enhanced by a jump. The continuum mechanics formulation accounts for a fracture process zone and a bulk material while retaining traction continuity across the discontinuity. The additional degrees of freedom that are associated with the discontinuity are represented by a midpoint node, which is statically condensed to enable the implementation in commercial software through the user element interface . We propose a quasi-brittle fracture model, where the failure-related deformation is uncoupled from the plastic deformation in the bulk material. To retain the positive definite finite element stiffness matrix of the bulk material, we neglect the fracture-related softening of the discontinuity and employ a modified Newton iteration in the strain softening domain. Our implementation facilitates the integration into commercial finite element software and examples illustrate the robustness of the method. The FORTRAN source code is freely available to benchmark our model. We show that fiber failures contribute to the nonlinear stress–strain response of paper. Together with fiber–fiber bond failures, they can potentially explain the nonlinear stress–strain response of paper and nanopaper.},

The objectivity of the energy functional is achieved by carefully selecting the invariants under rigid-body transformation. The third-order gradient solid theory includes more than 10.000 material parameters. However, under certain simplifications, the material parameters can be greatly reduced; down to 3. With this simplified formulation, we develop a nonlocal operator method and apply it to several numerical examples. The numerical analysis shows that the high gradient solid theory exhibits a stiffer response compared to a ’conventional’ hyperelastic solid. The numerical tests also demonstrate the capability of the nonlocal operator method in solving higher-order physical problems.},

  abstract     = {The paper aims to develop a unified variational framework to bridge the gap between the non-ordinary state-based peridynamics (NOSB-PD) and the classical continuum mechanics (CCM). First, a new force state vector is proposed by introducing the first Piola–Kirchhoff stress. This new force state vector enables the stress divergence of each material point to be expressed by averaging all the force state vectors in its support domain. The new force state vector also ensures the mathematical consistency between the strong form of PD and CCM when the horizon of a material point approaches to zero. Second, the displacement and traction boundaries in CCM are transformed into the non-local fictious boundary layers in PD, and a non-local Gauss’s formulation is presented by transforming the displacement and traction boundaries in CCM into the non-local fictious boundary layers in PD, and this formulation unifies the variational framework and boundary conditions of PD and CCM. Third, a fully implicit algorithm is developed to obtain the general nonlinear problems such as fracture and large deformation of solid materials. Further, a penalty method is employed to eliminate the zero-energy mode oscillation inherently observed in NOSB-PD, and the penalty force and penalty stiffness matrix are derived for the proposed implicit algorithm and numerical implementation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method is accurate and can well capture the fracture and large deformation of solid materials. Results also indicate that the method can effectively prevent the zero-mode oscillations inherently observed in the original NOSB-PD, and thus ensures the computational stability.},

  abstract     = {Approximately 1.6 million patients in the United States are affected by tricuspid valve regurgitation, which occurs when the tricuspid valve does not close properly to prevent backward blood flow into the right atrium. Despite its critical role in proper cardiac function, the tricuspid valve has received limited research attention compared to the mitral and aortic valves on the left side of the heart. As a result, proper valvular function and the pathologies that may cause dysfunction remain poorly understood. To promote further investigations of the biomechanical behavior and response of the tricuspid valve, this work establishes a parameter-based approach that provides a template for tricuspid valve modeling and simulation. The proposed tricuspid valve parameterization presents a comprehensive description of the leaflets and the complex chordae tendineae for capturing the typical three-leaflet structural deformation observed from medical data. This simulation framework develops a practical procedure for modeling tricuspid valves and offers a robust, flexible approach to analyze the performance and effectiveness of various valve configurations using isogeometric analysis. The proposed methods also establish a baseline to examine the tricuspid valve’s structural deformation, perform future investigations of native valve configurations under healthy and disease conditions, and optimize prosthetic valve designs.},

To account for the vastly different behaviour of thermal conduction and resin cure, we design a PINN consisting of two disconnected subnetworks, and develop a sequential training algorithm that mitigates instability present in traditional training methods. Further, we incorporate explicit discontinuities into the DNN at the composite-tool interface and enforce known physical behaviour directly in the loss function to improve the solution near the interface. We train the PINN with a technique that automatically adapts the weights on the loss terms corresponding to PDE, boundary, interface, and initial conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that one can include problem parameters as an input to the model – resulting in a surrogate that provides real-time simulation for a range of problem settings – and that one can use transfer learning to significantly reduce the training time for problem settings similar to that of an initial trained model. The performance of the proposed PINN is demonstrated in multiple scenarios with different material thicknesses and thermal boundary conditions.},

The procedure allows to define a nonlinear mapping in order to derive accurate reduced-order models (ROM) relying on invariant manifold theory. The proposed reduction strategy is direct and simulation free, in the sense that it allows to pass from physical coordinates (FE nodes) to normal coordinates, describing the dynamics in an invariant-based span of the phase space. The number of master modes for the ROM is not a priori limited since a complete change of coordinate is proposed. The underlying theory ensures the quality of the predictions thanks to the invariance property of the reduced subspace, together with their curvatures in phase space that accounts for the non-resonant nonlinear couplings. The method is applied to a beam discretised with 3D elements and shows its ability in recovering internal resonance at high energy. Then a fan blade model is investigated and the correct prediction given by the ROMs are assessed and discussed. A method is proposed to approximate an aggregate value for the damping, that takes into account the damping coefficients of all the slave modes, and also using the Rayleigh damping model as input. Frequency–response curves for the beam and the blades are then exhibited, showing the accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a fully coupled multiscale strategy for components made from short fiber reinforced composites, where each Gauss point of the macroscopic finite element model is equipped with a deep material network (DMN) which covers the different fiber orientation states varying within the component. These DMNs need to be identified by linear elastic precomputations on representative volume elements, and serve as high-fidelity surrogates for full-field simulations on microstructures with inelastic constituents. We discuss how to extend direct DMNs to account for varying fiber orientation, and propose a simplified sampling strategy which significantly speeds up the training process. To enable concurrent multiscale simulations, evaluating the DMNs efficiently is crucial. We discuss dedicated techniques for exploiting sparsity and high-performance linear algebra modules, and demonstrate the power of the proposed approach on an injection molded quadcopter frame as a benchmark component. Indeed, the DMN is capable of accelerating two-scale simulations significantly, providing possible speed-ups of several magnitudes.},

Both the CAD geometry and the physical boundary variables are approximated using Non-uniform Rational B-splines basis functions (NURBS) in an isogeometric setting. A detailed comparison between two BEM methods: the conventional boundary integral equation ( CBIE CBIE ) and Burton–Miller ( BM BM ) is provided including the computational cost. The proposed models are enhanced with a modified collocation scheme with offsets to Greville abscissae to avoid placing collocation points at the corners. Placing collocation points on a smooth surface enables accurate evaluation of normals for BM BM formulation in addition to straightforward prediction of jump-terms and avoids singularities in O ( 1 ∕ r ) O(1∕r) integrals eliminating the need for polar integration. Furthermore, no additional special treatment is required for the hyper-singular integral while collocating on highly distorted elements, such as those containing sphere poles. Acoustic shape optimization in different mediums (air and water) is performed with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the results are compared with the benchmark solutions from the literature. The reference solutions are obtained with BM BM which deals with higher order singularities and gradient-based optimization, and requires more complicated sensitivity analysis. The obtained results indicate that, CBIE CBIE with PSO is a feasible alternative (except for a small number of fictitious frequencies) which is easier to implement.},

  abstract     = {Graded lattice sandwich structures (GLSSs) enable superior structural performances due to the continuously-varying configurations and properties of lattices in space. This paper proposes a design method for GLSSs by multiscale topology optimization . In this method, the geometrical configuration of a prototype lattice cell (PLC) is described by an explicit topology description function (TDF). Based on some sample lattice cells, a Kriging metamodel is constructed to predict the effective property of each lattice cell. Based on the Kriging metamodel, the thickness optimization of two solid face-sheets and the distribution optimization of lattice cells in core layer are respectively implemented. Driven by their equivalent densities, the configurations of lattice cells with similar topological features are generated by interpolating the shape of the PLC. Then, the graded lattice cells (GLCs) are generated. Using the proposed method, the computational burden involved in design of GLSSs can be reduced significantly. What is more, the manufacturability of GLSSs can be guaranteed by constructing a proper PLC with the help of TDF. Numerical examples in terms of compliance and natural frequency optimization of GLSSs are provided to verify the advantages of the proposed method. Also, bending tests are performed on the GLSSs fabricated by additive manufacturing (AM). The results reveal that GLSSs are stiffer and have larger natural frequencies than the uniform lattice sandwich structures.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous materials such as rocks and composites are comprised of multiple material phases of different sizes and shapes that are randomly distributed through the medium. The random microstructure is typically described by using various statistical descriptors, which include volume fraction , two-point correlation function, and tortuosity, to name a few. Capturing different morphological features, a large number of statistical descriptors are proposed in different research fields, such as material science, geoscience and computational engineering. It is well known that these statistical descriptors are not independent from each other, but until recently it remains unclear what descriptors are more similar or more different. In particular, it is extremely difficult to look for quantified relations between various descriptors, since they are often defined in very different formats. The lack of quantified understanding of descriptors’ relations can cause uncertainties or even systematic errors in heterogeneous materials studies. To address this issue, we propose a novel and generic correlation analysis strategy and establish, for the first time, the quantified relations between various statistical descriptors for heterogeneous materials. Based on data science techniques, our approach consists of three operational steps: data regularization , dimension reduction and correlation analysis. A total of 41 statistical descriptors are collected and analysed in this study, which is readily extensible to include other new descriptors. The generic and quantified correlation results are compared with other established descriptor relations that are obtained from analytical analysis or physical intuition, and good agreements are observed in all cases. The quantified relations between various descriptors are summarized in a single correlation graph, which provides useful guiding information for the characterization, reconstruction and property prediction of heterogeneous materials.},

The proposed NSK is for deterministic data with response noise, aiming at reliability analysis. Various types of uncertainty can be identified by the NSK, including the conditions of known and unknown, constant and variable variances. Moreover, a local sample verification method is established to improve the accuracy of uncertainty quantification. To further improve the accuracy of reliability analysis, an adaptive NSK framework is established with new samples added, and then reliability analysis can be conducted. Through several numerical examples, it can be seen that the NSK always provides the most accurate results with the fewest analysis calls.},

  abstract     = {Mixtures of fluids and granular sediments play an important role in many industrial, geotechnical, and aerospace engineering problems, from waste management and transportation (liquid–sediment mixtures) to dust kick-up below helicopter rotors (gas–sediment mixtures). These mixed flows often involve bulk motion of hundreds of billions of individual sediment particles and can contain both highly turbulent regions and static, non-flowing regions. This breadth of phenomena necessitates the use of continuum simulation methods, such as the material point method (MPM), which can accurately capture these large deformations while also tracking the Lagrangian features of the flow (e.g. the granular surface, elastic stress, etc.). Recent works using two-phase MPM frameworks to simulate these mixtures have shown substantial promise; however, these approaches are hindered by the numerical limitations of MPM when simulating pure fluids. In addition to the well-known particle ringing instability and difficulty defining inflow/outflow boundary conditions, MPM has a tendency to accumulate quadrature errors as materials deform, increasing the rate of overall error growth as simulations progress. In this work, we present an improved, two-phase continuum simulation framework that uses the finite volume method (FVM) to solve the fluid phase equations of motion and MPM to solve the solid phase equations of motion, substantially reducing the effect of these errors and providing better accuracy and stability for long-duration simulations of these mixtures.},

In this work we investigate this limitation through the lens of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and elucidate how PINNs are biased towards learning functions along the dominant eigen-directions of their limiting NTK. Using this observation, we construct novel architectures that employ spatio-temporal and multi-scale random Fourier features, and justify how such coordinate embedding layers can lead to robust and accurate PINN models. Numerical examples are presented for several challenging cases where conventional PINN models fail, including wave propagation and reaction–diffusion dynamics, illustrating how the proposed methods can be used to effectively tackle both forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations with multi-scale behavior.

  abstract     = {This work proposes a Bayesian framework for determining the mechanical properties of carbon based nanocomposites . In particular, Bayesian parameter inference is applied to learn the parameters that characterize the CNT/polymer interface in the microscale . These parameters are associated with great uncertainties and their characterization is a difficult task, since microscale measurements are costly and hard to obtain. To overcome this, the present study introduces a computational framework for updating the prior beliefs on the values of these parameters, by using measurements on large-scale structures comprised of the composite. In terms of modeling, the CNT/polymer interface is formulated with the cohesive zone model and a bilinear bond-slip constitutive law. Typically, predicting the response of such systems requires multiscale analysis approaches, such as the F E 2 FE2 method, employed in this work. Despite its accuracy, F E 2 FE2 is associated with immense computational demands for large-scale problems and, therefore, its application to the Bayesian setting , which requires multiple model evaluations, is prohibitive. To alleviate this cost, a surrogate modeling technique is developed which utilizes artificial neural networks , trained to predict the nonlinear stress–strain relationship of representative volume elements of the microstructure. The data set over which the neural network is trained, is obtained by analyzing a limited number of different RVE configurations using a detailed finite element analysis. The elaborated methodology is first validated through a numerical example from 2D elasticity, which demonstrated its high accuracy and its significant cost reduction capabilities. It is then applied to a more challenging large-scale problem from 3D elasticity. Even though this paper focuses on the characterization of the mechanical properties of composite materials, the proposed numerical procedure is generic and can be straightforwardly applied to other physically analogous phenomena related to nano-composite modeling, such as parameter identification in heat transfer or electrical conduction.},

Particular emphasis is placed on the use of a rational function for the stress degradation that maintains a fixed effective strength with decreasing regularization length. The model is employed to examine crack growth in pure mode-I problems through the generation of crack growth resistance (J-R) curves.

  abstract     = {This article is devoted to a computational plastic periporomechanics model for localized failure in unsaturated porous media assuming passive atmospheric pressure. The computational periporomechanics model is formulated based on the hypothesis that unsaturated porous media can be represented by a collection of two-phase material points with infinitesimal volumes interacting with each other within finite distance. The effective force state concept for solid skeleton deformation and the peridynamic state concept for unsaturated fluid flow are utilized in the coupled integro-differential field equations that have an intrinsic length scale . The unsaturated fluid flow state and effective force state are determined by the fluid potential state and the deformation state of the solid skeleton, respectively. The periporomechanics model is numerically implemented by an implicit two-phase meshfree method in which the message passing interface technique is used for parallel computing . The numerical implementation is validated by simulating classical coupled poromechanics problems and comparing numerical results with analytical solutions and experimental data . Numerical examples under different scenarios are conducted to demonstrate the robustness of the implemented computational periporomechanics model for simulating localized failure in unsaturated porous media as a coupled solid deformation and unsaturated fluid flow problem .},

  abstract     = {In this contribution, the enforcement of uniform traction (UT) and periodic boundary (PB) conditions on arbitrarily generated meshes is analysed in detail, and the derivation of the associated macroscopic consistent tangent operators is described. Two different approaches to impose these boundary conditions are examined: the saddle point solution (SPS) resulting from the Lagrange multiplier method and the condensation method (CM). The numerical treatment required to implement the UT and the PB conditions with both methods is presented for rectangular and cuboidal representative volume elements (RVEs). It is shown that the UT condition only needs rigid body motion to be prescribed since it intrinsically restricts rigid body rotations in the finite strain setting. The application of the SPS to the UT condition leads to a formulation where the Lagrange multipliers are the homogenised stresses, and the macroscopic consistent tangent operator for FE 2 simulations can be directly derived. The enforcement of PB conditions on non-conforming meshes with the mortar approach is also described for the CM and SPS. The need to modify the Lagrange multiplier dual interpolation functions is emphasised to avoid over-constraints. The proposed implementation recovers the conventional PB condition solution when conforming meshes are used. The computational performance of both methods is compared in terms of time and memory requirements. As anticipated, the results obtained for each boundary condition do not depend on the enforcement method employed. With the direct solvers employed, the SPS is more efficient despite increasing the number of unknowns in the linear system of equations.},

  abstract     = {We present a phase-field model for pre-cracked solids with a directional strain decomposition and a stress-driven crack-opening indicator (COI). We first introduce the COI to distinguish the opening and closure of pre-cracks and propose a novel criterion for solids based on the stress component in the direction of the crack surface normal. The stress-driven COI can correctly detect crack opening when principal strains have different signs, which cannot be achieved by most existing phase-field models. We then split the strain tensor into an effective part that induces stress and a crack-induced part that does not result in stress, and suggest a mapping tensor to transform the total strain tensor to the effective strain tensor. The mapping tensor is based on the crack surface normal, the phase variable, and the COI, thus leading to a directional decomposition of the strain. Eventually, we obtain the fourth-order material tangent mapping an arbitrary strain tensor to its stress tensor in the way that the shear stress along the crack surface vanishes and the normal stress in the crack surface normal direction is eliminated when the crack is open. Besides, owing to the directional strain decomposition, the direction where the stiffness decreases is invariant to the current strain once a diffusive crack is generated, which is physically more reasonable. More importantly, the decomposition together with the COI ensures that when the crack is open the spurious Poisson effect associated with the crack-induced strain is eliminated. Numerical examples are provided and the results have demonstrated the capability of the proposed model in simulating material behaviours in the post-fracture stage. Particularly, in a shear test of a squared plate with an initial crack, our model that simulates both the pre-crack and crack growth using the phase-field approach is able to reproduce the crack evolution pattern that has only been obtained in phase-field modelling by considering the initial crack as a geometric notch.},

  abstract     = {Constitutive and closure models play important roles in computational mechanics and computational physics in general. Classical constitutive models for solid and fluid materials are typically local, algebraic equations or flow rules describing the dependence of stress on the local strain and/or strain-rate. Closure models such as those describing Reynolds stress in turbulent flows and laminar–turbulent transition can involve transport PDEs (partial differential equations). Such models play similar roles to constitutive relation, but they are often more challenging to develop and calibrate as they describe nonlocal mappings and often contain many submodels. Inspired by the structure of the exact solutions to linear transport PDEs, we propose a neural network representing a region-to-point mapping to describe such nonlocal constitutive models. The range of nonlocal dependence and the convolution structure are derived from the formal solution to transport equations. The neural network-based nonlocal constitutive model is trained with data. Numerical experiments demonstrate the predictive capability of the proposed method. Moreover, the proposed network learned the embedded submodel without using data from that level, thanks to its interpretable mathematical structure, which makes it a promising alternative to traditional nonlocal constitutive models.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an isogeometric formulation of the perfectly matched layer (PML) for time-harmonic acoustic simulations. The new formulation is a generalization of the conventional locally-conformal PML, in which the NURBS patch supporting the PML domain is transformed from real space to complex space. This is achieved by complex coordinate stretching, based on a stretching vector field indicating the directions in which incident sound waves are absorbed. To solve the difficulty that stretching vectors cannot be defined for control points not lying on the patch, an interpolation method is proposed in which the control-point stretching vectors are calculated by interpolating those at a set of integration points. An automatically matched layer (AML) is also formulated in the isogeometric context. Due to its form-invariant nature, the Helmholtz equation which governs time-harmonic acoustics is kept unchanged in the complex space, except that the Laplacian operator and the sound pressure should be transformed to their complex forms. The performance of the isogeometric PML formulation is discussed through several numerical examples , spanning one to three dimensions and involving both sound radiation and sound scattering problems. It is found that the proposed method presents superior computational accuracy , high geometric adaptivity, and good robustness against challenging geometric features . The geometry-preserving ability inherent in the isogeometric framework brings extra benefits by eliminating geometric errors that are unavoidable in the conventional PML. Meanwhile, these properties are not sensitive to the location of the sound source or the depth of the PML domain. The implementation of the isogeometric PML only requires the replacement of real control-point coordinates by complex ones, making it possible to incorporate the proposed method to various existing numerical routines.},

  abstract     = {In order to optimally design materials, it is crucial to understand the structure–property relations in the material by analyzing the effect of microstructure parameters on the macroscopic properties . In computational homogenization , the microstructure is thus explicitly modeled inside the macrostructure, leading to a coupled two-scale formulation. Unfortunately, the high computational costs of such multiscale simulations often render the solution of design, optimization, or inverse problems infeasible. To address this issue, we propose in this work a non-intrusive reduced basis method to construct inexpensive surrogates for parametrized microscale problems; the method is specifically well-suited for multiscale simulations since the coupled simulation is decoupled into two independent problems: (1) solving the microscopic problem for different (loading or material) parameters and learning a surrogate model from the data; and (2) solving the macroscopic problem with the learned material model. The proposed method has three key features. First, the microscopic stress field can be fully recovered, which is useful for instance for revealing local stress concentrations inside the microstructure. Second, the method is able to accurately predict the stress field for a wide range of material parameters; furthermore, the derivatives of the effective stress with respect to the material parameters are available and can be readily utilized in solving optimization problems . Finally, it is more data efficient, i.e. requiring less training data , as compared to directly performing a regression on the effective stress. To construct the surrogate model, first, a proper orthogonal decomposition is performed on precomputed microscopic stress field snapshots to find a reduced basis for the stress. Second, a regression is employed to infer the coefficients of the reduced basis approximation for any arbitrary parameter value, thus enabling a rapid online evaluation of the microscopic stress. Equipped with the stress field, the effective stress and its partial derivatives can then be derived analytically. For the microstructures in the two test problems considered , the mean approximation error of the effective stress is as low as 0.1% despite using a relatively small training dataset. Embedded into the macroscopic problem, the reduced order model leads to an online computational speed up of approximately three orders of magnitude while maintaining a high accuracy as compared to the FE 2 2 solver.},

It consists of a mixed formulation in both displacement and pressure, where the momentum equation of the continuum is complemented with a pressure equation that handles incompressibility inherently. It is obtained through the deviatoric and volumetric split of the stress, that enables us to solve the problem in the incompressible limit. A linearization of the deviatoric part of the stress is implemented as well. The Variational Multi-Scale method (VMS) is developed based on the orthogonal decomposition of the variables, which damps out spurious pressure fields for piece wise linear tetrahedral elements. Various numerical examples are presented to assess the robustness, accuracy and capabilities of our scheme in bending dominated problems, and for complex geometries.},

  abstract     = {The most commonly used adaptive time stepping technique is mainly based on the simple notion of a local error estimation . Accordingly, a variety of error estimators have mostly been designed for particular algorithms on an algorithm by algorithm selection basis. In this paper, a novel design of a three-time-level general purpose a posteriori error estimator is demonstrated for second-order transient systems, providing features of: (a) being universal for the most popular and entire class of second-order accurate unconditionally stable implicit LMS methods with/without numerical dissipation developed over the past few decades and on newer and optimal designs (the focus is on unconditionally stable implicit LMS methods and not explicit methods); (b) being simple for numerical implementation in the general purpose GS4-2 framework encompassing the entire class of LMS methods that are second order time accurate such that only the acceleration at three time levels is required; (c) preserving the third-order convergence in time for the local error; (d) predicting accurate local error such that the effectivity index is close to unity. In contrast to the existing a posteriori error estimators which are designed for certain algorithms and on algorithm by algorithm basis , the newly proposed approach can be directly applied to all the known and existing and new second-order accurate time integration algorithms in the entire class of the unconditionally stable implicit LMS family under the umbrella of the GS4-2 framework; thereby, the cumbersome work of designing different error estimators for different algorithms is avoided. In particular, the proposed error estimator can be directly applied also to the novel V0 family of algorithms without any limitation. Besides the limited selection of estimators existing within the U0 family of algorithms where most of the traditional methods belong to, the remainder of the algorithms within the U0 family and several others such as the V0 family do not have estimators that can be readily designed as the V0 family of algorithms only exist in the GS4-2 framework, which are entirely novel and new and are highly competitive. The numerical examples of stiff nonlinear spring pendulum, van der Pol equation , wave propagation, and phase-field modeling are described here to show the benefits to the computational cost whilst preserving generality, accuracy, and the like when the adaptive time stepping approach coupled with the proposed error estimator is applied to the transient simulations.},

We first present the fixed-stress split of the nonlinear model and perform convergence studies under spatial and temporal refinements. We then investigate the model assumption of the linear model using numerical solutions. In the case of small permeability, the linear model is not adequate to account for the large deformation of the tissue due to injection. Next, we adopt a nonlinear poro-elastic model to study subcutaneous injection. For large deformation, numerical solutions of the nonlinear model differ significantly from that of the linear model, especially near the injection site.},

A new cell-division scheme is proposed to track the scale transition through the network, and its consistency is ensured by the physics of fitting parameters. Essentially, each microscale node in the bottom layer is described by an ellipsoidal cell with its dimensions back-propagated from the macroscale material point. New crack surfaces in the cell are modeled by enriching cohesive layers, and failure algorithms are developed for crack initiation and evolution in the implicit DMN analysis. Besides studies on a single material point, we apply the multiscale model to concurrent multiscale simulations for the dynamic crush of a particle-reinforced composite tube and various tests on carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites.

We show that the SBEN variational formulation yields to a constrained time–space minimization problem . The cost function depends on stress, displacements, and plastic multiplier fields, which, naturally, leads to a mixed finite element discretization . The details of the solution algorithm are illustrated through the numerical study of the elastoplastic response of the thin and thick pressurized tubes, including inertia effects. Moreover, the balance of momentum is handled using two approaches. Firstly, the Schaefer superposition technique is considered, where the balance of momentum is exactly satisfied. Secondly, the balance of momentum is considered as an optimization constraint and satisfied only at the Gauss integration point level of the finite element problem.

  abstract     = {Computational predictions in cardiovascular medicine have largely relied on explicit models derived from physical and physiological principles. Recently, the application of artificial intelligence in cardiovascular medicine has grown substantially. However, successful application of purely data-driven methods requires a sufficiently large and rich dataset. An alternative to purely data-driven methods is to incorporate prior physics-based knowledge into the learning process to reduce the amount and quality of data necessary for a performant model. We analyzed the benefit of this alternative for prediction of pressure and flow in pathological coronary arteries. We trained fully-connected feed forward neural networks (NN) to predict pressure losses in coronary arteries. The training and test data were obtained by solving the 3D 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes ( 3D iNS 3DiNS ) equations. The coronary flow and various geometrical data were used as inputs to train a purely data-driven NN. We investigated two methods for incorporation of prior physics-based knowledge from a reduced-order model ( ROM ROM ) into NNs that predicted pressure losses across stenotic and healthy coronary segments. First, we trained NNs to predict the discrepancy between the ROM ROM and 3D iNS 3DiNS pressure loss. Second, we augmented the data by including the ROM ROM pressure loss prediction as an input feature to a NN that predicted 3D iNS 3DiNS pressure. Both approaches for incorporation of prior knowledge from the ROM ROM significantly improved prediction of pressure losses across healthy and stenotic segments relative to the purely data-driven approach, especially for lower amounts of data. The incorporation of NN predictions of coronary segment pressure losses in a coronary network model resulted in Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) predictions with error standard deviation of 0.021 with respect to 3D iNS 3DiNS FFR. In comparison, the standard deviation of repeated FFR measurements is 0.018.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization is a powerful tool for designing high-performance structures. However, the structures resulting from topology optimization usually have complex geometries , which makes them difficult or costly to fabricate. As a result, topology optimization is often used for the conceptual design of product structures. In this paper, a topology optimization method considering manufacturing constraints is proposed under the fixed finite element mesh. The minimum length scale and chamfer/round are controlled as required based on the floating projection topology optimization (FPTO) method, where the linear material interpolation scheme is adopted instead and the material 0/1 distribution is realized by applying sequential constraints on the elemental design variables through the floating projection. The minimum length scale is strictly controlled with the help of the structural skeleton , which is extracted from the structural topology by using a graphic thinning algorithm. Meanwhile, boundary filtering is proposed by using a variable filtering radius to control chamfers and rounds. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed topology optimization algorithm is effective for designing the stiffest structures with smooth boundaries, desired minimum length scale and chamfers/rounds, so as to improve their manufacturability.},

  abstract     = {One of the obstacles hindering the scaling-up of the initial successes of machine learning in practical engineering applications is the dependence of the accuracy on the size and quality of the database that “drives” the algorithms. Incorporating the already-known physical laws into the training process can significantly reduce the request for data. In this study, we establish a neural network-based computational framework to characterize the finite deformation of elastic plates, which in classic theories is described by the Föppl–von Kármán (FvK) equations with a set of boundary conditions (BCs). A neural network is constructed by taking the spatial coordinates as the input and the displacement field as the output to approximate the exact solution of the FvK equations. The physical information (PDEs, BCs, and potential energy) is then incorporated into the loss function, and a pseudo dataset is sampled without knowing the exact solution to finally train the neural network. The accuracy of the modeling framework is carefully examined by applying it to four different loading cases: in-plane tension with non-uniformly distributed stretching forces, in-plane central-hole tension, out-of-plane deflection, and buckling under compression. Three ways of formulating the loss function are compared: (1) purely data-driven, (2) PDE-based, and (3) energy-based. Through the comparison with the finite element simulations, it is found that all the three approaches can characterize the elastic deformation of plates with a satisfactory accuracy if trained with a proper strategy in terms of sampling size and resolution. Compared with incorporating the PDEs and BCs in the loss, using the total potential energy shows certain advantage in terms of the simplicity of hyperparameter tuning and the computational efficiency.},

In IBM, all external boundaries and internal contacts of an object are represented by embedded surfaces inside a Cartesian mesh, which need not conform to the grid lines. The contact constraints consist of the non-penetrability condition and Coulomb’s friction law , which are discretized using special interpolation stencils and enforced via penalty parameters. The resulting nonlinear system depends on displacement unknowns only. To solve it, we use the Newton method but find that it diverges frequently. To understand the divergence pattern, we analyze a simplified 2-cell problem and show that the global convergence of Newton cannot be ensured for any choice of penalty parameters. We thus propose a modified Newton solver, which guarantees convergence for the 2-cell problem and is numerically verified to converge for all the challenging simulations considered herein. While both 1st- and 2nd-order variants of IBM, in displacement unknowns, are proposed, the modified Newton solver applies only to the 1st-order variant.},

  abstract     = {Geometrical complexity is typical of missile and reentry systems, small-scale devices with intrinsic milli-to-micro scale features, or in general topology-rich systems. Additionally, at high altitudes or at microscales, when the flow becomes rarefied, the conventional continuum/macroscopic equations produce unsatisfactory results. A microscopic/kinetic description becomes necessary. In this work, we introduce isogeometric (IG) kinetic schemes (KS) for the full Boltzmann equation and related kinetic models (Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK), Ellipsoidal statistical BGK, and Shakov). These schemes are specifically aimed for modeling flows in topologically complex “multi-patch” geometries such as those constructed using computer-aided geometric design tools; high order accurate; unconditionally time-stable (as per our tests) following generalized- α α method; non-linearly stable following streamlined upwind Petrov–Galerkin method applied at every patch level with patch-to-patch coupling enforced either strongly by constraining the interface using single degree of freedom, or weakly using numerical fluxes as in discontinuous Galerkin (useful because the underlying system is first order in space); amenable to nearly-linear parallel efficiency owing to the six-dimensional nature of Boltzmann equation, wherein the convection and collision can be, respectively, performed simultaneously over velocity and physical spaces. In particular, since the surface representation is exact in IG, when surface properties are to be computed, which is often the case in aerodynamic applications, these schemes perform well. A series of verification tests for 1D/2D/3D-3V initial–boundary value and boundary-value flow problems, involving momentum, energy, and diffusive transport, including problems posed on non-conforming domains/patches, is performed to illustrate the stability and accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {A novel numerical formulation for solving fluid–structure interaction (FSI) problems is proposed where the fluid field is spatially discretized using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and the structural field using the finite element method (FEM). As compared to fully mesh- or grid-based FSI frameworks, due to the Lagrangian nature of SPH this framework can be easily extended to account for more complex fluids consisting of multiple phases and dynamic phase transitions. Moreover, this approach facilitates the handling of large deformations of the fluid domain respectively the fluid–structure interface without additional methodological and computational efforts. In particular, to achieve an accurate representation of interaction forces between fluid particles and structural elements also for strongly curved interface geometries, the novel sliding boundary particle approach is proposed to ensure full support of SPH particles close to the interface. The coupling of the fluid and the structural field is based on a Dirichlet–Neumann partitioned approach, where the fluid field is the Dirichlet partition with prescribed interface displacements and the structural field is the Neumann partition subject to interface forces. To overcome instabilities inherent to weakly coupled schemes an iterative fixed-point coupling scheme is employed. Several numerical examples in form of well-known benchmark tests are considered to validate the accuracy, stability, and robustness of the proposed formulation. Finally, the filling process of a highly flexible thin-walled balloon-like container is studied, representing a model problem close to potential application scenarios of the proposed scheme in the field of biomechanics.},

  abstract     = {The present paper extends the FEM-Cluster based Analysis (FCA) method to the efficient prediction of effective properties of porous materials in the nonlinear range. Different from the traditional methods of homogenization or mean field theory, this new approach does not fill the pore with low modulus materials which causes numerical inaccuracy and convergence difficulties as reported in several literature. With no material filling in pores, the average strain theorem and the Hill–Mandel condition which is the basis of the Representative Volume Element (RVE) method for the prediction of effective properties of heterogeneous materials is almost impossible to implement. Furthermore, because of the lack of pore strain information, the compatibility condition of cluster strains cannot be applied in the incremental analysis of reduced order model in the nonlinear stage. In the present study we have overcome these difficulties by several approaches. First, it is found that the energy equivalence principle provides a more suitable basis for effective properties prediction of porous materials. Second, the self-equilibrium cluster stress field obtained from the interaction matrix and the cluster-based minimum complementary energy in FCA can be successfully applied to the incremental analysis of reduced order model in the nonlinear stage instead of the strain compatibility condition. However, due to the errors introduced by averaging stress and strain over each cluster, the interaction matrix becomes non-singular and the self-equilibrium properties of the cluster stress field generated from the interaction matrix become very poor. Fortunately, the most exciting discovery of the present study is that we have found a way to recover the singularity of the interaction matrix by minimizing its rank on the premise that the elastic energy norm of RVE remains unchanged within the given tolerance. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

All equations follow consistently from stationary of a rate potential and yield a physically sound homogenization. Static and kinematic compatibility at the material interfaces are naturally guaranteed. In order to enforce admissibility of the phase field parameter, nonlinear complementary conditions are considered and embedded into the algorithmic formulation. Eventually, the variationally consistent framework also features topology optimization automatically. In contrast to other approaches that start from the optimization problem, the present formulation starts from a more comprehensive energy potential. This perspective allows to explore the natural physical mechanisms that control the system’s compliance (e.g., interface evolution) and that drive maximum structural performance (changing the direction of the evolution equation with respect to the phase field parameter). Furthermore, this perspective efficiently couples the physical constraints (e.g., mass and momentum conservation). Energetically optimized microstructures and an optimized beam structure illustrate the applicability as well as the numerical performance of the elaborated framework.},

The algorithm is altogether a new version, designed to overcome the local optima stagnation and poor exploration properties of DE and NMRA respectively. The new algorithm has been designed by incorporating DE into the worker phase of NMRA while keeping all the major parameters of both the algorithms intact. In order to make the algorithm self-adaptive, seven different mutation strategies have been explored for different parameters, and it was found that Lévy based scaling factor and sigmoidal mating factor are the best parameters. Apart from these parameters, adaptive properties have been introduced to all other parameters so that no user-based initialization of parameters is required. For performance evaluation, the proposed SaDN is tested on CEC 2005, CEC 2014 and CEC 2019 benchmark problems and comparison is performed for variable population size and higher dimension sizes. From the experimental results, it has been found that the proposed SaDN performs better with respect to other major state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. Apart from that, SaDN is subjected to three engineering design problems and compared with other algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate that SaDN shows better performance and is statistically significant in terms of Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test, Freidman’s test and computational complexity.

An adaptive Gaussian process modeling technique is used to represent the “expensive-to-evaluate” likelihood function, and the unknown posterior probability distribution is represented using a Gaussian mixture model. The evidence lower bound (ELBO) and its gradients can be computed analytically using the built Gaussian process and mixture models. The unknown parameters in the Gaussian mixture model can be identified by maximizing the value of ELBO. The stochastic gradient descent method is applied to perform the optimization. Numerical studies on an eight-story shear-type building and a simply supported beam are conducted to verify the accuracy and efficiency of using the proposed approach for probabilistic model updating and damage identification. Experimental studies on a laboratory steel frame structure are also conducted to validate the proposed approach. Results demonstrate that the posterior probability distributions of the unknown structural parameters can be successfully identified, and reliable probabilistic model updating and damage identification can be achieved.},

  abstract     = {High fidelity thermal multi-phase flow simulations are in much demand to reveal the multi-scale and multi-physics phenomena in metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes, yet accurate and robust predictions remain challenging. In this paper, we present a novel computational framework by mixing interface-capturing/interface-tracking methods for simulating the thermal multi-phase flows in metal AM applications, focusing on better handling the gas-metal interface, where AM physics, such as phase transitions and laser-material interactions, mainly takes place. The framework, built on level set method and variational multi-scale formulation (VMS), features three major contributions: (1) a simple computational geometry-based re-initialization approach, which maintains excellent signed distance property on unstructured meshes, re-constructs an explicit representation of gas-metal interface from the level set, and facilitates the treatment of the multiple laser reflections during keyhole evolution in AM processes; (2) a fully coupled VMS formulation for thermal multi-phase governing equations, including Navier-Stokes, level set convection, and thermodynamics with melting, solidification, evaporation, and interfacial force models; and (3) a three-level recursive preconditioning technique to enhance the robustness of linear solvers. We first compare the geometry-based re-initialization with the Eikonal partial differential equation (PDE)-based approach on two benchmark problems on level set convection and bubble dynamics. The comparison shows the geometry-based approach attains equivalent and even better performance on key criteria than the PDE-based counterpart. We then apply the developed framework to simulate two AM experiments, which Argonne National Laboratory has recently conducted using in-situ high-speed, high-energy x-ray imaging. The proposed framework’s accuracy is assessed by thoroughly comparing the simulated results against experimental measurements on various quantities. We also report important quantities that experiments cannot measure to show the modeling capability.},

To deal with the strong coupling of the problem, we first consider a fully decoupled and linear semi-discrete scheme, in which we only need to solve several linearized sub-problems at each time step for the velocity, pressure, oxygen concentration and cell density, respectively. Then, based on the linear finite element method for the spatial discretization, the flux-corrected transport algorithm is extended to the oxygen concentration and cell density sub-problems to preserve their positivity. Finally, we show a series of numerical examples to verify its efficiency. We also find that better simulation can be obtained by regularizing the cut-off function and setting a random initial cell density in the equations.},

The method removes the outliers appearing in the high-frequency region of the approximate spectrum when using the Cp−1,p -th ( p≥3 ) order isogeometric elements. We focus on the classical Laplacian (Dirichlet) eigenvalue problem in 1D to illustrate the idea and then use the tensor-product structure to generate the stiffness and mass matrices for multidimensional problems. To remove the outliers, we penalize the higher-order derivatives from both the solution and test spaces at the domain boundary. Intuitively, we construct a better approximation by weakly imposing features of the exact solution. Effectively, we add terms to the variational formulation at the boundaries with minimal extra-computational cost. We then generalize the idea to remove the outliers for the isogeometric analysis of the Neumann eigenvalue problem (for p≥2 ). The boundary penalization does not change the test and solution spaces . In the limiting case , when the penalty goes to infinity, we perform the dispersion analysis of C2 cubic elements for the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem and C1 quadratic elements for the Neumann eigenvalue problem. We obtain the analytical eigenpairs for the resulting matrix eigenvalue problems .

  abstract     = {A three-dimensional framework for low-cycle fatigue analysis of polycrystalline aggregates is proposed in this work. First, a cohesive law coupling plasticity and damage is developed for modelling cycle-by-cycle degradation of material interfaces up to complete de-cohesion and failure. The law may model both quasi-static degradation under increasing monotonic load and degradation under cyclic loading, through a coupled plasticity-damage model whose activation and flow rules are formulated in a thermodynamically consistent framework. The proposed interface laws have been then implemented and coupled with a multi-region boundary element formulation, with the aim of analysing low-cycle intergranular fatigue in polycrystalline aggregates. The boundary element formulation allows expressing the micro-mechanical problem in terms of grain-boundary displacements and tractions only, which are the quantities directly entering the cohesive laws, thus simplifying the coupling of the two tools. After assessing the response of an individual interface, to both quasi-static and cyclic loads , the coupled framework has been employed for the computational investigation of low-cycle degradation in fully-3D and pseudo-3D, or 2D columnar, polycrystalline aggregates, assuming that the degradation process remains confined in the intergranular regions. The discussed results show the potential of the developed formulation for multiscale materials modelling , which may find future application in the multiscale design of engineering structures subjected to complex loads and degradation processes, and for computational micromechanics , which may find direct application in the design and analysis of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS).},

Two peridynamic parameters, corresponding to the normal stiffness and the tangential stiffness of the bond, respectively, are introduced to ensure that the strain energy obtained from the proposed peridynamic model is consistent to that from the continuum viscoelastic mechanics. A novel failure criterion is developed to describe the dynamic progressive fracture of quasi-brittle materials. Damage functions and dynamic strengths of the bond are introduced to capture loading-rate effects for solid materials. The proposed model is verified by comparing its predictions with those from experimental observations. Numerical examples demonstrate that the nonlinear viscoelastic behaviors of quasi-brittle materials such as relaxation, softening–hardening behaviors as well as mix-mode fractures under dynamic loads with different loading rates are well captured by the proposed model.},

A coupled thermofluidic and mechanical model with a design-dependent thermal convection is considered at the macro design scale, while the numerical homogenization and surrogate model based approaches are employed to characterize the effective thermoelastic properties of predefined quasi-periodic structure patterns at the sub-level scale. Besides, a multi-material interpolation scheme based on the Porous Anisotropic Material with Penalization (PAMP) is used for topology optimization. The proposed approach can be applied to design the multi-scale topology of the lightweight load-bearing structures, of which the thermal shielding and dissipation are key performance indices in addition to the mechanical properties. The optimized designs exhibit better thermomechanical behaviors compared to those from the mono-scale solid based counterpart at a similar computational cost because of the larger design freedom of the multi-scale composite configuration. Several design examples and verification results are given to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying the uncertainty in model parameters and output is a critical component in model-driven decision support systems for groundwater management. This paper presents a novel algorithmic approach which fuses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Machine Learning methods to accelerate uncertainty quantification for groundwater flow models. We formulate the governing mathematical model as a Bayesian inverse problem, considering model parameters as a random process with an underlying probability distribution. MCMC allows us to sample from this distribution, but it comes with some limitations: it can be prohibitively expensive when dealing with costly likelihood functions, subsequent samples are often highly correlated, and the standard Metropolis–Hastings algorithm suffers from the curse of dimensionality. This paper designs a Metropolis–Hastings proposal which exploits a deep neural network (DNN) approximation of a groundwater flow model, to significantly accelerate MCMC sampling. We modify a delayed acceptance (DA) model hierarchy, whereby proposals are generated by running short subchains using an inexpensive DNN approximation, resulting in a decorrelation of subsequent fine model proposals. Using a simple adaptive error model, we estimate and correct the bias of the DNN approximation with respect to the posterior distribution on-the-fly. The approach is tested on two synthetic examples; a isotropic two-dimensional problem, and an anisotropic three-dimensional problem. The results show that the cost of uncertainty quantification can be reduced by up to 50% compared to single-level MCMC, depending on the precomputation cost and accuracy of the employed DNN.},

  abstract     = {We present a two-scale topology optimization framework for the design of macroscopic bodies with an optimized elastic response, which is achieved by means of a spatially-variant cellular architecture on the microscale. The chosen spinodoid topology for the cellular network on the microscale (which is inspired by natural microstructures forming during spinodal decomposition) admits a seamless spatial grading as well as tunable elastic anisotropy, and it is parametrized by a small set of design parameters associated with the underlying Gaussian random field. The macroscale boundary value problem is discretized by finite elements, which in addition to the displacement field continuously interpolate the microscale design parameters. By assuming a separation of scales, the local constitutive behavior on the macroscale is identified as the homogenized elastic response of the microstructure based on the local design parameters. As a departure from classical FE 2 2 -type approaches, we replace the costly microscale homogenization by a data-driven surrogate model, using deep neural networks, which accurately and efficiently maps design parameters onto the effective elasticity tensor. The model is trained on homogenized stiffness data obtained from numerical homogenization by finite elements. As an added benefit, the machine learning setup admits automatic differentiation, so that sensitivities (required for the optimization problem) can be computed exactly and without the need for numerical derivatives – a strategy that holds promise far beyond the elastic stiffness. Therefore, this framework presents a new opportunity for multiscale topology optimization based on data-driven surrogate models.},

The LGDM is a micromechanics-based method that avoids spurious damage growth and incorrect damage initiation observed in conventional gradient damage method (CGDM). However, in the LGDM, a cracked/discontinuous domain is not fully realized due to its continuous nature, even at high damage. This leads to numerous non-physical effects in LGDM like high strains, severe stress oscillations and incorrect representation of secondary variables . These shortcomings are rectified in the combined continuous–discontinuous (XFEM + LGDM) approach by introducing XFEM at the end of damage evolution to impose a discontinuous crack in the domain. To simplify the implementation, a fully coupled LGDM is converted to a decoupled LGDM using an operator-split (staggered) methodology. It is observed from numerical examples that the decoupling of LGDM leads to a reduction in the computational effort without compromising accuracy. Besides, the XFEM+LGDM approach avoids use of cohesive zone modelling necessary in existing XFEM+CGDM approaches. Moreover, the proposed method (combined XFEM + LGDM) is also investigated in the multi-physical framework of thermoelasticity. The numerical results reveal that the shortcomings mentioned earlier are rectified in a physically consistent manner under mode I and mixed-mode conditions.},

First of all, the elastostatics Kelvin fundamental solution is used as the fundamental solution of the problem. In order to preserve the advantage of IGABEM, i.e. only boundary is discretized, the radial integration method (RIM) is applied to transform the domain integral caused by the material heterogeneity and the inertia term into an equivalent boundary integral by means of applied points. In addition, using a simple transformation method, the rigid-body technique is applied to solve the strongly singular integrals , and the Telles scheme and the power series expansion method are used to solve the weakly singular integrals in RI-IGABEM respectively. Furthermore, the generalized- α α method is adopted to solve the time domain problem, which can improve the stability of numerical results by effectively filtering out the false response of high frequency and minimizing the attenuation of low frequency response. A number of 2D and 3D examples, such as those with homogeneous materials, functionally gradient materials, and material defects and inclusions, are used to demonstrate the ability of the scheme to simulate the elastodynamic problems.},

Here, boundary layer development is efficiently captured using a set of exponential functions derived from fundamental solutions to the problems considered. Results demonstrate smooth, numerical solutions with convergence observed to be in relative agreement with expected convergence rates for elliptic problems. Furthermore, significantly improved error levels are observed compared to traditional finite element formulations. Additional insights in improvements offered by the generalized finite element method are illuminated using a consistent decomposition of the variational multiscale method, enabling comparison with classical stabilized methods.},

In this new approach, the phase field method is firstly utilized to obtain the structural responses of crack growth, which are further preserved as images. Then, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is constructed to establish a predictive model . The proposed approach is a hybrid model of both physical and data-driven techniques, which can build a bridge between traditional computational fracture mechanics and deep learning algorithms. Several numerical cases are studied to evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed approach.

However, the approach is computationally demanding as it requires a very high resolution, both in space and time to resolve the fracture characteristics . In this paper, a novel adaptive phase field method is proposed for modelling quasi-static crack propagation in brittle materials . The adaptive refinement is based on the stability analysis which is combined with the quadtree decomposition. The stability analysis is based on a linear perturbation method that is used herein to determine the onset of fracture initiation on the fly. Three standard benchmark problems are solved to show the efficiency and the robustness of the proposed method. It is shown that the proposed framework does not require any post processing technique for adaptive refinement and yet is effective.},

  abstract     = {The multiscale hybrid mixed finite element method (MHM-H(div)), previously developed for Darcy’s problems, is extended for coupled flow/pressure and transport system of two-phase flow equations on heterogeneous media under the effect of gravitational segregation. It is combined with an implicit transport solver in a sequential fully implicit (SFI) manner. The MHM-H(div) method is designed to cope with the complex geometry and inherent multiscale nature of the phenomena. The discretizations are based on a general domain partition formed by polyhedral subregions , where a hierarchy of meshes and approximation spaces are considered. The multiscale approach is applied to the flux/pressure kernel making use of coarse scale normal fluxes between subregions (trace variable). The fine-scale features inside each subregion are determined by resolving completely independent local Neumann problems , the boundary conditions being set by the trace variable, by the mixed finite element method using fine flux and pressure representations. These properties imply that the MHM-H(div) can be interpreted as a classical mixed formulation of the model problem in the whole domain, based on a H ( div ) H(div) -conforming space with normal components over the macro-partition interfaces constrained by the trace space, and showing divergence compatibility with the pressure space. Consequently, local mass conservation is observed at the micro-scale elements inside the subregions, an essential property for flows in heterogeneous media, and divergence-free constraint strongly enforced for incompressible flows . The efficient use of static condensation leads to a global system to be solved only in terms of primary degrees of freedom associated with the trace variable and of a piecewise constant pressure for each subregion. This procedure allows a substantial reduction of the dominant computational costs associated with the flux/pressure kernel embedded in the numerical model. An iterative coupling technique is adopted to solve the two-phase flow equations using a shared integration point memory implementation model. At each SFI time step, the efficiency iterative method for the transport equations is improved using a Quasi-Newton method with a simple but effective nonlinear acceleration. The numerical examples show that the proposed scheme is able to solve challenging coupled flow and transport problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a deep learning framework for epidemiology system identification from noisy and sparse observations with quantified uncertainty. The proposed approach employs an ensemble of deep neural networks to infer the time-dependent reproduction number of an infectious disease by formulating a tensor-based multi-step loss function that allows us to efficiently calibrate the model on multiple observed trajectories. The method is applied to a mobility and social behavior-based SEIR model of COVID-19 spread. The model is trained on Google and Unacast mobility data spanning a period of 66 days, and is able to yield accurate future forecasts of COVID-19 spread in 203 US counties within a time-window of 15 days. Interestingly, a sensitivity analysis that assesses the importance of different mobility and social behavior parameters reveals that attendance of close places, including workplaces, residential, and retail and recreational locations, has the largest impact on the effective reproduction number. The model enables us to rapidly probe and quantify the effects of government interventions, such as lock-down and re-opening strategies. Taken together, the proposed framework provides a robust workflow for data-driven epidemiology model discovery under uncertainty and produces probabilistic forecasts for the evolution of a pandemic that can judiciously provide information for policy and decision making.

  abstract     = {Incompressible flow problems with nonlinear viscosity , as they often appear in biomedical and industrial applications, impose several numerical challenges related to regularity requirements, boundary conditions, matrix preconditioning , among other aspects. In particular, standard split-step or projection schemes decoupling velocity and pressure are not as efficient for generalised Newtonian fluids , since the additional terms due to the non-zero viscosity gradient couple all velocity components again. Moreover, classical pressure correction methods are not consistent with the non-Newtonian setting, which can cause numerical artifacts such as spurious pressure boundary layers. Although consistent reformulations have been recently developed, the additional projection steps needed for the viscous stress tensor incur considerable computational overhead. In this work, we present a new time-splitting framework that handles such important issues, leading to an efficient and accurate numerical tool. Two key factors for achieving this are an appropriate explicit–implicit treatment of the viscous and convective nonlinearities , as well as the derivation of a pressure Poisson problem with fully consistent boundary conditions and finite-element-suitable regularity requirements. We present first- and higher-order stepping schemes tailored for this purpose, as well as various numerical examples showcasing the stability, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework.},

In order to reduce the number of expensive micro-scale iterations, the present contribution presents a monolithic FE 2 scheme, for which the displacements at the micro-scale and at the macro-scale are solved for in a common Newton–Raphson loop. In this case, the linear system of equations within each iteration is solved by static condensation, so that only very limited modifications to the conventional, staggered scheme are necessary. The proposed monolithic FE 2 algorithm is implemented into the commercial FE code Abaqus . Benchmark examples demonstrate that the monolithic scheme saves up to ≈ ≈ 60% of computational costs.},

Due to a tailored combination of the assumed natural strain (ANS) as well as the enhanced assumed strain (EAS) method, the most important locking phenomena are eliminated. A polynomial approximation of the kinematic as well as the constitutively dependent quantities within the weak forms enables the definition of a suitable hourglass stabilization. In this way, the element stiffness contributions coming from the hourglass stabilization can be determined analytically, since they represent polynomials with respect to Cartesian coordinates .

  abstract     = {The evolution of local defects such as dislocations and cracks often determines the performance of engineering materials. For a proper description and understanding of these phenomena, one typically needs to descend to a very small scale, at which the discreteness of the material emerges. Fully-resolved discrete numerical models, although highly accurate, often suffer from excessive computing expenses when used for application-scale considerations. More efficient multiscale simulation procedures are thus called for, capable of capturing the most significant microscopic phenomena while being computationally tractable for macroscopic problems. Two broad classes of methods are available in the literature, which conceptually differ significantly. The first class considers the fully-resolved discrete system, which is subsequently reduced through suitable mathematical tools such as projection and reduced integration. The second class of methods first homogenizes the discrete system into an equivalent continuum formulation, into which the main phenomena are added through specific enrichments. This paper provides a thorough comparison of the two different modeling philosophies in terms of their theory, accuracy, and performance. To this goal, two typical representatives are adopted: the Quasicontinuum method for the first class, and an effective continuum with an embedded cohesive zone model for the second class. Two examples are employed to demonstrate capabilities and limitations of both approaches. In particular, dislocation propagation and pile-up against a coherent phase boundary is considered at the nanoscale level, whereas a three-point bending test of a concrete specimen with crack propagation is considered at the macroscale level. In both cases, the accuracy of the two methods is compared against the fully-resolved discrete reference model. It is shown that whereas continuum models with embedded cohesive zones offer good performance to accuracy ratios, they might fail to capture unexpected more complex mechanical behavior such as dislocation reflection or crack branching. The Quasicontinuum method, on the other hand, offers more flexibility and higher accuracy at a slightly higher computational cost.},

In this paper, we present an on-the-fly reduced order modeling of reactive as well as passive transport equations to reduce the computational cost. The presented approach seeks a low-rank decomposition of the species to three time-dependent components: (i) a set of orthonormal spatial modes, (ii) a low-rank factorization of the instantaneous species correlation matrix, and (iii) a set of orthonormal species modes, which represents a low-dimensional time-dependent manifold . Our approach bypasses the need to solve the full-dimensional species to generate high-fidelity data — as it is commonly performed in data-driven dimension reduction techniques such as the principle component analysis. Instead, the low-rank components are directly extracted from the species transport equation. The evolution equations for the three components are obtained from optimality conditions of a variational principle. The time-dependence of the three components enables an on-the-fly adaptation of the low-rank decomposition to transient changes in the species. Several demonstration cases of reduced order modeling of passive and reactive transport equations are presented.},

Here, we investigate material optimization and design to improve fracture behavior of composite structures under quasi-static conditions. The rate-independent structural problem considering cohesive fracture is ill-posed in its original form due to the non-unique nature of the solution. This renders the use of gradient-based optimization algorithms problematic. To overcome this issue, we introduce viscous regularization and a local approximation of the cohesive law into the governing state equations , and study the impact with the help of interfacial fracture of composite structures consisting of two or more materials. The fracture problem is then integrated into a material optimization framework. We study the effect of viscous regularization on the global landscape of the proposed objective function using a 2-dimensional delamination example with one design parameter and discuss difficulties resulting from the stabilization of inherently unstable crack states. In view of these issues, we finally propose considering multiple state problems, each limited to a single crack, with different predefined crack paths. In the end, we optimize the orientations of orthotropic inclusions embedded in a double-cantilever beam for the worst case of the potential crack paths.},

The method is based on the lowest order virtual element, in which the degrees of freedom for the velocity are simply given by the evaluations of velocity at the mesh vertices and the average values of normal velocity across the mesh edges, and the pressure is approximated by piecewise constants. In the standard virtual element scheme, an average of nodal values of test function is used in the approximation of right hand side to obtain the computability and achieve optimal approximation. However, such standard scheme involves a pressure contribution in the velocity error. To achieve the pressure-independent velocity approximation, we define an H ( div ) H(div) -conforming velocity reconstruction operator for the velocity test function and propose the modified scheme by employing it in the approximation of right-hand-side source term assembling. Compared with the standard scheme, the stiffness matrix keeps unchanged and only the approximation of the right hand side changes. The error estimates for the velocity and pressure have been proved, which imply that the velocity error is independent of pressure.

  abstract     = {We show that in the variational multiscale framework, the weak enforcement of essential boundary conditions via Nitsche’s method corresponds directly to a particular choice of projection operator. The consistency, symmetry and penalty terms of Nitsche’s method all originate from the fine-scale closure dictated by the corresponding scale decomposition. As a result of this formalism, we are able to determine the exact fine-scale contributions in Nitsche-type formulations. In the context of the advection–diffusion equation, we develop a residual-based model that incorporates the non-vanishing fine scales at the Dirichlet boundaries. This results in an additional boundary term with a new model parameter. We then propose a parameter estimation strategy for all parameters involved that is also consistent for higher-order basis functions. We illustrate with numerical experiments that our new augmented model mitigates the overly diffusive behavior that the classical residual-based fine-scale model exhibits in boundary layers at boundaries with weakly enforced essential conditions.},

  abstract     = {We propose an isogeometric approximation of the equations describing the propagation of an electrophysiologic stimulus over a thin cardiac tissue with the subsequent muscle contraction. The underlying method relies on the monodomain model for the electrophysiological sub-problem. This requires the solution of a reaction–diffusion equation over a surface in the three-dimensional space. Exploiting the benefits of the high-order NURBS basis functions within a curvilinear framework, the method is found to reproduce complex excitation patterns with a limited number of degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the curvilinear description of the diffusion term provides a flexible and easy-to-implement approach for general surfaces. At the discrete level, two different approaches for integrating the ionic current are investigated in the isogeometric analysis framework. The electrophysiological stimulus is converted into a mechanical load employing the well-established active strain approach. The multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor is grafted into a classical finite elasticity weak formulation, providing the necessary tensor expressions in curvilinear coordinates. The derived expressions provide what is needed to implement the active strain approach in standard finite-element solvers without resorting to dedicated formulations. Such a formulation is valid for general three-dimensional geometries and isotropic hyperelastic materials. The formulation is then restricted to Kirchhoff–Love shells by means of the static condensation of the material tensor. The purely elastic response of the structure is investigated with simple static test-cases of thin shells undergoing different active strain patterns. Eventually, various numerical tests performed with a staggered scheme illustrate that the coupled electromechanical model can capture the excitation–contraction mechanism over thin tissues and reproduce complex curvature variations.},

These methods are based on a subcell flux corrected transport (FCT) methodology that involves blending a high-order target scheme with a robust, low-order invariant domain preserving method that is obtained using a graph viscosity technique. The new low-order discretizations are based on sparse stencils which do not increase with the polynomial degree of the high-order DG method. As a result, the accuracy of the low-order method does not degrade when used with high-order target methods. The method is applied to both scalar conservation laws, for which the discrete maximum principle is naturally enforced, and to systems of conservation laws such as the Euler equations , for which positivity of density and a minimum principle for specific entropy are enforced. Numerical results are presented on a number of benchmark test cases.},

The proposed approach weakly enforces the continuity of the solution at patch interfaces through a dual mortar method and can be applied to both conforming and non-conforming discretizations. As the employed dual basis functions have local supports and satisfy the biorthogonality property, the resulting stiffness matrix is sparse. In addition, the coupling accuracy is optimal because the dual basis possesses the polynomial reproduction property. We also formulate the continuity constraints through the Rodrigues’ rotation operator which gives a unified framework for coupling patches that are intersected with G 1 G1 continuity as well as patches that meet at a kink. Several linear and nonlinear examples demonstrated the performance and robustness of the proposed coupling techniques.},

  abstract     = {Modeling and simulating interfacial shear load transfer in fiber-reinforced composites is crucial for characterizing fiber pullout behaviors. Addressing this complicated topic, this work presents a novel phase-field framework to simulate interfacial failure behaviors in fiber-reinforced cementitious composites. Specifically, a comprehensive constitutive model is proposed to describe both interfacial debonding and frictional slipping, which accounts for snubbing and bonding effects in fiber-reinforced composites. The developed model has the following novel features: (1) The model can simultaneously characterize interfacial debonding and frictional slipping, and thus thoroughly describe the fiber-reinforcing mechanisms in quasi-brittle solids; (2) An interfacial slipping degradation theory is implemented in the model to describe interfacial slippage and stress degradation during slipping; and (3) The model effectively and precisely incorporates the friction law with interface normal vectors. The developed model is successfully validated against experimental and simulated results. Finally, a series of parameter studies are undertaken to provide strategic insights to improve the mechanical properties of the composites. The proposed method adds efficiency and robustness to the study of features and fracture mechanisms of fiber reinforcements in complex fiber–cement systems.},

In particular, the new SPH scheme computes mesh-free and local high order accurate polynomials in space and time to evaluate numerical fluxes at the midpoint between two interaction particles with a proper Riemann solver within the general SPH framework of Vila (1999) for nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws . The new scheme has been carefully tested against reference solutions for both the compressible Euler and the magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The capability of the proposed scheme to accurately capture shocks and rarefaction waves for 1D and 2D problems with minimal amount of diffusion has been demonstrated. Via numerical evidence it has been shown that the new fully-discrete one-step ADER-WENO-SPH method is computationally more efficient than WENO-SPH schemes based on classical Runge–Kutta time-stepping. This is mainly due to the fact that with ADER timestepping the expensive stencil and neighbor search needs to be done only once per time step, while with Runge–Kutta time integrators the neighbor and stencil search is needed in each Runge–Kutta stage again.},

  abstract     = {A novel mathematical model for fiber-reinforced materials is proposed. It is based on a 1-dimensional beam model for the thin fiber structures, a flexible and general 3-dimensional elasticity model for the matrix and an overlapping domain decomposition approach. From a computational point of view, this is motivated by the fact that matrix and fibers can be easily meshed independently. Our main interest is in fiber-reinforced polymers where the Young modulus is quite different. Thus the modeling error from the overlapping approach is of no significance. The coupling conditions acknowledge both, the forces and the moments of the beam model and transfer them to the background material. A suitable static condensation procedure is applied to remove the beam balance equations. The condensed system then forms our starting point for a numerical approximation in terms of isogeometric analysis. The choice of our discrete basis functions of higher regularity is motivated by the fact, that as a result of the static condensation, we obtain second gradient terms in fiber direction. Eventually, a series of benchmark tests demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the proposed methodology. As a proof-of-concept, we show that our new model is able to capture bending, torsion and shear dominated situations.},

  abstract     = {It will be practically useful to know the mechanical properties of granular materials by only taking a photo of particles. This study attempts to deal with this challenge by developing a novel deep learning-based modelling strategy. In this strategy, the convolutional neural network (CNN) as image identification algorithm is first used to extract the particle information (particle size distribution PSD and morphology) based on the image of a granular sample, and the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural network is employed to train the model of reproducing mechanical behaviours and induced fabric evolutions of the sample with corresponding particle information. The datasets of images of samples are generated using discrete element method, and the datasets of mechanical properties together with fabric evolutions are obtained through numerical tests on corresponding samples. As a preliminary attempt, two-dimensional biaxial samples and tests with initially isotropic fabric are considered for the sake of simplicity. The feasibility and reliability of the proposed modelling strategy are evaluated through training and testing. All results indicate that the first part of the model based on CNN is capable of accurately identifying PSD of a granular sample, as well as circularity and roundness of particles, using which as connecting parameters the mechanical behaviours together with induced fabric evolutions of granular materials are subsequently well captured by the second part of the model based on BiLSTM. This study provides a basis and a possible way to obtain immediately particle and packing information, mechanical properties and fabric evolutions by leveraging images of granular materials.},

We show that approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) algorithms can accelerate material data searches by several orders of magnitude relative to exact searching algorithms. The approximations are suggested by—and adapted to—the structure of the data-driven iterative solver and result in no significant loss of solution accuracy. We assess the performance of the ANN algorithm with respect to material data set size with the aid of a 3D elasticity test case.

An ”extended” polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) approach is developed that accounts for both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties, modeled as random variables, thus allowing a unified treatment of both types of uncertainty. We explore in particular epistemic uncertainty associated with the choice of prior probabilistic models for input parameters. A PCE-based Kernel Density (KDE) construction provides a composite map from the PCE coefficients and germ to the PDF of quantities of interest (QoI). The sensitivities of these PDF with respect to the input parameters are then evaluated. Input parameters of the probabilistic models are considered. By sampling over the epistemic random variable, a family of PDFs is generated and the failure probability is itself estimated as a random variable with its own PCE. Integrating epistemic uncertainties within the PCE framework results in a computationally efficient paradigm for propagation and sensitivity evaluation. Two typical illustrative examples are used to demonstrate the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {A new fifth-order alternative finite difference multi-resolution weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme is designed to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws in this paper. With the application of the original finite difference multi-resolution WENO schemes (Zhu and Shu, 2018; Zhu and Shu, 2020), a series of unequal-sized central spatial stencils are adopted to perform the WENO procedures, but the difference is that the methodology adopted in this paper is directly based on the point values of the solution rather than on the flux values. The proposed new multi-resolution WENO scheme can inherit many advantages of the original high order schemes, such as the arbitrary choice of the linear weights, the maintenance of the essentially non-oscillatory property in the vicinity of strong discontinuities, the smaller L 1 L1 and L ∞ L∞ truncation errors than that of the same order classical WENOJS schemes (Balsara et al., 2016; Jiang and Shu, 1996) in smooth regions, and better convergence properties of the residue when solving some steady-state problems. Compared with the original multi-resolution WENO schemes, the presented WENO scheme also has some advantages. Firstly, an arbitrary monotone flux can be used in this framework, while the original method is only suitable for smooth flux splitting technique . Secondly, it has smaller L 1 L1 and L ∞ L∞ truncation errors than that of the original same order multi-resolution WENO scheme. And finally, it avoids some time-consuming intermediate processes in the original multi-resolution WENO reconstruction procedures, thus resulting in less calculation time under the same conditions. Some inviscid and viscous numerical examples are provided to verify the superior performance of the new fifth-order alternative finite difference multi-resolution WENO scheme.},

  abstract     = {An immersed enriched finite element method is proposed for the analysis of phononic crystals (PnCs) with finite element (FE) meshes that are completely decoupled from geometry. Particularly, a technique is proposed to prescribe Bloch–Floquet periodic boundary conditions strongly on non-matching edges of the periodic unit cell (PUC). The enriched finite element formulation effectively transforms a periodic non-confirming discretization into an enriched node-to-node periodic discretizations where periodicity is enforced by any standard procedure. The enriched formulation is also used to describe the interior material interface . This completely eliminates the tedious process of generating matching or fitted meshes during the design process, as it allows changing the inclusion’s geometry as well as the PnC’s lattice type without changing the FE mesh. The proposed approach, which is used to analyze phononic crystals in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D using structured meshes , exhibits the same performance as the standard finite element analysis on fitted meshes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the collocation-based isogeometric boundary element method (IGABEM) is combined with the isogeometric Reissner–Mindlin shell elements to conduct the mixed dimensional solid–shell coupling analysis. On the basis of taking advantages of the geometric smoothness and exactness of isogeometric analysis (IGA), this method can reduce the computational scale of the solid part and eliminate the procedure of constructing analysis-suitable volumetric discretizations . In addition, this method only needs to provide the surface CAD (computer-aided design) meshes of the whole coupling model, so it has great potential in achieving close link with CAD systems . For the coupling implementation, the stiffness formula of BE subdomains is formed by condensing the unknown tractions, which simplifies the implementation of coupling constraints. That is to say, only the displacement compatibility equations on the interface are required, without explicitly establishing the traction equilibrium conditions . Two coupling approaches are developed and studied. One is the collocation-based direct strict kinematic coupling based on the deformation hypothesis of the shell across the section, and another is the weak coupling formulation in an integral sense based on work equality. The accuracy and convergence properties of the presented coupling method are investigated through numerical examples including a complex impeller blade .},

  abstract     = {We propose a new approach for data-driven automated discovery of isotropic hyperelastic constitutive laws. The approach is unsupervised , i.e., it requires no stress data but only displacement and global force data, which are realistically available through mechanical testing and digital image correlation techniques; it delivers interpretable models, i.e., models that are embodied by parsimonious mathematical expressions discovered through sparse regression of a large catalogue of candidate functions; it is one-shot , i.e., discovery only needs one experiment — but can use more if available. The problem of unsupervised discovery is solved by enforcing equilibrium constraints in the bulk and at the loaded boundary of the domain. Sparsity of the solution is achieved by ℓ p ℓp regularization combined with thresholding, which calls for a non-linear optimization scheme. The ensuing fully automated algorithm leverages physics-based constraints for the automatic determination of the penalty parameter in the regularization term. Using numerically generated data including artificial noise, we demonstrate the ability of the approach to accurately discover five hyperelastic models of different complexity. We also show that, if a “true” feature is missing in the function library, the proposed approach is able to surrogate it in such a way that the actual response is still accurately predicted.},

This study proposes a surrogate methodology able to efficiently emulate the nonlinear multiscale procedure, based on a combination of artificial neural networks and Kriging modeling under a variable-fidelity framework. A triaxially braided textile under longitudinal tension is used as a use-case and the methodology is employed to identify the most critical parameters in terms of variance via a global sensitivity analysis technique. Results show strong interaction effects between the uncertain parameters. The approach is non-intrusive and can be easily extended to other types of textiles and load cases.},

  abstract     = {A distinguishing feature of lipid (bilayer) membranes is their in-plane fluidity caused by free-flowing lipid molecules on the membrane surface. In continuum models for lipid membranes (e.g., the Helfrich–Canham model), fluidity manifests as invariance of the free energy to change in parametrization of the reference surface; a property termed reparametrization invariance . Two different parametric equations of the surface, related through a reparametrization, have identical equilibrium and stability properties. They can therefore be considered equivalent representations of the same surface. Since there are infinitely many ways to parametrize a surface, there are infinitely many equivalent representations for the surface. This highly redundant representation for a surface poses significant challenges to computations. For example, in computational studies using finite element analysis, extreme mesh distortion and spurious zero-energy modes are reported (Feng and Klug, 2006; Ma and Klug, 2008). In this work, by viewing reparametrization invariance as a form of gauge symmetry , we propose a gauge-fixing procedure for the case of topologically spherical membranes. We show that this procedure breaks gauge symmetry and tames the extreme redundancy of the system. We also demonstrate that this procedure is suitable for efficient numerical computations. We obtain accurate equilibrium configurations for the Helfrich–Canham model while circumventing computational issues noted above.},

To that end, several algorithms, e.g. splitting reaction-by-reaction method combined with a quasi-steady-state (QSS) solver, as well as anisotropic SPH-diffusion discretization and total Lagrangian SPH formulation, are introduced for dealing with the fundamental challenges of developing an integrative SPH method for simulating cardiac function, including, (i) the correct capture of the stiff dynamics of the transmembrane potential and the gating variables, (ii) the stable prediction of the large deformations and the strongly anisotropic behavior of the myocardium, and (iii) a proper coupling between the electrophysiology and tissue mechanics for the electromechanical feedback. A set of numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the present SPH method, and render it a potential and powerful alternative that can augment the current lines of total cardiac modeling and clinical applications.},

We consider a discrete fracture-matrix (DFM) model that treats fractures as one-dimensional objects, and flows in both the matrix and fractures respect the Darcy’s law. A multipoint flux mixed finite element (MFMFE) method with the broken Raviart–Thomas ( RT 1 2 RT12 ) element and the trapezoidal quadrature rule is employed to approximate the matrix velocity and pressure, which results in a block diagonal, symmetric and positive definite mass matrix for the matrix velocity on general quadrilateral grids; the one-dimensional RT 0 RT0 mixed finite element method with the one-dimensional trapezoidal quadrature rule is exploited to approximate the fracture velocity and pressure, which leads to a diagonal and positive definite mass matrix for the fracture velocity in each single fracture . All these features of the obtained mass matrices allow for velocity elimination. Multiscale basis functions are constructed for the two-dimensional matrix pressure following the generalized multiscale finite element method (GMsFEM) framework to capture the fine-scale information of heterogeneous fractured porous media and effectively reduce the degrees of freedom for the matrix pressure, while fine-grid basis functions are utilized for the one-dimensional fracture pressure in fractures. Various numerical tests with the oversampling technique for different fracture distributions are performed to show that the proposed multiscale method is effective and able to provide good approximations for the fine-grid solution.},

To this end, we consider a non-overlapping DD method resulting in a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) Schur system for almost every sampled problem. To accelerate the iterative solution of the Schur system, we propose a new stochastic preconditioning strategy that produces a preconditioner adapted to each sampled problem and converges toward the ideal preconditioner ( i.e. , the Schur operator itself) when the numerical parameters increase. The construction of the stochastic preconditioner is trivially parallel and takes place in an off-line stage, while the evaluation of the sample’s preconditioner during the sampling stage has a low and fixed cost. One key feature of the proposed construction is a factorized form combined with Polynomial Chaos expansions of local operators. The factorized form guarantees the SPD character of the sampled preconditioners while the local character of the PC expansions ensures a low computational complexity. The stochastic preconditioner is tested on a model problem in 2 space dimensions. In these tests, the preconditioner is very robust and significantly more efficient than the deterministic median-based preconditioner, requiring, on average, up to 7 times fewer iterations to converge. Complexity analysis suggests the scalability of the preconditioner with the number of subdomains.},

  abstract     = {Multiscale models based on representative volume elements (RVEs) might help unraveling the ways in which macroscopic loadings affect the microstructure of tissues reinforced by collagen fibers, and vice versa. Tissues such as arteries, however, are characterized by a significant collagen dispersion. Therefore, many fibers have to be included in the RVE to achieve a representative geometrical model of the microstructure. For this reason, when the finite element method is employed in the numerical homogenization, fibers are commonly modeled as 1D elements, either by considering a network of trusses or the embedded elements technique. With regard to the latter, there has been little attention in previous works concerning the influence of the chosen multiscale boundary conditions and RVE size. In order to address this issue, the present work combines a sound multiscale framework with the classical embedded elements technique to simulate four increasingly larger RVEs, which resemble the microstructure of the medial layer of the arterial wall. Each RVE is modeled as a ground substance with embedded collagen fibers and subjected to a macroscopic isochoric equibiaxial stretch up to 10%, according to four classical multiscale boundary conditions: Taylor-Voigt, linear boundary displacements, periodic boundary fluctuations and minimally constrained model. Results are evaluated both at the macroscopic level (homogenized response) and the microscopic level (strains in the ground substance and fiber stretches). At the macroscopic level, the homogenized response for the periodic boundary condition seems to converge faster than the other three with increasing RVE size. At the microscopic level, the periodic model is also less prone to concentrated effects at the boundaries of the RVE. Therefore, among the four classical multiscale boundary conditions, the periodic model seems to be better suited to simulate the microstructure of fibrous tissues employing the embedded elements technique. Importantly, the resulting microscopic strain fields are characterized by a considerable degree of inhomogeneity and some values are significantly larger than the macroscopic (imposed) strain. That could help to shed more light on relevant mechanotransduction mechanisms, e.g., cell signaling, that are known to happen in the arterial media and are linked to biological processes such as growth and remodeling. Therefore, the framework herein proposed may serve as a valuable tool for the investigation of microstructural phenomena that happen in arteries, or even other fibrous tissues.},

  abstract     = {The microstructural evolution in solids is driven by different factors, such as entropy density , the chemical potential and mechanical energy. The mechanical energy density propagates along with the propagation of the mechanical wave, which has a great influence on the rapid solid-state phase transformation, such as the martensitic transformation. In order to determine the mechanical contribution to the driving force during the microstructural evolution, it is therefore indispensable to simulate the mechanical wave propagation within a multiphase and multigrain system. With the introduction of an order parameter for each phase, the phase-field method is an efficient and robust numerical analysis tool, which obviates the complexity of tracking the interfaces among different phases. In this paper, the phase-field method is extended to simulate the mechanical wave propagation by coupling it with the high-order discontinuous Galerkin method . The jump condition at the sharp interface is derived for mechanical waves with strong and weak discontinuities. Based on the jump condition, the interpolation scheme for the stiffness matrix and the density is formulated with order parameters, so as to derive the driving force for the microstructural evolution. Numerical validations are carried out to verify the jump condition, the interpolation scheme and the accuracy and convergence of this simulation scheme.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a two-way coupling technique between a total Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method for Solid Mechanics and the explicit incompressible SPH (EISPH) to simulate fluid–structure interaction problems. In the solid part, the total Lagrangian framework guarantees that the particle distribution keep stable to correctly calculate the deformation gradient and thus the elastic forces. The constitutive model follows hyperelastic formulations, and the stability of the method is enforced by a Jameson–Schmidt–Turkel (JST) stabilization procedure. For the fluid part, we applied an EISPH formulation, which is a fully explicit incompressible scheme based on a projection method capable of providing accurate pressure distributions for free-surface flows, while avoiding costly linear equations . The coupling scheme follows the same manner as the fixed wall ghost particle (FWGP) approach, which was here adapted to include moving walls. In addition, the non-penetration condition is rigorously reinforced through a numerical algorithm to avoid penetration of every fluid particle, including free-surface particles. Our method for solid is then verified through a large deformed tension plate numerical test, and our coupling forces through a series floating tests and hydrostatic water column over a thin infinite plate. Then, the method is validated comparing it with experimental data of a dam break test in which the water column attacks a thin rubber plate.},

  abstract     = {Many scientific phenomena are modeled by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The development of data gathering tools along with the advances in machine learning (ML) techniques have raised opportunities for data-driven identification of governing equations from experimentally observed data. We propose an ML method to discover the terms involved in the equation from two-dimensional spatiotemporal data. Robust and useful physical features are extracted from data samples to represent the specific behaviors imposed by each mathematical term in the equation. Compared to the previous models, this idea provides us with the ability to discover 2D equations with time derivatives of different orders, and also to identify new underlying physics on which the model has not been trained. Moreover, the model can work with small sets of low-resolution data while avoiding instability caused by numerical differentiations. The results indicate robustness of the features extracted based on prior knowledge in comparison to automatically detected features by a Three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) given the same amounts of data. Although particular PDEs are studied in this work, the idea of the proposed approach could be extended for reliable identification of various PDEs.},

The formulation is capable of generating ordinary as well as non-negative shape functions in a unified style. The flexibility of producing either strong Kronecker-delta in the domain or weak Kronecker-delta property at the boundaries is one of the method’s prominent features. Both convex and non-convex boundaries are treated, even when non-negative shape functions are of concern. It is shown that a variety of interpolant/non-interpolant functions are achievable. The existence of weak/strong Kronecker-delta property at the boundaries allows for using the interpolants in the Galerkin-weak type of formulation. In this context, it is shown that some alternatives are far preferable to the others. For instance comparison of the performances of non-negative interpolants with weak and strong Kronecker-delta shows that the former interpolants are superior to the latter ones. All the interpolants introduced may seamlessly convert to the finite element ones, and thus, they may be employed in solutions using a dual discretization . Due to the continuity of the shape functions (up to the desired order), one may use them in a collocation approach. Several examples are solved to demonstrate the capabilities/flexibility of the interpolants.},

  abstract     = {In the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM), the approximation is achieved through construction of shape functions in the physical domain and the interaction of neighbouring nodes. When modelling large deformation problems, Lagrangian and semi-Lagrangian formulations have been proposed, where the RK functions are evaluated in the reference initial coordinates and in the current configuration, respectively. The Lagrangian RKPM breaks down when the mapping between current and reference configuration is not one-to-one and the deformation gradient is not invertible, such as in modelling high velocity impact and penetration processes. On the other hand, the semi-Lagrangian RKPM formulation with RK functions evaluated in the current configuration eliminates the requirement on the deformation mapping but results in a high computational cost. In order to retain the advantages of both formulations, a blending-based spatial coupling scheme is proposed to allow transition from the Lagrangian to the semi-Lagrangian RKPM meshfree formulation. Spatial consistency and temporal stability of the proposed coupling approach are analysed. The analysis results show that the critical time step of the coupled formulation is larger than the worst case between the pure Lagrangian and pure semi-Lagrangian RK cases. Moreover, an algorithm to update three-dimensional semi-Lagrangian kernel supports and smoothing cells is introduced to enhance the solution accuracy of the semi-Lagrangian portion of the proposed coupling scheme. The proposed update algorithm avoids the numerical issues of either insufficient support coverage or loss of locality associated with the conventional pure semi-Lagrangian formulation under large deformations. The performance of the proposed Lagrangian/semi-Lagrangian coupling approach is verified through a suite of benchmark problems, including extreme deformation problems.},

  abstract     = {In many contexts, it is of interest to assess the impact of selected parameters on the failure probability of a physical system. To this end, one can perform conditional reliability analysis, in which the probability of failure becomes a function of these parameters. Computing conditional reliability requires recomputing failure probabilities for a sample sequence of the parameters, which strongly increases the already high computational cost of conventional reliability analysis. We alleviate these costs by reusing information from previous reliability computations in each subsequent reliability analysis of the sequence. The method is designed using two variants of importance sampling and performs information transfer by reusing importance densities from previous reliability analyses in the current one. We put forward a criterion for selecting the most informative importance densities, which is robust with respect to the input space dimension, and use a recently proposed density mixture model for constructing effective importance densities in high dimensions. The method controls the estimator coefficient of variation to achieve a prescribed accuracy. We demonstrate its performance by means of two engineering examples featuring a number of pitfall features such as strong non-linearity, high dimensionality and small failure probabilities ( 1 0 − 5 to 1 0 − 9 10−5to10−9 ).},

  abstract     = {With growing application of additive manufacturing (AM) in industry, simulation of transient heat conduction during the AM process has drawn increasing attention. However, detailed simulation with acceptable accuracy is extremely time consuming because of the large range of time scales involved in the problem. In this work, a multi-time stepping method using different timesteps in multiple subdomains is developed to accelerate transient heat conduction simulation. A Dirichlet–Robin iterative coupling scheme is proposed to enforce continuity at the interfaces between different subdomains. This allows numerical stability of the multi-timestep​ model, even with disparate materials or meshes on either side of the subdomain interfaces. Specifically, an optimal approximation for the Schur complement matrix is derived using a one-dimensional (1D) model, which avoids the instabilities encountered when using a Dirichlet–Neumann coupling formulation and allows convergence of the iterative coupling scheme in only one iteration at each timestep. Several numerical examples are studied to evaluate the stability, convergence and performance of the method. It is found that the proposed method is robust and stable for all choices of material parameters, unlike the conventional Dirichlet–Neumann coupling scheme. To demonstrate the use of the method for AM, a simulation representative of a single laser track is performed and compared with line heat source model approach. It is found that the proposed method not only accelerates the simulation by a factor of more than 100, but gives very good accuracy for temperature in the melt pool region.},

The algorithm computes the deterministic responses and corresponding random variable coefficients in their individual spaces and is insensitive to stochastic dimensions, thus it can be applied to high-dimensional stochastic problems without extra difficulties. More importantly, the deterministic responses can be computed efficiently by use of existing finite element method (FEM) solvers, thus the proposed method can be easy to embed into existing FEM structural analysis software.

As a result, rIGA enriches the approximation space and reduces the interconnection between degrees of freedom. We compare computational costs of rIGA versus those of IGA when employing a Lanczos eigensolver with a shift-and-invert spectral transformation. When all eigenpairs within a given interval [ λ s , λ e ] [λs,λe] are of interest, we select several shifts σ k ∈ [ λ s , λ e ] σk∈[λs,λe] using a spectrum slicing technique. For each shift σ k σk , the factorization cost of the spectral transformation matrix K − σ k M K−σkM controls the total computational cost of the eigensolution . Several multiplications of the operator matrix ( K − σ k M ) − 1 M (K−σkM)−1M by vectors follow this factorization. Let p p be the polynomial degree of the basis functions and assume that IGA has maximum continuity of p − 1 p−1 . When using rIGA, we introduce C 0 C0 separators at certain element interfaces to minimize the factorization cost. For this setup, our theoretical estimates predict computational savings to compute a fixed number of eigenpairs of up to O ( p 2 ) O(p2) in the asymptotic regime, that is, large problem sizes. Yet, our numerical tests show that for moderate-size eigenproblems, the total observed computational cost reduction is O ( p ) O(p) . In addition, rIGA improves the accuracy of every eigenpair of the first N 0 N0 eigenvalues and eigenfunctions , where N 0 N0 is the total number of modes of the original maximum-continuity IGA discretization .},

The governing equations for this problem originate from a constrained minimization of a non-convex energy functional, and the most commonly used solver is a staggered solution scheme. This is known to be robust compared to the monolithic Newton method , however, the staggered scheme often requires many iterations to converge when cracks are evolving. The focus of our work is to accelerate the solver through a scheme that sequentially applies Anderson acceleration and over-relaxation, switching back and forth depending on the residual evolution, and thereby ensuring a decreasing tendency. The resulting scheme takes advantage of the complementary strengths of Anderson acceleration and over-relaxation to make a robust and accelerating method for this problem. The new method is applied as a post-processing technique to the increments of the solver. Hence, the implementation merely requires minor modifications to already available software. Moreover, the cost of the acceleration scheme is negligible. The robustness and efficiency of the method are demonstrated through numerical examples .},

  abstract     = {The capability to incorporate moving geometric features within models for complex simulations is a common requirement in many fields. Fluid mechanics within aeronautical applications, for example, routinely feature rotating (e.g. turbines, wheels and fan blades) or sliding components (e.g. in compressor or turbine cascade simulations). With an increasing trend towards the high-fidelity modelling of these cases, in particular combined with the use of high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods, there is therefore a requirement to understand how different numerical treatments of the interfaces between the static mesh and the sliding/rotating part impact on overall solution quality. In this article, we compare two different approaches to handle this non-conformal interface. The first is the so-called mortar approach, where flux integrals along edges are split according to the positioning of the non-conformal grid. The second is a less-documented point-to-point interpolation method, where the interior and exterior quantities for flux evaluations are interpolated from elements lying on the opposing side of the interface. Although the mortar approach has significant advantages in terms of its numerical properties, in that it preserves the local conservation properties of DG methods, in the context of complex 3D meshes it poses notable implementation difficulties which the point-to-point method handles more readily. In this paper we examine the numerical properties of each method, focusing not only on observing convergence orders for smooth solutions, but also how each method performs in under-resolved simulations of linear and nonlinear hyperbolic problems, to inform the use of these methods in implicit large-eddy simulations.},

  abstract     = {We present a topology optimization framework to design periodic composites comprised of piezoelectric constituents that exhibit large flexoelectric constants. The novelty of the approach is that it leverages a representative volume element (RVE)-based computational homogenization approach that enables the analysis of periodic composites where the characteristic dimensions of the microstructure are significantly smaller than those of the structure, and as such requires only the optimization of a single RVE rather than that of the entire structure. We utilize this approach to analyze the enhancement in flexoelectric constants that can be achieved in different types of PZT-based composites, including hard–hard (PZT–PZT), and hard–soft (PZT–polymer composite, and porous PZT) structures. In all cases, significant enhancements are observed, with improvements between 2 and 15 times those of a naive guess, with some designs reaching a factor of one order of magnitude larger than BTO. We identify different mechanisms governing the enhanced electromechanical couplings, which can arise either from an enhancement of effective piezoelectricity in the RVE for PZT–PZT composites, or from a more subtle interplay involving the enhancement of effective piezoelectric and dielectric properties coupled with a reduction in mechanical compliance for PZT–polymer and porous PZT RVEs.},

  abstract     = {The estimation of the failure probability for complex systems is a crucial issue for sustainability. Reliability analysis methods are needed to be developed to provide accurate estimations of the safety levels for the complex systems and structures of today. In this paper, a novel hybrid framework for the reliability analysis of engineering systems and structures is extended to reduce the computational burden. The proposed hybrid framework is named as SVR–CFORM and consists of coupling two parts: the first is an enhanced first-order reliability method (FORM) using nonlinear conjugate map (CFORM); the second is an artificial intelligence technique called support vector regression (SVR). The conjugate FORM (CFORM) is adaptively formulated to improve the robustness of the original iterative FORM algorithm, whereas the SVR technique is used to enhance the efficiency of the reliability analysis by reducing the computational burden. The performance of the proposed SVR–CFORM formulation is compared in terms of efficiency and robustness with several FORM formulas (i.e. HL–RF, directional stability transformation method, conjugate HL–RF and finite step length) through different numerical/structural reliability examples. Results indicate that the proposed SVR–CFORM formulation is more accurate and efficient than other reliability methods. Based on the comparative analysis results, the SVR technique can highly reduce the computational costs and accurately model the response of complex performance functions, while the iterative CFORM formulation found to provide stable and robust reliability index results compared to the others reliability methods.},

  abstract     = {We present a consistent and efficient approach to the formulation of geometric nonlinear finite elements for isogeometric analysis ( IGA ) and isogeometric B-Rep analysis ( IBRA ) based on the adjoint method. IGA elements are computationally expensive, especially for high polynomial degrees . Using the method presented here enables us to reduce this disadvantage and develop a methodical framework for the efficient implementation of IGA elements. The elements are consistently derived from energy functionals. The load vector and stiffness matrix are obtained from the first and second order derivatives of the energy. Starting from the functional, we apply the concept of algorithmic or automatic differentiation to compute the precise derivatives. Here, we compare the direct (forward) and adjoint (reversed) methods. Analysis of the computational graph allows us to optimize the computation and identify recurring modules. It turns out that using the adjoint method leads to a core-congruential formulation , which enables a clean separation between the mechanical behavior and the geometric description. This is particularly useful in CAD-integrated analysis, where mechanical properties are applied to different geometry types. The adjoint method produces the same results but requires significantly fewer operations and fewer intermediate results. Moreover, the number of intermediate results is no longer dependent on the polynomial degree of the NURBS. This is important for implementation efficiency and computation speed. The procedure can be applied to arbitrary element formulations and coupling conditions based on energy functionals. For demonstration purposes, we present the proposed approach specifically for use with geometrically nonlinear trusses, beams, membranes, shells, and coupling conditions based on the penalty method.},

  abstract     = {Substitution of well-grounded theoretical models by data-driven predictions is not as simple in engineering and sciences as it is in social and economic fields. Scientific problems suffer many times from paucity of data, while they may involve a large number of variables and parameters that interact in complex and non-stationary ways, obeying certain physical laws. Moreover, a physically-based model is not only useful for making predictions, but to gain knowledge by the interpretation of its structure, parameters, and mathematical properties. The solution to these shortcomings seems to be the seamless blending of the tremendous predictive power of the data-driven approach with the scientific consistency and interpretability of physically-based models. We use here the concept of Physically-Guided Neural Networks (PGNN) to predict the input–output relation in a physical system, while, at the same time, fulfilling the physical constraints. With this goal, the internal hidden state variables of the system are associated with a set of internal neuron layers, whose values are constrained by known physical relations, as well as any additional knowledge on the system. Furthermore, when having enough data, it is possible to infer knowledge about the internal structure of the system and, if parameterized, to predict the state parameters for a particular input–output relation. We show that this approach, besides getting physically-based predictions, accelerates the training process, reduces the amount of data required to get similar accuracy, partly filters the intrinsic noise in the experimental data and improves its extrapolation capacity.},

In this work, we rigorously prove the well-posedness of the method and the solenoidal nature of the discrete magnetic flux field. We also derive stability energy estimates. The design of the method includes three choices for the construction of the nodal mass matrix and criteria to more alternatives. This approach is novel in the VEM literature and allows us to preserve a commuting diagram property. We present a set of numerical experiments that independently validate theoretical results. The numerical experiments include the convergence rate study, energy estimates and verification of the divergence-free condition on the magnetic flux field. All these numerical experiments have been performed on triangular, perturbed quadrilateral and Voronoi meshes. Finally, we demonstrate the development of the VEM method on a numerical model for Hartmann flows as well as in the case of magnetic reconnection.},

  abstract     = {Lattice-type structures can provide a combination of stiffness with light weight that is desirable in a variety of applications. Design optimization of these structures must rely on approximations of the governing physics to render solution of a mathematical model feasible. In this paper, we propose a topology optimization (TO) formulation that approximates the governing physics using component-wise reduced order modeling as introduced in Huynh et al. (2013); Eftang and Patera (2013), which can reduce solution time by multiple orders of magnitude over a full-order finite element model while providing a relative error in the solution of &lt; &amp;lt; 1%. In addition, the offline training data set from such component-wise models is reusable, allowing its application to many design problems for only the cost of a single offline training phase, and the component-wise method is nearly embarrassingly parallel. We also show how the parameterization chosen in our optimization allows a simplification of the component-wise reduced order model (CWROM) not noted in previous literature, for further speedup of the optimization process. The sensitivity of the compliance with respect to the particular parameterization is derived solely at the component level. In numerical examples, we demonstrate a 1000x speedup over a full-order FEM model with relative error of &lt; &amp;lt; 1% and show minimum compliance designs for two different cantilever beam examples, one smaller and one larger. Finally, error bounds for the displacement field, compliance, and compliance sensitivity of the CWROM are derived.},

  abstract     = {Laser-based metal processing including welding and three dimensional printing, involves localized melting of solid or granular raw material, surface tension-driven melt flow and significant evaporation of melt due to the applied very high energy densities. The present work proposes a weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics formulation for thermo-capillary phase change problems involving solid, liquid and gaseous phases with special focus on selective laser melting, an emerging metal additive manufacturing technique. Evaporation-induced recoil pressure, temperature-dependent surface tension and wetting forces are considered as mechanical interface fluxes, while a Gaussian laser beam heat source and evaporation-induced heat losses are considered as thermal interface fluxes. A novel interface stabilization scheme is proposed, which is shown to allow for a stable and smooth liquid–gas interface by effectively damping spurious interface flows as typically occurring in continuum surface force approaches. Moreover, discretization strategies for the tangential projection of the temperature gradient, as required for the discrete Marangoni forces, are critically reviewed. The proposed formulation is deemed especially suitable for modeling of the melt pool dynamics in metal additive manufacturing because the full range of relevant interface forces is considered and the explicit resolution of the atmospheric gas phase enables a consistent description of pore formation by gas inclusion. The accuracy and robustness of the individual model and method building blocks is verified by means of several selected examples in the context of the selective laser melting process.},

Cross-section deformation is allowed for by adding kinematic DOFs, the so-called “cross-section deformation modes”, which are obtained using Generalised Beam Theory . All expressions required to implement the proposed finite element are derived. For validation purposes, several numerical examples are presented and discussed. In each case, the results obtained with the proposed element and refined shell finite element models are compared, and an excellent agreement is found.

Moreover, the physical meaning of the additional Degrees of Freedom (DOFs) in the displacement expression of XFEMs or XIGA is not clarified. To address these issues, we proposed a new method that combines XIGA and B++ splines for modeling the fracture behaviors of single and multiple cracks in 2D elasticity solids. We adopt the overlapping trimming curves to represent the crack curves . The control points that the basis functions are non-zeros for the penetrating elements in XIGA are changed into the double-layer collocation points on the crack curves in our proposed method. In doing so, the DOFs of control points of the elements penetrated by the crack in the XIGA are replaced by those of the double-layer collocation points on the crack curves. The movement of the crack edges is simulated by the displacement of collocation points. Thus, the physical meaning of the DOFs of the elements penetrated by the cracks is clarified. As the basis functions of the collocation points on the crack boundary satisfy the Kronecker delta property, the presented method allows strong imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions on the crack edges. The stress intensity factors (SIFs) are calculated by adopting the interaction integral technology. Numerical examples verify the accuracy of the proposed method.},

Particularly, the plate microstructures (PM) that are comprised of 6 sets of flat plates have been proved to attain any extreme stiffness in theory. In this paper, we solve two remaining issues for design of optimal PMs. On one hand, we investigate the stiffness optimality of three PMs that involve fewer than 6 freely-oriented plate sets subjected to any prescribed multi-loadings, which are typically quasiperiodic. Because they have simpler geometries with fewer plate sets, they are preferred in practical applications. On the other hand, we identify two optimal periodic plate lattice structures which are comprised of 7 plate sets, and demonstrate that they are able to attain near-optimal stiffness (over 97% and 99% of the extreme stiffness in theory) for any multi-loadings in the low volume fraction limit. In order to ensure a sufficiently large loading space for verification of the stiffness optimality of these PMs, tens of thousands of random multi-loadings are first used and further the worst multi-loading that yields the highest stiffness deficiency is systematically identified for each PM. The numerical results not only illustrate the stiffness optimality of these PMs, but also provide suggestions on selection of the simplest PMs with the fewest plate sets in applications.},

  abstract     = {The paper presents a level set based topology optimization method for unidirectional phononic structures with finite layers of lattice cells . Boundary element method(BEM) is employed as the numerical approach to solve the acoustic problems governed by Helmholtz equation . A sized reduced coefficient matrix is derived due to the iteration forms for input and output quantities on the periodic boundary of unit cells. Topological derivatives are formulated by boundary integral equation combined with adjoint variable method and computed for each layer. An average topological sensitivity of a single design domain is proposed for the updating of the level set function(LSF) governed by an evolution equation. Numerical models with different number of layers are considered and several optimized structures of unit cells are obtained in concerned frequencies. A further investigation into the transmission of acoustic waves is carried out by employing more layers of the periodic structures between the input and output domains. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method for the finite unidirectional phononic structures.},

  abstract     = {In the past few decades, the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme has been widely used in mesh-based methods and has achieved great success, but its application to the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is still limited. In this paper, a simple and accurate implementation of the WENO scheme to the SPH method is proposed for solving compressible flows with discontinuities and small-scale structures. In the proposed scheme, several equal spacing points along the line joining two interacting particles are selected to constitute candidate stencils. However, due to the Lagrangian characteristic of SPH, some points may be lost. To solve this problem, we first search the particles closest to these missing points, and then the first-order Taylor series expansion is used to obtain the corresponding primitive variables of these points. After that, through the WENO strategy, the left and right states at the interface between two interacting particles are reconstructed. Finally, the inter-particle interactions are determined by using Roe’s approximate Riemann solver. Several numerical tests show that the proposed WENO-SPH method is robust and able to accurately capture shockwaves , and benefiting from the low-dissipation property, it also has a good performance in resolving small-scale structures in flows.},

  abstract     = {The scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is capable of generating polyhedral elements with an arbitrary number of surfaces. This salient feature significantly alleviates the meshing burden being a bottleneck in the analysis pipeline in the standard finite element method (FEM). In this paper, we implement polyhedral elements based on the SBFEM into the commercial finite element software ABAQUS. To this end, user elements are provided through the user subroutine UEL. Detailed explanations regarding the data structures and implementational aspects of the procedures are given. The focus of the current implementation is on interfacial problems and therefore, element-based surfaces are created on polyhedral user elements to establish interactions. This is achieved by an overlay of standard finite elements with negligible stiffness, provided in the ABAQUS element library, with polyhedral user elements. By means of several numerical examples , the advantages of polyhedral elements regarding the treatment of non-matching interfaces and automatic mesh generation are clearly demonstrated. Thus, the performance of ABAQUS for problems involving interfaces is augmented based on the availability of polyhedral meshes. Due to the implementation of polyhedral user elements, ABAQUS can directly handle complex geometries given in the form of digital images or stereolithography (STL) files. In order to facilitate the use of the proposed approach, the code of the UEL is published open-source and can be downloaded from https://github.com/ShukaiYa/SBFEM-UEL .},

The extended system not only reduces to the TCPDE system at specific values of the supplementary variables, but also allows one to retain consistency and solvability after a consistent numerical approximation . Among virtually infinite many possibilities to add the supplementary variables, we present two that maintain thermodynamical consistency in the extended system before and after the approximation . A pseudo-spectral method is used in space to arrive at fully discrete schemes. The new schemes are compared with the energy stable SAV scheme and the fully implicit Crank–Nicolson scheme.

  abstract     = {Multiple bifurcation (MB) is a compound stability problem of nonlinear structures, in which the singular system stiffness matrix at the stability point coincidentally undergoes two or more zero eigenvalues. The corresponding critical eigenvectors are generally coupled in the actual buckling modes, as frequently observed in symmetric structures . This paper presents a practical diagnosis to visualize all secondary paths branching from the compound stability point when the stiffness matrix is deficient in rank by two. To find post-critical equilibria around an MB point (MBP), asymptotic expansions are assumed to consist of two homogeneous and one particular solution of the singular stiffness equations. Furthermore, hyper-dual numbers are introduced to numerically evaluate the derivatives of the system stiffness with respect to the nodal degrees-of-freedom. The resulting bifurcation equations are a set of three simultaneous cubic polynomial equations with unknown perturbation parameters that can be solved by a popular graphical software. The number and location of existing equilibria above and beneath the MBP at the load level can exactly indicate each type of branching path, such as asymmetric, unstable, or stable symmetric bifurcation paths. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed asymptotic theory can reliably diagnose MB. The first one is the Augusti model, i.e., a simple rigid column supported by elastic springs that shows that the numerical prediction by the proposed method is consistent with Augusti’s analytical results. The second example was computed using the plate and shell finite element (FE) program to verify that the asymptotically expanded and visually solved bifurcation equations work well and can be implemented in existing FE codes for stability analysis, including imperfection-sensitivity and optimization.},

This paper presents an overlooked issue in this type of coupled computational methods: the lack of overall equilibrium. This can be the case even if the coupling strategy satisfies the usual numerical tests involving rigid body motions as well as uniform and linear strain distributions. We focus our investigation on the lack of overall equilibrium in an approach to couple peridynamics and classical continuum mechanics recently proposed by the authors. In our examples, the magnitude of the out-of-balance forces is a fraction of a percent of the applied forces , but it cannot be assumed to be a numerical round-off error. We show analytically and numerically that the main reason for the existence of out-of-balance forces is a lack of balance between the local and nonlocal tractions at the coupling interface. This usually results from the presence of high-order derivatives of displacements in the coupling zone.},

Due to the numerically highly demanding nature of these problems, efficient automatic mesh generators and transient solvers are required. To this end, a parallel explicit solver exploiting the advantages of balanced octree meshes is introduced. To avoid the hanging nodes problem encountered in standard finite element analysis (FEA), the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is deployed as a spatial discretization scheme . Consequently, arbitrarily shaped star-convex polyhedral elements are straightforwardly generated. Considering the scaling and transformation of octree cells, the stiffness and mass matrices of a limited number of unique cell patterns are pre-computed. A recently proposed mass lumping technique is extended to 3D yielding a well-conditioned diagonal mass matrix. This enables us to leverage the advantages of explicit time integrator, i.e., it is possible to efficiently compute the nodal displacements without the need for solving a system of linear equations . We implement the proposed scheme together with a central difference method (CDM) in a distributed computing environment . The performance of our parallel explicit solver is evaluated by means of several numerical benchmark examples, including complex geometries and various practical applications. A significant speedup is observed for these examples with up to one billion of degrees of freedom and running on up to 16,384 computing cores.},

We distinguish between one-neighbour, two-neighbour and three-neighbour interactions. One-neighbour interactions are equivalent to the bond-based interactions of the original PD formalism. However, two- and three-neighbour interactions are fundamentally different to state-based interactions, as the basic elements of continuum kinematics are preserved exactly. We investigate the consequences of the angular momentum balance and provide a set of appropriate arguments for the interaction potentials accordingly. Furthermore, we elaborate on restrictions on the interaction energies and derive dissipation-consistent constitutive laws through a Coleman–Noll-like procedure. Although the framework is suitable for finite deformations , an additive decomposition of the kinematic quantities into elastic and plastic parts is rigorously proven to be a correct choice. Crucially, in our proposed scheme, the elasto-plastic framework resembles standard one-dimensional plasticity, for all interactions. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of our proposed framework via a series of numerical examples .},

The proposed formulation is derived from the three-dimensional continuum theory where the beam axis and the director vectors of cross-sections are used to characterize beam configurations. The translational displacements of the beam axis and the axial cross-sectional rotation along the beam axis are considered as unknown kinematics. The orthogonality between the cross-sections and the beam axis is satisfied by using the smallest rotation mapping for the description of finite cross-sectional rotations. The use of the smallest rotation mapping reduces the nonlinearity of the employed strain measurements with respect to the unknown kinematics and offers highly efficient linearization. Furthermore, a penalty-free approach is introduced to deal with rigid connections in multi-patch beam structures in the context of geometrically nonlinear analysis . A novel nonlinear transformation between the total cross-sectional rotation and the unknown kinematics is derived, which facilitates the use of the total cross-sectional rotations at the ends of patches as discrete unknowns. This approach also allows straightforward enforcement of rotational boundary conditions. The proposed formulation is investigated by several well-established examples and great accuracy and efficiency are observed.},

  abstract     = {We present a strategy grounded in the element removal idea of Bruns and Tortorelli (2003) and aimed at reducing computational cost and circumventing potential numerical instabilities of density-based topology optimization . The design variables and the relative densities are both represented on a fixed, uniform finite element grid, and linked through filtering and Heaviside projection. The regions in the analysis domain where the relative density is below a specified threshold are removed from the forward analysis and replaced by nodal boundary conditions. This brings a progressive cut of the computational cost as the optimization proceeds and helps to mitigate numerical instabilities associated with low-density regions. Removed regions can be readily reintroduced since all the design variables remain active and are modeled in the formal sensitivity analysis. A key feature of the proposed approach is that the Heaviside projection promotes material reintroduction along the structural boundaries by amplifying the magnitude of the sensitivities inside the filter reach. Several 2D and 3D structural topology optimization examples are presented, including linear and nonlinear compliance minimization, the design of a force inverter, and frequency and buckling load maximization. The approach is shown to be effective at producing optimized designs equivalent or nearly equivalent to those obtained without the element removal, while providing remarkable computational savings.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we consider a gradient recovery-based adaptive stabilized mixed finite element method (FEM) for solving the convection–diffusion–reaction equation on surfaces. By defining a new total flux on the surface, we firstly transform the original equation into an equivalent mixed first-order formulation. Then, by using both the convection–convection term and the div–div term to stabilize the weak formulation, we prove the discrete inf–sup condition and the error estimate for the mixed FEM. In this new method, the equal order Lagrangian elements are allowed for the primal variable and the total flux, and a high accurate numerical solution for the flux in the H 1 H1 space is obtained. The impact of the curvature on the algorithm is also investigated. Additionally, to overcome the low resolution and the non-physical oscillation in simulating the convection-dominated problem, we study a gradient recovery-based adaptive stabilized mixed FEM. Finally, we show some numerical experiments to verify the theoretical prediction and efficiency of the studied method.},

  abstract     = {We present a continuum framework to simulate fluid flow through anisotropic elastoplastic media with double porosity. Two effective stress measures σ′ and σ′′ emerge from the thermodynamic formulation, which are energy-conjugate to the elastic and plastic components of strain, respectively. Both effective stress measures can be expressed as a combination of the total Cauchy stress σ and the average pore pressure p¯ in the two pore scales. In the effective stress for elasticity, p¯ is scaled with a rank-2 Biot tensor, whereas the effective stress for plasticity follows the Terzaghi form in which p¯ is scaled by the Kronecker delta . The Biot tensor and storage coefficients are derived as functions of elasticity parameters and porosities. A mixed finite element formulation is introduced to discretize the domain and solve initial boundary-value problems. A stabilization scheme is employed on equal-order interpolation for both displacement and pressure fields throughout the entire range of drainage responses. Numerical simulations reproduce the hydromechanical response of Opalinus shale in one-dimensional consolidation tests throughout the range of primary and secondary consolidation under different external loads . Numerical simulations of the consolidation of a rectangular domain subjected to a strip load demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed stabilization scheme, as well as illustrate the impacts of stress history, mass transfer, and different pore systems on the hydromechanical response.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces the scaled boundary cubature (SBC) scheme for accurate and efficient integration of functions over polygons and two-dimensional regions bounded by parametric curves. Over two-dimensional domains, the SBC method reduces integration over a region bounded by m m curves to integration over m m regions (referred to as curved triangular regions), where each region is bounded by two line segments and a curve. With proper (counterclockwise) orientation of the boundary curves, the scheme is applicable to convex and nonconvex domains. Additionally, for star-convex domains, a tensor-product cubature rule with positive weights and integration points in the interior of the domain is obtained. If the integrand is homogeneous, we show that this new method reduces to the homogeneous numerical integration scheme; however, the SBC scheme is more versatile since it is equally applicable to both homogeneous and non-homogeneous functions. This paper also introduces several methods for smoothing integrands with point singularities and near-singularities. When these methods are used, highly efficient integration of weakly singular functions is realized. The SBC method is applied to a number of benchmark problems, which reveal its broad applicability and superior performance (in terms of time to generate a rule and accuracy per cubature point) when compared to existing methods for integration.},

The optimal rates of convergence in the discrete L 2 L2 -norm are derived without any restrictions on the grid ratio for both types of virtual element methods. Finally, numerical examples on a set of polygonal meshes are given to support the theoretical analysis.

  abstract     = {A novel extension of the Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds (PLoM) is presented. It makes it possible to synthesize solutions to a wide range of nonlinear stochastic boundary value problems described by partial differential equations (PDEs) for which a stochastic computational model (SCM) is available and which depend on a vector-valued random control parameter . The cost of a single numerical evaluation of this SCM is assumed to be such that only a limited number of points can be computed for constructing the training dataset (small data). Each point of the training dataset is made up of realizations from a vector-valued stochastic process (the stochastic solution) and the associated random control parameter on which it depends. The presented PLoM constrained by PDE allows for generating a large number of learned realizations of the stochastic process and its corresponding random control parameter. These learned realizations are generated so as to minimize the vector-valued random residual of the PDE in the mean-square sense. Appropriate novel methods are developed to solve this challenging problem. Three applications are presented. The first one is a simple uncertain nonlinear dynamical system with a nonstationary stochastic excitation. The second one concerns the 2D nonlinear unsteady Navier–Stokes equations for incompressible flows in which the Reynolds number is the random control parameter. The last one deals with the nonlinear dynamics of a 3D elastic structure with uncertainties. The results obtained make it possible to validate the PLoM constrained by stochastic PDE but also provide further validation of the PLoM without constraint.},

VE-approaches have great potential for the homogenization of the physical properties of heterogeneous polycrystalline microstructures with anisotropic grains. The flexibility in element shapes can be exploited for creating VE-mesh with a significant lower number of degrees of freedom if compared to finite element (FE) meshes, while maintaining a high accuracy. Evidence that VE-approaches outperform FEM is available in the literature, but only addressing purely-mechanic problems (i.e. elastic properties) and transversely anisotropic materials. The aim of this work is twofold. On one hand, the study compares VE-and FE-based numerical homogenization schemes for electro-mechanically coupled problems for different crystal lattice structures and degrees of elastic anisotropy. Within all considered materials, the VE-approach outperforms the FE-approach for the same number of nodes. On the other hand, a hybrid microstructure made up by both electro-mechanical and magneto-mechanical grains is investigated resulting in an electro-magneto-mechanically coupled microstructure. Again, VEM provides a more accurate solution strategy.},

The method can be seen as an adaptation of the variational multi-scale (VMS) method, where the fine solution is solved numerically instead of analytically. Also, from the point of view of homogenization methods it can be seen as an evolution of Finite Element square (FE 2 2 ) methods, where the most expensive part of the computations is performed offline. The name of P-DNS arises from the premise that in all multi-scale simulations the numerical result obtained with a very fine discretization is correct without the need to introduce any additional model (i.e. turbulence models) or stabilization procedures for transport equation terms (as in residual-based VMS methods). What is intended here is that the P-DNS solution tends to the DNS solution of the problem, accepting as a premise that the DNS solution is a reliable result. In this paper we present first an overview of the P-DNS methodology in the context of an abstract Dirichlet problem involving a second order differential operator that could be non-symmetric and non-necessarily positive definite. Next, the P-DNS approach is applied to the fluid mechanics equations accounting for turbulent phenomena. Examples showing the applicability of the P-DNS method for solving transport problems involving different scales are then presented.},

The data-driven reduced homogenization minimizes the distance between points lying in a data-set and points associated with the macroscopic state of the material. The enrichment-variables are excellent pointers for the selection of the correct part of the data-set for problems with a time-dependent material state. Proof-of-principle simulations are carried out with a heterogeneous linear material exhibiting a relaxed separation of scales. Information obtained from simulations carried out at the micro-scale on a unit-cell is used to determine approximate values of metric coefficients in the distance function. The proposed data-driven reduced homogenization also performs adequately in the case of noisy data-sets. Finally, the possible extensions to non-linear history-dependent behavior are discussed.},

We propose a natural extension of a single-domain parallel cell aggregation scheme to problems with a finite number of interfaces; it straightforwardly leads to aggregated finite element spaces that have the structure of a Cartesian product. We demonstrate, through standard numerical analysis and exhaustive numerical experimentation on several complex Poisson and linear elasticity benchmarks, that the new technique enjoys the following properties: well-posedness, robustness with respect to cut location and material contrast, optimal (h-adaptive) approximation properties, high scalability and easy implementation in large-scale finite element codes.

Within the framework of the fixed-stress split algorithm, hinged upon freezing the total mean stress in the flow equations, hydrodynamics and geomechanics subsystems are solved by mixed finite element methods whereas the hyperbolic equation for the water saturation is formulated in terms of the Lagrangian porosity and solved adopting an operator splitting fractional-step method combined with a higher-order non-oscillatory finite volume central scheme. Within this typical multi-physics setting, the sequential formulation allows greater flexibility in the choice of the meshes for the subsystems, particularly for the geomechanics module, which can be solved in the extended domain including the adjacent impervious formations (over-, under- and side-burdens). Considering the upper interface of the rock salt dictated by the profile of saline dome geobodies, whose impermeability property precludes hydraulic communication between adjacent formations, the initial in situ undrained state is also modeled by invoking Skempton’s coefficient along with the characterization of the undrained bulk and shear modulus. By constructing a robust evolving algorithm between the discrete counterparts of the three subsystems in the reservoir, in conjunction with an iterative scheme underlying the mixed method for the nonlinear creep problem in the rock salt, numerical simulations of a water-flooding problem in secondary oil recovery are performed for different realizations of the input random fields. Numerical results illustrate the influence of viscoelastic effects in the cap rock upon subsidence, reservoir compaction, finger grow and breakthrough curves. Comparisons with the performance of traditional one-way formulation are also presented.},

The blood dynamics is modeled by means of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Our algorithm is based on an approximated domain-decomposition of the target geometry into a number of subdomains obtained from the parametrized deformation of geometrical building blocks (e.g., straight tubes and model bifurcations). On each of these building blocks , we build a set of spectral functions by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of a large number of snapshots of finite element solutions (offline phase). The global solution of the Navier–Stokes equations on a target geometry is then found by coupling linear combinations of these local basis functions by means of spectral Lagrange multipliers (online phase). Being that the number of reduced degrees of freedom is considerably smaller than their finite element counterpart, this approach allows us to significantly decrease the size of the linear system to be solved in each iteration of the Newton–Raphson algorithm. We achieve large speedups with respect to the full order simulation (in our numerical experiments, the gain is at least of one order of magnitude and grows inversely with respect to the reduced basis size), whilst still retaining satisfactory accuracy for most cardiovascular simulations.},

  abstract     = {The simulation of fracture using continuum ductile damage models attains a pathological discretization dependence caused by strain localization , after loss of ellipticity of the problem, in regions whose size is connected to the spatial discretization . Implicit gradient techniques suppress this problem introducing some inelastic non-local fields and solving an enriched formulation where the classical balance of linear momentum is fully coupled with a Helmholtz-type equation for each of the non-local variable. Such Helmholtz-type equations determine the distribution of the non-local fields in bands whose width is controlled by a characteristic length , independently on the spatial discretization . The numerical resolution of this coupled problem using the Finite Element method is computationally very expensive and its use to simulate the damage process in 3D multi-phase microstructures becomes prohibitive. In this work, we propose a novel FFT-based iterative algorithm for simulating gradient ductile damage in computational homogenization problems. In particular, the Helmholtz-type equation of the implicit gradient approach is properly generalized to model the regularization of damage in multi-phase media, where multiple damage variables and different characteristic lengths may come into play. In the proposed iterative algorithm, two distinct problems are solved in a staggered fashion: (i) a conventional mechanical problem via a FFT-Galerkin solver with mixed macroscopic loading control and (ii) the generalized Helmholtz-type equation using a Krylov-based algorithm combined with an efficient pre-conditioner. The numerical implementation is firstly validated on simple two-dimensional microstructures, showing identical responses for different spatial discretizations and reproducing a ductility change dependent on the characteristic length . Finally, the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated in the simulation of failure of complex 3D particle reinforced composites characterized by millions of degrees of freedom.},

The quadrature points are Greville abscissae associated with p p th-order B-spline basis functions whose continuities depend on the specific Galerkin formulations, and the quadrature weights are calculated by solving a linear moment fitting problem in each parametric direction. The proposed shell element formulations are shown through numerical studies to be rank sufficient and to be free of spurious modes. The studies reveal comparable accuracy, in terms of both displacement and stress, compared with fully integrated spline-based shell elements, while at the same time reducing storage and computational cost associated with forming element stiffness and mass matrices and force vectors. The high accuracy with low computational cost makes the proposed quadratures along with higher-order spline bases, in particular polynomial orders, p = 5 p=5 and 6, good choices for alleviating membrane and shear locking in shells.},

  abstract     = {Transient wave propagation problems may involve rich discretizations , both in space and in time, leading to computationally expensive simulations, even for simple spatial domains. The Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) is an attractive model order reduction technique to address this issue, especially when the spatial domain is separable. In this work, we propose a space separation with a time adaptive number of modes to efficiently capture transient wave propagation in separable domains. We combine standard time integration schemes with this original space separated representation for empowering standard procedures. The numerical behavior of the proposed method is explored through several 2D wave propagation problems involving radial waves, propagation on long time analyses, and wave conversions. We show that the PGD solution approximates its standard finite element solution counterpart with acceptable accuracy, while reducing the storage needs and the computation time (CPU time). Numerical results show that the CPU time per time step linearly increases when refining the mesh, even with implicit time integration schemes, which is not the case with standard procedures.},

The quasi-periodic boundary conditions are handled by the Floquet–Bloch transform, which converts the computation of band structures into an eigenvalue problem with periodic boundary conditions. More importantly, we show the well-posedness of the proposed method using a delicate argument based on the trace inequality, and further prove the convergence by the Babuška–Osborn theory. We achieve the optimal convergence rate at the presence of the periodic inclusions of general geometry. We demonstrate the theoretical results by two numerical examples, and show the capability of the proposed methods for computing the band structures without fitting the interfaces of periodic inclusions.},

  abstract     = {At every iteration or timestep of the online phase of some reduced-order modelling schemes for non-linear or time-dependent systems, large linear systems must be assembled and then projected onto a reduced order basis of small dimension. The projected small linear systems are cheap to solve, but assembly and projection become the dominant computational cost. In this paper we introduce a new hyper-reduction strategy called reduced assembly (RA) that drastically cuts these costs. RA consists of a triangulation adaptation algorithm that uses a local error indicator to construct a reduced assembly triangulation specially suited to the reduced order basis. Crucially, this reduced assembly triangulation has fewer cells than the original one, resulting in lower assembly and projection costs. We demonstrate the efficacy of RA on a Galerkin-POD type reduced order model (RAPOD). We show performance increases up to five times over the baseline Galerkin-POD method on a non-linear reaction–diffusion problem solved with a semi-implicit time-stepping scheme and up to seven times for a 3D hyperelasticity problem solved with a continuation Newton–Raphson algorithm. The examples are implemented in the DOLFIN finite element solver using PETSc and SLEPc for linear algebra .

  abstract     = {The Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method (SBFEM) is a technique in which approximation spaces are constructed using a semi-analytical approach. They are based on partitions of the computational domain by polygonal/polyhedral subregions , where the shape functions approximate local Dirichlet problems with piecewise polynomial trace data. Using this operator adaptation approach, and by imposing a starlike scaling requirement on the subregions, the representation of local SBFEM shape functions in radial and surface directions is obtained from eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of an ODE system, whose coefficients are determined by the element geometry and the trace polynomial spaces . The aim of this paper is to derive a priori error estimates for SBFEM’s solutions of harmonic test problems. For that, the SBFEM spaces are characterized in the context of Duffy’s approximations for which a gradient-orthogonality constraint is imposed. As a consequence, the scaled boundary functions are gradient-orthogonal to any function in Duffy’s spaces vanishing at the mesh skeleton, a mimetic version of a well-known property valid for harmonic functions . This orthogonality property is applied to provide a priori SBFEM error estimates in terms of known finite element interpolant errors of the exact solution. Similarities with virtual harmonic approximations are also explored for the understanding of SBFEM convergence properties . Numerical experiments with 2D and 3D polytopal meshes confirm optimal SBFEM convergence rates for two test problems with smooth solutions. Attention is also paid to the approximation of a point singular solution by using SBFEM close to the singularity and finite element approximations elsewhere, revealing optimal accuracy rates of standard regular contexts.},

  abstract     = {Computational modeling constitutes a powerful tool to understand the biomechanical function of the heart and the aorta. However, the high dimensionality and non-linear nature of current models can be challenging in terms of computational demands. In this work, we present a novel energy-transform variational formulation (ETVF) for accelerating the numerical simulation of hyperelastic biosolids. To this end, we propose a mixed variational framework, where we introduce auxiliary fields that render the strain energy density into a quadratic form , at the expense of adding unknown fields to the problem. We further reduce the non-linearity of the problem by transforming the constraints that arise due to auxiliary fields in a Lagrange multiplier formulation. The resulting continuous problem is solved by using multi-field non-linear finite-element schemes. We assess the numerical performance of the ETVF by solving two benchmark problems in cardiac and vessel mechanics and one anatomically-detailed model of a human heart under passive filling that assumes an orthotropic heterogeneous constitutive relation. Our results show that the ETVF can deliver speed-ups up to 2.28 × in realistic cardiovascular simulations only by considering the proposed reformulation of the hyperelastic problem. Further, we show that the ETVF can decrease the wall-clock time of simulations solved in parallel architectures (8-cores) by 55%. We argue that the decrease in computational cost is explained by the ability of the ETVF to reduce the condition number of tangent operators. We believe that the ETVF offers an effective framework to accelerate the numerical solution of general hyperelastic problems, enabling the solution of large-scale problems in attractive computing times.

While SCM is well suited for describing crack nucleation and diffuse damage at initial failure stage, DCM offers a great tool to model the subsequent crack growth and its interaction with other failure modes. A hybrid SCM/DCM formulation is developed for CFM, so that the progressive failure process from diffuse damage to propagation of major cracks is characterized.

In this article, an attempt is made to improve the computational performance of the GBMS method by employing algebraic condensation (AC). The interior component of the unit cell is firstly partitioned into a set of small substructures automatically in the algebraic domain, and these substructures are then absorbed into boundary sets by using the improved reduced system (IRS) method. The boundary degrees of freedom (DOFs) are subsequently reduced via the enhanced Craig–Bampton (ECB) method and the local-level characteristic constraint mode reduction, respectively. The coupling residual modes of IRS and ECB processes are then compensated after imposing the Bloch boundary conditions. Through several numerical examples, the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in terms of accuracy and computational cost. The influence of partitioned numbers on the computational efficiency of the proposed method is finally discussed. The numerical results show that the computational efficiency of the GBMS method can be greatly enhanced by using AC for the unit cells with relatively large DOFs or with dense meshes of the exterior boundary, which hence extends the application scope of the GBMS method.},

  abstract     = {A nominal finite element solver is proposed for data-driven finite strain elasticity. It bypasses the need for a constitutive model by considering a database of deformation gradient/first Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensors pairs. The boundary value problem is reformulated as the constrained minimization problem of the distance between (i) the mechanical states, i.e. strain–stress, in the body and (ii) the material states coming from the database. The corresponding constraints are of two types: kinematical, i.e. displacement–strain relation, and mechanical, i.e. conservation linear and angular momenta. The solver uses alternated minimization: the material states are determined from a local search in the database using an efficient tree-based nearest neighbor search algorithm, and the mechanical states result from a standard constrained minimization addressed with an augmented Lagrangian approach. The performance of the solver is demonstrated by means of 2D sanity check examples: the data-driven solution converges to the classical finite element solution when the material database increasingly approximates the constitutive model.

  abstract     = {Having the advancement in automated fiber placement (AFP) and three-dimensional (3D) printing, fabricating novel composites reinforced with curvilinear fibers, namely variable stiffness composites (VSCs), have gradually become feasible. Contrasted to the traditional straight fiber-reinforced composites, VSCs possess significantly enhanced mechanical properties and increased mechanical performance. However, the optimization of a VSC panel is still a challenging problem, which can be attributed to the high non-convexity of the feasible design space and highly involved computation resources. To accelerate the design and optimization of VSC structures, in this study, we propose an effective and efficient adaptive surrogate-based harmony search algorithm (ASBHSA). The VSC is modeled using the fiber path methodology through which the fiber trajectory is generated by a mathematical formulation. In addition, the manufacturability and quality of the product are guaranteed by considering the curvature constraint. For the ASBHSA, a distance-based infill criterion in combination with a radial basis function (RBF) is proposed to guide the adaptive sampling. The global best harmony search (GHS) with a good ability to find the global minimum is integrated into the developed optimization framework. After solving some popular benchmark optimization problems as well as making comparisons of the optimal designs of VSCs with those in published works, the proposed optimization framework is demonstrated being able to effectively and efficiently find the global minimum. Then, a series of designs and optimizations of laminated VSC plates under various boundary conditions and different loading conditions are carried out systematically. The reported interesting findings may provide some insights and guidance in the design of laminated VSC composites. Moreover, our proposed optimization model provides a useful tool for solving various kinds of optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {The advent of novel robot-assisted composite manufacturing techniques has enabled steering of fibre paths in the plane of the lamina, leading to the emergence of the so-called variable angle tow (VAT) composite laminates. These laminates, with spatially varying fibre angle orientations, provide the designer with the ability to tailor the point-wise stiffness properties of VAT composites with substantially more efficient structural performance over conventional straight fibre laminates. As the application of fibre-steered composite laminates has reached an unprecedented scale in both academia and industry in recent years, a reflection upon the state-of-the-art advancements in the modelling, design, and analysis of these advanced structures becomes vital for successfully shaping the future landscape. Motivated by the gap and shortcomings in the available review works, in the present paper, we first summarize and discuss underlying fibre placement technologies including tailored fibre placement (TFP), continuous tow shearing (CTS), and automated fibre placement (AFP). Afterwards, mathematical models of reference fibre path in fibre-steering technology will be reviewed, followed by a detailed discussion on the manufacturing limitations and constraints of the AFP process. Then, design considerations in constructing a ply with multiple courses are elaborated, and key techniques to fill the entire layer with several courses are reviewed. This review is then followed by an introduction to the continuity and smoothness of fibre paths. Furthermore, a description on the material and geometric uncertainties is elaborated. Last but not least, the plate and shell laminate theories, which serve as the fundamental core of the modelling and design of VAT composite structures, are discussed.},

Level-set formulations satisfy the maximum principle for the density but are not energy-stable.

In this paper we derive a novel model for incompressible immiscible two-phase flow with non-matching densities and surface tension that is both energetically-stable and satisfies the maximum principle for the density. The model finds its place at the intersection of level-set and phase-field models. Its derivation is based on a diffusification of the incompressible two-phase Navier–Stokes equations with non-matching densities and surface tension and involves functional entropy variables. Additionally, we present an associated fully-discrete energy-stable method. Isogeometric analysis is used for the spatial discretization and the temporal-integration is performed with a new time-integration scheme that is a perturbation of the second-order midpoint scheme. The fully-discrete scheme is unconditionally energy-dissipative, pointwise divergence-free and satisfies the maximum principle for the density. Numerical examples in two and three dimensions verify the energetic-stability of the methodology.},

It features: (1) using a golden spiral lattice on the unit sphere to generate an initial triangular mesh with any number of vertices/triangles for a star-shaped surface; (2) applying an edge contraction mesh simplification algorithm to reduce the mesh size to any desired level; and (3) adopting an energy-conserving linear normal contact model to compute the contact geometric and force features of contacting particles. In particular, the edge contraction algorithm is applicable to any triangular mesh. It is algorithmically very simple and highly effective, and can be easily incorporated into existing discrete element frameworks. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the simplified mesh by the edge contraction can not only have a very low geometric approximation error but also achieve expected mechanical responses. Thus this mesh simplification approach can serve as an ideal pre-processing tool to optimise a large input triangular mesh in order to significantly reduce the computational cost associated with discrete element simulations without compromising the modelling accuracy.},

A thermal and mechanical stress analysis formulation based on homogenization theory is developed and is used in a regional scaled aggregation stress constraint method. Since specific load cases are not always known beforehand, a method of worst-case stress minimization is also included to efficiently address load uncertainty. It is shown that the two stress-based techniques lead to thermal expansion properties that are highly sensitive to small changes in material distribution and composition. To resolve this issue, a uniform manufacturing uncertainty method is utilized which considers variations in both geometry and material mixture. Test cases of high stiffness, zero thermal expansion, and negative thermal expansion microstructures are generated, and the stress-based and manufacturing uncertainty methods are applied to demonstrate how the techniques alter the optimized designs. Large reductions in stress are achieved while maintaining robust strength and thermal expansion properties.},

A novel method is developed to transfer discrete dislocations in the atomistic domains to dislocation densities in the continuum domain. Propagation of dislocation densities in the continuum domain is modeled by the advection equation of a conserved quantity using the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) in conjunction with the collocation method. Validation studies are conducted by comparing results of the concurrent model with those by MD for nickel single crystal specimen with an embedded crack.

  abstract     = {Crystal plasticity models evolve a polycrystalline yield surface using meso-scale descriptions of deformation mechanisms. The activation of deformation mechanisms is governed by crystallography and a set of model parameters, which are typically calibrated through the fitting of mechanical data such as stress–strain curves and elastic lattice strains. Microstructural data such as phase fractions and texture evolution are used for verifying crystal plasticity parameters. In this work, we use a multi-objective genetic algorithm to identify hardening parameters from flow stress curves with an option to incorporate texture into the optimization approach. Robust, generalized objective functions are developed and used to identify sets of parameters pertaining to dislocation density-based hardening laws in visco-plastic and elasto-plastic self-consistent (VPSC and EPSC) homogenization models. First, the parameters are identified for pure Nb directly from texture using an objective function based on generalized spherical harmonics. Since texture evolution is driven by the relative contribution of active slip systems, the parameters governing the evolution of slip resistance ratios can be recovered from fitting discrete textures at a series of strains. Next, a comprehensive set of load reversal data for dual phase (DP) 780 steel is used to fit a hardening law and a back-stress law in EPSC. Finally, parameters pertaining to a complex hardening law for the evolution of slip and twinning in pure α α -Ti are identified. Remarkably, using texture as an objective in combination with stress–strain objectives constrains the model of Ti to fully reproduce not only stress–strain and texture evolution but also hierarchical twinning measurements as a function of initial grain size and texture. Furthermore, given an appropriate model fit to representative experimental texture evolution, underlying twin volume fractions contributing to texture evolution can be predicted.},

In this model, the diffusion term of the depth-averaged advection–diffusion equation is divided into two parts by the product rule, one part of which is combined into the advection term to produce the pseudo velocity. The relaxation time is independent of the diffusion coefficient, and the remaining value of ( 3 + 3 ) ∕ 6 (3+3)∕6 derived from the Chapmann–Enskog expansion reduces the third-order error. According to the different treatments of the water depth gradient in the equilibrium distribution function, center scheme and linked scheme are developed. Both schemes can ensure the conservation of the solute mass. Numerical tests show that these two schemes give predictions in good agreement, but the linked scheme works better at the breakpoint.

  abstract     = {The presence of nonlinear and state-dependent surface loads within structural dynamic applications often causes an increased computational effort for time integration. Although the degrees of freedom (DOFs) of finite element (FE) models can be reduced significantly via model order reduction (MOR), the determination of nonlinear effects usually depends on the full physical domain. This paper introduces a hyper-reduction (HR) approach, which allows the computation of nonlinear surface loads by a limited number of integration points. One of the fundamental underlying concepts is the creation of mode bases for both the MOR and the reduced load computation, whereby the latter ones are denoted as stress modes. These can be determined a priori from linear FE analyses, for which no fully nonlinear dynamic computations are required. Another relevant step includes the formulation of the contact law based on the calculus of variations, combined with the use of these stress modes. The resulting relationships are in the dimension of the stress modes subspace but still rely on the full physical domain, which is why in this paper, the empirical cubature method (ECM) is proposed to obtain a reduction of the integration points. Based on these theoretical concepts, a general HR framework for nonlinear and state-dependent surface loads is outlined. For a demonstration of the proposed procedure, a planar crank drive with an elastohydrodynamic (EHD) contact between the piston and the cylinder is presented. The quality of the results and the potential for saving computing time are demonstrated by comparing the HR approach with conventional solution techniques.},

We explain how to incorporate the momentum balance and constitutive relations into PINN, and explore in detail the application to linear elasticity, and illustrate its extension to nonlinear problems through an example that showcases von Mises elastoplasticity. While common PINN algorithms are based on training one deep neural network (DNN), we propose a multi-network model that results in more accurate representation of the field variables. To validate the model, we test the framework on synthetic data generated from analytical and numerical reference solutions. We study convergence of the PINN model, and show that Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) results in superior accuracy and convergence characteristics compared with classic low-order Finite Element Method (FEM). We also show the applicability of the framework for transfer learning, and find vastly accelerated convergence during network re-training. Finally, we find that honoring the physics leads to improved robustness: when trained only on a few parameters, we find that the PINN model can accurately predict the solution for a wide range of parameters new to the network—thus pointing to an important application of this framework to sensitivity analysis and surrogate modeling.},

  abstract     = {In the data-driven finite element analysis proposed by Kirchdoerfer and Ortiz (2016) the material data are a direct part of the optimization problem. The mechanical problem is rewritten as a minimization problem of a distance function subject to the conservation laws. For every material point of the finite element geometry nearest neighbor searches need to be performed to find the closest data points describing equilibrium. With increasing dimensions and data density the numerical cost increases significantly. The fact that detailed data are required for good results and that three dimensional examples cannot always be simplified leads to a high computation time and memory demand. Here a multi-level method is proposed to reduce the computational cost of such analyses. Starting point is a coarser initial subset of the data, a first solution is then approximated and successively improved by adaptively refined data sets. Repeated simulations lead to an adequate solution using just a fraction of the total data set. While introducing the method on a simple truss structure example it is shown that this multi-level method significantly reduces computational costs and enables complex data-driven finite element computations by means of an engineering example.},

  abstract     = {We developed a computational framework for simulating thin fluid flow in narrow interfaces between contacting solids, which is relevant for a range of engineering, biological and geophysical applications. The treatment of this problem requires coupling between fluid and solid mechanics equations, further complicated by contact constraints and potentially complex geometrical features of contacting surfaces. We developed a monolithic finite-element framework for handling mechanical contact, thin incompressible viscous flow and fluid-induced tractions on the surface of the solid, suitable for both one- and two-way coupling approaches. Additionally, we consider the possibility of fluid entrapment in ”pools” delimited by contact patches and its pressurization following a non-linear compressibility constitutive law. Image analysis algorithms were adapted to identify the local status of each interface element (i.e. distinguish between contact, fluid flow and trapped fluid zones) within the Newton–Raphson loop. First, an application of the proposed framework for a problem with a model geometry is given, and the robustness is demonstrated by the residual-wise and status-wise convergence. The full capability of the developed two-way coupling framework is demonstrated on a problem of a fluid flow in contact interface between a solid with representative rough surface and a rigid flat. The evolution of the contact pressure, fluid flow pattern and the morphology of trapped fluid zones under increasing external load until the complete sealing of the interface is displayed. Additionally, we demonstrated an almost mesh-independent result of a refined post-processing approach to the real contact-area computation. The developed framework permits not only to study the evolution of effective properties of contact interfaces, such as transmissivity and real contact area, but also to highlight the difference between one- and two-way coupling approaches, and, in particular, to quantify the effect of trapped fluid ”pools” on the coupled problem.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics computational framework for the simulation of large strain fast solid dynamics in thermo-elasticity. The formulation is based on the Total Lagrangian description of a system of first order conservation laws written in terms of the linear momentum, the triplet of deformation measures (also known as minors of the deformation gradient tensor) and the total energy of the system, extending thus the previous work carried out by some of the authors in the context of isothermal elasticity and elasto-plasticity (Lee et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019). To ensure the stability (i.e. hyperbolicity) of the formulation from the continuum point of view, the internal energy density is expressed as a polyconvex combination of the triplet of deformation measures and the entropy density. Moreover, and to guarantee stability from the spatial discretisation point of view, consistently derived Riemann-based numerical dissipation is carefully introduced where local numerical entropy production is demonstrated via a novel technique in terms of the time rate of the so-called ballistic free energy of the system. For completeness, an alternative and equally competitive formulation (in the case of smooth solutions), expressed in terms of the entropy density, is also implemented and compared. A series of numerical examples is presented in order to assess the applicability and robustness of the proposed formulations, where the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics scheme is benchmarked against an alternative in-house Finite Volume Vertex Centred implementation.},

  abstract     = {Interval fields have been introduced to model spatial uncertainty in Finite Element Models when the stochastic resolution of available data is too limited to build representative probabilistic models. However, current interval fields modelling techniques are according to the state-of-the-art limited in potential, as they homogenise the uncertain parameters to globally defined parameters. Hence, these techniques are inherently unable to represent local uncertainty. In practice, local variations in the uncertain parameters (non-stationary uncertainty) often occur, e.g. , through local effects in manufacturing processes. This paper presents a novel method to model local explicit interval fields, that is furthermore less computationally demanding and less conservative than global explicit interval fields. The method presented in this paper is based on the concept of explicit interval fields and develops an alternative approach for the commonly applied inverse distance weighting approach for the generation of the basis functions. The paper includes three case studies to compare the introduced local explicit interval fields approach with the global explicit interval fields method. The obtained results are discussed from a numerical and application point of view to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) is potentially an effective way to automatically generate computational meshes for high-fidelity simulations such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES). When combined with adjoint methods, which are able to localize error contributions, AMR can generate meshes that are optimal for computing a physical quantity of interest (e.g. lift or drag). In order to apply adjoint-based AMR techniques to LES, primal flow solutions are needed to solve the adjoint problem backward in time. However, the resources required to store primal flow solutions can be huge, even prohibitive, in practical problems because of the typically very fine meshes and long averaging times for computing the statistical quantities of interest. Here, a Reduced-Order Representation (ROR) based upon proper orthogonal decomposition is introduced to address this issue. We develop an Enhanced Online Algorithm (EOA) based on incremental singular value decomposition to build this ROR online, which makes adjoint-based AMR feasible for practical applications. An adjoint-based error estimation procedure is first introduced, and verified using a manufactured solution. Then a ROR-driven AMR strategy is studied using a 1D unsteady Burgers problem with a multi-frequency forcing term . This is also used to evaluate the EOA for ROR-driven AMR. Numerical results demonstrate that the enhanced online algorithm generates RORs that are sufficiently accurate for AMR, avoiding the storage of almost all of the primal solution data.},

  abstract     = {The Karhunen–Loève series expansion (KLE) decomposes a stochastic process into an infinite series of pairwise uncorrelated random variables and pairwise L 2 L2 -orthogonal functions. For any given truncation order of the infinite series the basis is optimal in the sense that the total mean squared error is minimized. The orthogonal basis functions are determined as the solution of an eigenvalue problem corresponding to the homogeneous Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, which is computationally challenging for several reasons. Firstly, a Galerkin discretization requires numerical integration over a 2 d 2d dimensional domain, where d d , in this work, denotes the spatial dimension. Secondly, the main system matrix of the discretized weak-form is dense. Consequently, the computational complexity of classical finite element formation and assembly procedures as well as the memory requirements of direct solution techniques become quickly computationally intractable with increasing polynomial degree, number of elements and degrees of freedom. The objective of this work is to significantly reduce several of the computational bottlenecks associated with numerical solution of the KLE. We present a matrix-free solution strategy, which is embarrassingly parallel and scales favorably with problem size and polynomial degree. Our approach is based on (1) an interpolation based quadrature that minimizes the required number of quadrature points; (2) an inexpensive reformulation of the generalized eigenvalue problem into a standard eigenvalue problem; and (3) a matrix-free and parallel matrix–vector product for iterative eigenvalue solvers. Two higher-order three-dimensional C 0 C0 -conforming multipatch benchmarks illustrate exceptional computational performance combined with high accuracy and robustness.},

In this paper, IGABEM based on radial integration method (RI-IGABEM) is used for viscoelastic analysis of solid propellant grain. The memory stress, as the initial stress, leads to the boundary-domain integral equations and thus eliminates the only boundary discretization advantage of boundary element method (BEM). The radial integration method (RIM) is applied to transform the domain integral into an equivalent boundary integral by means of the applied points. The usage of RIM makes it possible to only store the strains on the applied points. Meanwhile, Prony-series is used to discretize the general integrals and to store the two most recent time-step strains rather than the time-step strains of the entire process. The combination between RIM and Prony-series will help reduce the storage space and computational time . In addition, by using the fundamental solutions for linear elastic problems and the regularized technologies, the singular integrals can be solved through the previous methods, such as the Telles scheme and element sub-division method. In order to validate the accuracy and robustness of RI-IGABEM in viscoelastic analysis, the influence of the number and position of applied points as well as the time interval on viscoelastic analysis is discussed through comparing with cell discretization methods. A set of numerical examples demonstrates the ability of the scheme to simulate the viscoelastic problems.},

The method simultaneously employs a ghost-cell technique and distributed forcing technique to impose the boundary conditions. An axis-projected interpolation scheme is used to avoid searching failures during fluid and solid identification. This method yields a topology-free immersed boundary, which particularly suits flow simulations of highly complex geometries. Difficulties generally arise when generating the calculation grid for these scenarios. This method allows dirty data to be handled without any preparatory treatment work to simplify or clean-up the geometry. This method is also applicable to the coherent structural turbulence model employed in this study. The verification cases, used in conjunction with the second-order central-difference scheme, resulted in first-order accuracy at finer resolution, although the coarser resolution retained second-order accuracy. This method is fully parallelized for distributed memory platforms. In this study, the accuracy and fidelity of this method were examined by simulating the flow around the bluff body, past a flat plate, and past dirty spheres. These simulations were compared with experimental data and other established results. Finally, results from the simulation of practical applications demonstrate the ability of the method to model highly complex, non-canonical three-dimensional flows.

The aggregated p -norm global stress measure is adopted to approximate the maximum von Mises stress. The conventional compliance design objective is augmented with p -norm stress measures by introducing one Lagrange multiplier . The Lagrange multiplier is employed to yield compromised designs of compliance and the p -norm stress. A scheme is developed for the determination of the Lagrange multiplier so that the maximum von Mises stress could be effectively constrained. The update of the binary topological design variables lies in the sensitivity numbers derived using the adjoint method. As for the highly nonlinear stress behavior, both topological variables and sensitivity numbers are filtered to stabilize the optimization procedure . The filtered sensitivity numbers are further stabilized with their historical information. A series of comparison studies has been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the method on several benchmark design problems.},

However, it is extremely challenging to model the mechanical and failure behaviours of sintered nano-silver paste due to its random micro-porous structures and the coupled thermomechanical loading conditions. In this study, a novel computational framework was proposed to generate the random micro-porous structures and simulate their effects on mechanical properties and fracture behaviour based on the one-cut gaussian random field model and the thermo-elasto-plastic phase-field model. The elastic modulus, ultimate tensile strength and strain to failure are computed statistically, showing good agreement with the experimental results. Further, the framework was applied to model the fracture of sintered nano-silver paste under thermal cyclic conditions, demonstrating the formation of distinctive crack patterns and complex crack networks. The cracking behaviours observed in the experiments and simulations are remarkably similar to each other. The framework was implemented within Abaqus via a combination of subroutines and Python scripts, automating the process of model generation and subsequent computation.

Two kinds of design variables are assigned to describe the macro and micro scale topology density fields, respectively A multiscale nested form interpolation scheme is constructed from a sequence of discrete terms coupled with the penalty principle which contributes to the selection of candidate microstructures or base materials. The proposed method eliminates the dependency of the dimension of design variables on the number of material types, and significantly reduces the number of design variables. The characteristic function which indicates the existence of each microstructure or base material is introduced to enforce an arbitrary number of volume constraints at the macro and micro scales. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed optimization formulation is also conducted. Finally, the proposed method has been verified and illustrated against multiple examples found in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Dealing with complex geometry boundaries is a challenge for particle boundary conditions. Since the effective area of the fluid particle is cut off by the boundary, it is difficult to obtain accurate results near the boundary, especially for complex geometry shapes. Things become more complicated when dealing with multiple sizes of particles in multi-resolution particle methods. In this paper, a generic smoothed wall (GSW) boundary is proposed by using single layer particles to accurately discretize the boundary. The boundary weight function is transformed to a distance function to fill the vacancy of the particle number density of fluid particles. The GSW boundary can be applied in the static, moving and non-linear deforming wall conditions. It also can be used to effectively handle complex geometric boundaries, since simulation results are not affected by changes in the number and size of wall particles. In addition, the GSW boundary also shows good results when combined with multi-resolution methods solving problems with multiple sizes of particles. In this paper, the MPS–DEM coupling method with GSW boundary model is applied to solve non-linear FSI problem. Several cases have been calculated to validate the accuracy, convergency and stability of the GSW boundary model. Compared with dummy particle boundary, results show that the proposed GSW boundary model can improve the numerical accuracy near the boundary, and handle arbitrary moving boundaries with high efficiency.},

The popular generalized- α α time-marching method provides second-order accuracy in time and controls the numerical dissipation in the high-frequency regions of the discrete spectrum. It includes a wide range of time integrators as particular cases selected by appropriate parameters. Nevertheless, to exploit the spatial discretization’s high-accuracy, in practice, we require high-order time marching methods that handle the poor approximability in the discrete high-frequency range. Thus, we extend the generalized- α α method to increase its order of accuracy while keeping the unconditional stability behavior and the attractive user-control feature on the high-frequency numerical dissipation. A single parameter controls the dissipation, and the update procedure has the same structure as the original second-order method. That is, our high-order schemes require simple modifications of the available implementations of the generalized- α α method.},

  abstract     = {Computer models have been playing a vital role in scientific and engineering problems. However, before using the models, we usually need to calibrate them by utilizing some experimental data from real tests. When calibrating computer models, it is necessary to consider the model structure error/discrepancy and formulate a realistic prior for the model discrepancy function. In this paper, we use a novel approach, i.e., a Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model, to formulate the model discrepancy function, which can be described as a collection of 0-order T–S type fuzzy if-then rules. The premises of the fuzzy rules are determined based on fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering, while the consequence parameters are estimated simultaneously with the calibration parameters. The advantages of this modeling approach can be summarized as: (1) strong ability to exploit expert knowledge, (2) low computational costs, and (3) easy to interpret. Further, based on the T–S fuzzy model prior for the model discrepancy function, we construct the Bayesian model for the calibration problem and design a sampler which combines Gibbs and Metropolis–Hastings steps, forming the framework of Bayesian calibration method based on Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model (BC-TS). To our best knowledge, it is the first attempt to bring a fuzzy model into the Bayesian model calibration. The issue of identifiability is also addressed with the help of Fisher information matrix and analysis results show that the proposed BC-TS method has a good identifiability property. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed BC-TS is verified by a numerical example and a practical example, i.e., the Sandia 2014 verification and validation (V&amp;V) challenge problem.},

  abstract     = {Over the last few decades, existing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) solvers have demonstrated a tremendous success in solving complex, non-linear PDEs. Although accurate, these PDE solvers are computationally costly. With the advances in Machine Learning (ML) technologies, there has been a significant increase in the research of using ML to solve PDEs. The goal of this work is to develop an ML-based PDE solver, that couples’ important characteristics of existing PDE solvers with ML technologies. The two solver characteristics that have been adopted in this work are: (1) the use of discretization-based schemes to approximate spatio-temporal partial derivatives and (2) the use of iterative algorithms to solve linearized PDEs in their discrete form. In the presence of highly non-linear, coupled PDE solutions, these strategies can be very important in achieving good accuracy, better stability and faster convergence. Our ML-solver, DiscretizationNet, employs a generative CNN-based encoder–decoder model with PDE variables as both input and output features. During training, the discretization schemes are implemented inside the computational graph to enable faster GPU computation of PDE residuals, which are used to update network weights that result into converged solutions. A novel iterative capability is implemented during the network training to improve the stability and convergence of the ML-solver. The ML-Solver is demonstrated to solve the steady, incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in 3-D for several cases such as, lid-driven cavity, flow past a cylinder and conjugate heat transfer .},

This study presents new peridynamic (PD) beam and shell models with the effect of transverse shear deformation based on the micro-beam bond and the Timoshenko beam theory. Interpolation method is used for describing axial, torsional, bending and transverse shear deformations as well as the corresponding strain energy densities of the micro-beam bond. The micro moduli for PD beam and shell models can be solved spontaneously. The deflections of the PD models for thin/thick beams and shells are captured accurately due to the high-order relationships between the transverse forces/bending moments and the deflections/rotational angles of the micro-beam bond. Also, no restrictions are needed on the material parameters in the PD models. The simulation results prove the high precision of the presented PD beam and shell models.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a general high-order kernel regularization technique applicable to all four integral operators of Calderón calculus associated with linear elliptic PDEs in two and three spatial dimensions. Like previous density interpolation methods, the proposed technique relies on interpolating the density function around the kernel singularity in terms of solutions of the underlying homogeneous PDE , so as to recast singular and nearly singular integrals in terms of bounded (or more regular) integrands . We present here a simple interpolation strategy which, unlike previous approaches, does not entail explicit computation of high-order derivatives of the density function along the surface. Furthermore, the proposed approach is kernel- and dimension-independent in the sense that the sought density interpolant is constructed as a linear combination of point-source fields, given by the same Green’s function used in the integral equation formulation, thus making the procedure applicable, in principle, to any PDE with known Green’s function. For the sake of definiteness , we focus here on Nystr‘̀om methods for the (scalar) Laplace and Helmholtz equations and the (vector) elastostatic and time-harmonic elastodynamic equations. The method’s accuracy, flexibility, efficiency, and compatibility with fast solvers are demonstrated by means of a variety of large-scale three-dimensional numerical examples .},

To enable a systematic approach to design fiber-reinforced materials and structures, we propose a general topology optimization framework for the computational optimized design of hyperelastic structures with nonlinear and anisotropic fiber reinforcements under large deformations. This framework simultaneously optimizes both the material distribution in the matrix phase and the orientations of the underlying fiber reinforcements, by parameterizing matrix and fiber phases individually using two sets of design variables. The optimized distribution of fiber orientations is chosen from a set of discrete orientations defined a priori , and several fiber orientation interpolation schemes are studied. In addition, this work proposes a novel anisotropic material interpolation scheme, which integrates both matrix and fiber design variables (both with material nonlinearity) into the stored-energy function. To improve the computational efficiency of both optimization and nonlinear structural analysis, we derive a fully decoupled fiber-matrix update scheme that performs parallel updates of the matrix and fiber design variables and employ the virtual element method (VEM) together with a tailored mesh adaptivity scheme to solve the finite elasticity boundary value problem. Design examples involving three objective functions are presented, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework in designing anisotropic hyperelastic structures under large deformations.},

  abstract     = {Peridynamics (PD) becomes increasingly promising in computational fracture mechanics for its powerful ability to capture complex crack problems. Nevertheless, the PD applications are mainly limited to brittle fracture , and a robust PD model for predicting mixed mode fracture of quasi-brittle materials is still lacking. In this work, a novel damage model is proposed in the PD-CZM to accurately predict quasi-brittle failure under quasi-static mixed-mode loading, especially shear-dominated loading. In order to establish the damage criterion of quasi-brittle materials, the bond potential in bond based peridynamics (BBPD) is firstly separated into the dilatational part and deviatoric part. Instead of using existing bond stretch-based failure criterion, a new damage criterion obtained by combining bond stretch and dilatational bond potential is firstly proposed to determine the damage initiation. Also, the tension softening behavior of quasi-brittle materials is described in the damage model by a well-established degradation curve based on an energy-equivalence principle. Besides, to robustly solve the physical nonlinear characteristics, especially tension softening-induced snap-back phenomenon, the implicit implementation of the PD-CZM is performed with different implicit solution methods . Three challenging benchmarks are simulated to validate the proposed damage model, including Schlangen’s single-edge notched beam test, Nooru-Mohamed’s double edge-notched concrete specimen (DENS) test and Arrea and Ingraffea’s single notched shear beam test with severe snap-back behavior. Both the predicted crack paths and the load–displacement curves are in perfect agreement with the experimental observations and other numerical results, clearly demonstrating the validity of the proposed damage model and the robustness of the implicit implementation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel density-based topology optimization method for cellular structures with quasi-periodic microstructures is proposed. Here, ‘quasi-periodic’ is developed from periodic microstructures composed with a base unit cell, through gradually changing one or multiple alterable microstructural sizing/shape parameters. However, it is a challenge and key issue to identify the explicit alterable parameters in the density-based topology frame, since the microstructural topology is described by voxel densities. For solving this problem, an erode–dilate based method for describing the quasi-periodic microstructures is proposed. A family of quasi-periodic microstructures is formed by executing the erode–dilate operators on the base unit cell with different operator parameters. The topology optimization of quasi-periodic cellular structures is formulated as simultaneously optimizing the topology of the base unit cell and the volume fractions of macro-elements that correspond to the candidate microstructures. Furthermore, to avoid the small structural members being eliminated in the eroded process, the structural skeleton is extracted to modify the eroded process. Sensitivities of the structural compliance with respect to the two types of design variables are derived, and the gradient-based optimization method is applied to update the design variables. In the obtained results, the neighboring microstructures have similar topologies and varying volume fractions . The design space has been expanded compared with the periodic cellular structures, and the connectivity issue of the conventional heterogeneous microstructures has been resolved. The numerical examples validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results show that the quasi-periodic cellular structures have better performances than single-scale structures and periodic cellular structures.},

  abstract     = {The random field theory is often utilized to characterize the inherent spatial variability of material properties. In order to incorporate sampled data from site investigations or experiments into simulations, a patching algorithm is developed to yield a conditional random field in this study. Comparison is conducted between the proposed algorithm and the conventional Kriging algorithm to underscore the former’s advantages in simulating material properties with limited sampled data. Unlike the Kriging algorithm that interpolates the entire spatial domain, the proposed algorithm restricts the influence domain of sampled data within a reasonable range, which is determined as a function of the scale of fluctuation. The simulated conditional random field via the proposed algorithm is stationary in mean and variance; thus, it would be preferable for situations with a few known data. Additionally, a tunnel excavation model is considered to exemplify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. By virtue of Monte-Carlo simulations, maximum tunnel convergence modeled by unconditional and conditional random fields is analyzed in a statistical manner. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the uncertainty of prediction in responses. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is also applicable with a sparse sampling pattern.},

  abstract     = {Phononic crystals (PnCs) have seen increasing popularity due to band gap property for sound wave propagation. As a natural bridge, topology optimization has been applied to the design of PnCs. However, thus far most of the existent works on topological design of PnCs have been focused on single micro-scale topology optimization of a periodical unit cell. Moreover, practical manufacturing of those designed structures has been rarely involved. This paper presents a quasi two-scale topology optimization framework suitable for additive manufacturing (AM) implementation to design 2D phononic-like structures with respect to sound transmission coefficient (STC). A designate topology is employed and subjected to sizing optimization in the micro-scale design. The thin-walled square lattice structures made of single metal material are selected as the infills for the design domain to guarantee material connectivity in the optimized design in order to facilitate fabrication by AM. The practical effective mechanical property of the lattice structures with different volume densities obtained by experimental measurement is employed in the topology optimization. The proposed framework is applied to the design of 2D phononic-like structures with different macroscopic shapes for the desired band gap feature. Numerical examples show the desired band gap containing a prescribed excitation frequency can be realized through the proposed quasi two-scale topology optimization method. Moreover, the optimized designs are reconstructed into CAD files with the thin-walled lattice infills. The reconstruction makes fabrication of the optimized designs feasible by practical AM process .},

  abstract     = {Pentamode metamaterials (PMMs) are a new class of three-dimensional (3D) mechanical metamaterials, engineered to have unusual elastic property of vanishing shear modulus . Here ‘penta’ denotes five, referring to only one non-zero but five vanishing eigenvalues in the elasticity tensor of isotropic materials. PMMs gain their properties from their rationally designed structural architecture rather than their composition, mimicking the behavior of fluids but are solid, hard to compress yet easy to deform. Compared to most up-to-date design methods based on rigid-body double-cone concept, this paper is to propose, for the first time, a new generative design method using topology optimization to find novel micro-lattice architectures, to enable pentamode properties through the overall elastic deformation of the micro-lattice. The design problem is then formulated to make the micro-lattice have a large but realistically attainable ratio of effective bulk modulus compared to the shear modulus , corresponding to the isotropic microstructure with the effective Poisson’s ratio close to 0.5. The larger of the ratio, the better of the PMM solids to simulate liquids. Several numerical cases with the additive manufacture technique (SLM: selective laser melting) are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed topological design method in this paper.},

Heat transfers between the actual fluids and the fictitious particle are treated as a multiphase problem by the CFD to resolve the temperature gradient distribution within each granular particle and its possible phase change (e.g., melting or partial melting). The mechanical interactions between the solid particles and the fluids are modeled by coupled DEM and CFD. The proposed method is validated by simulations of a typical powder-based selective laser melting (PB-SLM) process. Three key SLM input parameters, laser power, laser energy distribution and hatch distance , are examined on the effect of melting. The simulation results capture key features and observations of PB-SLM found in experiments and are quantitatively consistent with available testing data.

  abstract     = {Pattern formation is a widely observed phenomenon in diverse fields including materials physics, developmental biology and ecology, among many others. The physics underlying the patterns is specific to the mechanisms, and is encoded by partial differential equations (PDEs). With the aim of discovering hidden physics, we have previously presented a variational approach to identifying such systems of PDEs in the face of noisy data at varying fidelities ( Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering , 356 :44–74, 2019). Here, we extend our variational system identification methods to address the challenges presented by image data on microstructures in materials physics. PDEs are formally posed as initial and boundary value problems over combinations of time intervals and spatial domains whose evolution is either fixed or can be tracked. However, the vast majority of microscopy techniques for evolving microstructure in a given material system deliver micrographs of pattern evolution over domains that bear no relation with each other at different time instants. The temporal resolution can rarely capture the fastest time scales that dominate the early dynamics, and noise abounds. Furthermore, data for evolution of the same phenomenon in a material system may well be obtained from different physical specimens. Against this backdrop of spatially unrelated, sparse and multi-source data, we exploit the variational framework to make judicious choices of weighting functions and identify PDE operators from the dynamics. A consistency condition arises for parsimonious inference of a minimal set of the spatial operators at steady state. It is complemented by a confirmation test that provides a sharp condition for acceptance of the inferred operators. The entire framework is demonstrated on synthetic data that reflect the characteristics of the experimental material microscopy images.},

The finite-element discretization of the model is performed in Firedrake and relies on the PETSc solver library. The large systems of linear equations arising are efficiently solved using GMRES and a geometric multigrid preconditioner with a carefully chosen relaxation. The modeling capabilities are illustrated through a 3D simulation of the microstructure evolution in a pseudoelastic CuAlNi single crystal during nano-indentation, with all six orthorhombic martensite variants taken into account.

  abstract     = {The numerical simulation of wave propagation in heterogeneous unbounded media using domain discretization techniques requires truncation of the physical domain: at the truncation boundary, Perfectly Matched Layers (PMLs) – buffers wherein wave attenuation is imposed – are often used to mimic outgoing wave motion and prevent waves from re-entering the interior computational domain. The PML’s wave-dissipative properties derive from a coordinate mapping concept, where the physical coordinate is mapped onto a frequency-dependent complex coordinate in the PML via a complex stretching function. The choice of the stretching function controls not only the spectral character and the absorptive properties of the PML, but also, more critically, the long-time stability when the computational domain-PML ensemble is used for transient wave simulations. The standard PML stretching function can lead to error growth, particularly when propagating waves impinge at grazing incidence on the truncation boundary. By contrast, a modification to the standard stretching function that has led to the Complex-Frequency-Shifted CFS-PML has been shown to alleviate the temporal instability. However, whereas PML formulations using the standard stretching function can lead to second-order in time semi-discrete forms, affording multifaceted benefits, all CFS-PML formulations to date require the evaluation of convolutions. In this paper, we discuss a new CFS-PML formulation that avoids the evaluation of convolutions, while preserving the second-order temporal character of elastic waves. It is shown that, upon spatial discretization, the CFS-PML can be completely described by a triad of stiffness, damping, and mass matrices, which can be readily incorporated into existing finite element codes originally designed for interior problems, to endow them with wave simulation capabilities on unbounded domains. Numerical experiments in the time-domain demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach; we also report long-time stability for problems involving waveguides and grazing wave incidence.},

  abstract     = {The simulation of structural problems involving the deformations of volumetric bodies is of paramount importance in many areas of engineering. Although the use of tetrahedral elements is extremely appealing, tetrahedral discretisations are generally known as very stiff and are hence often avoided in typical simulation workflows. The development of mixed displacement–pressure approaches has allowed to effectively overcome this problem leading to a class of locking-free elements which can effectively compete with hexahedral discretisations while retaining obvious advantages in the mesh generation step. Despite such advantages the adoption of the technology within commercial codes is not yet pervasive. This can be attributed to two different reasons: the difficulty in making use of standard constitutive libraries and the implied continuity of the pressure, which makes the application of the method questionable in the context of multi-material problems. Current paper proposes the adoption of the volumetric strain instead of the pressure as a nodal value . Such choice leads to the definition of a modified strain making the use of standard strain-driven constitutive laws straightforward. At the same time, the continuity of the volumetric strain across multimaterial interfaces can be understood as a sort of kinematic constraint (stresses can still remain discontinuous across material interfaces). The new element also opens the door to the use of anisotropic constitutive laws, which are typically problematic in the context of mixed elements.},

However, its formulation is based on classical continuum mechanics and is not suitable for crack propagation problems. The peridynamics (PD) theory is based on the non-local integral equation, which avoids the discontinuous problem of classical continuum mechanics and can solve the crack problems. In this paper, a coupling model of IGA and bond-based PD (IGA-PD) is proposed to provide the solution to crack problem of model with exact geometry. We prove that in the IGA-PD coupling model, the PD nodes can be constructed by using the control net from IGA. The implicit and explicit formulas of the PD model are combined with IGA formulations based on the force balance principle. Through setting the isogeometric model on the domain near the boundaries, the surface effect of the PD model can be relieved. The IGA-PD model fully utilizes the advantages of non-local continuum theory and improves the precision and computational efficiency in calculation of crack problems. The coupling method is straightforward and effective, and can be integrated within existing IGA codes. Examples of static problems and crack propagations are given to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The geometric reinterpretation of the Finite Element Method (FEM) shows that Raviart–Thomas and Nédélec mass matrices map from degrees of freedoms (DoFs) attached to geometric elements of a tetrahedral grid to DoFs attached to the barycentric dual grid. The algebraic inverses of the mass matrices map DoFs attached to the barycentric dual grid back to DoFs attached to the corresponding primal tetrahedral grid, but they are of limited practical use since they are dense. In this paper we present a new geometric construction of sparse inverse mass matrices for arbitrary tetrahedral grids and possibly inhomogeneous and anisotropic materials, debunking the conventional wisdom that the barycentric dual grid prohibits a sparse representation for inverse mass matrices. In particular, we provide a unified framework for the construction of both edge and face mass matrices and their sparse inverses. Such a unifying principle relies on novel geometric reconstruction formulas, from which, according to a well-established design strategy, local mass matrices are constructed as the sum of a consistent and a stabilization part. A major difference with the approaches proposed so far is that the consistent part is defined geometrically and explicitly, that is, without the necessity of computing the inverses of local matrices. This provides a sensible speedup and an easier implementation. We use these new sparse inverse mass matrices to discretize a three-dimensional Poisson problem , providing the comparison between the results obtained by various formulations on a benchmark problem with analytical solution.},

In optimal design problem, material layout of the FGPs and control voltages of piezoelectric layers are simultaneously optimized under the conditions of minimum static shape error and maximum first-order natural frequency. The B-spline control points for describing ceramic volume fraction distribution of the FGPs and the applied voltages are taken as design variables.

  abstract     = {We introduce a deep learning framework designed to train smoothed elastoplasticity models with interpretable components, such as the stored elastic energy function, yield surface, and plastic flow that evolve based on a set of deep neural network predictions. By recasting the yield function as an evolving level set , we introduce a deep learning approach to deduce the solutions of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation that governs the hardening/softening mechanism. This machine learning hardening law may recover any classical hand-crafted hardening rules and discover new mechanisms that are either unbeknownst or difficult to express with mathematical expressions. Leveraging Sobolev training to gain control over the derivatives of the learned functions, the resultant machine learning elastoplasticity models are thermodynamically consistent, interpretable, while exhibiting excellent learning capacity. Using a 3D FFT solver to create a polycrystal database, numerical experiments are conducted and the implementations of each component of the models are individually verified. Our numerical experiments reveal that this new approach provides more robust and accurate forward predictions of cyclic stress paths than those obtained from black-box deep neural network models such as the recurrent neural network , the 1D convolutional neural network , and the multi-step feed-forward model.},

  abstract     = {Finding fast yet accurate numerical solutions to the Helmholtz equation remains a challenging task. The pollution error (i.e. the discrepancy between the numerical and analytical wave number k k ) requires the mesh resolution to be kept fine enough to obtain accurate solutions. A recent study showed that the use of Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) for the spatial discretization significantly reduces the pollution error. However, solving the resulting linear systems by means of a direct solver remains computationally expensive when large wave numbers or multiple dimensions are considered. An alternative lies in the use of (preconditioned) Krylov subspace methods . Recently, the use of the exact Complex Shifted Laplacian Preconditioner (CSLP) with a small complex shift has shown to lead to wave number independent convergence while obtaining more accurate numerical solutions using IgA. In this paper, we propose the use of deflation techniques combined with an approximated inverse of the CSLP using a geometric multigrid method . Numerical results obtained for one- and two-dimensional model problems, including constant and non-constant wave numbers, show scalable convergence with respect to the wave number and approximation order p p of the spatial discretization . Furthermore, when k h kh is kept constant, the proposed approach leads to a significant reduction of the computational time compared to the use of the multigrid-approximated or exact inverse of the CSLP with a small shift, in particular for three-dimensional model problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an isogeometric formulation of the Reissner–Mindlin shell, using the Mixed Interpolation of Tensorial Components (MITC) technique to alleviate shear locking and membrane locking. Instead of over each Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) element, kinematics of the shell is directly formulated on the entire NURBS patch, with its displacements decoupled to the motions of control points and of director vectors tied to the control points. Since control points are in general not located on the surface, those control-point director vectors are interpolated from normal vectors at a set of pre-defined integration points on the patch. The assumed in-plane membrane strain field and the assumed transverse shear strain field are built as linear combinations of NURBS basis functions with degrees lower than those employed by the displacement interpolation, and tied to the original covariant strain fields at a set of well-selected tying points. Integration points for the definition of control-point director vectors and tying points of the assumed covariant strain fields are provided by the optimal and reduced macro-element quadrature rules, respectively. In this way, the classical MITC technique is fully incorporated into the isogeometric framework with arbitrary polynomial orders or patch configurations. Thanks to the high smoothness of NURBS basis functions , the geometry-preserving nature of isogeometric transformation, and the locking-resistive capability of MITC technique, the isogeometric MITC shell formulation shows superior convergence behavior , minimal geometrical error, and good robustness against patch distortion. In particular, its convergence property is insensitive to NURBS polynomial order or control point density. These advantages are demonstrated through a number of well-established benchmark problems, validating the proposed isogeometric MITC formulation being an accurate and efficient solution for linear analysis of shell structures .},

There are two levels of rigid-body qualification, one is on the buckling theory of the rod itself and the other on the isogeometric formulation for discretization . Both will be illustrated. Based on the updated Lagrangian formulation of three-dimensional continua, the rotational effect of end moments is naturally included in the external virtual work done by end tractions without introducing any definition of finite rotations. Both the geometric torsion and curvatures of the rod are considered closely for the centroidal axis , except with the omission of higher order terms. The geometric stiffness matrix for internal moments is consistent with that of the geometrically exact rod model with its rigid-body quality demonstrated. For structures rigorously defined for the deformed state, the geometric stiffness matrix after global assembly is always symmetric, for both the internal and external moments. By adopting the invariant isogeometric discretization following our previous work, a series of numerical examples , including the cases of external conservative moments, angled joint and complicated spatial geometry, were solved for buckling analysis, by which the reliability of the geometric stiffness matrix derived is verified via comparison with the analytical or straight beam solutions.},

  abstract     = {Meshfree discretizations of state-based peridynamic models are attractive due to their ability to naturally describe fracture of general materials. However, two factors conspire to prevent meshfree discretizations of state-based peridynamics from converging to corresponding local solutions as resolution is increased: quadrature error prevents an accurate prediction of bulk mechanics, and the lack of an explicit boundary representation presents challenges when applying traction loads. In this paper, we develop a reformulation of the linear peridynamic solid (LPS) model to address these shortcomings, using improved meshfree quadrature, a reformulation of the nonlocal dilatation, and a consistent handling of the nonlocal traction condition to construct a model with rigorous accuracy guarantees. In particular, these improvements are designed to enforce discrete consistency in the presence of evolving fractures, whose a priori unknown location render consistent treatment difficult. In the absence of fracture, when a corresponding classical continuum mechanics model exists, our improvements provide asymptotically compatible convergence to corresponding local solutions, eliminating surface effects and issues with traction loading which have historically plagued peridynamic discretizations . When fracture occurs, our formulation automatically provides a sharp representation of the fracture surface by breaking bonds, avoiding the loss of mass. We provide rigorous error analysis and demonstrate convergence for a number of benchmarks, including manufactured solutions, free-surface, nonhomogeneous traction loading, and composite material problems. Finally, we validate simulations of brittle fracture against a recent experiment of dynamic crack branching in soda-lime glass, providing evidence that the scheme yields accurate predictions for practical engineering problems.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript presents a multiscale reduced-order modeling framework for heterogeneous materials that accounts for both cohesive interface failure and continuum damage. The model builds on the eigendeformation-based reduced-order homogenization model (EHM), which relies on the pre-calculation of a set of coefficient tensors that account for the effects of linear and nonlinear material behavior between regions of the domain known as parts. A k-means clustering algorithm is used to optimally construct these parts and a new formulation for the partitioning of interfaces using this method is proposed. The extraction of the volumetric and interfacial influence functions is performed using the Interface-enriched Generalized Finite Element Method (IGFEM), which relies on a finite element discretization that does not conform to the material phase boundaries. A Lagrange multiplier method is used in this preprocessing phase, allowing for the reuse of the matrix factorization for different influence function problems and hence leading to efficiency improvement. A newly proposed traction calculation for the interface partition is also adopted to alleviate the instability caused by traction calculations along interfaces. The accuracy and efficiency of the IGFEM–EHM method is assessed through comparison with reference IGFEM simulations. The method is then used to extract the nonlinear multiscale response of particulate, unidirectional fiber-reinforced, and woven composites.},

  abstract     = {A superconvergent isogeometric collocation method that employs the conventional Greville abscissae as collocation points is proposed. Firstly, a basis transformation is presented for isogeometric basis functions, which preserves the exact geometry representation characterized by isogeometric analysis. More specifically, the geometry is exactly represented by the transformed isogeometric basis functions and the Greville points that function as control points in the current formulation. Meanwhile, the proposed basis transformation enables a very straightforward formulation of the consistency conditions. It also turns out that the transformed isogeometric basis functions span the same solution space as the standard isogeometric basis functions. Subsequently, with the aid of these consistency conditions, an accuracy analysis is presented for multi-dimensional isogeometric collocation formulation and the basis degree discrepancy issue is theoretically identified. In order to resolve this issue, a recursive gradient formulation is further introduced to effectively construct the gradients of transformed isogeometric basis functions. It is shown that these recursive gradients meet additional higher order consistency conditions. Consequently, a superconvergent isogeometric collocation method is finally established, which utilizes the recursive gradients to replace the conventional gradients of isogeometric basis functions and directly collocates at Greville points. The superconvergence of the proposed method regarding odd degree basis functions is then proved, which is also well manifested by numerical results.},

  abstract     = {The penalty method has proven to be a well-suited approach for the application of coupling and boundary conditions on (trimmed) multi-patch NURBS shell structures within isogeometric analysis. Beside its favorable simplicity and efficiency, the main challenge is the appropriate choice of the underlying penalty factor — choosing the penalty factor too low yields a poor constraint accuracy, while choosing it too high causes numerical issues like ill-conditioned system matrices or a small infeasible time step size in explicit dynamics. Although recommendations for penalty values exist, profound methods for its determination are still an active field of research. We address this issue and provide formulas allowing an a priori determination of penalty factors for NURBS-based Reissner–Mindlin shells with penalty-based coupling and boundary conditions. The underlying approach is inspired by a methodology previously used for conventional finite elements, for which penalty factors are derived through a comparison with exact Lagrange multiplier solutions. In that way, penalty formulas consisting of a problem-dependent factor and a problem-independent intensity factor are obtained. The fact that the latter is a direct measure of the penalty-induced error is the main advantage of this approach and enables a problem-independent definition of the penalty factor as a function of the desired accuracy. We demonstrate the validity of the derived formulas and the corresponding error measure with benchmark problems in linear elasticity including trimmed non-matching NURBS shells. Furthermore we show that the mesh-adaptivity of the penalty formulas improves the convergence behavior and conditioning of penalty methods.},

  abstract     = {Recently, several approaches for multiscale simulations for problems with high contrast and no scale separation are introduced. Among them is nonlocal multicontinua (NLMC) method, which introduces multiple macroscopic variables in each computational grid . These approaches explore the entire coarse block resolution and one can obtain optimal convergence results independent of contrast and scales. However, these approaches are not amenable to many multiscale simulations, where the subgrid effects are much smaller than the coarse-mesh resolution. For example, molecular dynamics of shale gas occurs in much smaller length scales compared to the coarse-mesh size, which is of orders of meters. In this case, one cannot explore the entire coarse-grid resolution in evaluating effective properties . In this paper, we merge the concepts of nonlocal multicontinua methods and Representative Volume Element (RVE) concepts to explore problems with extreme scale separation. The first step of this approach is to use sub-grid scale (sub to RVE) to write a large-scale macroscopic system . We call it intermediate scale macroscale system. In the next step, we couple this intermediate macroscale system to the simulation grid model, which are used in simulations. This is done using RVE concepts, where we relate intermediate macroscale variables to the macroscale variables defined on our simulation coarse grid. Our intermediate coarse model allows formulating macroscale variables correctly and coupling them to the simulation grid. We present the general concept of our approach and present details of single-phase flow. Some numerical results are presented. For nonlinear examples, we use machine learning techniques to compute macroscale parameters.},

The model is partitioned into two parts, (1) the SHSM equations and (2) the dispersive correction part, which are discretized using discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods . This splitting technique provides a facility to select dynamically regions of a problem domain where the dispersive term is not applied, e.g. wave breaking regions where the dispersive wave model is no longer valid. Algorithms that can handle wetting–drying and detect wave breaking are provided and a number of numerical examples are presented to validate the developed numerical solution algorithm. The results of the simulations indicate that the model is capable of predicting sediment transport and bed morphodynamic processes correctly provided that the empirical models for the suspended and bed load transport are properly calibrated. Moreover, the developed model is able to accurately capture hydrodynamics and wave dispersion effects up to swash zones, and its application is justified for simulations where dispersive wave effects are prevalent.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new particle-based fluid–rigid-body interaction simulator for violent free-surface flow problems is developed. The incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (ISPH) method has been proven to produce a smooth and accurate pressure distribution of free-surface fluid flow with breaking and fragmentation. Computed hydrodynamic forces can be applied onto rigid bodies, which may simultaneously experience contact or impact with the surrounding wall boundaries or another rigid body . Modeled by using the discrete element method (DEM), the contact force between rigid bodies is traditionally calculated employing the penalty approach, where a spring-based repulsive force is approximated at the vicinity of contact points depending on the deepest penetration depth. However, for high-speed collision problems involving a system of many rigid bodies, the values of approximated repulsive forces may be highly overestimated, and thus, a much smaller time step and an excessive damping parameter are often required to stabilize the approximated forces. This problem is highly inefficient for the computational resources of the fluid–rigid body interaction simulation since the computational cost at each time step is mostly dominated by the incompressible fluid simulation . The capability to increase the time increment following the critical time step of the fluid solver is, therefore, strongly demanded to increase the simulation efficiency. The current paper incorporates the usage of the energy-tracking impulse (ETI) method as an alternative approach to handle contact accurately. To achieve better energy conservation and enhance stability, Stronge’s hypothesis is considered instead of the generally assumed Newton’s contact law. The current work also covers three experimental validation tests, which were conducted to assure the quality and robustness of the coupled ISPH–DEM implementation.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new level set based multi-material topology optimization method, where a difference-set-based multi-material level set (DS-MMLS) model is developed for topology description and an alternating active-phase algorithm is implemented. Based on the alternating active-phase algorithm, a multi-material topology optimization problem with N + 1 phases is split into N ( N + 1)/2 binary-phase topology optimization sub-problems. Compared with the initial multi-material problem, each sub-problem involves fewer design variables and volume constraints. In the DS-MMLS model, N + 1 phases are represented by the sequential difference set of N level set functions. Based on this model, the topological evolution of two active phases can be easily achieved by updating a single level set function in a fixed domain, which contributes a great convenience to the implementation of the alternating active-phase algorithm with level set method. Therefore, the proposed method can be easily extended to topology optimization problems with more material phases. To demonstrate its effectiveness, some 2D and 3D numerical examples with different material phases are presented. The results reveal that the proposed method is effective for multi-material topology optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Multi-scale topology optimization (MTO) is exploited today in applications that require designs with large surface-to-volume ratio. Further, with the advent of additive manufacturing, MTO has gained significant prominence. However, a major drawback of MTO is that it is computationally expensive. As an alternate, graded MTO has been proposed where the design features at the smaller scale are graded variations of a single microstructure. This leads to significant reduction in computational cost, while retaining many of the benefits of MTO. Graded MTO fundamentally rests on interpolation of elasticity matrices. The direct method of interpolation used today unfortunately does not guarantee positive-definiteness of the resulting matrices. Consequently, during the graded MTO algorithm the strain energy may become negative and non-physical. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective spectral decomposition -based approach which guarantees positive-definite elasticity matrices. The proposed method relies on a spectral (eigen) decomposition of instances of the elasticity matrices, followed by regression of eigenvalues and interpolation of eigenvector orientations. The resulting elasticity matrix can then be used for stable optimization. The direct and spectral decomposition methods are compared here for robustness, accuracy and speed, through several numerical experiments.},

The model consist of two phases, the lipid bilayer and the electrolyte. The two-phases problem is modeled using the phase-field method, a subclass of the diffusive interface models. The bending, flexoelectric and dielectric energies of the model are reformulated using the phase-field parameter. A modified Augmented-Lagrangian approach was used to satisfy the constraints while maintaining numerical stability and a relatively large time step. This approach guarantees the satisfaction of the constraints at each time step over the entire temporal domain. The results show the superiority of the isogeometric analysis in solving high-order differential operators without the need for additional intermediate equations to account for classical mesh-based methods limited continuity. On the physical side, the morphological evolution of the vesicles can be simulated accurately using IGA, even when considering the flexoelectric response of the biomembrane, which adds another layer of numerical complexity to the system. The effect of the flexoelectricity , the conductivity ratio and other aspects of the problem are studied through several 3D numerical examples .},

Nevertheless, the existing researches reveal several unfavorable issues including the fiber dis-continuity, the length scale separation, the decreased design freedom, as well as the complicated fiber orientation optimization. Thus, this paper proposes a full-scale fiber-reinforced structure topology optimization method that is capable of simultaneous design for the structural topology, continuous fiber path, and its morphology (i.e., fiber volume, spacing and thickness). The method builds upon a bi-material element-wise density-based topology optimization framework, where the matrix material and fiber material are considered in a uniform finite element model without the scale separation. Furthermore, a novel fiber generation scheme is developed, in which the bi-material constraint method is introduced by combining the total solid (composite) volume constraint and local fiber proportion constraint, so as to drive the evolution of the general topology, continuous fiber path and fiber morphology, respectively. In this way, it can avoid the above existing issues of the current FRC designs. The fiber-reinforced structures can be naturally generated with continuous fiber paths. Several numerical examples for compliance minimization problems are provided to show the merits of the full-scale optimization method for fiber-reinforced structures. The interpretation design procedure and post-processing error simulation analysis are also presented to further validate the applicability of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {All material point method (MPM) codes approximate the full mass matrix with a lumped mass matrix . Because this approach causes dissipation, most MPM simulations rely on so-called FLIP methods to limit dissipation. Recent work to deal with noise caused by those FLIP methods derived the XPIC method (for extended particle in cell method) that filters null space noise from particle velocities using a projection operator. This paper shows that the XPIC projection operator is equivalent to doing grid calculations using an asymptotic expansion of the full mass matrix inverse . From that insight, we derived FMPM( k k ) for full mass matrix MPM of order k k (where the mass matrix inverse is expanded to k k terms). Compared to prior MPM algorithms, FMPM changes the methods used to update particle velocities , positions, stresses, and strains. Several examples show that FMPM is more stable and accurate, has less dissipation than XPIC, and with high enough k k has less dissipation than FLIP methods. One challenge in MPM is imposing velocity conditions on the grid and those challenges are amplified in FMPM. This paper describes a new moving-wall approach that improves grid boundary conditions and is beneficial to both FMPM and prior MPM. Finally, the use of FMPM for multimaterial mode MPM, with explicit cracks, and with affine extrapolation options is each discussed.},

With a special emphasis on accurate geometries of the 3D crack, we propose in this paper a B-spline ruled surface (BRS), a smooth, explicit, meshfree crack representation algorithm, which offers good geometrical accuracy, good numerical efficiency, and no mesh-resolution dependence. The technique accurately represents the geometry of an evolving 3D crack in a lightweight manner and leads to highly efficient point-surface projections for level set values. The technique is applied to modeling arbitrary 3D crack propagation in context of the Improved XFEM (IXFEM) that has been developed to eliminate the daunting issues of linear dependence and ill-conditioning of the standard XFEM (Tian and Wen (2015); Wen and Tian (2016)). Numerical tests show that IXFEM with the technique of crack description provides accurate solutions for the benchmarks of 3D crack propagation; the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated.},

The geometry is described by discrete particles, where the radius basis kernel function is used to realize a mapping from particle to density field, and finite element analysis is used to compute the deformation under the external stimulus. The optimization problem is formulated in detail, and MMA optimizer is implemented to update the location of discrete particles based on sensitivity information. In this work, self-weight due to gravity imposed on linear elastic structures is considered as the source of deformation. The objective of the problem is then to find the initial shape so that the deformed shape under gravity is close to desired geometry shape. A shape interpolation method based on Artificial Neural Network is proposed to reconstruct the accurate geometric prototype. Several numerical examples are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of proposed method for reverse shape compensation. The computational framework for reverse shape compensation described in this paper has the potential to be extended to consider linear and non-linear deformation induced by other external stimuli.},

At each time step, one only needs to solve several independent elliptic equations with constant coefficients illustrating the high practical efficiency.

Since the fibers are primarily aligned in the flow direction of the extrudate , the printing trajectory influences the material properties of the composite structure. To accommodate this, we define the toolpaths as contours of parameterized level-set functions. This parameterization allows us to optimize the material properties and impose manufacturing constraints such as no-overlap, no-sag, minimum radius of curvature, and continuity of the toolpaths.

  abstract     = {In the framework of cardiac electrophysiology for the human heart, we apply multipatch NURBS-based Isogeometric Analysis for the space discretization of the Monodomain model. Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) is a technique for the solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) that facilitates encapsulating the exact representation of the computational geometry by using basis functions with high-order continuity. IGA features very small numerical dissipation and dispersion when compared to other methods for the solution of PDEs. The use of multiple patches allows to overcome the conventional limitations of single patch IGA, thanks to the gained flexibility in the design of the computational domain, especially when its representation is quite involved as in bioengineering applications. We propose two algorithms for the preprocessing of CAD models of complex surface and volumetric NURBS geometries with cavities, such as atria and ventricles: our purpose is to obtain geometrically and parametrically conforming NURBS multipatch models starting from CAD models. We employ those algorithms for the construction of an IGA realistic representation of a human heart. We apply IGA for the discretization of the Monodomain equation, which describes the evolution of the cardiac action potential in space and time at the tissue level. This PDE is coupled with suitable microscopic models to define the behavior at cellular scale: the Courtemanche–Ramirez–Nattel model for the atrial simulation, and the Luo–Rudy model for the ventricular one. Numerical simulations on realistic human atria and ventricle geometries are carried out, obtaining accurate and smooth excitation fronts by combining IGA with the multipatch approach for the geometrical representation of the computational domains, either surfaces for the atria or solids for the ventricles.},

  abstract     = {Functionally graded materials have widespread applications for the practical engineering and industry of design and development. In the present work, free vibration and transient dynamic behaviors of functionally graded material (FGM) sandwich plates are semi-analytically investigated by the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM). A layerwise approach based on the three-dimensional (3D) theory of elasticity is adopted for the simulation of FGM sandwich plates, and the material properties involving Young’s modulus and mass density are assumed to be continuously graded in the thickness direction according to a power law function while Poisson’s ratio is taken to be constant in each individual layer. In order to obtain the global equilibrium equations for the dynamic problem of FGM sandwich plates, the SBFEM governing equation associated with a single layer is derived based on the principle of virtual work in the first step. Subsequently, they are assembled for the whole FGM sandwich plate by imposing the continuity conditions of the layer interface in the displacement fields. Natural frequencies are determined by eigenvalue analysis , and the transient dynamic equilibrium equation is solved on the basis of the Newmark’s method. One of the advantages of present technique is the capability of reducing the spatial dimension and no discretizations in the thickness direction are needed, which results in a considerable reduction in the computational costs of the project. Furthermore, dynamic responses can be obtained directly from the semi-analytical solutions without shear correction factors or special treatments for the shear-locking effect as some high-order shear deformation plate theories. Excellent adaptability in mesh distortion , thickness ratio and boundary condition of proposed formulations for the dynamic analysis of FGM sandwich plates are confirmed and comprehensive parametric investigations are also carried out. Numerical results show that the dynamic responses obtained by the proposed approach converge rapidly and excellent agreement can be achieved between SBFEM results and the available solutions with a small number of computational costs, which indicates high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed formulations in dynamic analyses of FGM sandwich plates.},

  abstract     = {Auxetic materials have recently emerged as new types of advanced materials with unique material properties that conventional materials do not possess. In this paper, we examine the effect of in-plane negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) on the thermal postbuckling behavior of graphene-reinforced metal matrix composite (GRMMC) laminated cylindrical shells . The shell consists of GRMMC layers arranged in a piece-wise functionally graded (FG) pattern and is subjected to a uniform thermal load surrounded by an elastic medium. Based on the molecular dynamics simulation results, it is noted that the temperature-dependent material properties of GRMMCs can be expressed as a nonlinear function of temperature. The thermal postbuckling problem of shells is modeled under the framework of the Reddy’s third order shear deformation theory and solved by using a singular perturbation technique in conjunction with a two-step perturbation approach . Numerical investigations are carried out for the postbuckling of (10/-10/10/-10/10) S S and (10/-10/10) S S shells with in-plane NPR. It is found that the FG-X pattern can enhance the buckling temperature and the thermal postbuckling strength of the shells. The anomaly is that the thermal buckling load and postbuckling strength of UD (10/-10/10) S S shell are slightly higher than those of UD (10/-10/10/-10/10) S S GRMMC laminated cylindrical shell.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an enhanced Virtual Element Method (VEM) formulation is proposed for plane elasticity . It is based on the improvement of the strain representation within the element, without altering the degree of the displacement interpolating functions on the element boundary. The idea is to fully exploit polygonal elements with a high number of sides, a peculiar VEM feature, characterized by many displacement degrees of freedom on the element boundary, even if a low interpolation order is assumed over each side. The proposed approach is framed within a generalization of the classic VEM formulation, obtained by introducing an energy norm in the projection operator definition. Although such generalization may mainly appear to have a formal value, it allows to effectively point out the mechanical meaning of the quantities involved in the projection operator definition and to drive the selection of the enhanced representations. Various enhancements are proposed and tested through several numerical examples . Numerical results successfully show the capability of the enhanced VEM formulation to (i) considerably increase accuracy (with respect to standard VEM) while keeping the optimal convergence rate, (ii) bypass the need of stabilization terms in many practical cases, (iii) obtain natural serendipity elements in many practical cases, and (vi) effectively treat also nearly incompressible materials .},

With the advent of new computer architectures there has been growing demand for low memory solvers of this type. The addition of time adaptivity improves the accuracy and greatly enhances the efficiency of the algorithm. We prove energy stability of an embedded first–second order IMEX pair. For the first order member of the pair, we prove stability for variable stepsizes, and analyze convergence. We believe this to be the first proof of this type for a variable stepsize IMEX scheme for the incompressible NSE . We then define and test a variable stepsize, variable order IMEX scheme using these methods.

The first-order homogenization technique is employed to perform the multi-scale analysis. The governing equations of two-phase flow of immiscible fluids, including an equilibrium equation and two mass continuity equations, are considered based on the appropriate main variables. According to the well-known Hill–Mandel principle of macro-homogeneity, the proper energy types are defined instead of conventional stress power for linking micro- and macro-scales, which plays a significant role in determination of consistent microscopic fields. The finite element squared strategy is utilized to resolve the two scales simultaneously. The periodic and linear boundary conditions are exploited in the micro-scale analysis, and the macroscopic quantities such as stress tensor, inertial force vector, flux vectors and fluid contents are determined from the boundary information of microscopic domain. Moreover, a general approach is defined depending on the type of boundary condition in which the macroscopic tangent operators can be extracted directly from the converged microscopic Jacobian matrix. Finally, in order to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed computational algorithm, several numerical examples are solved, and the effects of various parameters, such as boundary conditions, RVE types, RVE length scale, and volume fraction of heterogeneities are investigated.},

It relies on one fundamental parameter of lattice size δ x δx in the model. This leads to a revolutionary and precise minimal “Lattice” Boltzmann method, which directly uses physical variables as boundary conditions with less required storage for more accurate and efficient simulations. In this paper, the MacLAB is further developed for solving incompressible axisymmetric flow equations (MacAxLAB). The model is validated through simulations of a 3D unsteady Womersley flow and two 3D steady cylindrical cavity flows . The numerical results have compared with other numerical ones and available analytical solutions; it shows that the MacAxLAB is applicable and accurate for modelling incompressible axisymmetric flow.},

  abstract     = {Cracking of rocks and rock-like materials exhibits a rich variety of patterns where tensile (mode I) and shear (mode II) fractures are often interwoven. These mixed-mode fractures are usually cohesive (quasi-brittle) and frictional. Although phase-field modeling is increasingly used for rock fracture simulation, no phase-field formulation is available for cohesive and frictional mixed-mode fracture. To address this shortfall, here we develop a double-phase-field formulation that employs two different phase fields to describe cohesive tensile fracture and frictional shear fracture individually. The formulation rigorously combines the two phase fields through three approaches: (i) crack-direction-based decomposition of the strain energy into the tensile, shear, and pure compression parts, (ii) contact-dependent calculation of the potential energy, and (iii) energy-based determination of the dominant fracturing mode in each contact condition. We validate the proposed model, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with experimental data on mixed-mode fracture in rocks. The validation results demonstrate that the double-phase-field model – a combination of two quasi-brittle phase-field models – allows one to directly use material strengths measured from experiments, unlike brittle phase-field models for mixed-mode fracture in rocks. Another standout feature of the double-phase-field model is that it can simulate, and naturally distinguish between, tensile and shear fractures without complex algorithms.},

The particle regeneration technique is that the fluid particles replaced by the background particles when the fluid density changes to a specific limitation. The fluid variables of the background particles are approximated by the fluid variables of the initial particles in their support domain. For the multiphase flow , the multiphase interface is calculated by an interface reproducing algorithm, in which, we defined an indicator variable, and set the indicator value discontinuity between different materials. By setting the threshold value, the multiphase interface is reconstructed. Meanwhile, the momentum equation for the Riemann SPH is modified to eliminate the instability in the light phase.

Nonetheless, the majority of existing methodologies still inherit instability issues for arbitrary discontinuity geometries when using an explicit time integration scheme. To address this, the discrete strong discontinuity approach is herein developed for the simulation of dynamic crack propagation . The formulation is fully variationally consistent and a new mapping approach is introduced to embed the rigid body movements associated with discontinuities while keeping the critical time step bounded. Multiple discontinuities within a single element are also considered for the accurate modelling of crack branching. The stability of the new technique is first verified in one- and two-dimensional elements. Next, the accuracy and efficiency are validated with structural examples including tensile and mixed-mode loadings. A concrete L-specimen, where different loading rates produce significant variations in failure patterns and strength, is also considered. Results show the good overall agreement with experimental data and other numerical studies available in the literature. The new formulation, however, is able to capture complex crack propagation phenomena, such as crack branching, without any specific additional criterion (e.g. based on crack tip velocity). The formulation presented in this paper is, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the first PU-based consistent finite element with intrinsically bounded critical time step for explicit time integration.},

  abstract     = {Thermally induced cracking occurs in many engineering problems such as drying shrinkage cracking of concrete, thermal shock induced fracture, micro cracking of two-phase composite materials etc. The computational simulation of such a fracture is complicated, but the use of phase-field models (PFMs) is promising as they can seamlessly model complex crack patterns like branching, merging, and fragmentation by treating the crack discontinuity as thin band of diffuse damage. Despite the success of phase-field models there are two major issues in previous PFMs of thermally induced fracture. Firstly, these models, which are mostly based on a PFM using a simple quadratic degradation function without any user-defined parameters, provide solutions that are sensitive to a length scale. Secondly, they are limited to brittle fracture only. As a solution, we extend the phase-field regularized cohesive zone model ( PF-CZM ) of Wu [JMPS, 103 (2017)], with a rational degradation function dependent on elasticity and fracture related material parameters, to thermoelastic solids. Furthermore, we present a monolithic BFGS algorithm to solve the three-field (displacements, phase-field and temperature) coupling equations altogether. Multiple thermally induced fracture problems, simulated within the framework of the finite element method, are presented with predictions in good agreement with previous findings and experiments. The proposed model is shown to give better performance in capturing the physics of thermally induced fracture: it provides length scale insensitive responses. And the monolithic solver is 4 ∼ 5 4∼5 times faster than the conventional alternating minimization solver.},

  abstract     = {The moving morphable components (MMC)-based topology optimization method makes it possible to directly connect theoretical designs to computer-aided design (CAD) systems. To improve the manufacturability of the optimal result, this paper proposes a projective transformation-based topology optimization using moving morphable components (PMMC), which can reduce the performance loss when the optimized design is ported to practical manufacturing. The basic idea is to treat an arbitrary component as a projection of a component template independent of design variables. A hierarchical feature construction method is used to reconstruct the internal details within an element while reducing the interpolation error , in order to achieve a high-precision feature representation and sensitivity analysis that are not affected by the quality of the background mesh. The proposed method not only ensures the consistency of the geometric model and the analysis model, but also flexibly addresses components that are difficult to describe explicitly. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through a series of numerical examples .},

  abstract     = {We present a topology optimization approach for the design of fluid-to-fluid heat exchangers which rests on an explicit meshed discretization of the phases at stake, at every iteration of the optimization process. The considered physical situations involve a weak coupling between the Navier–Stokes equations for the velocity and the pressure in the fluid, and the convection–diffusion equation for the temperature field. The proposed framework combines several recent techniques from the field of shape and topology optimization, and notably a level-set based mesh evolution algorithm for tracking shapes and their deformations, an efficient optimization algorithm for constrained shape optimization problems, and a numerical method to handle a wide variety of geometric constraints such as thickness constraints and non-penetration constraints. Our strategy is applied to the optimization of various types of heat exchangers. At first, we consider a simplified 2D cross-flow model where the optimized boundary is the section of the hot fluid phase flowing in the transverse direction, which is naturally composed of multiple holes. A minimum thickness constraint is imposed on the cross-section so as to account for manufacturing and maximum pressure drop constraints. In a second part, we optimize the design of 2D and 3D heat exchangers composed of two types of fluid channels (hot and cold), which are separated by a solid body. A non-mixing constraint between the fluid components containing the hot and cold phases is enforced by prescribing a minimum distance between them. Numerical results are presented on a variety of test cases, demonstrating the efficiency of our approach in generating new, realistic, and unconventional heat exchanger designs.},

  abstract     = {Data assimilation in subsurface flow systems is challenging due to the large number of flow simulations often required, and by the need to preserve geological realism in the calibrated (posterior) models. In this work we present a deep-learning-based surrogate model for two-phase flow in 3D subsurface formations. This surrogate model, a 3D recurrent residual U-Net (referred to as recurrent R-U-Net), consists of 3D convolutional and recurrent (convLSTM) neural networks, designed to capture the spatial–temporal information associated with dynamic subsurface flow systems. A CNN-PCA procedure (convolutional neural network post-processing of principal component analysis) for parameterizing complex 3D geomodels is also described. This approach represents a simplified version of a recently developed supervised-learning-based CNN-PCA framework. The recurrent R-U-Net is trained on the simulated dynamic 3D saturation and pressure fields for a set of random ‘channelized’ geomodels (generated using 3D CNN-PCA). Detailed flow predictions demonstrate that the recurrent R-U-Net surrogate model provides accurate results for dynamic states and well responses for new geological realizations, along with accurate flow statistics for an ensemble of new geomodels. The 3D recurrent R-U-Net and CNN-PCA procedures are then used in combination for a challenging data assimilation problem involving a channelized system. Two different algorithms, namely rejection sampling and an ensemble-based method, are successfully applied. The overall methodology described in this paper may enable the assessment and refinement of data assimilation procedures for a range of realistic and challenging subsurface flow problems.},

  abstract     = {Robust optimization strategies typically aim at minimizing some statistics of the uncertain objective function and can be expensive to solve when the statistic is costly to estimate at each design point. Surrogate models of the uncertain objective function can be used to reduce this computational cost. However, such surrogate approaches classically require a low-dimensional parametrization of the uncertainties, limiting their applicability. This work concentrates on the minimization of the quantile and the direct construction of a quantile regression model over the design space, from a limited number of training samples. A Bayesian quantile regression procedure is employed to construct the full posterior distribution of the quantile model. Sampling this distribution, we can assess the estimation error and adjust the complexity of the regression model to the available data. The Bayesian regression is embedded in a Bayesian optimization procedure, which generates sequentially new samples to improve the determination of the minimum of the quantile. Specifically, the sample infill strategy uses optimal points of a sample set of the quantile estimator. The optimization method is tested on simple analytical functions to demonstrate its convergence to the global optimum. The robust design of an airfoil’s shock control bump under high-dimensional geometrical and operational uncertainties serves to demonstrate the capability of the method to handle problems with industrial relevance. Finally, we provide recommendations for future developments and improvements of the method.},

The deviation from a uniform loading traction boundary condition degrades the accuracy in predicting the average stiffness of the material under consideration. In this work, we suggest that the induced traction should be within one standard deviation from the loading traction, and propose an adaptive strategy to update the reference stiffness.

  abstract     = {This work proposes an iterative sparse-regularized regression method to recover governing equations of nonlinear dynamical systems from noisy state measurements. The method is inspired by the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) approach of Brunton et al. (2016), which relies on two main assumptions: the state variables are known a priori and the governing equations lend themselves to sparse, linear expansions in a (nonlinear) basis of the state variables. The aim of this work is to improve the accuracy and robustness of SINDy in the presence of state measurement noise. To this end, a reweighted ℓ 1 ℓ1 -regularized least squares solver is developed, wherein the regularization parameter is selected from the corner point of a Pareto curve. The idea behind using weighted ℓ 1 ℓ1 -norm for regularization – instead of the standard ℓ 1 ℓ1 -norm – is to better promote sparsity in the recovery of the governing equations and, in turn, mitigate the effect of noise in the state variables. We also present a method to recover single physical constraints from state measurements. Through several examples of well-known nonlinear dynamical systems, we demonstrate empirically the accuracy and robustness of the reweighted ℓ 1 ℓ1 -regularized least squares strategy with respect to state measurement noise, thus illustrating its viability for a wide range of potential applications.},

In this paper, we propose a novel decoupling method, which only needs to solve several decoupling linear elliptic equations with constant coefficients at each time step to obtain a numerical solution with second-order time accuracy. The key idea is to introduce two nonlocal auxiliary variables into the system, one of which is used to linearize the nonlinear potential, and the other is used to introduce an ordinary differential equation to deal with the nonlinear coupling terms with “ zero-energy-contribution ” characteristics. We strictly prove the solvability and unconditional energy stability of the scheme, and conduct numerical simulations in 2D and 3D to show the accuracy and stability of the scheme numerically.

We first present an algorithm for computing Bézier extraction operators for univariate spline differential forms that allow local degree elevation. Then, using tensor-products of the univariate splines, a complex of discrete differential forms is built on meshes that contain polar singularities, i.e., edges that are singularly mapped onto points. We prove that the spline complexes share the same cohomological structure as the de Rham complex. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology.

  abstract     = {This work introduces a surrogate modeling strategy, based on diffusion maps manifold learning and artificial neural networks. On this basis, a numerical procedure is developed for cost-efficient predictions of a complex system’s response modeled by parametrized partial differential equations. The idea is to utilize a collection of solution snapshots, obtained by solving the partial differential equation for a small number of parameter values, in order to establish an efficient yet accurate mapping from the problem’s parametric space to its solution space. In common practice, solving the partial differential equations in the framework of the finite element method leads to high-dimensional data sets, which are a major challenge for machine learning algorithms to handle (curse of dimensionality). To overcome this problem, the proposed method exploits the dimensionality reduction properties of the diffusion maps algorithm in order to obtain a meaningful low-dimensional representation of the solution data set. With this approach, a reduced set of ‘hyperparameters’ is obtained, namely, the diffusion map coordinates, that characterize the high-dimensional solution vectors. Using this reduced representation, a feed-forward neural network is efficiently trained that maps the problem’s parameter values to their images in the low-dimensional diffusion maps space. This approach offers two advantages. The obvious one is that it reduces the computational resources and CPU time needed to train the neural network, which can be prohibitive for high dimensional problems. The second advantage is that training the neural network on the diffusion map coordinates, essentially translates to using the diffusion maps distance in the MSE loss function of the network. Compared to the Euclidean distance in the ambient space, the diffusion distance gives a better approximation of the distance between two points on the solution manifold, which leads to a more accurate network. Lastly, a mapping is developed based on the Laplacian pyramids scheme in order to convert points from the diffusion maps space back to the solution space. The composition of the neural network with the Laplacian pyramid scheme, substitutes the process of solving the partial differential equation under consideration, and is capable of providing the additional system solutions at a very low cost and high accuracy.},

Heat conduction and potential flow problems with smooth and non-smooth interfaces are considered. The previously developed Particle Difference Method (PDM) accurately solves this class of interfacial singularity problems, however, it requires additional difference equations on the interfacial points. In contrast, the IIPDM no longer requires the additional interfacial equations since the interface condition is already immersed in the particle derivative approximation through the moving least squares procedure. The method successfully captures both singularities and discontinuities in the derivative field due to the interface geometry regardless of its smoothness. In fact, enforcement of the interface condition is conducted both in an implicit manner and in an explicit manner enriching the polynomial basis as well as the local approximation. Under the constrained derivative approximation, discretization of the elliptic PDE in its strong form leads to a difference scheme or a point collocation scheme involving only the particles. Consequently, the strong formulation can avoid the increase in total system size and improves the computational efficiency. Numerical experiments show that the IIPDM can sharply capture discontinuities and singularities within a solution field. Furthermore, convergence studies of various elliptic interface problems demonstrate efficiencies captured from the IIPDM when comparing convergence rates against the PDM.},

Stability and the inf–sup condition for the discrete solution are proved, and the local existence of a unique solution to the discrete nonlinear system is established based on the assumption of the existence of an isolated solution to the linearized problem and Banach fixed point argument. One principal tool employed is to exploit the enrichment operator from nonconforming space to H 0 2 ( Ω ) H02(Ω) . Thereby, not only smallness assumption on data is avoided, but also optimal error estimates in H 2 H2 - and H 1 H1 -norms are proved under minimal regularity condition on the exact solution. Then, for the nonlinear discrete system, the Newton method is applied, which is shown to preserve local quadratic convergence . Moreover, a posteriori error estimator for an adaptive algorithm is derived. Finally, several numerical experiments with a benchmark problem are considered to confirm our theoretical findings.},

It can search for several dominant failure modes of structural systems without much structural analysis function calls. For the evaluation of the reliability of structural systems, this paper further proposes an extended sequential compound method, which can solve the correlation coefficients between compound events and its internal events.

Besides, a system reliability-based design optimization method is proposed under the framework of the reliability index method with an analytical method for solving the gradient of the system reliability index.

To guarantee convergence, we first introduce a trust-region method that employs generalized trust-region constraints and prove it is globally convergent. We then devise a class of globally convergent ROM-accelerated topology optimization methods informed by two theories: the aforementioned trust-region theory, which identifies the ROM accuracy conditions required to guarantee the method converges to a critical point of the original topology optimization problem ; a posteriori error estimation theory for projection-based ROMs, which informs ROM construction procedure to meet the accuracy conditions. This leads to trust-region methods that construct and update the ROM on-the-fly during optimization; the methods are guaranteed to converge to a critical point of the original, unreduced topology optimization problem, regardless of starting point.

First, a feature boundary correction term is introduced to address the issue of incomplete kernel support at the boundary vicinity. The mesh generation of feature curves, feature surfaces and volumes can be handled concurrently without explicitly following a dimensional sequence. Second, a two-phase model is proposed to characterize the mesh-generation procedure by a feature-size-adaptation phase and a mesh-quality-optimization phase. By proposing a new error measurement criterion and an adaptive control system with two sets of simulation parameters, the objectives of faster feature-size adaptation and local mesh-quality improvement are merged into a consistent framework. The proposed method is validated with a set of 2D and 3D numerical tests with different complexities and scales. The results demonstrate that high-quality meshes are generated with a significant speedup of convergence.},

The method exploits the convolutional structure of the PD diffusion operator to compute it efficiently by using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). A new “embedded constraint” (EC) strategy allows using the Fourier transform on irregular domains and imposing arbitrary nonlocal boundary conditions. The complexity of the new method is O ( N log 2 N ) O(Nlog2N) , compared with O ( N 2 ) O(N2) for the conventional peridynamic meshfree or finite element solvers of the same problem. We find quadratic convergence rates in terms of spatial discretization to the exact nonlocal solutions in 1D and 2D problems. Numerical tests show substantial efficiency gains when using the FCBM-EC method compared to the meshfree discretization method for problems with a larger number of nodes inside the nonlocal region. Further speedup is achieved with Matlab’s intrinsic FFT functions for computations on GPUs or multiple CPUs. An example in 3D with over 1 billion degrees of freedom over tens of thousands of time-steps, is solved by the new method on a single CPU in a matter of days. The same problem would have required over a century to complete with the commonly used meshfree discretization.},

  abstract     = {Presently, it has been widely recognized that numerical integration plays a crucial role on the solution accuracy of Galerkin meshfree methods due to the rational nature of meshfree shape functions and the misalignment of shape function supports with integration cells. Nonetheless, the corresponding underlying cause is still not quite clear. To address this issue, an accuracy analysis of Galerkin meshfree methods is presented in this study with a special focus on the contribution of numerical integration to the error estimates . One important fact is that the integration difficulty of meshfree methods leads to a loss of the Galerkin orthogonality condition which usually serves as a basis to develop error bounds . In order to enable the accuracy analysis, an error measure is proposed to evaluate the loss of Galerkin orthogonality condition , which is actually related to the order of integration consistency for Galerkin meshfree formulation. With the aid of this orthogonality error measure, both H 1 H1 and L 2 L2 error estimates are established for Galerkin meshfree methods. It turns out that these errors essentially consist of two parts, one comes from the standard interpolation error , and the other one attributes to the numerical integration error. In accordance with the proposed error estimates, it is evident that for the conventional Gauss integration schemes violating the integration consistency, the solution errors eventually are controlled by the integration error and optimal convergence cannot be achieved even with high order quadrature rules. On the other hand, for the consistent integration approaches, e.g., the stabilized conforming nodal integration and the more recent reproducing kernel gradient smoothing integration, the integration and interpolation errors have the same accuracy order and thus an optimal convergence of Galerkin meshfree methods is ensured. The proposed theoretical error estimates for Galerkin meshfree methods are well demonstrated by numerical results.},

Since explicit algorithms are considered, separated analyses of the acoustic and elastodynamic subdomains may be easily carried out, with the interaction between the different subdomains of the model being accomplished by interface forces. In this work, these interface forces are computed considering an implicit formulation, allowing the stability limits of the explicit solution to be governed by the decoupled subdomains of the model; thus, enabling greater time-steps to be applied if enhanced time-marching procedures are considered within the solid subdomains (which are usually the most restrictive subdomains of the coupled model). The proposed methodology provides adaptive algorithmic dissipation in the higher modes and it is highly accurate, as well as it is very simple to implement.

We developed a novel HyTopS optimization scheme for microvascular composites which can perform the topological change during the shape optimization process. This task has been done by introducing a new set of design parameters to add/remove microchannels and change the topology of the network. The profound advantage of the HyTopS method in contrast to a solely shape optimization approach is that the design space in HyTopS is not limited to the topology of the initial configuration. We integrate the HyTopS optimization method with the non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) approach to conduct a robust and reliable design. The non-intrusive nature of the proposed method allows for almost any source of uncertainty to be incorporated virtually in the design optimization process. The PCE representations of the response metrics enable the optimizer to efficiently and precisely approximate the statistical moments, failure probabilities, and their sensitivities with respect to the design variables. We solve several numerical examples to demonstrate the advantages of using the suggested optimization scheme over deterministic optimization method for microvascular composites. The results reveal that the optimized designs obtained from performing optimization process under uncertainty outperform the optimized configurations of the deterministic optimization approach in terms of reducing the sensitivity of the design performance to the various random variables.},

The numerical evaluation of the IEOS requires a nonlinear solution of stress, temperature and history variables associated with elastic trial states for stress and temperature. The model is implemented into the ALEGRA shock and multi-physics code and the applications presented include single element deformation paths, the Taylor anvil problem and an energetically driven thermo-mechanical problem.},

  abstract     = {The governing equations of the variational approach to brittle and ductile fracture emerge from the minimization of a non-convex energy functional subject to irreversibility constraints. This results in a multifield problem governed by a mechanical balance equation and evolution equations for the internal variables. While the balance equation is subject to kinematic admissibility of the displacement field, the evolution equations for the internal variables are subject to irreversibility conditions, and take the form of variational inequalities , which are typically solved in a relaxed or penalized way that can lead to deviations of the actual solution. This paper presents an interior-point method that allows to rigorously solve the system of variational inequalities. With this method, a sequence of perturbed constraints is considered, which, in the limit, recovers the original constrained problem. As such, no penalty parameters or modifications of the governing equations are involved. The interior-point method is applied in both a staggered and a monolithic scheme for both brittle and ductile fracture models. In order to stabilize the monolithic scheme, a perturbation is applied to the Hessian matrix of the energy functional. The presented algorithms are applied to three benchmark problems and compared to conventional methods, where irreversibility of the crack phase-field is imposed using a history field or an augmented Lagrangian .},

Different from physical-based modeling, the method developed here is based on a data-driven statistics approach, which solves the problem without needing the information of physical deformation process. The proposed method relies only on the scanned material data from the thermal distorted configuration as well as the shape of the initial design configuration. We coined this artificial intelligence based algorithm as the material deformation finding (MDF) algorithm. In this work, the MDF algorithm was first validated by a 2D synthetic example. We then demonstrated that the proposed MDF method can accurately find the permanent thermal distortion of a complex 3D printed structural component, and hence to identify the thermal compensation design configuration. The results obtained in this work indicate that one can use this data-driven statistics approach to significantly mitigate thermal distortion of 3D printed products in additive manufacturing.},

In particular, we successfully apply PINNs to extract the permeability and viscoelastic modulus from thrombus deformation data, which can be described by the fourth-order Cahn–Hilliard and Navier–Stokes Equations. In PINNs, the partial differential equations are encoded into a loss function, where partial derivatives can be obtained through automatic differentiation (AD). To tackle the challenge of calculating the fourth-order derivative in the Cahn–Hilliard equation with AD, we introduce an auxiliary network along with the main neural network to approximate the second-derivative of the energy potential term. Our model can simultaneously predict unknown material parameters and velocity, pressure, and deformation gradient fields by merely training with partial information among all data, i.e., phase field and pressure measurements, while remaining highly flexible in sampling within the spatio-temporal domain for data acquisition. We validate our model by numerical solutions from the spectral/ hp element method (SEM) and demonstrate its robustness by training it with noisy measurements. Our results show that PINNs can infer the material properties from noisy synthetic data ►and thus they have great potential for inferring these properties from experimental multi-modality and multi-fidelity data.},

Then, for the system coupled with the incompressible flow, we propose a novel numerical method to construct an effective scheme that is fully-decoupled, linear, unconditionally energy stable, and second-order time-accurate . The key idea to achieve the full decoupling nature is to introduce an ordinary differential equation to deal with the nonlinear coupling term that satisfies the so-called “ zero-energy-contribution ” property. Thus, in actual calculations, this scheme only needs to solve several independent linear equations with constant coefficients at each time step. We strictly prove the solvability and unconditional energy stability, and perform numerical simulations in 2D and 3D to verify the accuracy and stability of the scheme numerically.},

  abstract     = {A numerical framework for analyzing steady-state elastic–plastic material deformation at finite strains is developed and demonstrated in the present work. The framework is an extension of the original method by Dean and Hutchinson (1980) develop to analyze steady-state crack propagation, under a small strain assumption, in which the history-dependent material response is captured through streamline integration. Steady-state problems are encountered in numerous engineering processes , and the original studies of crack growth have already been extended to include rolling and drawing, though within a small strain framework. However, the investigation of such manufacturing processes, where strains greater than 10% easily develop, requires a finite strain formulation to provide accurate results. The framework proposed in the present work offers an efficient and accurate method to extract the steady-state solution at finite strains without encountering the numerical issues related to traditional Lagrangian procedures. Furthermore, the framework also accounts for elastic unloading compared to many existing numerical steady-state schemes as they are often restricted to rigid plasticity. The new numerical framework employs a hyperelastic material model, in terms of a Neo-Hookean material, combined with an isotropic viscoplastic material behavior . However, the framework is not limited to any specific hyperelastic material model, nor any specific model for the plastic behavior. The finite strain steady-state framework has been verified through comparison to a traditional Lagrangian analysis conducted in ANSYS. The benchmark case constitutes a plane strain drawing process where the thickness of the specimen is reduced by drawing it between two circular cylindrical tools.},

The Strang operator splitting technique is employed to treat the dispersive terms separately, and it provides the ability to ignore the dispersive terms in specified regions, such as surf zones . Algorithms that can handle wetting–drying and detect wave breaking are presented. The numerical solution algorithms are validated with numerical experiments to demonstrate the ability of the algorithms to accurately resolve hydrodynamics of solitary and regular waves, and morphodynamic changes induced by such waves. The results indicate that the model has the potential to be used in studies of coastal morphodynamics driven by dispersive water waves, given that the hydrodynamic part resolves the water motion and dispersive wave effects with sufficient accuracy up to swash zones, and the morphodynamic model can capture the major features of bed erosion and deposition.},

Specifically, in this approach the microstrain modes used for building the reduced order model (ROM) are obtained through standard proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) techniques applied over snapshots of a representative sampling strain space. Additionally, a reduced number of integration points is obtained by exactly integrating the main free energy modes resulting from the sampling energy snapshots. The outcome consists of a number of dominant strain modes integrated over a remarkably reduced number of integration points which provide the support to evaluate the constitutive behavior of the microstructural phases. It is emphasized that stresses are computed according to the selected constitutive law at the reduced integration points and, therefore, the strategy inherits advantageous properties such as model completeness and customization of material properties. Overall results are discussed in terms of the consistency of the multiscale analysis , customization of the microscopic material parameters and speedup ratios compared to high-fidelity finite element (HF) simulations.},

This task is of interest in medicine since it could enrich the available information used in the diagnosis of certain diseases which is currently based essentially on the measurements coming from ultrasound devices. The fast reconstruction of the full flow can be performed with state estimation methods that have been introduced in recent years and that involve reduced order models . One simple and efficient strategy is the so-called Parametrized Background Data-Weak approach (PBDW, see Maday et al. (2015)). It is a linear mapping that consists in a least squares fit between the measurement data and a linear reduced model to which a certain correction term is added. However, in the original approach, the reduced model is built a priori and independently of the reconstruction task (typically with a proper orthogonal decomposition or a greedy algorithm). In this paper, we investigate the construction of other reduced spaces which are built to be better adapted to the reconstruction task and which result in mappings that are sometimes nonlinear. We compare the performance of the different algorithms on numerical experiments involving synthetic Doppler measurements. The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed alternatives to the classical linear PBDW approach.},

This work employs a phase field framework for frictional contact originated in Fei and Choo (2020), s.t. these strong discontinuities are represented by implicit functions and the frictional responses of the transitional damage zone is approximated by a diffusive constitutive law that captures the coupling between the bulk and interfacial plasticity. To replicate the rate dependence and size effects commonly exhibited in frictional interfaces, we propose a regularized constitutive law for the slip weakening/strengthening at different loading rates and temperature regimes.

  abstract     = {The increased availability of observation data from engineering systems in operation poses the question of how to incorporate this data into finite element models. To this end, we propose a novel statistical construction of the finite element method that provides the means of synthesising measurement data and finite element models. The Bayesian statistical framework is adopted to treat all the uncertainties present in the data, the mathematical model and its finite element discretisation. From the outset, we postulate a statistical generating model which additively decomposes data into a finite element, a model misspecification and a noise component. Each of the components may be uncertain and is considered as a random variable with a respective prior probability density. The prior of the finite element component is given by a conventional stochastic forward problem. The prior probabilities of the model misspecification and measurement noise, without loss of generality, are assumed to have a zero-mean and a known covariance structure. Our proposed statistical model is hierarchical in the sense that each of the three random components may depend on one or more non-observable random hyperparameters with their own corresponding probability densities. We use Bayes rule to infer the posterior densities of the three random components and the hyperparameters from their known prior densities and a data dependent likelihood function. Because of the hierarchical structure of our statistical model, Bayes rule is applied on three different levels in turn. On level one, we determine the posterior densities of the finite element component and the true system response using the prior finite element density given by the forward problem and the data likelihood. In this step, approximating the prior finite element density with a multivariate Gaussian distribution allows us to obtain a closed-form expression for the posterior. On the next level, we infer the hyperparameter posterior densities from their respective priors and the marginal likelihood of the first inference problem. These posteriors are sampled numerically using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Finally, on level three we use Bayes rule to choose the most suitable finite element model in light of the observed data by computing the respective model posteriors. We demonstrate the application and versatility of statFEM with one and two-dimensional examples.},

  abstract     = {We put forward a general machine learning-based topology optimization framework, which greatly accelerates the design process of large-scale problems, without sacrifice in accuracy. The proposed framework has three distinguishing features. First, a novel online training concept is established using data from earlier iterations of the topology optimization process. Thus, the training is done during, rather than before, the topology optimization. Second, a tailored two-scale topology optimization formulation is adopted, which introduces a localized online training strategy. This training strategy can improve both the scalability and accuracy of the proposed framework. Third, an online updating scheme is synergistically incorporated, which continuously improves the prediction accuracy of the machine learning models by providing new data generated from actual physical simulations. Through numerical investigations and design examples, we demonstrate that the aforementioned framework is highly scalable and can efficiently handle design problems with a wide range of discretization levels, different load and boundary conditions, and various design considerations (e.g., the presence of non-designable regions).},

It converts the double-loop probabilistic optimization into a serial of cycles of reliability assessment and deterministic optimization through a performance shift strategy. The approach further proceeds by calculating the performance shift scalar and then solving a deterministic design optimization at each cycle, and eventually converges to the optimum design solution. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in two main aspects. First, the shift scalar is deducted for each probabilistic constraint in the response space, rather than in the design variable space, through which the violated constraints are moved towards the reliable region and the design solutions are improved progressively. Second, reliability analysis methods that calculate the moments or probability density functions, rather than most probable points or reliability indexes, are able to be integrated in the sequential RBDO framework, through which we could enhance the performance of existing sequential RBDO methods, especially the computational efficiency. Three numerical examples are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the proposed approach is further utilized to perform crashworthiness design of a vehicle side impact problem.},

For problems involving large material deformations, the computation domain often needs to be reinitialized because of the distortion, causing the loss of the history information of the system. This work introduces an algorithm to accommodate a large deformation of the material while maintaining the computational domain cuboid to avoid the domain reinitialization during the computation. The algorithm uses a rotating frame of reference, in which the velocity gradient can be represented by an upper triangular matrix . The deformation caused by the upper triangular matrix is treated by the image system implied in the periodicity to maintain the computational domain cuboid. The effect from the rotation of the reference frame is considered using the inertial forces . Simulations of simple and pure shear motions are carried out to illustrate the algorithm.},

The resulting variationally consistent PPG method is able to pass the patch test and to restore the optimal convergence rates. A correction of the test functions that preserves the linear trial function consistency allows the use of displacement–pressure–dilation formulations and exhibits stability and robustness for 3-D in the regime of non-linear elasticity.

  abstract     = {The “Generalized Single Step Single Solve” framework for first-order transient systems (GS4-1) is considered to develop adaptive time stepping via a newly proposed a posteriori error estimator in this paper. Traditional approaches design and employ particular error estimators for particular algorithms on algorithm by algorithm selection basis. In sharp contrast, in this paper, an accurate and simple universal a posteriori error estimator that is agnostic is newly designed to foster features that enable the adaptive time stepping for the entire subset of second order time accurate linear multi-step (LMS) algorithms in the GS4-1 family. The core contributions are: (a) The estimated local error has the same order of convergence and error constant as that of the exact local error; thereby the underlying issues that under-/over-estimate the error for optimizing the time step are addressed with rigour. The validation tests for linear/nonlinear problems show the third-order convergence rate in time for the local error, and the overlapped profiles of estimated local error and exact local error demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed error estimator. (b) Unlike several previously reported error estimators designed for some specific existing time integration algorithms in the literature, the proposed error estimator is universal, and is independent of the algorithmic parameters; thereby it can be applied to all the numerically dissipative/non-dissipative schemes without any limitations in the GS4-1 family. (c) The adaptive time stepping computational strategy emanating from the proposed error estimator achieves an excellent balance between the solution accuracy and CPU cost. In addition, several linear/nonlinear heat transfer problems with multi-degree of freedom are solved via the proposed method to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the numerical implementation.},

  abstract     = {In the numerical simulation of fluid dynamic problems there are situations in which acoustic waves are very fast compared to the average velocity of the fluid and conversely situations in which the fluid moves at high speed and shock waves may be present. Ideally, a numerical method should be able to treat these different regimes without strong limitations in terms of time step and without excessive related computational cost. Unfortunately, standard explicit in time schemes often adopted for hyperbolic problems are not suitable for these problems, hence remedies have to be studied. To this aim, the results presented in this article concern the development of a second order in time and space numerical method for the compressible Navier–Stokes equation which works for both high and low Mach numbers . In particular, when the Mach number goes to zero, one recovers a numerical method for the limit Navier–Stokes system which under some additional hypothesis degenerates to the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, while in the case of high Mach numbers the method exhibits a shock capturing structure. The idea is based on partitioning the equations into a fast and a slow scale and by taking implicit the fast scale dynamic together with the viscous terms. The resulting numerical scheme is stable for time steps which are independent both from the speed of the pressure waves and from the diffusive terms characterizing the viscous forces and the heat flux. The only time step limitation is induced by the average speed of the flow. The work here presented extends the seminal ideas developed in Dimarco et al. (2017, 2018) for isentropic Euler equations and in Boscheri et al. (2020) for the full set of compressible Euler equations to the multidimensional Navier–Stokes system and permits efficient three dimensional simulations of all Mach problems. The discretization is constructed on Cartesian meshes and the method is second order accurate in space and time. Numerical results show the accuracy, the robustness and the effectiveness of the new proposed approach.},

In order to preserve the advantage of IGABEM, i.e. only boundary is discretized, the radial integration method (RIM) is applied to transform the domain integral into an equivalent boundary integral. In addition, using a simple transformation method, the uniform potential method is successfully applied to solve the strongly singular integrals , and the Telles scheme and the element sub-division method are used to solve the weakly singular integrals in RI-IGABEM respectively. Furthermore, in order to improve the stability of numerical results, the PIM is adopted to solve the time domain problem. In order to validate the accuracy and convergence of the RI-IGABEM 2D and 3D numerical examples are used to discuss the influence of some factors, such as the number and the position of applied points, the order of basis functions, the number of model refinements and the length of time step.},

The density gradient is obtained by directly computing the derivatives of the B-spline density field. The other concerns the constraint to avoid undesired V-shaped areas and is formulated by limiting the density values at detection points uniformly distributed in the design domain.

  abstract     = {Multiscale modeling for estimating the effective thermal conductivities of particulate composites with complex microstructures remains a challenging problem. This is mainly due to the non-linear physics, the high-dimensional property, and the fact that many repeated evaluations of the multiscale model are often required. In this study, we develop an innovative wavelet-based learning approach assisted multiscale analysis to predict the effective thermal conductivities of particulate composites with heterogeneous conductivity. This novel method combines respective advantages of multiscale modeling, wavelet transform and artificial neural network (ANN) together. By virtue of asymptotic homogenization method (AHM), a multiscale model is proposed for establishment of the material database with high-dimensional and highly-complex mappings. The multiscale material database and the wavelet-based learning strategy ease the training of neural networks, and enable us to efficiently build more simple networks that have an essentially increasing capacity and resisting noise for approximating mappings of very high complexity. Moreover, it should be noted that the wavelet-based learning strategy can not only extract important data features from material database, but also achieve a great reduction in input data of neural networks for resolving the great difficulty due to taking a large data set from the entire material database and ensuring the successful training the neural networks. The numerical experiments performed using periodic and random particulate composite models in 2D and 3D cases illustrate the outstanding performance of the integrated method. The obtained results indicate that the wavelet-based learning approach is a robust method for estimating the effective thermal conductivities with different heterogeneity patterns. The proposed method can significantly reduce the computational time, and can be further extended to predict effective mechanical properties of particulate composites.},

Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is the most common type, affecting children between ages 8 to 18 when bone growth is at its maximum rate. We propose a mechanistic machine learning algorithm in order to study patient-specific AIS curve progression, which is associated with the bone growth and other genetic and environmental factors. Two different frameworks are used to analyse and predict curve progression, one with implementing clinical data extracted from 2D X-ray images and the other one with incorporating both clinical data and physical equations governing the non-uniform bone growth. The physical equations governing bone growth are affiliated with calculating all stress components at each region. The stress values are evaluated through a surrogate finite element simulation and a bone growth model on a detailed patient-specific geometry of the human spine. We also propose a patient-specific framework to generate the volumetric model of human spine which is partitioned into different tissues for both vertebra and intervertebral disc. It is shown that implementing physical equations governing bone growth into the prediction framework will notably improve the prediction results as compared to only using clinical data for prediction. In addition, we can predict curve progression at ages outside the range of training samples .},

  abstract     = {The modeling of crack initiation and propagation is of vital importance in the design and safety evaluation of structural components and engineering structures. Great advances have been achieved in the crack simulation during the past decades . Although the phase-field theory and the newly proposed nonlocal macro-meso-scale consistent damage (NMMD) model can predict the crack initiation, propagation and load-deformation curves for quasi-brittle materials correctly, the energetic degradation function, which bridges the energy-based damage and the topologic damage and plays an important role in these models, is still more or less empirically determined. In the present paper, a physical interpretation and quantitative modeling of the energetic degradation function via the embedded meso-scale mechanism of damage in the NMMD model is proposed. For this purpose, the NMMD model is firstly outlined. In this model, the meso-scale damage is firstly defined based on the degradation of bonds of material point pairs according to the irreversible elongation. The macro-scale topologic damage is then evaluated by averaging the meso-scale damage in the influence domain. It is then inserted into the thermodynamically consistent framework of continuum damage mechanics via the energetic degradation function bridging the topologic damage and the energy-based damage. To physically determine the energetic degradation function, the Helmholtz free energy of the damaged and undamaged materials is evaluated from the meso-scale mechanism of damage. In addition, it is theoretically proved that such determined energetic degradation function is invariant against the meso-scale parameters, including the radius of influence domain and the critical elongation quantity, and is weakly related to the strain state. Four numerical examples involving mode-I and mix-mode failures of isotropic quasi-brittle materials under static loading are studied to verify the NMMD model with the physically determined energetic degradation function. It is demonstrated that by the proposed approach there is no need to prescribe the initial crack and potential propagation path , the crack propagation can be captured automatically and the mesh size sensitivity is circumvented. Problems to be further studied are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {This study concerns damage initiation and its progression in bonded-lap joints with adhesives under quasi-static loading conditions. The weak form of peridynamic (PD) equilibrium equation is derived based on the nonlinear response of elastic adherends and viscoelastic adhesives. The peridynamic deformation gradient tensor is evaluated in the bond-associated domain of interaction using the PD differential operator . The fidelity of this approach is established in the absence of failure by comparison with benchmark solutions for relaxation and creep response under simple loading conditions. Subsequently, the PD predictions in a domain of two dissimilar elastic and viscoelastic materials are verified against the finite element predictions . Finally, a double-lap and a single-lap joint are considered for failure initiation and growth. The PD predictions successfully capture the deformation response and damage initiation sites and propagation paths .},

  abstract     = {For structural reliability assessment, some performance functions are fairly complicated, which leads to disjoint failure domains, discontinuous structural responses and multiple design points. Thus, such a problem is difficult to be solved by some existing methods, i.e., the design point-based methods and surrogate model-based methods, etc. Although the stochastic sampling-based methods can tackle this issue, much computational effort is needed. In this paper, a novel approach, direct probability integral method (DPIM), is proposed to address static and dynamic reliability assessment for structures with complicated performance functions. The DPIM is established based on the decoupled computation of probability density integral equation and structural physical equation. Firstly, by introducing the point selection technique based on generalized F discrepancy and the smoothing of Dirac delta function , the probability density integral equation is solved directly to calculate the probability density functions (PDFs) of static and dynamic responses of structures with complicated performance functions. Then, the failure probability for static system is acquired by integrating the PDF curve of structural response over failure domain. For stochastic dynamic system, the dynamic reliability assessment is fulfilled efficiently by DPIM combining with extreme value distribution . Finally, six representative examples indicate that DPIM is much more efficient than Monte Carlo simulation to attack the reliability estimation issue of structures containing complicated performance functions.},

Various extensions of surface elasticity theory have been proposed. The main objective of this contribution is to formulate a finite deformation theory for boundary viscoelasticity in principal stretches by accounting for strain-dependent boundary stresses. We present a model that utilizes a nonlinear evolution law and thus is not restricted to the states that are close to the thermodynamic equilibrium . Boundary contributions include both surface and curve effects wherein boundary elasticity as well as boundary tension are accounted for. The boundary constitutive models are formulated such that fluid-like and solid-like viscoelastic behavior of boundaries are considered. A geometrically exact computational framework using isogeometric analysis inherently suited to account for boundaries is developed. Equipped with the theoretical and computational framework, the influence of boundary viscoelasticity on the material response is illustrated. Non-equilibrium counterpart of surface tension is introduced and its effects are elucidated via examples. Through numerical examples , various applications of the bulk–boundary coupled formulation which require further investigation are highlighted.},

In recent years much work has been directed towards developing methods of combining models of different accuracies in order to propagate uncertainty, but the problem of improving uncertainty propagations by considering evidence from both computational models and experiments has received less attention. The framework described here uses the Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) to find an updated, least biased estimate of a probability distribution by maximising the entropy between the original and updated estimates. A constrained optimisation is performed to find the coefficients of a Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) that minimise the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between estimates, while ensuring that the new estimate conforms to constraints imposed by the available experimental measurements of the QoI. In this work a novel constraint is used, based upon the Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz inequality and the Massart bound (DKWM), as opposed to the more commonly used moment-based constraints. Such a constraint allows scarce experimental data to be used in informing the updated estimate of the probability distribution.},

  abstract     = {Strong-form direct collocation method based on the reproducing kernel (RK) approximation has been criticized frequently by the complexity and time-consuming computation of the derivatives, and it is rather hard to use the low-order basis functions to improve the efficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient meshfree gradient smoothing collocation method (GSCM) based on the RK approximation which adopts the gradient smoothing technique for the calculation of the RK derivatives. Low-order basis functions such as constant functions can be utilized for the approximation in the numerical solutions of the elasticity problems which can greatly improve the efficiency. Conforming and nonconforming meshes can be constructed for the numerical integration of the gradient smoothing. Constraints of the numerical integration are established where the proper positions of the integration points and the corresponding weighs for the integration are derived to keep the consistency of the RK shape function and its smoothed gradients. These guarantee the accuracy and convergence of the proposed method. Numerical results demonstrate that the presented method can outmatch the conventional direct collocation method (DCM) in accuracy, stability and computational efficiency, and generally the GSCM-II using a double gradient smoothing performs better than the GSCM-I and the super-convergent gradient smoothing meshfree collocation method (SGSMC) using a single gradient smoothing.},

  abstract     = {Modeling a material’s microstructure using continuum theories allows for inspection of the relationship between coarse scale and fine scale behaviors. Computational limits generally require selection of a sub-volume from a bulk sample in order to directly model the microstructure. Boundary conditions are applied to the sub-volume to mimic the excluded bulk material. Appropriate selection of boundary conditions helps effectively determine the appropriate spatial scale required of the sub-volume. Applicable boundary conditions include direct displacement, periodic, and uniform traction. While direct displacement and periodic boundary conditions are commonly used, uniform traction boundary conditions have seen limited use due to rigid body stability issues in simulations of compression or shear deformation . A new application of uniform traction boundary conditions was developed through linear constraint equations, similar to approaches employed by direct displacement and periodic boundary conditions, to quench rigid body motions with minimal interference of the relative deformation of the model. These boundary conditions were tested by compressing several synthetically generated periodic microstructures using the finite element method . Evaluating the effective stiffness along the compression axis , the direct displacement boundary condition produced the stiffest response, whereas the uniform traction boundary condition produced the most compliant. Periodic boundary conditions produced the same response for all volumes analyzed and both the direct displacement and uniform traction boundary conditions trended toward the periodic response as the domain volume increased. Computational performance was also evaluated for each boundary condition using implicit and explicit solvers. Direct displacement boundary conditions presented the lowest computational cost of all of the boundary conditions followed by periodic then uniform traction. The computational expense of periodic and uniform traction boundary conditions limited the viable spatial scale and mesh resolutions able to be simulated. Selection of appropriate boundary conditions for specific uses need to be a balance between allowable computational expense and accuracy of the method. Techniques for evaluating which boundary conditions to use are discussed.},

Our framework exploits localized structure in the spatio-parameter space to enable rapid, reliable uncertainty quantification for output quantities of interest. Our formulation comprises the following technical components: (i) a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method, which provides stability for convection-dominated problems; (ii) element-wise polynomial chaos expansions, which capture the parametric dependence of the solution in a way amenable to adaptation; (iii) the dual-weighted residual method, which provides global and element-wise error estimates for quantities of interest; and (iv) a projection-based anisotropic error indicator along with the associated adaptation mechanics that can detect and refine strongly directional features in the physical and/or parameter spaces simultaneously in an efficient manner. Both the spatial and stochastic discretization errors are controlled through the adaptive refinement of the spatial mesh or polynomial chaos expansion degree based on these anisotropic error indicators. We analyze stability, approximation properties, and a priori error bounds of the spatio-stochastic adaptive method.

The work applies the principles of rank-n homogenisation in the context of extremely deformable dielectric elastomers actuated beyond the onset of geometrical instabilities. Following previous work by the authors (Gil and Ortigosa, 2016; Ortigosa and Gil, 2016; Ortigosa and Gil, 2016) Convex Multi-Variable (CMV) energy density functionals are used to describe the physics of the individual microscopic constituents , which is shown to guarantee ab initio the existence of solutions for the microstructure problem, described in terms of the so-called deformation gradient and electric displacement amplitude vectors. The high nonlinearity of the quasi-static electro-mechanical problem is resolved via a monolithic multi-scale Newton–Raphson scheme, which is enhanced with a tailor-made arc length technique, used to circumvent the onset of geometrical instabilities. A tensor cross product operation between vectors and tensors and an additive decomposition of the micro-scale deformation gradient (in terms of macro-scale and fluctuation components) are used to considerably reduce the complexity of the algebra. The possible loss of ellipticity of the homogenised constitutive model is strictly monitored through the minors of the homogenised acoustic tensor . A series of numerical examples is presented in order to demonstrate the effect that the volume fraction , the contrast and the material properties, as well as the level of deformation and electric field , have upon the response of the composites when subjected to large three dimensional stretching, bending and torsion, including the possible development of wrinkling.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this work is the development of an efficient two-scale numerical scheme for the prediction of the local and overall mechanical behavior of polycrystalline materials with elasto-viscoplastic constitutive behavior at finite strains. Assuming scale separation, the microstructural deformations are prescribed by the kinematics of the macroscopic continuum body. The macroscopic constitutive behavior is in turn determined by the mean response of the point-wise linked microstructure which is represented by a periodic unit cell. The algorithmic formulation and numerical solution of the two locally coupled boundary value problems is based on the FE-FFT method. In particular, the presented work is concerned with the development of a CPU- and memory-efficient solution strategy for two-scale finite strain crystal plasticity simulations of polycrystalline aggregates which is based on a microstructural convergence analysis . This efficient solution strategy allows a two-scale simulation of complex macroscopic boundary value problems in a reasonable time period. In order to demonstrate the versatile use of the proposed method, three polycrystalline materials namely copper, aluminum and iron are studied with different textures for three distinct macroscopic loading conditions. On this basis, the micromechanical fields and the overall material response of an iron-based polycrystal are predicted for a deep rolling process, which serves as a testing example for a representative and application oriented simulation.},

  abstract     = {A rate-independent model for isotropic elastic–orthotropic plastic material behaviour including the plastic spin is presented in this paper. The plastic spin, as introduced by Dafalias, is the spin of the continuum relative to the material substructure. The model is based on a specific multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor, which introduces a uniquely defined intermediate configuration as motivated by Casey. We focus our attention on metal sheets in forming processes, in which pre-existing preferred orientations govern the orthotropic plastic behaviour. As a result, we advocate a Hill-type yield criterion enriched by the notion of plastic spin to describe this material behaviour. Our formulation yields three key findings: firstly, the uniquely defined intermediate configuration, namely a plastically stretched intermediate configuration, allows for a neat implementation of the plastic spin; secondly, the algorithmic formulation is straightforward and shows no additional difficulties in the implementation; and thirdly, a good agreement of our numerical model with experimental and numerical results from in-plane sheet forming processes reported in the literature is achieved.},

The topology is defined following level set methods where a B-spline surface is used to parameterize the level set function . In each optimization cycle, the level set based topology is mapped into a spline-based representation that is constructed on an unstructured mesh . The mapping procedure is performed following untrimming techniques which lead to geometrical models whose boundaries are explicitly defined as cubic B-spline curves. The geometrical model is replicated precisely by mesh refinement to obtain a suitable model for subsequent Iso Geometric Analysis (IGA). It is shown that accurate stress evaluations are obtained on the untrimmed boundaries. Consistent sensitivity analysis is formulated to account for all mappings and refinements from the underlying level set function to the IGA-based solution of the mechanical response. Implementation of the proposed approach is demonstrated on compliance and maximum stress minimization problems . Several design aspects are examined, namely integrating a topological derivative technique for hole insertion; a control points mapping procedure; and imposing predefined fixed void regions. The results expose the capability of the proposed approach to generate optimized layouts while accurately modeling the boundaries throughout the optimization process. Furthermore, the outcomes are spline-based optimized topologies that are directly compatible with CAD environments.},

We adapt the three-field formulation for nearly incompressible hyperelasticity introduced in Chavan et al. (2007) to the fully incompressible case. The mixed formulation is of Hu–Washizu type and it differs from other approaches in that we use the Kirchhoff stress, displacement, and pressure as principal unknowns. We also discuss the solvability of the linearised problem restricted to neo-Hookean materials, illustrating the interplay between the coupling blocks. We construct a family of mixed finite element schemes (with different polynomial degrees) for simplicial meshes and verify its error decay through computational tests. We also propose a new augmented Lagrangian preconditioner that improves convergence properties of iterative solvers. The numerical performance of the family of mixed methods is assessed with benchmark solutions, and the applicability of the formulation is further tested in a model of cardiac biomechanics using orthotropic strain energy densities . The proposed methods are advantageous in terms of physical fidelity (as the Kirchhoff stress can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy and no locking is observed) and convergence (the discretisation and the preconditioners are robust and computationally efficient, and they compare favourably at least with respect to classical displacement–pressure schemes).},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a physics-informed machine learning (ML) framework to construct reduced-order models (ROMs) for reactive-transport quantities of interest (QoIs) based on high-fidelity numerical simulations. QoIs include species decay, product yield, and degree of mixing. The ROMs for QoIs are applied to quantify and understand how the chemical species evolve over time. First, high-resolution datasets for constructing ROMs are generated by solving anisotropic reaction–diffusion equations using a non-negative finite element formulation for different input parameters. The reactive-mixing model input parameters are: time-scale associated with flipping of velocity, spatial-scale controlling small/large vortex structures of velocity, perturbation parameter of the vortex-based velocity, anisotropic dispersion contrast, and molecular diffusion. Second, random forests, F-test, and mutual information criterion are used to evaluate the importance of model inputs/features with respect to QoIs. We observed that anisotropic dispersion contrast is the most important feature and time-scale associated with flipping of velocity is the least important feature. Third, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are used to construct ROMs based on the model inputs. The constructed SVR-ROMs are then used to predict scaling of QoIs. We also present estimates and inequalities on the QoIs, which inform that the species decay, mix, and produce in an exponential fashion. These inequalities also inform that a radial basis function is the most suitable kernel for the SVM/SVR models for QoIs. It is observed that R 2 R2 -score for SVR-ROMs on unseen data is greater than 0.9, implying that the SVR-ROMs are able to predict the reaction–diffusion system state reasonably well. Finally, in terms of the computational cost, the proposed SVM-ROMs are O ( 1 0 7 ) O(107) times faster than running a high-fidelity finite element simulation for evaluating QoIs. This makes the proposed ML-based ROMs attractive for reactive-transport sensing and real-time monitoring applications as they are significantly faster yet reasonably accurate.},

In this work we extract nonlocal models from data, circumventing these challenges and providing data-driven justification for the resulting model form. Extracting data-driven surrogates is a major challenge for machine learning (ML) approaches, due to nonlinearities and lack of convexity — it is particularly challenging to extract surrogates which are provably well-posed and numerically stable. Our scheme not only yields a convex optimization problem, but also allows extraction of nonlocal models whose kernels may be partially negative while maintaining well-posedness even in small-data regimes. To achieve this, based on established nonlocal theory, we embed in our algorithm sufficient conditions on the non-positive part of the kernel that guarantee well-posedness of the learnt operator. These conditions are imposed as inequality constraints to meet the requisite conditions of the nonlocal theory. We demonstrate this workflow for a range of applications, including reproduction of manufactured nonlocal kernels; numerical homogenization of Darcy flow associated with a heterogeneous periodic microstructure; nonlocal approximation to high-order local transport phenomena; and approximation of globally supported fractional diffusion operators by truncated kernels.},

  abstract     = {Stable and accurate modeling of thin shells requires proper enforcement of all types of boundary conditions. Unfortunately, for Kirchhoff–Love shells, strong enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions is difficult because both displacement and normal rotation boundary conditions must be applied. A popular alternative is to employ Nitsche’s method to weakly enforce all boundary conditions. However, while many Nitsche-based formulations have been proposed in the literature, they lack comprehensive error analyses and verification. In fact, existing formulations are variationally inconsistent and yield sub-optimal convergence rates when used with common boundary condition specifications. In this paper, we present a novel Nitsche-based formulation for the linear Kirchhoff–Love shell that is provably stable and optimally convergent for general sets of admissible boundary conditions. To arrive at our formulation, we first present a framework for constructing Nitsche’s method for any abstract variationally constrained minimization problem. We then apply this framework to the linear Kirchhoff–Love shell and, for the particular case of NURBS-based isogeometric analysis, we prove that the resulting formulation yields optimal convergence rates in both the shell energy norm and the standard L 2 -norm. To arrive at this formulation, we derive the Euler–Lagrange equations for general sets of admissible boundary conditions and show that the Euler–Lagrange boundary conditions typically presented in the literature are incorrect. We verify our formulation by manufacturing solutions for a new shell obstacle course that encompasses flat, parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic geometric configurations with a variety of common boundary condition specifications. These manufactured solutions allow us to robustly measure the error across the entire shell in contrast with current best practices where displacement and stress errors are only measured at specific locations. We use NURBS discretizations to represent the shell geometry and show optimal convergence rates in both the shell energy norm and the standard L 2 -norm with varying polynomial degrees for all of the problems in the obstacle course.},

  abstract     = {Material Point Method (MPM) has arisen in the recent years as an alternative to Finite Element Method (FEM) under large deformations . However, the simulation of shock waves propagation in the large deformation regime is still challenging under this approach due to the incapability of the standard MPM time integration scheme to filter spurious noises. To overcome it, we propose in this paper an explicit Predictor–Corrector time integration scheme. Its powerful performance mitigates the presence of spurious oscillations with minimal dissipation in high frequency problems. Other source of numerical noise in MPM occurs when the material points cross computational grid boundaries, being caused by the lack of smoothness of the interpolation functions . This noise results in spurious local variations at the material points, where strain–stress fields are computed. This could lead to inaccurate solutions as well as aborted simulations in the worst cases. To surmount it, we propose in this work the Local Maximum-Entropy (LME) approximation schemes as a robust substitute of the traditional shape function in MPM. The performance of both improvements is validated by the high quality results of the numerical examples .},

Therefore, the design optimization has large freedom to improve the performance of a structure. A fundamental issue in the design optimization is how to describe the spatially varying fiber angles. In the present study, the fiber angle arrangement is described by using a parametric divergence-free vector field (pDVF) that is constructed through an expansion by using a set of basis vector fields. A basis vector field is obtained by multiplying the gradient vectors of a compact supported radial basis function with an anti-symmetric matrix. Then the expansion coefficients are regarded as design variables in the optimization.

  abstract     = {In this work, we discuss and develop multidimensional limiting techniques for discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of scalar hyperbolic problems. To ensure that each cell average satisfies a local discrete maximum principle (DMP), we impose inequality constraints on the local Lax–Friedrichs fluxes of a piecewise-linear ( P 1 P1 ) approximation. Since the piecewise-constant ( P 0 P0 ) version corresponds to a property-preserving low-order finite volume method, the validity of DMP conditions can always be enforced using slope and/or flux limiters. We show that the (currently rather uncommon) use of direct flux limiting makes it possible to construct more accurate DMP-satisfying approximations in which a weak form of slope limiting is used to prevent unbounded growth of solution gradients. After presenting two flux limiters that ensure the validity of local DMPs for cell averages, we discuss the design of slope limiters based on different kinds of inequality constraints. In particular, we derive new limiting procedures based on flux constraints and constraints for directional derivatives. The latter approach makes it possible to preserve directional monotonicity in applications to problems that require different treatment of different space directions. At the flux limiting stage, the anisotropy of the problem at hand can be taken into account by using a customized definition of local bounds for the DMP constraints. At the slope limiting stage, we adjust the magnitude of individual directional derivatives using low-order reconstructions from cell averages to define the bounds. In this way, we avoid unnecessary limiting of well-resolved derivatives at smooth peaks and in internal/boundary layers. The properties of selected algorithms are explored in numerical studies for DG- P 1 P1 discretizations of two-dimensional test problems. In the context of h p hp -adaptive DG methods, the new limiting procedures can be used in P 1 P1 subcells of macroelements marked as ‘troubled’ by a smoothness indicator.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) isogeometric finite element (FE) and boundary element (BE) coupling approach based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) is developed to simulate the deformed body. Based on the geometric exactness and higher smoothness of isogeometric analysis (IGA), NURBS discretization is applied to the approximation of geometric representation , displacement field and traction field simultaneously. An improved power series expansion method (M-PSEM) is used to evaluate the singular integral and is suitable for high order ( ≥ ≥ 3) NURBS basis functions , which is the limitation of the traditional method. Adaptive integration scheme based on quadtree subdivision technique is adopted to enable the non-singular integration computation more flexible and efficient at optimal computational cost. The relationship between the tractions and nodal external forces on the interface is established by using the virtual work principle. On the other hand, displacement coupling constraints among the non-conforming (or incomplete coincident) surface meshes are constructed by a virtual knot insertion technique. The main advantages of this method are simplicity and robustness, as it is problem-independent and only depends on the NURBS meshes on both sides of the interface. Introducing an enhanced symmetric matrix related to the BE subdomain , the symmetric iterative coupling method (SICM) is extended to solve the final system coupling equation. The final coupling matrix obtained by this iterative method is symmetric, and its dimension is the same as that of the stiffness matrix of IGA finite element method (IGAFEM). Numerical examples are investigated to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the presented method.},

Analysis-suitable T-splines are used for the representation of all boundary surfaces and the unknown perturbation potential is approximated by the same T-spline basis used for the geometry. A novel numerical application of the so-called Kutta condition is introduced that utilises the advantages of isogeometric analysis with regard to the smoothness of the trailing edge curve basis functions. The method shows good agreement with existing experimental results and superior behaviour when compared to a low order panel method.

  abstract     = {The simulation of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) requires finding the solution to a highly coupled nonlinear set of partial differential equations. Verification of EGS modelling has been difficult due to a lack of analytical or semi-analytical solutions and is typically limited to a subset of processes. A comparison of alternative solution schemes is one method to numerically verify the coupling between all processes simultaneously and provide confidence in the solutions produced by the different solution schemes. This article presents the first such comparison of monolithic and sequential solution schemes for the modelling of EGS wells. A custom thermo-hydro-mechanical finite element model for an EGS well connected by planar fractures is developed along with two monolithic schemes; one using the Newton–Raphson iterative method and another using the Newton–Raphson iterative method modified by Aitken’s Δ 2 Δ2 relaxation method. The two monolithic schemes are compared against two sequential schemes and one loosely-coupled scheme in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The monolithic schemes are shown to have an optimal rate of convergence with respect to mesh and timestep refinement. The monolithic Newton–Raphson scheme is shown to require small timesteps that violate the minimum timestep size of the β β -method of time integration, introducing spurious oscillations into the solution. Aitken’s Δ 2 Δ2 relaxation method is shown to improve the ability of the Newton–Raphson scheme to find a converged solution at larger timesteps, avoiding spurious oscillations and reducing overall computation time. The sequential solution schemes are shown to provide optimal rates of convergence with respect to mesh and timestep refinement and converge to the same solution as the monolithic solution schemes, verifying the results of both methodologies and previous modelling efforts. It is demonstrated that the sequential solution schemes are computationally more expensive than the monolithic schemes when seeking well-converged solutions. The loosely-coupled scheme demonstrates an optimal rate of convergence with mesh and timestep refinement, but is also shown to be much less accurate than the other schemes. The recommended solution scheme for the efficient simulation of EGSs is thus the Newton–Raphson scheme with Aitken’s Δ 2 Δ2 relaxation.},

In this research, the topology optimization model of turbulent flows is expanded by adapting the Spalart–Allmaras (SA) model with the Rotation/Curvature Correction to consider a density-based material model. This correction improves the turbulence evaluation when rotating frames are considered. The SA model considers the distance to the nearest wall to calculate the turbulent viscosity. However, in the TO, it uses the distance to the nearest solid element, which is calculated by using a novel Eikonal equation with a penalization model. The algorithm is implemented by using a finite element model to solve the state equations. The pyadjoint libraries are used to perform the automatic sensitivity derivation. The objective function considered minimizes energy dissipation. The algorithm is evaluated by performing the optimization of rotating flows with high Reynolds numbers. Several optimized topologies for different domains and angular velocities are shown.},

Effective drug delivery in the subcutaneous tissue critically depends on the coupled mechanical and transport processes occurring in the tissue during and after the injection. The details of these processes, however, remain poorly understood; and this explains the growing interest in computational approaches. Notably, there are very few computational studies on subcutaneous injection into three-dimensional porous media that account for tissue deformability. Here, we leverage a poroelastic model to analyze the response of subcutaneous tissue under the flow of a pressurized fluid. We propose a computational method based on Isogeometric Analysis that exploits the global continuity of splines. Our model shows the importance of considering tissue deformation and permeability changes in order to obtain more realistic results in terms of fluid pressure and velocity, during and after the injection.},

  abstract     = {The in-depth knowledge of rarefied gas dynamics is crucial to address challenges in a wide range of engineering problems, where gas flows are usually multiscale, i.e., covering a wide range of Knudsen numbers. As the traditional Navier–Stokes equations fail, gas kinetic equations are required to model the flows. So far, very few numerical methods are designed to efficiently solve the multiscale gas dynamics and reveal the role of internal degrees of freedom of gas molecules. In this work, a general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS) is proposed to find steady-state solutions of the gas kinetic equations for molecular gas flows accurately and efficiently, where the gas kinetic equations are solved together with the macroscopic synthetic equations that expedite solutions towards the steady state. In the macroscopic synthetic equations, while the momentum equation is the same as that used in the GSIS for monatomic gas, two energy equations are introduced here for polyatomic gases: one is for the translational energy and the other for the internal energy; these equations are derived exactly from the gas kinetic equations hence no approximation is made in final solutions. The Fourier stability analysis is performed to show that the GSIS permits fast convergence to steady-state solutions in the entire flow regime; meanwhile the asymptotic analysis shows that the GSIS recovers the Navier–Stokes equations when the Knudsen number is small, even on the spatial grid with cell size much larger than the molecular mean free path. With all these unique features, several challenging numerical examples are given to show that the proposed GSIS is a promising tool to simulate multiscale molecular gas flows and investigate the effects of internal degrees of freedom.},

Moreover, an explicit formula is introduced as a more efficient form of the proposed time-integration scheme. To obtain numerical evidence, we apply the proposed method to simulate four benchmark test flows of incompressible Navier–Stokes equations: a linear advection–diffusion, a flow on a square domain, a shear layer flow, and a backward-facing step flow. The proposed method provides third-order accuracy in terms of both time and space in the overall backward semi-Lagrangian methodology.

However, the theory of online sequential estimation of sparsely changing parameter vectors is much less studied. We present a sequential SBL framework for recursive learning of sparse vectors that also change sparsely between successive sampling time periods. Our method uses a hierarchical Bayesian model to recursively estimate the marginal posterior distribution of the parameter vector for each time period, incorporating the sparseness of both this vector and its temporal changes. Our Bayesian model is built around a linear Gaussian state space model and so many quantities of interest can be calculated by using the recursive Bayesian equations. The fast evidence maximization procedure for SBL is developed for recursive Bayesian analysis and the “noise” parameters are efficiently learned solely from the available data in an efficient manner. Numerical experiments verify that exploiting the sparseness of temporal changes of sparse vectors leads to better performance of sparse Bayesian learning . We also examine two applications of sequential SBL: structural system identification for estimating stiffness losses of sequential damage states and recursive reconstruction of image sequences. These illustrative applications validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel method to model non-deterministic quantities based on experimental measurement data. The focus of this work is on quantities that vary over a continuous domain, e.g., material properties, time-dependent strain rate effects, or stress–strain curves. These quantities are modelled by means of the recently introduced concept of interval fields. An interval field defines intervals that are defined throughout the continuous domain and have dependence in this domain by expanding them over a set of basis functions, describing the spatial nature of the non-determinism of the modelled quantities. One of the more intuitive concepts of defining basis functions in an interval field is through inverse distance weighting interpolation (IDW), which starts from known intervals at specific control points within the domain. For each of these control points, a corresponding basis function is defined, the relative weight of which is decreasing inversely with the distance. Through this definition, all intervals have non-vanishing basis functions throughout the model domain. This makes the application of standard IDW extremely challenging when the interval uncertainty varies inhomogeneously over the domain, i.e., when local effects are present in the model. Therefore, in this paper standard IDW is adapted by changing the distance measure. More specifically, the weight of intervals is increased locally, while diminishing the weight in other regions. For this purpose, a function is introduced that maps the domain to a higher dimension feature space, in which the distances that determine the weight are measured. This mapping function is based on either the size of the intervals at the control points or experimental data, which both yield additional control resulting in increased agreement with experimental data. This paper demonstrates that this method outperforms standard IDW in controllability, while limiting the number of control points. This is illustrated in three case studies: a first case concerning modelling local non-determinism; a second case where a mix of global and local effects is modelled; and the third case, where the interval field is based on experimental stress strain curves. In all these cases, multiple configurations demonstrate the effects of the parameters, and how the new technique is applied. The proposed technique outperforms standard IDW in all three case studies, with an increased coefficient of determination, R 2 R2 , between 22% and 56%, in comparison to standard IDW.},

  abstract     = {This work addresses the inverse identification of apparent elastic properties of random heterogeneous materials using machine learning based on artificial neural networks. The proposed neural network-based identification method requires the construction of a database from which an artificial neural network can be trained to learn the nonlinear relationship between the hyperparameters of a prior stochastic model of the random compliance field and some relevant quantities of interest of an ad hoc multiscale computational model. An initial database made up with input and target data is first generated from the computational model, from which a processed database is deduced by conditioning the input data with respect to the target data using the nonparametric statistics. Two- and three-layer feedforward artificial neural networks are then trained from each of the initial and processed databases to construct an algebraic representation of the nonlinear mapping between the hyperparameters (network outputs) and the quantities of interest (network inputs). The performances of the trained artificial neural networks are analyzed in terms of mean squared error, linear regression fit and probability distribution between network outputs and targets for both databases. An ad hoc probabilistic model of the input random vector is finally proposed in order to take into account uncertainties on the network input and to perform a robustness analysis of the network output with respect to the input uncertainties level. The capability of the proposed neural network-based identification method to efficiently solve the underlying statistical inverse problem is illustrated through two numerical examples developed within the framework of 2D plane stress linear elasticity, namely a first validation example on synthetic data obtained through computational simulations and a second application example on real experimental data obtained through a physical experiment monitored by digital image correlation on a real heterogeneous biological material (beef cortical bone).},

  abstract     = {The Discontinuous Petrov–Galerkin (DPG) method is a widely employed discretization method for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). In a recent work, we applied the DPG method with optimal test functions for the time integration of transient parabolic PDEs. We showed that the resulting DPG-based time-marching scheme is equivalent to exponential integrators for the trace variables. In this work, we extend the aforementioned method to time-dependent hyperbolic PDEs. For that, we reduce the second order system in time to first order and we calculate the optimal testing analytically. We also relate our method with exponential integrators of Gautschi-type. Finally, we validate our method for 1D/2D + time linear wave equation after semidiscretization in space with a standard Bubnov–Galerkin method. The presented DPG-based time integrator provides expressions for the solution in the element interiors in addition to those on the traces. This allows to design different error estimators to perform adaptivity.},

  abstract     = {A two-way coupling method of the three-dimensional (3D) isogeometric approach and the least-square moving particle semi-implicit method (LSMPS) is presented for handling the fluid–structure interaction problems. This method takes advantages of isogeometric analysis (IGA) for structure deformation , e.g. the exact representation of the structure geometry and high accuracy for solution fields with relatively few elements, and that of the LSMPS method for fluid flow, e.g. its consistent discretization for both internal particles and boundary conditions. When the fluid is solved by the LSMPS method, the NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) surfaces provide boundary conditions for the LSMPS method. Afterward, the pressure on the NURBS surface is first evaluated from the pressure and the corresponding derivatives at the LSMPS particles by using the Taylor series expansion , and then integrated to determine the pressure force at the virtual points on the NURBS surface by using the Newton–Cotes method. Subsequently, the pressure forces at the virtual points are distributed onto the control nodes (i.e. control points) of the IGA elements so that the structure deformation can be analyzed by using the IGA method. The coupling algorithm is based on a Lagrangian framework and can handle the boundary conditions and the fluid–structure interactions accurately and easily. Finally, three examples, i.e. fluid flowing in a rigid pipe, fluid-tank, and fluid-torus interactions in the elastic regime , are simulated to demonstrate the accuracy and validity of the proposed coupling method.},

  abstract     = {One major merit of phase-field models for fracture is that cracks nucleation, propagation, branching, merging, coalescence and even fragmentation, etc., can be accounted for seamlessly within a standalone regularized variational framework. This fascinating feature overcomes the cumbersomeness in the characterization of non-smooth crack surfaces and the tracking of complex crack paths. However, the numerical algorithms frequently adopted in solving the coupled governing equations are not robust or efficient enough, together with the high computational cost in resolving the fracture process zone, largely hindering application of these models to general 3D problems. In this work, several 3D benchmark problems involving mode I, I+II or I+III failure in brittle and quasi-brittle solids is addressed based on our recent theoretical and numerical progresses on the unified phase-field theory for damage and fracture (Wu, 2017). Complex 3D fracture problems with over 2 million elements and more than 6 million degrees of freedom (dofs) can be tackled using normal computation facilities within acceptable computational time . Moreover, we are able to not only reproduce qualitatively evolution of the complex fracture pattern, but also compare quantitatively the global responses against experimental results. With the need neither to characterize the non-smooth crack surface nor to track the twisting crack path, the 3D computer implementation is almost the same as the 2D counterpart, paving the way to the phase-field modeling of large scale engineering problems.},

  abstract     = {The classical boundary element method (BEM) is widely used to obtain detailed information on the acoustic performance of large-scale dynamical systems due to the nature of semi-analytical characteristic. Its use, however, results in asymmetric and dense system matrix, which makes original full-order model evaluation very time consuming and memory demanding. Moreover, the frequency sweep analysis which is indispensable for the assessment of noise emission levels and the design of high-quality products requires the repetitive assembly and solution of system of equations, which further increases the computational complexity. In order to alleviate these problems, an adaptive structure-preserving model order reduction method is presented, which is based on an offline–online solution framework. In the offline phase, we first factor out the frequency term as a scalar function from the BE integral kernels of the Burton–Miller formulation, followed by integration to set up the system matrices. A global frequency-independent orthonormal basis is then constructed via the second-order Arnoldi (SOAR) method to span a projection subspace, onto which the frequency-decoupled system matrices are projected column by column to solve the memory problem arising from the frequency-related decomposition. In addition, the number of iterations required for convergence can be automatically determined by exploiting the condition number of an upper Hessenberg matrix in SOAR. In the online stage, a reliable reduced-order model can be quickly recovered by the sum of those offline stored reduced matrices multiplied by frequency-dependent coefficients, which is favored in many-query applications. Two academic benchmarks and a more realistic problem are investigated in order to demonstrate the potentials of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This work focuses on the characterization of narrow vertical cracks of finite size using optically excited lock-in thermography (OLT). To characterize these cracks, we need to solve an ill-posed inverse problem. As a previous step to the solution of this inverse problem, we propose a sensitivity analysis to quantify the influence that the parameters involved in the model have on the surface temperature. Some of these parameters are estimated at the laboratory and they incorporate uncertainty that may severely affect the reconstruction of thin cracks. For this reason, we design a calibration criterion based on the sensitivity analysis to determine which parameters we need to include as unknowns of the inverse problem. We perform this analysis using a numerical discontinuous Galerkin method. Additionally, we propose a theoretical noise model for the thermograms. Then, we use a weighted least square method (WLS) to determine the parameters from the experimental thermograms. We also obtain a theoretical uncertainty of the reconstructed parameters in OLT-WLS fitting according to the used surface temperature dataset. Finally, we perform a numerical experiment with a 2 . 4 2.4 m-thick vertical crack to show the sensitivities of the surface temperature with respect to the model parameters. We also determine the uncertainty of the parameters under different datasets with known noise characteristics.},

Based upon the variational setting of generalized standard materials, we model the stiffness degradation of the matrix in cycle space by a simple isotropic fatigue-damage model with minimum number of model parameters, and consider the fibers to be linear elastic. The stiffness degradation upon cyclic loading is determined, for fixed damage state, by standard linear elastic homogenization. We thoroughly investigate the influence of the involved numerical and material parameters on the effective stiffness degradation of short-fiber reinforced volume elements, and also pay close attention on the dependence on geometric parameters of the composite like fiber-volume fraction and the fiber-orientation state. To enable component-scale simulations, we use a model-order reduction strategy for identifying a suitable macroscopic model. This reduction is possible because our free energy involves polynomial powers in the fields not exceeding two, and our dissipation potential is assumed quadratic. For resolving the balance of linear momentum on the microscopic scale, we rely upon a fast Fourier transform based non-local micromechanics solver. We investigate the clever identification of the modes and demonstrate the capabilities of our model on the microscopic and on the component scale by pertinent numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {Incompatible parametric subdomains are common in computer-aided design (CAD) and in computer-aided engineering (CAE). In this paper, we present a unified formulation to smoothly couple non-matching parametric domains for both geometric modeling and analysis of behavior. The key concept used to accomplish the coupling is a “parametric stitching” or p p -stitching interface between the incompatible patches. Specifically, p p -stitching permits independently varying fields with assured, arbitrary smoothness at the interface between the coupled subdomains. The developed procedure enables modular construction of coupling problems with compatible interfaces as well as the ability to characterize sharp changes in gradient, as at dissimilar material interfaces. Fundamental to the developed methodology is enriched field approximations. The base approximations in the subdomains are enriched by the interfacial fields constructed as a function of distance from the coupling interfaces. The proposed method is argued to be the smooth extension of the dual–primal method such as the localized version of the Lagrange multiplier method. In the present paper, non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) are chosen for discretizing the parametric subdomains. The developed procedure though is valid for other representations of subdomains whose basis functions obey partition of unity. We validate the proposed method through patch tests and demonstrate the approach on several two- and three-dimensional elastostatic as well as heat conduction numerical examples.},

This paper presents a flexible and effective thermal multi-phase flow model for directed energy deposition (DED) processes. Departing from the data-fitted or presumed deposit shapes in the literature, we first derive a deposit geometry model based on an energy minimization problem with a mass conservation constraint. Then, an interface-capturing approach based on a signed distance function that moves with the laser is constructed to represent the air–metal interface evolution. The approach can be applied to any type of mesh without requiring the activation process of solid elements in a mesh. The coupled multi-phase Navier–Stokes and energy conservation equations are solved by a variational multi-scale formulation (VMS). A density-scaled continuous surface force (CSF) model is employed to incorporate the Marangoni effect , no penetration boundary condition, and the heat source on the air–metal interface. We utilize the proposed method to simulate two representative metal manufacturing problems. The simulated results are carefully compared with available experimental measurements and computational results from others. The results demonstrate the accuracy and modeling capabilities of the proposed method for metal AM problems.},

This leads to a system of ordinary differential equations to describe the motion which enables a straightforward combination of the model with control or estimation algorithms . However, an explicit relation between the model full coordinates and a minimal number of parameters is not always available or easily obtainable, especially for spatial closed-loop mechanisms. In this work, we therefore propose to deploy deep learning to find an approximation of such motion mappings. More specifically, an autoencoder neural network architecture is exploited for the nonlinear dimensionality reduction from full to minimal coordinates. A novel neural-network training scheme is introduced, which exploits the multibody model dynamics information to optimize the decoder-function derivatives so that they represent the tangent space and the curvature of the minimal coordinates manifold. This scheme leads to an effective description of the motion manifold which can be used to express the dynamics in minimal coordinates. The approach is validated on two reference rigid body mechanisms.},

In our method, the digital microstructure image is assumed to be a stationary Markov random field (MRF), and local patterns covering the basic morphological features are collected to train a DNN model, after which statistically equivalent samples can be generated through a DNN-guided reconstruction procedure. Furthermore, to overcome the short-distance limitation associated with the MRF assumption, a multi-level approach is developed to preserve the long-distance morphological features of heterogeneous microstructures. A large number of tests have been conducted to compare the reconstructed and target microstructures in both morphological characteristics and physical properties, and good agreements are observed in all test cases. The proposed method is efficient, accurate, versatile, and especially beneficial to the statistical reconstruction of 2D/3D microstructures with long-distance correlations.},

  abstract     = {The evaluation of constitutive models, especially for high-risk and high-regret engineering applications, requires efficient and rigorous third-party calibration, validation and falsification. While there are numerous efforts to develop paradigms and standard procedures to validate models, difficulties may arise due to the sequential, manual, and often biased nature of the commonly adopted calibration and validation processes, thus slowing down data collections, hampering the progress towards discovering new physics, increasing expenses and possibly leading to misinterpretations of the credibility and application ranges of proposed models. This work attempts to introduce concepts from game theory and machine learning techniques to overcome many of these existing difficulties. We introduce an automated meta-modeling game where two competing AI agents systematically generate experimental data to calibrate a given constitutive model and to explore its weakness such that the experiment design and model robustness can be improved through competitions. The two agents automatically search for the Nash equilibrium of the meta-modeling game in an adversarial reinforcement learning framework without human intervention. In particular, a protagonist agent seeks to find the more effective ways to generate data for model calibrations, while an adversary agent tries to find the most devastating test scenarios that expose the weaknesses of the constitutive model calibrated by the protagonist. By capturing all possible design options of the laboratory experiments into a single decision tree, we recast the design of experiments as a game of combinatorial moves that can be resolved through deep reinforcement learning by the two competing players. Our adversarial framework emulates idealized scientific collaborations and competitions among researchers to achieve a better understanding of the application range of the learned material laws and prevent misinterpretations caused by conventional AI-based third-party validation. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the wide applicability of the proposed meta-modeling game with adversarial attacks on both human-crafted constitutive models and machine learning models.},

  abstract     = {The approximation properties of the finite element method can often be substantially improved by choosing smooth high-order basis functions. It is extremely difficult to devise such basis functions for partitions consisting of arbitrarily shaped polytopes . We propose the mollified basis functions of arbitrary order and smoothness for partitions consisting of convex polytopes . On each polytope an independent local polynomial approximant of arbitrary order is assumed. The basis functions are defined as the convolutions of the local approximants with a mollifier. The mollifier is chosen to be smooth, to have a compact support and a unit volume. The approximation properties of the obtained basis functions are governed by the local polynomial approximation order and mollifier smoothness. The convolution integrals are evaluated numerically first by computing the boolean intersection between the mollifier and the polytope and then applying the divergence theorem to reduce the dimension of the integrals. The support of a basis function is given as the Minkowski sum of the respective polytope and the mollifier. The breakpoints of the basis functions, i.e. locations with non-infinite smoothness, are not necessarily aligned with polytope boundaries. Furthermore, the basis functions are not boundary interpolating so that we apply boundary conditions with the non-symmetric Nitsche method as in immersed/embedded finite elements. The presented numerical examples confirm the optimal convergence of the proposed approximation scheme for Poisson and elasticity problems .},

  abstract     = {The initiation and propagation of aortic dissection have not yet been fully elucidated. An essential role is attributed to the degradation of inter-lamellar elastic fibers in the aortic media which causes a significant lowering of the radial strength . Inter-lamellar elastic fibers are aligned radially and contribute mainly to the cohesion of the lamellar units in the aortic media. Computational studies that consider these pathological findings during aortic dissection are rare. In this study, we propose a constitutive model which incorporates the degeneration of inter-lamellar elastic fibers. For this purpose, the recently introduced discrete fiber dispersion model is applied to include symmetrically dispersed inter-lamellar elastic fibers in a strain–energy function. Damaged or degraded elastic fibers are excluded from the strain–energy function by introducing a degradation parameter. Subsequently, the proposed model is implemented in a finite element program and verified with two representative numerical examples , uniaxial extension and simple shear. An aortic dissection geometry with two distinct layers, motivated from patient data, is then created to study the influence of degraded radially-directed elastic fibers on the stress distribution in an aortic dissection. In summary, the presented constitutive model is able to capture the degradation of inter-lamellar elastic fibers during aortic dissection. Moreover, the finite element analysis results of the patient-data motivated geometry suggest a possible mechanism triggering the dissection propagation.},

  abstract     = {Recycling of Krylov subspaces is often used to obtain an augmentation subspace in the context of iterative algorithms for the solution of sequences of linear systems . However, it still remains difficult to quantify the effect of subspaces recycling and thus to determine the dimension of the subspaces to be recycled targeting a specific accuracy. In that context, this work proposes the Automatic Krylov subspaces Recycling algorithm (AKR) that automates the selection of Krylov subspaces to be recycled and generates a basis that can provide sufficiently accurate approximations of the solution for a parametric system on a predefined interval Ψ . The constructed basis is employed as a Galerkin projection basis for a model order reduction (MOR) scheme in the context of non-affine parametric systems. In the offline phase of the MOR scheme, AKR constructs a projection subspace W by sampling Krylov subspaces at an iteratively built set of parameter values Ω . Keeping a balance between the solution accuracy and the memory required, the algorithm, apart from guaranteeing a predefined residual level rtol , also permits the predetermination of a threshold regarding the maximum memory employed. Nevertheless, following the unpreconditioned Krylov methods effectiveness criteria, the proposed technique proves to be efficient for systems with relatively clustered eigenvalues such as the ones encountered in the conventional Boundary Element Method . The performance of the proposed AKR algorithm is assessed in comparison with an alternative version of the reduced basis method, which is based on the same assumptions as the AKR and is specifically designed to provide a good benchmark. These techniques are deployed for a randomly generated complex system and an acoustic BEM system. The advantage of employing AKR is demonstrated as fewer system assemblies are required for the construction of the projection basis.},

Lagrange quadratic shape function in time with flexible interpolation points are considered to approximate the solution over a time interval . Instead of specifying the weight functions, two algorithmic parameters, namely, a principal root ( ρ q ∞ ρq∞ ) and a spurious root ( ρ p ∞ ρp∞ ), are introduced to formulate a generalized weight function, which enables us to introduce controllable numerical dissipation with respect to displacement and momenta while preserving high-order convergence, and features with improved solution accuracy.

The error is estimated locally considering the residuals that emerge from the numerical solution and the error inverse-velocity scales, τ τ ’s, associated with each type of residual. These error scales are provided in this paper, which have been computed a-priori solving a set of local problems with unit residuals. Therefore, the computational effort to predict the error is small and its implementation in any FEM code is simple. As an application, a strategy to develop adaptive meshes with the aim of optimizing the computational effort is shown. Numerical examples are presented to test the behavior of the error estimator.},

  abstract     = {The integration of numerical simulation and experimental measurements in cellular materials at the sub-cellular scale is a real challenge. On the experimental side, the almost absence of texture makes displacement fields measurement tricky. On the simulation side, it requires the construction of reliable and specimen-specific geometric and mechanical models from digital images. For this purpose, high order based fictitious domain approaches have proven to be an efficient alternative to boundary conforming finite elements for the analysis of geometrically complex objects. A number of discretization parameters needs to be set by the user by making a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. In addition to numerical errors (interpolation, integration etc.), there are additional geometric and model errors due to the pixelation of the image ( e.g. , quantization, sampling, noise). In the literature, discretization parameters are often analyzed without taking pixelation into account, which can lead to over-calculations. In this paper, these parameters are adjusted to obtain (a) the best possible accuracy (bounded by pixelation errors) while (b) ensuring minimal complexity (concept of fair price). In order to analyze the different sources of error, various two-dimensional synthetic experiments are generated by mimicking the image acquisition process from high-resolution numerical simulations considered as a reference. The approach leads to a modeling that outperforms conventional approaches both in terms of accuracy and complexity. Eventually, it is shown that the presented image-based models provide a unique opportunity to assist digital volume correlation and allow the measurement of relevant local kinematics within cellular materials.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we address an unresolved problem in the numerical modeling of cardiac electromechanics , that is the onset of numerical oscillations due to the dependence of force generation models on the fibers shortening velocity. A way to avoid numerical oscillations is to use monolithic schemes for the solution of the coupled problem of active–passive mechanics. However, staggered strategies, which foresee the sequential solution of the models of force generation and of tissue mechanics , are preferable, due to their reduced computational cost and low implementation effort. In this paper we propose a cure for this issue, by introducing, with respect to the standard staggered scheme, a numerically consistent stabilization term. This term is derived in virtue of the identification of the cause of instability in the mismatch between macroscopic and microscopic strains, inconsistently expressed in Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates , respectively. By considering a model problem of active mechanics we prove that the proposed scheme is unconditionally absolutely stable (i.e. it is stable for any time step size), yet within a fully staggered framework. As such, the new scheme removes the non-physical oscillations, as we prove by applying it to three force generation models, namely the Niederer–Hunter–Smith model, the model by Land and coworkers , and the mean-field force generation model that we have recently proposed.},

  abstract     = {In Parts I (Bonet et al., 2015) and II (Gil et al., 2016) of this series, a novel computational framework was presented for the numerical analysis of large strain fast solid dynamics in compressible and nearly/truly incompressible isothermal hyperelasticity. The methodology exploited the use of a system of first order Total Lagrangian conservation laws formulated in terms of the linear momentum and a triplet of deformation measures comprised of the deformation gradient tensor, its co-factor and its Jacobian. Moreover, the consideration of polyconvex constitutive laws was exploited in order to guarantee the hyperbolicity of the system and show the existence of a convex entropy function (sum of kinetic and strain energy per unit undeformed volume) necessary for symmetrisation. In this new paper, the framework is extended to the more general case of thermo-elasticity by incorporating the first law of thermodynamics as an additional conservation law, written in terms of either the entropy (suitable for smooth solutions) or the total energy density (suitable for discontinuous solutions) of the system. The paper is further enhanced with the following key novelties. First, sufficient conditions are put forward in terms of the internal energy density and the entropy measured at reference temperature in order to ensure ab-initio the polyconvexity of the internal energy density in terms of the extended set comprised of the triplet of deformation measures and the entropy. Second, the study of the eigenvalue structure of the system is performed as proof of hyperbolicity and with the purpose of obtaining correct time step bounds for explicit time integrators. Application to two well-established thermo-elastic models is presented: Mie–Grüneisen and modified entropic elasticity. Third, the use of polyconvex internal energy constitutive laws enables the definition of a generalised convex entropy function, namely the ballistic energy, and associated entropy fluxes, allowing the symmetrisation of the system of conservation laws in terms of entropy-conjugate fields. Fourth, and in line with the previous papers of the series, an explicit stabilised Petrov–Galerkin framework is presented for the numerical solution of the thermo-elastic system of conservation laws when considering the entropy as an unknown of the system. Finally, a series of numerical examples is presented in order to assess the applicability and robustness of the proposed formulation.},

The constitutive model captures the superelastic behaviour of SMAs and damage is driven by the elastic and transformation strain energy densities. We consider both the assumption of a constant fracture energy and the case of a fracture energy dependent on the martensitic volume fraction. The framework is implemented in an implicit time integration scheme, with both monolithic and staggered solution strategies. The potential of this formulation is showcased by modelling a number of paradigmatic problems. First, a boundary layer model is used to examine crack tip fields and compute crack growth resistance curves (R-curves). We show that the model is able to capture the main fracture features associated with SMAs, including the toughening effect associated with stress-induced phase transformation. Insight is gained into the role of temperature, material strength, crack density function and fracture energy homogenisation. Secondly, several 2D and 3D boundary value problems are addressed, demonstrating the capabilities of the model in capturing complex cracking phenomena in SMAs, such as unstable crack growth, mixed-mode fracture or the interaction between several cracks. Finally, the model is extended to fatigue and used to capture crack nucleation and propagation in biomedical stents, a paradigmatic application of nitinol SMAs.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we establish a binary fluid surfactant model by coupling two mass-conserved Allen–Cahn equations and the Navier–Stokes equations and consider numerical simulations of the developed model. Due to a large number of nonlinear and nonlocal coupling terms in the model, it is very challenging to design an efficient and accurate numerical scheme , especially the full decoupling scheme with second-order time accuracy. We solve this challenge by developing a novel fully-decoupled approach, where the key idea achieving the full decoupling structure is to introduce an ordinary differential equation to deal with the nonlinear coupling terms that satisfy the so-called “ zero-energy-contribution ” property. In this way, we can easily discretize the coupled nonlinear terms in a fully explicit way, while still maintaining unconditional energy stability. By combining with the projection type method and quadratization approach, at each time step, we only need to solve several fully-decoupled linear elliptic equations with constant coefficients . We strictly prove the solvability of the scheme, prove that the scheme satisfies the unconditional energy stability, and give various 2D and 3D numerical simulations to show its stability and accuracy numerically. As far as the author knows, this is the first fully-decoupled and second-order time-accurate scheme of the flow-coupled phase-field type model .},

In the framework of the convex set theory and Taylor series expansion , the ellipsoidal Newton’s iteration scheme is established. Two various models of the scheme depending on the different models of quantifying the region of the iterative solution in iterative calculation are discussed. The bounds of the solution are updated iteratively by using the maximum and minimum values of the solution increment, which can be obtained by solving the optimization problem . The convergence of the scheme is proved and the general procedure for its implementation is also presented.

  abstract     = {The data-driven computing paradigm initially introduced by Kirchdoerfer and Ortiz (2016) is extended by incorporating locally linear tangent spaces into the data set. These tangent spaces are constructed by means of the tensor voting method introduced by Mordohai and Medioni (2010) which improves the learning of the underlying structure of a data set. Tensor voting is an instance-based machine learning technique which accumulates votes from the nearest neighbors to build up second-order tensors encoding tangents and normals to the underlying data structure. The here proposed second-order data-driven paradigm is a plug-in method for distance-minimizing as well as entropy-maximizing data-driven schemes. Like its predecessor (Kirchdoerfer and Ortiz, 2016), the resulting method aims to minimize a suitably defined free energy over phase space subject to compatibility and equilibrium constraints. The method’s implementation is straightforward and numerically efficient since the data structure analysis is performed in an offline step. Selected numerical examples are presented that establish the higher-order convergence properties of the data-driven solvers enhanced by tensor voting for ideal and noisy data sets.},

  abstract     = {An extended immersed boundary methodology utilizing a semi-implicit direct forcing approach was formulated for the simulation of incompressible flows in the presence of periodically moving immersed bodies. The methodology utilizes a Schur complement approach to enforce no-slip kinematic constraints for immersed surfaces. The methodology is split into an “embarrassingly” parallel pre-computing stage and a time integration stage, both of which take advantage of the general parallel file system (GPFS) for efficient writing and reading of large amounts of data. The methodology can be embedded straight forwardly into the whole family of pressure–velocity segregated solvers of incompressible Navier–Stokes equations based on projection or fractional step approaches. The methodology accurately meets the no-slip kinematic constraints on the surfaces of immersed oscillating bodies . In this study, it was extensively verified by applying it for the simulation of a number of representative flows developing in the presence of an oscillating sphere. The capabilities of the methodology for the simulation of incompressible flow generated by a number of bodies whose motion is governed by general periodic kinematics were demonstrated by simulation of the flow developing in the presence of two out-of-phase oscillating spheres. The physical characteristics of the generated flows in terms of the time evolutions of the total drag coefficients were presented as a function of Reynolds values. The vortical structures inherent in the generated flows were visualized by presenting the isosurfaces of the λ 2 λ2 criterion.},

We use a third-order method on 2D quadrilateral meshes as an example to present the algorithm. The method can effectively remap the physical variables after mesh rezoning in the ALE algorithm. By calculating the intersection exactly, this method does not require the same connectivity between the old and new meshes. By reconstructing a quadratic polynomial and a zero-order polynomial for each cell in a two-dimensional domain, this method assigns nonlinear weights for these polynomials accordingly after calculating the smoothness indicators over the integration area, yielding third order accuracy without numerical oscillations. After calculating the overlaps between the old and new meshes and integrating the polynomials over the intersections, the remapping is completed. Furthermore, to ensure the positivity-preserving property of relevant physical variables in hydrodynamics numerical simulation such as density and internal energy, a simple and efficient positive-preserving limiter is adopted to slightly modify the reconstructed polynomials, which can maintain the original order of accuracy and conservation. The algorithm can be extended to higher order accuracy using higher order reconstruction and higher order integration formula over the intersection areas. A series of numerical experiments are performed to test the properties of the multi-resolution WENO conservative remapping algorithm. Numerical results show that the algorithm is conservative, positivity-preserving, highly efficient, third-order accurate for smooth problems, and essentially non-oscillatory for discontinuous problems.},

Specifically, the method requires only snapshot data of state variables at discrete time instances and the parameters that characterize the boundaries, but not further knowledge of the full-order model and the underlying governing equations. The dynamical systems can be generally nonlinear. The movements of boundaries are not limited to prescribed or periodic motions but can be free motions. In addition, we numerically investigate the ability of the reduced order model constructed by the proposed method to forecast the full-order solutions for future times beyond the range of snapshot data. The error analysis for the proposed reduced order modeling and the criteria to determine the furthest forecast time are also provided. Through numerical experiments, we assess the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method in several benchmark problems. The snapshot data used to construct and validate the reduced order model are from analytical/numerical solutions and experimental measurements.},

  abstract     = {The contact volume based energy-conserving contact model is presented in the current paper as a specialised version of the general energy-conserving contact model established in the first paper of this series (Feng, 2020). It is based on the assumption that the contact energy potential is taken to be a function of the contact volume between two contacting bodies with arbitrary (convex and concave) shapes in both 2D and 3D cases. By choosing such a contact energy function, the full normal contact features can be determined without the need to introduce any additional assumptions/parameters. By further exploiting the geometric properties of the contact surfaces concerned, more effective integration schemes are developed to reduce the evaluation costs involved. When a linear contact energy function of the contact volume is adopted, a linear contact model is derived in which only the intersection between two contact shapes is needed, thereby substantially improving both efficiency and applicability of the proposed contact model. A comparison of this linear energy-conserving contact model with some existing models for discs and spheres further reveals the nature of the proposed model, and provides insights into how to appropriately choose the stiffness parameter included in the energy function. For general non-spherical shapes, mesh representations are required. The corresponding computational aspects are described when shapes are discretised into volumetric meshes, while new developments are presented and recommended for shapes that are represented by surface triangular meshes. Owing to its additive property of the contact geometric features involved, the proposed contact model can be conducted locally in parallel using GPU or GPGPU computing without occurring much communication overhead for shapes represented as either a volumetric or surface triangular mesh. A set of examples considering the elastic impact of two shapes are presented to verify the energy-conserving property of the proposed model for a wide range of concave shapes and contact scenarios, followed by examples involving large numbers of arbitrarily shaped particles to demonstrate the robustness and applicability for more complex and realistic problems.},

In this work, we propose a methodology for efficient uncertainty quantification for dynamic subsurface flow with a surrogate constructed by the Theory-guided Neural Network (TgNN). The TgNN here is specially designed for problems with stochastic parameters. In the TgNN, stochastic parameters, time and location comprise the input of the neural network, while the quantity of interest is the output. The neural network is trained with available simulation data, while being simultaneously guided by theory (e.g., the governing equation, boundary conditions, initial conditions, etc.) of the underlying problem. The trained neural network can predict solutions of subsurface flow problems with new stochastic parameters. With the TgNN surrogate, the Monte Carlo (MC) method can be efficiently implemented for uncertainty quantification. The proposed methodology is evaluated with two-dimensional dynamic saturated flow problems in porous medium. Numerical results show that the TgNN based surrogate can significantly improve the efficiency of uncertainty quantification tasks compared with simulation based implementation. Further investigations regarding stochastic fields with smaller correlation length, larger variance, changing boundary values and out-of-distribution variances are performed, and satisfactory results are obtained.},

  abstract     = {This contribution presents a general approach for solving structural design problems formulated as a class of nonlinear constrained optimization problems. A Two-Phase approach based on Bayesian model updating is considered for obtaining the optimal designs . Phase I generates samples (designs) uniformly distributed over the feasible design space, while Phase II obtains a set of designs lying in the vicinity of the optimal solution set . The equivalent model updating problem is solved by the transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo method . The proposed constraint-handling approach is direct and does not require special constraint-handling techniques. The population-based stochastic optimization algorithm generates a set of nearly optimal solutions uniformly distributed over the vicinity of the optimal solution set. The set of optimal solutions provides valuable sensitivity information. In addition, the proposed scheme is a useful tool for exploration of complex feasible design spaces. The general approach is applied to an important class of problems. Specifically, reliability-based design optimization of structural dynamical systems under stochastic excitation. Numerical examples are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed design scheme.},

This paper introduces and describes the methodology behind using the bonded particle method (BPM) with the level set discrete element method (LS-DEM-BPM), in order to model connected granular materials with arbitrary particle shape. The method is thoroughly detailed in both two and three dimensions. Examples of use for the method are shown for three distinct contexts. The first is the modeling of a fault gouge, where it is demonstrated that the method has the potential to be predictive of the rate-and-state friction law and have key insights into the micromechanics of the process. Another example is presented where a cone penetrates porous sintered ice showing that bond thickness has a considerable effect on model behavior. The third example is a simulation using many unique bonds for each contact interface, demonstrating the ability to simulate partial fractures. A discussion is also included on how and when this method can be either advantageous or disadvantageous.},

The objective of the current work is to construct a high-accuracy multi-fidelity surrogate model correlating the configuration parameters of an aircraft and its aerodynamic performance by blending different fidelity information and adaptively learning their linear or nonlinear correlation without any prior assumption. In the optimization framework, the high-fidelity model using a CFD evaluation with fine grid and the low-fidelity model using the same CFD model with coarse grid are applied. Moreover, in each optimization iteration, the high-fidelity infilling strategy by adding the current optimal solution of surrogate model into the high-fidelity database is applied to improve the surrogate accuracy. The low-fidelity infilling strategy which can generate the solutions distributed uniformly in the whole design space is used to update the low-fidelity database for avoiding local optimum . Then, the proposed multi-fidelity optimization framework is validated by two standard synthetic benchmarks. Finally, it is applied to the high-dimensional aerodynamic shape optimization of a RAE2822 airfoil parameterized by 10 design variables and a DLR-F4 wing-body configuration parameterized by 30 design variables. The optimization results demonstrate that the proposed multi-fidelity optimization framework can remarkably improve optimization efficiency and outperform the single-fidelity method.},

In this paper, a mechanistic-based, data-driven computational framework is proposed for elastoplastic materials undergoing finite strain. Harnessing the physical insights from the existing model-based plasticity theory , multiplicative decomposition of deformation gradient and the coaxial relationship between the logarithmic trial elastic strain and the true stress is employed to perform stress-update, driven by two sets of the specifically measured one dimensional (1D) stress–strain data. The proposed approach, called MAP123-EPF, is used to solve several Boundary-Value Problems (BVPs) involving elastoplastic materials undergoing finite strains. Numerical results indicate that the proposed approach can predict the response of isotropic elastoplastic materials (characterized by the classical J2 plasticity model and the associative Drucker–Prager model) with good accuracy using numerically/experimentally generated data. The proposed approach circumvents the need for the several basic ingredients of a traditional finite strain computational plasticity model, such as an explicit yielding function, a hardening law and an appropriate objective stress rate . Demonstrative examples are shown and strengths and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed.},

The sampling of the high-fidelity model to generate the snapshots is based on a locally adaptive sparse grid method. The novelty of the work is in the adaptive sampling of time, which is treated as an additional parameter. The goal is to have a robust and efficient sampling strategy that minimizes the risk of overlooking important dynamics of the system while disregarding snapshots at times when the dynamics are not contributing to the construction of the reduced model. The developed algorithm was tested on three numerical tests. The first was an advection problem parametrized with a five-dimensional space. The second was a lid-driven cavity test, and the last was a neutron diffusion problem in a subcritical nuclear reactor with 11 parameters. In all tests, the algorithm was able to detect and include more snapshots in important transient windows, which produced accurate and efficient representations of the high-fidelity models.},

  abstract     = {Homogenizing the constitutive response of materials with nonlinear and history-dependent behavior at the microscale is particularly challenging. In this case, the only option is generally to homogenize numerically via concurrent multiscale models (CMMs). Unfortunately, these methods are not practical as their computational cost becomes prohibitive for engineering-scale applications. In this work, we develop an alternative formulation to CMMs that leverage state-of-the-art micromechanical modeling and advanced machine learning techniques to develop what we call smart constitutive laws (SCLs). We propose a training scheme for our SCLs that makes them suitable for arbitrary loading histories, making them equivalent to traditional constitutive models. We also show how to implement a SCL into a traditional finite element solver and investigate the response of an engineering-scale component. We compare our results to those obtained via a high fidelity simulation. Our findings indicate that SCLs can dramatically boost the computational efficiency and scalability of computational homogenization for nonlinear and history-dependent materials with arbitrary microstructures, enabling in this way the automatic and systematic generation of microstructurally-informed constitutive laws that can be adopted for the solution of macro-scale complex structures.},

In this paper, the SSE method is applied to a 4-node quadrilateral finite element. Doing so, the piecewise linear shape functions are employed instead of standard bilinear shape functions.

  abstract     = {To achieve real-time simulations for flexible multibody dynamics (FMBD) systems, we suggest data-driven modeling based on deep neural networks (DNNs). While a DNN can represent system dynamics accurately, two main factors of FMBD systems require demanding computational costs for training a DNN. One is a fine discretization of flexible bodies, which produces a large number of training data . The other is the nonlinearity of FMBD, which requires train DNN models to have numerous weight and bias parameters. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a data-driven modeling algorithm for training a DNN efficiently that consists of two steps. First, sets of randomly chosen coarse data sequentially train a DNN model. This helps speed up the training process, even for highly parametrized DNNs. At some point, the model no longer improves, and introducing an error correction step increases the performance of the model. The proposed algorithm is easy to employ and utilizes an efficient size of training data while achieving high performance of the DNN as demonstrated by numerical examples .},

  abstract     = {Javili et al. recently reported a continuum-kinematics-inspired peridynamic model , in which theoretical aspects regarding the balance of linear and angular momentum and other conservation principles are considered. However, the analytical formulation of the model constants and the microelastic potential energy functions and numerical implementation were not defined. In this paper, a novel linear elastic constitutive model is proposed for the continuum-kinematics-inspired peridynamics by introducing specific expressions for various interaction potentials. The one-neighbor interaction potential equivalent to conventional bond-based interaction potential is utilized to account for the constitutive relationship within line elements between two material points. In contrast, the two- and three-neighbor interaction potentials are employed to consider the areal and volumetric effects under general mechanical loads. Three relevant material parameters are introduced and derived from energy equivalence to a classical linear elastic continuum mechanics model . Equipped with the three types of interaction potentials, the novel continuum-kinematics-inspired peridynamics is extended from classical bond-based peridynamics, wherein the two interaction force vectors within a bond are unequal and not parallel to the bond direction, can be regarded as an alternative version of non-ordinary state-based peridynamics. The proposed model is numerically demonstrated to be effective in absolutely eliminating the restriction of the fixed Poisson’s ratio in classical bond-based peridynamics, notably improving the effectiveness of the other enriched bond-based peridynamics in reproducing the elastic deformation of solids subjected to heterogeneous deformation fields and completely removing the numerical oscillations in non-ordinary state-based peridynamics.},

Many strides have been made in recent years regarding continuum topology optimization with elastoplasticity and buckling separately, but these phenomena are typically not considered together. The formulation we propose is computationally efficient and robust, partly due to its reliance on small strain kinematics and a separation of the elastoplastic response from the buckling load factors computed during the optimization procedure . An aggregate objective function is constructed in which the total work in an elastoplastic analysis is maximized and an aggregation function of the load factors from a separate linear elastic buckling analysis is included. Additionally, local ductile failure constraints are handled via a framework without aggregation functions and a new pseudo buckling mode filter is proposed. Each of the obtained topologies are then subject to a verification step in which a large strain ductile failure model is used in order to compare the performance of the optimized designs obtained for three numerical examples . The results demonstrate that structural responses such as peak load carrying capacity and total external work required to reach the peak load may be significantly improved using the suggested framework.

By interpolating the level set function (LSF) with the compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBFs), the partial differential equation (PDE) is transformed into an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Based on the interval-set model, the displacement constraint is transformed into the non-probabilistic reliability-based scheme and the reliability is evaluated by the optimization feature distance (OFD). Moreover, the interval parametric vertex approach, the concept of shape derivative and the adjoint vector method are employed to obtain the sensitivity between the optimization model and the pseudo time to obtain the evolution velocity field of LSF. By utilizing the optimization criterion (OC) method, the optimization problem can be solved iteratively. To verify the validity and applicability of the proposed NRBTO method, three examples are presented, and numerical results show that taking the UBB uncertainties effects into account during the topology optimization may have a significant influence on the final structural configurations.},

In this way G 1 G1 -conformity of the deformation can be implicitly obtained for any mesh of quadrilateral elements , also for not G 1 G1 -continuous parametrizations . The interpolation is defined by means of the kinematics of the boundary ribbons. The ribbon is the differential set generated by the tangents at the boundary of the element. A new set of degrees of freedom is introduced in order to control the deformation of the boundary, and the non-linear map between this new set of degrees of freedom and the control points of the Gregory interpolation is derived. Due to the presence of rational terms, the interpolation is not consistent, so that, in order to recover consistency it is necessary to enforce the vanishing of the discontinuities of the second derivatives with additional constraints.

  abstract     = {Numerical simulations of brittle fracture using phase-field approaches often employ a discrete approximation framework that applies the same order of interpolation for the displacement and phase-field variables. In particular, the use of linear finite elements to discretize both stress equilibrium and phase-field equations is widespread in the literature. However, the use of P 1 P1 Lagrange shape functions to model the phase-field is not optimal, as the latter contains cusps for fully developed cracks . These should in turn occur at locations corresponding to Gauss points of the associated FE model for the mechanics. Such a feature is challenging to reproduce accurately with low order elements, and element sizes must consequently be made very small relative to the phase-field regularization parameter in order to achieve convergence of results with respect to the mesh. In this paper, we combine a standard linear FE discretization of stress equilibrium with a cell-centered finite volume approximation of the phase-field evolution equation based on the two-point flux approximation constructed over the same simplex mesh. Compared to a pure FE formulation utilizing linear elements , the proposed framework results in looser restrictions on mesh refinement with respect to the phase-field length scale . This ability to employ coarser meshes relative to the traditional implementation allows for significant reductions on computational cost, as demonstrated in several numerical examples .},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a modeling framework to describe the driving mechanisms of cyclic failure in brittle and ductile materials, including cyclic plasticity and fatigue crack growth . A variational model is devised using the energetic formulation for rate-independent systems, coupling a phase-field description of fatigue fracture to a cyclic plasticity model that includes multi-surface kinematic hardening , gradient-enhanced isotropic hardening/softening and ratcheting. The coupled model embeds two distinctive fatigue effects. The first captures the characteristic features of low-cycle fatigue, driven by the accumulation of plastic strains, while the second accounts for high-cycle fatigue, driven by free energy accumulation. The interplay between these mechanisms allows to describe a wide range of cyclic responses under both force loading and displacement loading, as shown in several numerical simulations. Moreover, the phase-field approach to fracture accounts for the initiation and propagation of fatigue-induced cracks.},

  abstract     = {Phase-field models are frequently adopted to simulate fracture mechanics problems in the context of the finite element method . To depict fracture, this method involves solving a coupled set of Helmholtz-like damage-field equation and augmented linear momentum balance equation. Solutions to these coupled equations are then used as descriptions of crack propagation phenomena within solids. However, this method imposes a constrain of using extremely fine meshing for properly predicting cracks. For practical problems of interest, this very often leads to linear systems with large sizes that have to be repetitively assembled and solved. As such, iterative solution procedures such as the Krylov subspace-based methods for solving these large linear systems within the framework of serial/parallel computing environments become mandatory to obtain results in a feasible time. In this work, the vectorial finite discretization for a hybrid phase-field formulation – a monolithic solving scheme – is presented. The underlying nonlinearity present in the coupled set of equations of the hybrid phase-field model is dealt through Picard iteration that helps to preserve the symmetry of the linearized system to solve. Due to the symmetric positive definite nature of the finite element linear systems obtained for this problem, the conjugate gradient method makes a standard choice of iterative solution algorithm . In this article, to improve convergence rates, consequently time to solution, of the conjugate gradient method applied to crack propagation problems, different preconditioning strategies are analyzed, tuned, and discussed. Brittle fracture benchmarks are used to measure the performance of preconditioners which are then applied to massively parallel simulations with millions of unknowns. A series of numerical experiments show that the algebraic multigrid preconditioner is well suited for solving the phase-field model for fracture, being superior to the Jacobi and the block Jacobi preconditioning in all regards: ease of solving the problem, iterations to converge, time to solution, and parallel scaling on more than a thousand processes.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new data-driven reduced order model (ROM) framework that centers around the hierarchical structure of the variational multiscale (VMS) methodology and utilizes data to increase the ROM accuracy at a modest computational cost. The VMS methodology is a natural fit for the hierarchical structure of the ROM basis: In the first step, we use the ROM projection to separate the scales into three categories: (i) resolved large scales, (ii) resolved small scales, and (iii) unresolved scales. In the second step, we explicitly identify the VMS–ROM closure terms, i.e., the terms representing the interactions among the three types of scales. In the third step, we use available data to model the VMS–ROM closure terms. Thus, instead of phenomenological models used in VMS for standard numerical discretizations (e.g., eddy viscosity models), we utilize available data to construct new structural VMS–ROM closure models. Specifically, we build ROM operators (vectors, matrices, and tensors) that are closest to the true ROM closure terms evaluated with the available data. We test the new data-driven VMS–ROM in the numerical simulation of four test cases: (i) the 1D Burgers equation with viscosity coefficient ν = 1 0 − 3 ν=10−3 ; (ii) a 2D flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers R e = 100 Re=100 , R e = 500 Re=500 , and R e = 1000 Re=1000 ; (iii) the quasi-geostrophic equations at Reynolds number R e = 450 Re=450 and Rossby number R o = 0 . 0036 Ro=0.0036 ; and (iv) a 2D flow over a backward facing step at Reynolds number R e = 1000 Re=1000 . The numerical results show that the data-driven VMS–ROM is significantly more accurate than standard ROMs.},

The discrete weak gradients of these shape functions and the numerical Darcy velocity are established in the lowest order AC space. The Bernardi–Raugel elements ( B R 1 , Q 0 ) (BR1,Q0) are used to discretize the Stokes equations . These two types of discretizations are combined at an interface, where kinematic, normal stress, and the Beavers–Joseph–Saffman (BJS) conditions are applied.

Rule-Based-Methods (RBMs) represent a commonly used strategy to include cardiac fibers in computational models . A particular class of such methods is known as Laplace–Dirichlet-Rule-Based-Methods (LDRBMs) since they rely on the solution of Laplace problems. In this work we provide a unified framework, based on LDRBMs, for generating full heart muscle fibers. First, we review existing ventricular LDRBMs providing a communal mathematical description and introducing also some modeling improvements with respect to the existing literature. We then carry out a systematic comparison of LDRBMs based on meaningful biomarkers produced by numerical EP simulations. Next we propose, for the first time, a LDRBM to be used for generating atrial fibers. The new method, tested both on idealized and realistic atrial models, can be applied to any arbitrary geometries. Finally, we present numerical results obtained in a realistic whole heart where fibers are included for all the four chambers using the discussed LDRBMs.},

Unfortunately, it is largely affected by the curse of dimensionality and its application for reliability analysis is usually hindered unless high truncated degrees are used. To alleviate this problem, this paper presents a new method based on contribution-degree analysis (CDA), an exact dimension-reduction model (DRM) and polynomial chaos expansion for efficient reliability analysis. First, the original performance function is decomposed as a summation of several component functions including one lower-dimensional interacting component function and several one-dimensional non-interacting component functions via a CDA-based DRM. Then, the full PCE or sparse PCE is employed to reconstruct the lower-dimensional interacting component function instead of the original complicated multi-dimensional performance function, whereas one-dimensional full PCEs are utilized for approximating the non-interacting component functions. In this way, we avoid building a PCE meta-model for the original multivariate performance function, thus the number of unknown coefficients is significantly reduced and the computational burden for reliability analysis is eased accordingly. Pertinent examples including both analytical performance functions and finite-element models are investigated, which demonstrates that the proposed method achieves a good trade-off of efficiency and accuracy for reliability analysis.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this study is to understand the effects of micro-heterogeneity, such as grain size, morphology and mineralogy, on the initiation, propagation and coalescence of microcracks in heterogeneous materials. A multiscale grain-breakable continuum–discontinuum model incorporating realistic micro-heterogeneity reproduction method is proposed to investigate the fracturing behaviours and confinement mechanism of rocks. Crack initiation and damage stresses are intrinsic properties of rocks determined by grain-scale heterogeneity. Intergranular tensile cracks are primarily initiated as a result of local stress heterogeneity along grain boundaries. The subsequent generation of transgranular shear cracks implies a rapid proliferation of grain-crossing fractures, leads to large-scale crack interaction and coalescence. The effect of confinement inhibits crack extension and increases the appearance of shear-induced grain pulverizations. Furthermore, the effects of grain size, grain morphology and mineralogy on macro mechanical properties, including crack initiation stress, crack damage stress, uniaxial compression strength and elastic modulus , are discussed. The simulated results indicate that the larger grain size contributes to stronger local stress heterogeneity, which results in a lower failure strength of rocks. The crack initiation stress is determined by local heterogeneity and is less affected by the change in average grain size . Grain morphology plays an important role in grain interlocking while a reduction in grain size variance leads to a more homogeneous stress field. The mineralogy is evaluated with the aid of a quartz-mica-feldspar diagram, and the quantitative relationships between mineralogy and the macro-scale mechanical properties of rocks are discussed.},

  abstract     = {The first paper of this series establishes a unified theoretical framework that lays a solid foundation for developing energy-conserving normal contact models for arbitrarily shaped bodies in the discrete element method. It is derived based solely on the requirement that the potential energy must be conserved for an elastic impact of two shapes under any condition. The resulting general energy-conserving contact model states that the normal force as a vector must be the gradient of a contact potential field. When such a contact potential or energy function is specified, a complete normal contact model for a pair of arbitrarily shaped particles, including the contact normal direction, contact point/line and force magnitude, will be automatically followed without introducing any additional assumptions. In this framework, the contact geometry and contact force are indispensably related and are evaluated in a consistent manner. Due to the paramount role that the energy function plays in the current theory, its fundamental properties are discussed, which serve as general guidance for choosing a valid energy function. In addition, both single and multiple contacts and their evolution can be handled in a seamless way. Some symmetric properties of particle shapes can also be utilised to simplify the contact models. Within the proposed theoretical framework, different choices or combinations of geometric features as variables for the contact energy function can give rise to unique types of energy-conserving contact models with distinct characteristics and features. Two such functions using only one primary feature, which lead to two specialised energy-conserving contact models, will be presented in the subsequent papers of this series.},

Hence, a novel solution to the SMMTO problem is proposed in this paper based on the ordered SIMP method. To be specific, description of the multi-material elastic model is achieved with the ordered SIMP interpolation. More importantly, a novel ordered SIMP-like interpolation function is proposed to realize the relaxed and scaled stress interpolation, so that only a unique set of density variables are required for the SMMTO problem. Scaling of the stress measure plays a vital role in properly addressing the different yield limits. The global stress constraint is established with the p-norm function combined with the stability transformation method to close the gap between the p-norm stress and the exact maximum local stress . The adjoint sensitivity analysis is performed and the optimization problem is solved using a MMA optimizer. Several benchmark numerical examples are investigated and discussed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Thus, numerical methods based on PPE reformulations are representatives of a class of methods that have no principal limitations in achieving high order. In this paper, it is studied to what extent high-order methods for the NSE can be obtained from a specific PPE reformulation with electric boundary conditions (EBC). To that end, implicit–explicit (IMEX) time-stepping is used to decouple the pressure solve from the velocity update, while avoiding a parabolic time-step restriction; and mixed finite elements are used in space, to capture the structure imposed by the EBC. Via numerical examples, it is demonstrated that the methodology can yield at least third order accuracy in space and time.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an extension of the variational interface fracture model proposed in Khisamitov and Meschke (2018) to model fluid driven fracture in porous materials. The fluid saturated material is described by the theory of poroelasticity and the effective stress concept , while the coupling between fluid flow and fracture initiation and propagation is accomplished via a variational interface element formulation, using a damage variable c c as an additional degree of freedom in conjunction with linear momentum and mass balance equations along the interface zones. Introducing the damage variable c c , fracture propagates according to the values of the minimizers of the total potential energy expressed in terms of effective stresses. Hence, neither local crack propagation criteria nor tracking algorithms are required. Taking into account that a fracture grows quasi-statically, the discretized system of PDEs is solved by the backward Euler-scheme, ignoring the contribution from inertia forces. In the Newton–Raphson iterative solution procedure, an operator splitting algorithm is employed to solve first the poroelastic equations, and updating subsequently the damage variable c c . The proposed model for hydraulic fracturing is validated first by means of one-dimensional analytical solutions in toughness as well as in viscosity dominated regimes . The performance and the applicability of the model to simulate interactions between propagating and existing fractures is demonstrated by means of 2D and 3D numerical examples .},

  abstract     = {Enforcement of essential boundary conditions in many Galerkin meshfree methods is non-trivial due to the fact that field variables are not guaranteed to coincide with their coefficients at nodal locations. A common approach to overcome this issue is to strongly enforce the boundary conditions at these points by employing a technique to modify the approximation such that this is possible. However, with these methods, test and trial functions do not strictly satisfy the requirements of the conventional weak formulation of the problem, as the desired imposed values can actually deviate between nodes on the boundary. In this work, it is first shown that this inconsistency results in the loss of Galerkin orthogonality and the best approximation property, and correspondingly, failure to pass the patch test. It is also shown that this induces an O ( h ) O(h) error in the energy norm in the solution of second-order boundary value problems that is independent of the order of completeness in the approximation. As a result, this places a barrier on the global order of accuracy of Galerkin meshfree solutions to that of linear consistency. That is, with these methods, it is not possible to attain the higher order accuracy offered by meshfree approximations in the solution of boundary-value problems. To remedy this deficiency, two new weak forms are introduced that relax the requirements on the test and trial functions in the traditional weak formulation. These are employed in conjunction with strong enforcement of essential boundary conditions at nodes, and several benchmark problems are solved to demonstrate that optimal accuracy and convergence rates associated with the order of approximation can be restored using the proposed method. In other words, this approach allows p p -refinement, and h h -refinement with p p th order rates with strong enforcement of boundary conditions beyond linear ( p &gt; 1 p&amp;gt;1 ) for the first time. In addition, a new concept termed a a -refinement is introduced, where improved accuracy is obtained by increasing the kernel measure in meshfree approximations, previously unavailable.},

In the context of XFEM , the pore pressure is defined independently on either side of the hydro-fracture using the Heaviside enrichment function. Meanwhile, independent pressure degrees of freedom are employed to develop a generalized model for the hydro-fracture inflow. In this way, the pressure jump due to the formation of a bedding layer of settled proppants and/or additive chemicals in the vicinity of the hydro-fracture faces can be taken into account (technically referred to as the cake layer effect). On the other hand, the reduction in the hydraulic permeability of zones adjacent to those areas affected by the very high fracturing pressure , also known as filtrate effects, is taken into account through a series of experimental correlations. Finally, the ability of the developed framework to tackle the modelling of hydraulic fracturing , particularly in medium to low permeability formations, is illustrated by means of numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Some years ago, a family of large deformation continuum finite elements based on reduced integration was investigated by Reese (2005), Schwarze and Reese (2011) and Frischkorn and Reese (2015). Many structural components with different kinds of elastic and inelastic material behavior were considered and these elements showed accurate results while being more efficient than similar three-dimensional formulations based on full integration. The objective of the present contribution is to extend the analysis to non-local damage and fracture. To this end, the incorporation of the gradient-extended damage plasticity model for large deformations of Brepols et al. (2020) into the framework of reduced integration-based continuum elements is presented. For the sake of brevity, the present work is restricted to solids with only one integration (Gauss) point in the center of the element. The weak form of the formulation, which is based on a two-field variational functional closely related to the enhanced-assumed strain (EAS) method is extended by the weak form of the micromorphic balance equation. The steps required in order to transform the extended formulation into a stable, robust and efficient single Gauss point concept are described in detail. Due to the analogy to fully-coupled thermomechanical problems, the derivation of a novel micromorphic hourglass stabilization is based on earlier contributions of the research group. Therein, the Taylor series expansion of all constitutively dependent quantities plays a crucial role. Representative numerical examples of quasi-brittle and ductile fracture reveal the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach. Besides the ability to deliver mesh-independent results, the framework is especially suitable for constrained situations in which conventional low-order finite elements suffer from well-known locking phenomena .},

To this end, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties are considered within a combined fuzzy random model. The random part is modeled by the multivariate polynomial chaos expansion, whereas the fuzzy part is modeled by fuzzy variables defined as fuzzy sets. The fuzzy response for each selected α α -level is obtained from the minimum and maximum values of a quantity of interest ( QoI ). However, the QoI becomes a fuzzy random variable and depends on fuzzy variables as well as random variables. In order to avoid optimization of random variables, so-called surrogate QoIs are used, which are described by ordinary and central statistical moments. The representative examples deal with a fuzzy random analysis of a unidirectional FRC taken from the literature as well as a comparison with own experimental data for a carbon/epoxy resin FRC to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed formulation.},

This accurately satisfies no-slip wall boundary conditions at every time step without any feedback treatment. A particular contribution of the work is the introduction of a numerical model equation to analyze the body force convergence. This is useful to pre-evaluate the generated Cartesian and body-surface grids. Several benchmark aeroacoustic problems are simulated to validate the present model. Results show that the unsteady force and far-field sound directivity agree well with the previous direct numerical simulation results.

This work shows how to achieve all these features using a novel isogeometric weak formulation. Incremental rotation vectors are associated to the control points of quadratic NURBS describing the geometry. The control point vectors are used to define a novel path-independent, objective and singularity-free approximation of the rotation matrix used for the evaluation of the exact strain measure, based on an element-wise corotational system. The inter-element NURBS regularity is preserved also for the rotation. Additivity and symmetry are assured by the vector-like parameterization. Imposing constant spatial forces over each patch results in a locking-free discretization without displacement DOFs within the patch. Boundary conditions can be imposed directly without any ad hoc procedure. Accurate results are obtained using coarse meshes with reduced number of unknowns compared to displacement-based isogeometric analyses and locking-free finite elements .},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an interface stabilized method for moving and deforming interface problems in immiscible, discrete, multi-phase flows. The evolution of the interface is represented in the momentum balance equations written in an Eulerian frame via the dependence of the local value of density and viscosity of the fluids on the spatial location of the interphase boundary. The motion of the interface is tracked via a hyperbolic equation that is driven by the velocity field furnished by the Navier–Stokes equations. Zero contour of the level set field marks the boundary which is permitted to traverse through the elements. The jump in viscosity and density of the fluids across the arbitrarily deforming phase boundaries can trigger numerical instabilities in the solution. A main contribution in this work is the mathematical analysis of interface stabilization terms that appear naturally when the Variational Multiscale (VMS) method is applied to the coupled system of partial differential equations (PDEs). Two specific forms are developed: full gradient form in R n sd Rnsd over subdomain Ω I ΩI around the embedded interface, and a reduced form in R n sd − 1 Rnsd−1 for face stabilization at the embedded interface Γ I ΓI . Benchmark problems in 2D and 3D are presented to highlight the salient features of the proposed interface stabilization method and to show its range of application.},

  abstract     = {Grid generation for reservoir simulation, must honour classical key geological features and multilateral wells. The features to be honoured are classified into two groups; (1) involving layers, faults, pinchouts and fractures, and (2) involving well distributions. In the former, control-volume boundary aligned grids (BAGs) are required, while in the latter, control-point (defined as the centroid of the control-volume) well aligned grids (WAGs) are required. Depending on discretization method type and formulation, a choice of control-point and control-volume type is made, i.e. for a cell-centered method the primal grid cells act as control-volumes, otherwise for a vertex-centered method the dual-grid cells act as control-volumes. Novel three-dimensional unstructured grid generation methods are proposed that automate control-volume boundary alignment to geological features and control point alignment to complex wells, yielding essentially perpendicular bisector (PEBI) meshes either with respect to primal or dual-cells depending on grid type. Both grid types use tetrahedra, pyramids, prisms and hexahedra as grid elements. Primal-cell feature aligned grids are generated using special boundary surface protection techniques together with constrained cell-centered well trajectory alignment. Dual-cell feature aligned grids are generated from underlying primal-meshes, whereby features are protected such that dual-cell control-volume faces are aligned with interior feature boundaries, together with protected vertex-centered (control point) well trajectory alignment. The novel methods of grid generation presented enable practical application of both method types in 3-D for the first time. The primal and dual grids generated here demonstrate the gridding methods, and enable the first comparative performance study of cell-vertex versus cell-centered control-volume distributed multi-point flux approximation (CVD-MPFA) finite-volume formulations using equivalent mesh resolution on challenging problems in 3-D. Pressure fields computed by the cell-centered and vertex-centered CVD-MPFA schemes are compared and contrasted relative to the respective degrees of freedom employed, and demonstrate the relative benefits of each approximation type. Stability limits of the methods are also explored. For a given mesh the cell-vertex method uses approximately a fifth of the unknowns used by a cell-centered method and proves to be the most beneficial with respect to accuracy and efficiency. Numerical results show that vertex-centered CVD-MPFA methods outperform cell-centered CVD-MPFA method.},

The method solves stationary advection-dominated diffusion problems .We stabilize the method via residual minimization. We discretize the problem using B-spline basis functions. We then seek to minimize the isogeometric residual over a spline space built on a tensor product mesh. We construct the solution over a smooth subspace of the residual. We can specify the solution subspace by reducing the polynomial order , by increasing the continuity, or by a combination of these. The Gramm matrix for the residual minimization method is approximated by a weighted H 1 H1 norm, which we can express as Kronecker products , due to the tensor-product structure of the approximations . We use the Gramm matrix as a preconditional which can be applied in a computational cost proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in 2D and 3D. Building on these approximations, we construct an iterative algorithm . We test the residual minimization method on several numerical examples , and we compare it to the Discontinuous Petrov–Galerkin (DPG) and the Streamline Upwind Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG) stabilization methods. The iGRM method delivers similar quality solutions as the DPG method, it uses smaller grids, it does not require breaking of the spaces, but it is limited to tensor-product meshes. The computational cost of the iGRM is higher than for SUPG, but it does not require the determination of problem specific parameters.},
