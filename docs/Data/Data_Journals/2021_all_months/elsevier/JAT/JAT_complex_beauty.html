Hence, the problem of estimating the sharp constants cn(L) is transformed to the problem of estimating the extreme eigenvalues (zeros) of these Jacobi matrices (orthogonal polynomials). By applying Gershgorin’s Circle Theorem we obtain new upper bounds for the sharp constants in the Markov L2 inequalities with the Laguerre and Gegenbauer weights, and examine the asymptotic behavior of these constants as the parameters in the weights tend to infinity.},

The former requires an analysis involving the Routh–Romanovski polynomials, while the latter is based on multidimensional integral formulas for generalised hypergeometric series based on Jack polynomials.

The general model depends on many parameters. In the cases of constant and 2-periodic parameter values we show that the MVOP can be expressed in terms of scalar polynomials with non-Hermitian orthogonality on a closed contour in the complex plane. The 2-periodic hexagon tiling model with a constant parameter has a phase transition in the large size limit. This is reflected in the asymptotic behavior of the MVOP as the degree tends to infinity. The connection with the scalar orthogonal polynomials allows us to find the limiting behavior of the zeros of the determinant of the MVOP. The zeros tend to a curve Σ ˜ 0 Σ˜0 in the complex plane that has a self-intersection. The zeros of the individual entries of the MVOP show a different behavior, and we find the limiting zero distribution of the upper right entry under a geometric condition on the curve Σ ˜ 0 Σ˜0 that we were unable to prove, but which is convincingly supported by numerical evidence.},

These notions are closely related to approximation order and density order by a quasi-projection operator. To give our characterizations, we shall explain the behavior on a neighborhood of the origin of the Fourier transform of a refinable function . In particular, we invoke the classical notion of approximate continuity. We write our results in the multivariate context of Parseval wavelet frames associated to A A , an expansive linear map preserving the integer lattice .},

The resulting problem is recast in terms of a common fixed point problem and solved with a new block-iterative algorithm that features approximate projections onto the individual sets as well as an extrapolated relaxation scheme that exploits the possible presence of affine constraints.

  abstract     = {An elegant and fruitful way to bring harmonic analysis into the theory of orthogonal polynomials and special functions, or to associate certain Banach algebras with orthogonal polynomials satisfying a specific but frequently satisfied nonnegative linearization property, is the concept of a polynomial hypergroup. Polynomial hypergroups (or the underlying polynomials, respectively) are accompanied by L 1 L1 -algebras and a rich, well-developed and unified harmonic analysis . However, the individual behavior strongly depends on the underlying polynomials. We study the associated symmetric Pollaczek polynomials, which are a two-parameter generalization of the ultraspherical polynomials. Considering the associated L 1 L1 -algebras, we will provide complete characterizations of weak amenability and point amenability by specifying the corresponding parameter regions. In particular, we shall see that there is a large parameter region for which none of these amenability properties hold (which is very different to L 1 L1 -algebras of locally compact groups). Moreover, we will rule out right character amenability. The crucial underlying nonnegative linearization property will be established, too, which particularly establishes a conjecture of R. Lasser (1994). Furthermore, we shall prove Turán’s inequality for associated symmetric Pollaczek polynomials. Our strategy relies on chain sequences, asymptotic behavior , further Turán type inequalities and transformations into more convenient orthogonal polynomial systems.},

  abstract     = {We consider a new way of factorizing the transition probability matrix of a discrete-time birth–death chain on the integers by means of an absorbing and a reflecting birth–death chain to the state 0 and viceversa. First we will consider reflecting–absorbing factorizations of birth–death chains on the integers. We give conditions on the two free parameters such that each of the factors is a stochastic matrix . By inverting the order of the factors (also known as a Darboux transformation) we get new families of “almost” birth–death chains on the integers with the only difference that we have new probabilities going from the state 1 to the state − 1 −1 and viceversa. On the other hand an absorbing–reflecting factorization of birth–death chains on the integers is only possible if both factors are split into two separated birth–death chains at the state 0. Therefore it makes more sense to consider absorbing–reflecting factorizations of “almost” birth–death chains with extra transitions between the states 1 and − 1 −1 and with some conditions. This factorization is now unique and by inverting the order of the factors we get a birth–death chain on the integers. In both cases we identify the spectral matrices associated with the Darboux transformation, the first one being a Geronimus transformation and the second one a Christoffel transformation of the original spectral matrix. We also study the probabilistic implications of both transformations. Finally, we apply our results to examples of chains with constant transition probabilities .},

  abstract     = {M. Derevyagin, L. Vinet and A. Zhedanov introduced in Derevyagin et al. (2012) a new connection between orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle and the real line. It maps any real CMV matrix into a Jacobi one depending on a real parameter λ λ . In Derevyagin et al. (2012) the authors prove that this map yields a natural link between the Jacobi polynomials on the unit circle and the little and big − 1 −1 Jacobi polynomials on the real line. They also provide explicit expressions for the measure and orthogonal polynomials associated with the Jacobi matrix in terms of those related to the CMV matrix, but only for the value λ = 1 λ=1 which simplifies the connection – basic DVZ connection –. However, similar explicit expressions for an arbitrary value of λ λ – (general) DVZ connection – are missing in Derevyagin et al. (2012). This is the main problem overcome in this paper. This work introduces a new approach to the DVZ connection which formulates it as a two-dimensional eigenproblem by using known properties of CMV matrices. This allows us to go further than Derevyagin et al. (2012), providing explicit relations between the measures and orthogonal polynomials for the general DVZ connection. It turns out that this connection maps a measure on the unit circle into a rational perturbation of an even measure supported on two symmetric intervals of the real line, which reduce to a single interval for the basic DVZ connection, while the perturbation becomes a degree one polynomial. Some instances of the DVZ connection are shown to give new one-parameter families of orthogonal polynomials on the real line.},

Motivated by the recursive optimality property of Zolotarev functions (for the square root and sign functions), we investigate approximating x 1 ∕ p x1∕p by composite rational functions of the form r k ( x , r k − 1 ( x , r k − 2 ( ⋯ ( x , r 1 ( x , 1 ) ) ) ) ) rk(x,rk−1(x,rk−2(⋯(x,r1(x,1))))) . While this class of rational functions ceases to contain the minimax (best) approximant for p ≥ 3 p≥3 , we show that it achieves approximately p p th-root exponential convergence with respect to the degree. Moreover, crucially, the convergence is doubly exponential with respect to the number of degrees of freedom, suggesting that composite rational functions are able to approximate x 1 ∕ p x1∕p and related functions (such as | x | |x| and the sector function) with exceptional efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The constrained covariance (COCO) has been proposed for measuring dependence between random vectors. Kernel cross-covariance operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces , as one of kernel methods which could extract nonlinear dependence, have attracted considerable attention. This paper establishes learning rates of some estimators associated with kernel cross-covariance. For kernel cross-covariance operators, we bound a weighted summation of squared estimation errors of empirical singular functions by 16 times of the estimation error of empirical cross-covariance. Our method actually applies in general setting, so that a new bound is obtained for perturbation of singular functions of Hilbert–Schmidt operators. It is much tighter than the classical result as the latter only bounds each error of singular function individually. This is interest in its own right. For normalized cross-covariance operator, we propose an estimator and obtain a learning rate.},

  abstract     = {A class of Schrödinger-type second-order linear differential equations with a large parameter u u is considered. Analytic solutions of this type of equations can be described via (divergent) formal series in descending powers of u u . These formal series solutions are called the WKB solutions. We show that under mild conditions on the potential function of the equation, the WKB solutions are Borel summable with respect to the parameter u u in large, unbounded domains of the independent variable. It is established that the formal series expansions are the asymptotic expansions , uniform with respect to the independent variable, of the Borel re-summed solutions and we supply computable bounds on their error terms. In addition, it is proved that the WKB solutions can be expressed using factorial series in the parameter, and that these expansions converge in half-planes, uniformly with respect to the independent variable. We illustrate our theory by application to a radial Schrödinger equation associated with the problem of a rotating harmonic oscillator and to the Bessel equation.},

Such a question coincides with a 2D version of an inverse magnetic “net” moment recovery question that arises in paleomagnetism, for thin rock samples. We formulate and constructively solve a best approximation problem under constraint in L 2 L2 and in Sobolev spaces involving the restriction of the Poisson extension of the divergence of m m . Numerical results obtained from the described algorithms for the net moment approximation are also furnished.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss the compressed data separation problem. In order to reconstruct the distinct subcomponents, which are sparse in morphologically different dictionaries D 1 ∈ R n × d 1 D1∈Rn×d1 and D 2 ∈ R n × d 2 D2∈Rn×d2 , we present a general class of convex optimization decoder. It can deal with signal separation under the corruption of different kinds of noises, including Gaussian noise ( p = 2 p=2 ), Laplacian noise ( p = 1 p=1 ), and uniformly bounded noise ( p = ∞ p=∞ ). Although the restricted isometry property adapted to frames is a commonly used tool, the measurement number is suboptimal when p &gt; 2 p&amp;gt;2 . Furthermore, the ℓ p ℓp robust nullspace property adapted to Ψ Ψ , which is constructed by D 1 D1 and D 2 D2 , may fail to work on data separation problem. Here we introduce the modified ℓ p ℓp robust nullspace property adapted to Ψ Ψ (abbreviated as the modified ( ℓ p ℓp , Ψ Ψ )-RNSP). First of all, we show the robust recovery of signals based on the modified ( ℓ p ℓp , Ψ Ψ )-RNSP and the mutual coherence between D 1 D1 and D 2 D2 . Besides, we find that Gaussian measurements meet the modified ( ℓ p ℓp , Ψ Ψ )-RNSP for any 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ 1≤p≤∞ , provided with the optimal number of measurements O ( s log ( d ∕ s ) ) O(slog(d∕s)) , where s s is the sparsity level and d = d 1 + d 2 d=d1+d2 . Furthermore, we introduce another properly constrained ℓ 1 ℓ1 -analysis optimization model, called the Split Dantzig Selector. It can recover signals which are approximately sparse in terms of different frame representations, when the measurement matrix satisfies the modified ( ℓ p ℓp , Ψ Ψ )-RNSP. As a special case, when considering Gaussian white noise, the recovery error by the Split Dantzig Selector is O s log d m Oslogdm . It outperforms the ℓ 2 ℓ2 -constrained model, whose recovery error is O ( log m ) O(logm) , if the sparsity level is small.},

On the other hand, we give a learning rate of distribution regression problem under the coefficient regularization scheme by using similar operator methods.

  abstract     = {Kernel based methods provide a way to reconstruct potentially high-dimensional functions from meshfree samples, i.e., sampling points and corresponding target values. A crucial ingredient for this to be successful is the distribution of the sampling points. Since the computation of an optimal selection of sampling points may be an infeasible task, one promising option is to use greedy methods. Although these methods may be very effective, depending on the specific greedy criterion the chosen points might quickly lead to instabilities in the computation. To circumvent this problem, we introduce and investigate a new class of stabilized greedy kernel algorithms, which can be used to create a scale of new selection strategies. We analyze these algorithms, and in particular we prove convergence results and quantify in a precise way the distribution of the selected points. These results allow to prove, in the case of certain Sobolev kernels, that the algorithms have optimal stability and optimal convergence rates, including for functions outside the native space of the kernel. The results also apply to the case of the usual P P -greedy algorithm, significantly improving state-of-the-art results available in the literature. Illustrative experiments are presented that support the theoretical findings and show improvements of the stabilized algorithms in terms of accuracy due to improved stability.},
