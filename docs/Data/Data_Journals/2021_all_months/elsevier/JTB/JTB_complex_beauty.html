  abstract     = {With an increasingly elderly population globally, the impacts of cerebrovascular diseases, such as stroke and dementia, become increasingly significant. Haemorrhagic transformation (HT) is one of the most common complications of ischaemic stroke that is caused by dysfunction of endothelial cells in the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and that can be exacerbated by thrombolytic therapy. Recent studies also suggest that HT can lead to an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) and result in capillary compression. The aim of this study is to develop a mathematical model that can be used to simulate the consequence of HT over a range of vasculature length scales. We use a 2D vasculature model to investigate the severity of HT with different vascular geometry. The resulting model shows that the haematoma radius is approximately constant across different length scales ( 100 - 1000 μ m 100-1000μm ) and in good agreement with the available experimental data. In addition, this study identified that the effects of capillary compression do appear to have a significant impact on the leakage fraction of blood and hence act to restrain the development of a haematoma.},

Essential genes seem to be more conservative and are usually responsible for basic functions, for instance, genetic information flow or energy production. Despite persistent advances in experimental methods, computer predictions may constitute an important part of this investigation. Firstly, they may embrace a huge amount of data and provide some characteristic patterns. Furthermore, they enable scientists to build models for predicting essential genes which are not yet verified experimentally. Some papers indicate interesting dependencies within essential genes sequences using different computer models. In this paper, an author took a three-step analysis for a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of essential and non-essential genes. Beginning from a simple nucleotide composition and finishing at long-range correlations, presents some characteristic patterns that are expected to be developed in future studies.},

  abstract     = {Colonization of the water column by animals occurred gradually during the early Palaeozoic. However, the morphological and functional changes that took place during this colonization are poorly understood. The fossil record provides clear evidence of animals that were well adapted for swimming near the seafloor or in the open ocean, but recognising transitional forms is more problematic. Trilobites are a good model to explore the colonization of marine ecosystems . Here, we use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to test between competing functional hypotheses in the Ordovician trilobite Placoparia . The CFD simulations exhibits hydrodynamics that promote detachment from the seafloor but also promote return to the seafloor following detachment, this is compatible with hopping locomotion. The results suggest that Placopara was not able to swim, but its hydrodynamics allowed it to hop long distances. This is consistent with the fossil record, as some ichnofossils show evidence of hopping. This type of locomotion could be useful to avoid predators as an escape mechanism. In addition, CFD simulation shows how the morphology of Placoparia is adapted to protect anterior appendices of the trunk and generate a ventral vortex that send food particles directly to the trilobite mouth. Adaptations in Placoparia allowed the first steps to evolved a new ecological habitat and consequently nektonization during the GOBE.},

When an epidemic disease is spreading, it is very urgent and essential to build a prediction and control model based on the real-time and partial data in order that decision makers find and implement the optimal strategy timely. In this paper, we developed a new framework for solving the problem. Our nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) based on a discrete time susceptible-infected-removed dynamics ( SIR ) gave an attempt that aims at timely dealing with the condition. Our NMPC model minimizes the total number of infectious cases and the total cost, with the treatment beds capacity constraints and other constraints, especially, with a state observer based on the system output which can be sampled more easily and more accurately. Our control policy can be updated timely according to the current statistical data because our NMPC is a kind of closed-loop control algorithm based on our observer. We also presented some theoretical results on the state observer. Finally, we gave a numerical example to illustrate our algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Is population-level heterogeneity a reflection of distinct subpopulations, exhibiting different metabolic functions, or dynamic metabolism of individuals within the population? This fascinating question has remained a subject of great interest in studying metabolic specialization in microorganisms. The Crabtree effect – i.e., the ability of some microorganisms to switch from respiration to fermentation in the presence of oxygen - is an appropriate case study to address the aforementioned question. Game-theoretical approaches have been routinely used to examine and explain the way a microorganism, such as yeast, would switch between the two ATP-producing pathways, i.e., respiration and fermentation. Here we attempt to explain the switch between respiration and fermentation in yeast by constructing a simple metabolic switch. We then utilize an individual-based model, in which each individual is equipped with all the relevant chemical reactions, to see how cells equipped with such metabolic switch would behave in different conditions. We further investigate our proposed metabolic switch using the game-theoretical approach. Based on this model, we postulate that the population-level metabolic heterogeneity in microorganisms can simply arise from individuals utilizing a mixed strategy.},

The adaptive immune system’s humoral response creates plasma B cells and memory B cells, each with their own immunological objectives. The affinity maturation process is widely viewed as a heuristic to solve the global optimization problem of finding B cells with high affinity to the antigen. However, memory B cells appear to be purposely selected earlier in the affinity maturation process and have lower affinity. We propose that this memory B cell selection process may be an approximate solution to two optimization problems: optimizing for affinity to similar antigens in the future despite mutations or other minor differences, and optimizing to warm start the generation of plasma B cells in the future. We use simulations to provide evidence for our hypotheses, taking into account data showing that certain B cell mutations are more likely than others. Our findings are consistent with memory B cells having high-affinity to mutated antigens, but do not provide strong evidence that memory B cells will be more useful than selected naive B cells for seeding the secondary germinal centers.},

  abstract     = {For nearly three decades, spatial games have produced a wealth of insights to the study of behavior and its relation to population structure. However, as different rules and factors are added or altered, the dynamics of spatial models often become increasingly complicated to interpret. To tackle this problem, we introduce persistent homology as a rigorous framework that can be used to both define and compute higher-order features of data in a manner which is invariant to parameter choices, robust to noise, and independent of human observation. Our work demonstrates its relevance for spatial games by showing how topological features of simulation data that persist over different spatial scales reflect the stability of strategies in 2D lattice games. To do so, we analyze the persistent homology of scenarios from two games: a Prisoner’s Dilemma and a SIRS epidemic model. The experimental results show how the method accurately detects features that correspond to real aspects of the game dynamics. Unlike other tools that study dynamics of spatial systems, persistent homology can tell us something meaningful about population structure while remaining neutral about the underlying structure itself. Regardless of game complexity, since strategies either succeed or fail to conform to shapes of a certain topology there is much potential for the method to provide novel insights for a wide variety of spatially extended systems in biology, social science, and physics.},

This paper uses geometry to show that, holding order and richness constant, the families of divergence-based evenness measures nest. This property allows them to be ranked based on their reactivity to changes in relatively even assemblages or changes in relatively uneven ones. We establish this ranking and explore how the distance-based measures relate to it for both order q = 2 and q = 1. We also derive a new family of distance-based measures that captures the angular distance between the vector of relative abundances and a perfectly even vector and is highly reactive to changes in even assemblages. Finally, we show that if we only require evenness to be a divergence, then any smooth, monotonically increasing function of diversity can be made into an evenness measure. A deeper understanding of how to measure evenness will require empirical or theoretical research that uncovers which kind of divergence best reflects the underlying concept.},

Turing patterns constitute a main candidate to explain such processes, but they appear sensitive to fluctuations and variations in kinetic parameters, raising the question of how they may be adopted and realised in naturally evolved systems. The vast majority of mathematical studies of Turing patterns have used continuous models specified in terms of partial differential equations. Here, we complement this work by studying Turing patterns using discrete cellular automata models. We perform a large-scale study on all possible two-species networks and find the same Turing pattern producing networks as in the continuous framework. In contrast to continuous models, however, we find these Turing pattern topologies to be substantially more robust to changes in the parameters of the model. We also find that diffusion-driven instabilities are substantially weaker predictors for Turing patterns in our discrete modelling framework in comparison to the continuous case, in the sense that the presence of an instability does not guarantee a pattern emerging in simulations. We show that a more refined criterion constitutes a stronger predictor. The similarity of the results for the two modelling frameworks suggests a deeper underlying principle of Turing mechanisms in nature. Together with the larger robustness in the discrete case this suggests that Turing patterns may be more robust than previously thought.},

By anticipating the evolutionary response of the pathogen we may develop effective long-term management strategies for controlling the impact of the endemic on the society. To that end, we use standard Adaptive Dynamics techniques in an SIS model. The recovery rate and the transmission rate, both of which can be affected by healthcare interventions, are used as evolutionary control variables. The effect of interventions may be density-independent (self-help based on healthcare instructions) or density-dependent (when assistance of a healthcare worker is required). We consider the evolutionary response of the pathogen both to abrupt changes and to gradual changes in the level of healthcare intervention. Healthcare intervention is optimised for three alternative objectives: minimisation of virulence, minimisation of the probability that an infected individual dies of the disease, and total eradication of the endemic. We find that the optimal strategy may depend on the objective. High levels of healthcare intervention may eradicate the pathogen, but this option may not be available for budgetary reasons or otherwise. Counterintuitively, to minimise virulence, one should keep healthcare interventions at a minimum, while to minimise the probability for an infected individual to die of the disease, both low and high levels of healthcare intervention suffice. Changes in the level of healthcare intervention should be implemented fast (not gradually) in order to avoid sudden changes in pathogen evolution and the possible emergence of multiple simultaneously coexisting pathogen strains.},

  abstract     = {Butterfly wing color patterns are a representative model system for studying biological pattern formation, due to their two-dimensional simple structural and high inter- and intra-specific variabilities. Moreover, butterfly color patterns have demonstrated roles in mate choice, thermoregulation, and predator avoidance via disruptive coloration, attack deflection, aposematism, mimicry, and masquerade. Because of the importance of color patterns to many aspects of butterfly biology and their apparent tractability for study, color patterns have been the subjects of many attempts to model their development. Early attempts focused on generalized mechanisms of pattern formation such as reaction-diffusion, diffusion gradient, lateral inhibition, and threshold responses, without reference to any specific gene products. As candidate genes with expression patterns that resembled incipient color patterns were identified, genetic regulatory networks were proposed for color pattern formation based on gene functions inferred from other insects with wings, such as Drosophila . Particularly detailed networks incorporating the gene products, Distal-less (Dll), Engrailed (En), Hedgehog (Hh), Cubitus interruptus (Ci), Transforming growth factor- β β (TGF- β β ), and Wingless (Wg), have been proposed for butterfly border ocelli (eyespots) which helps the investigation of the formation of these patterns. Thus, in this work, we develop a mathematical model including the gene products En, Hh, Ci, TGF- β β , and Wg to mimic and investigate the eyespot formation in butterflies . Our simulations show that the level of En has peaks in the inner and outer rings and the level of Ci has peaks in the inner and middle rings. The interactions among these peaks activate cells to produce white, black, and yellow pigments in the inner, middle, and outer rings, respectively, which captures the eyespot pattern of wild type Bicyclus anynana butterflies. Additionally, our simulations suggest that lack of En generates a single black spot and lack of Hh or Ci generates a single white spot, and a deficiency of TGF- β β or Wg will cause the loss of the outer yellow ring. These deficient patterns are similar to those observed in the eyespots of Vanessa atalanta , Vanessa altissima , and Chlosyne nycteis . Thus, our model also provides a hypothesis to explain the mechanism of generating the deficient patterns in these species.},

  abstract     = {We model the population dynamics of two host species attacked by a common parasitoid using a discrete-time formalism that captures their population densities from year to year. It is well known starting from the seminal work of Nicholson and Bailey that a constant parasitoid attack rate leads to an unstable host-parasitoid interaction. However, a Type III functional response, where the parasitoid attack rate accelerates with increasing host density stabilizes the population dynamics. We first consider a scenario where both host species are attacked by a parasitoid with the same Type III functional response. Our results show that sufficient fast acceleration of the parasitoid attack rate stabilizes the population dynamics of all three species. For two symmetric host species, the extent of acceleration needed to stabilize the three-species equilibrium is exactly the same as that needed for a single host-parasitoid interaction. However, asymmetry can lead to scenarios where the removal of a host species from a stable interaction destabilizes the interaction between the remaining host species and the parasitoid. Next, we consider a situation where one of the host species is attacked at a constant rate (i.e., Type I functional response), and the other species is attacked via a Type III functional response. We identify parameter regimes where a Type III functional response to just one of the host species stabilizes the three species interaction. In summary, our results show that a generalist parasitoid with a Type III functional response to one or many host species can play a key role in stabilizing population dynamics of host-parasitoid communities in apparent competition.},

Several virus strains are co-circulating and the differences in their characteristics and avian pathogenesis levels are still unknown. In this study, we use within–host mathematical models to characterize the mechanisms responsible for virus expansion and clearance in juvenile chickens challenged with four Usutu virus strains. We find heterogeneity between the virus strains, with the time between cell infection and viral production varying between 16 h and 23 h, the infected cell lifespan varying between 48 min and 9.5 h, and the basic reproductive number R 0 R0 varying between 12.05 and 19.49. The strains with high basic reproductive number have short infected cell lifespan, indicative of immune responses. The virus strains with low basic reproductive number have lower viral peaks and longer lasting viremia, due to lower infection rates and high infected cell lifespan. We discuss how the host and virus heterogeneities may differently impact the public health threat presented by these virus strains.},

  abstract     = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV -2), a causative agent of COVID-19 disease, poses a significant threat to public health. Since its outbreak in December 2019, Wuhan, China, extensive collection of diverse data from cell culture and animal infections as well as population level data from an ongoing pandemic, has been vital in assessing strategies to battle its spread. Mathematical modelling plays a key role in quantifying determinants that drive virus infection dynamics, especially those relevant for epidemiological investigations and predictions as well as for proposing efficient mitigation strategies. We utilized a simple mathematical model to describe and explain experimental results on viral replication cycle kinetics during SARS-CoV-2 infection of animal and human derived cell lines, green monkey kidney cells , Vero-E6, and human lung epithelium cells, A549-ACE2, respectively. We conducted cell infections using two distinct initial viral concentrations and quantified viral loads over time. We then fitted the model to our experimental data and quantified the viral parameters. We showed that such cellular tropism generates significant differences in the infection rates and incubation times of SARS-CoV-2, that is, the times to the first release of newly synthesised viral progeny by SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Specifically, the rate at which A549-ACE2 cells were infected by SARS-CoV-2 was 15 times lower than that in the case of Vero-E6 cell infection and the duration of latent phase of A549-ACE2 cells was 1.6 times longer than that of Vero-E6 cells. On the other hand, we found no statistically significant differences in other viral parameters, such as viral production rate or infected cell death rate. Since in vitro infection assays represent the first stage in the development of antiviral treatments against SARS-CoV-2, discrepancies in the viral parameter values across different cell hosts have to be identified and quantified to better target vaccine and antiviral research.},

However, the COVID-19 vaccination programme will be the biggest in history. Reaching herd immunity will require an unprecedented mass immunisation campaign that will take several months and millions of dollars. Using different network models, COVID-19 pandemic dynamics of different countries can be recapitulated such as in Italy. Stochastic computational simulations highlight that peak epidemic sizes in a population strongly depend on the network structure. Assuming a vaccine efficacy of at least 80\% 80\% in a mass vaccination program, at least 70\% 70\% of a given population should be vaccinated to obtain herd immunity, independently of the network structure. If the vaccine efficacy reports lower levels of efficacy in practice, then the coverage of vaccination would be needed to be even higher. Simulations suggest that the “Ring of Vaccination” strategy, vaccinating susceptible contact and contact of contacts, would prevent new waves of COVID −19 meanwhile a high percent of the population is vaccinated.},

  abstract     = {We develop new equations for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of populations and their traits. These equations resolve the change in the phenotypic differentiation within a population, which better estimates how the variance of the trait distribution changes. We note that traits may be bounded, assume they may be described by beta distributions with small variances, and develop a coupled ordinary differential equation system to describe the dynamics of the total population, the mean trait value, and a measure of phenotype differentiation. The variance of the trait in the population is calculated from its mean and the population’s phenotype differentiation. We consider an example of two competing plant populations to demonstrate the efficacy of the new approach. Each population may trade-off its growth rate against its susceptibility to direct competition from the other population. We create two models of this system: a population model based on our new eco-evolutionary equations; and a phenotype model, in which the growth or demise of each fraction of each population with a defined phenotype is simulated as it interacts with a shared limiting resource and its competing phenotypes and populations. Comparison of four simulation scenarios reveals excellent agreement between the predicted quantities from both models: total populations, the average trait values, the trait variances, and the degree of phenotypic differentiation within each population. In each of the four scenarios simulated, three of which are initially subject to competitive exclusion in the absence of evolution, the populations adapt to coexist. One population maximises growth and dominates, while the other minimises competitive losses. These simulations suggest that our new eco-evolutionary equations may provide an excellent approximation to phenotype changes in populations.},

  abstract     = {Realistic fitness landscapes generally display a redundancy-fitness trade-off: highly fit trait configurations are inevitably rare, while less fit trait configurations are expected to be more redundant. The resulting sub-optimal patterns in the fitness distribution are typically described by means of effective formulations, where redundancy provided by the presence of neutral contributions is modelled implicitly, e . g . with a bias of the mutation process. However, the extent to which effective formulations are compatible with explicitly redundant landscapes is yet to be understood, as well as the consequences of a potential miss-match. Here we investigate the effects of such trade-off on the evolution of phenotype-structured populations, characterised by continuous quantitative traits. We consider a typical replication-mutation dynamics, and we model redundancy by means of two dimensional landscapes displaying both selective and neutral traits. We show that asymmetries of the landscapes will generate neutral contributions to the marginalised fitness-level description, that cannot be described by effective formulations, nor disentangled by the full trait distribution. Rather, they appear as effective sources, whose magnitude depends on the geometry of the landscape. Our results highlight new important aspects on the nature of sub-optimality. We discuss practical implications for rapidly mutant populations such as pathogens and cancer cells, where the qualitative knowledge of their trait and fitness distributions can drive disease management and intervention policies.},

We propose and compare the performance of various measures of network structure as potential EWS indicators of epidemics and changes in population vaccine opinion. We construct a multiplex model coupling transmission of a vaccine-preventable childhood infectious disease and social dynamics concerning vaccine opinion. We find that the modularity of pro- and anti-vaccine network communities perform well as EWS, as do several measures of the number and size of opinion-based communities, and the size of pro-vaccine echo chambers. The number of opinion changes also gives early warnings, although the clustering coefficient and metrics concerning anti-vaccine echo chambers provide little warning. Stronger social norms are found to compromise the ability of all EWS metrics to provide advance warning. These exploratory results suggest that EWS indicators based on the network structure of online social media communities might assist public health preparedness by providing early warning of potential regime shifts.},

  abstract     = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a key role in determining ecosystem functionality. Understanding how diversity in the fungal community affects plant productivity is therefore an important question in ecology. Current research has focused on understanding the role of functional complementarity in the fungal community when the host plant faces multiple stress factors. Fewer studies, however, have investigated how variation in traits affecting nutrient exchange can impact the plant growth dynamics, even in the absence of environmental stressors. Combining experimental data and a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations, we investigate the role played by carbon sink strength on plant productivity. We simulate and measure plant growth over time when the plant is associated with two fungal isolates with different carbon sink strength, and when the plant is in pairwise association with each of the isolates alone. Overall, our theoretical as well as our experimental results show that co-inoculation with fungi with different carbon sink strength can induce positive non-additive effects (or synergistic effects) in plant productivity. Fungi with high carbon sink strength are able to quickly establish a fungal community and increase the nutrient supply to the plant, with a consequent positive impact on plant growth rate. On the other side, fungi with low carbon sink strength inflict lower carbon costs to the host plant, and support maximal plant productivity once plant biomass is large. As AM fungi are widely used as organic fertilizers worldwide, our findings have important implications for restoration ecology and agricultural management .},

Of particular interest are genomic elements Inverse Repeats (IRs), which maintain genome stability, regulate gene expressions, and are the targets of mutations. However, little research attention is given to the IR content analysis in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. In this study, we propose a geometric analysis method and using the method to investigate the distributions of IRs in SARS-CoV-2 and its related coronavirus genomes. The method represents each genomic IR sequence pair as a single point and constructs the geometric shape of the genome using the IRs. Thus, the IR shape can be considered as the signature of the genome. The genomes of different coronaviruses are then compared using the constructed IR shapes. The results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 genome, specifically, has an abundance of IRs, and the IRs in coronavirus genomes show an increase during evolution events.},

Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) measure the glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid of the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, glucose measured in the abdominal interstitial fluid does not represent blood glucose concentrations accurately due to the complex blood transport through the body and glucose diffusion in interstitial fluid. To gain insight into this problem, a phenomenological-based semiphysical model (PBSM) of glucose transport by volumetric flow and diffusion from the bloodstream to interstitial fluid was constructed. A published 10-step modeling procedure was used to obtain a model for glucose transport time through the blood vessels and from the blood capillaries to the interstitial fluid, glucose diffusion within the interstitial fluid, and glucose diffusion through the semipermeable coating of the sensor needle. For this model, a healthy person is considered at rest with average parameters. The simulations performed using the PBSM allow obtaining the glucose transport time from the liver to the sensor needle. In this way, it is possible to reconstruct an accurate dynamic measurement of blood glucose from the measurements in the interstitial fluid of the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. PBSMs with parameters interpretability illustrate the connection of glucose concentrations in the interstitial fluid with that currently in the blood. Implementing this model in a CGM will result in more reliable measurements of blood glucose levels for T1DM treatment.},

Herein, by employing Waddington’s landscape theory and bifurcation analysis, we demonstrate that Mushroom and Isola bifurcations can be realized with four minimal network motifs that are constituted by combining a positive feedback motif with various incoherent feed-forward loops. Our study reveals that the intrinsic bi-stable dynamics originating from the positive feedback motif can be fine-tuned by altering the extent of the incoherence of these minimal networks to produce these complex bifurcations. These modeling insights will be useful in identifying the possible network motifs that may give rise to either Mushroom or Isola bifurcation in other biological systems.},

  abstract     = {The sterile insect technique (SIT) involves periodically releasing artificially sterilized insects to inhibit normal mating between wild insect pests , ultimately resulting in the eradication of wild pest populations. It has often been discussed whether releasing either one sex, mainly males, of sterile insects (i.e., a unisexual release) can enhance the pest-control effect of the SIT more than releasing both sexes (i.e., a bisexual release). We constructed a mathematical model to examine the contribution of sterile males and females to the pest-control effect and the synergy between them. We consider that males seek out and court females in accord with their own female searching ability and preference, and that females subsequently choose one male from among males courting them in accordance with their own preference. Using this model, we compared the pest-control effect of bisexual and unisexual release, focusing on the difference in mating systems of the targeted insects. We showed that for swarm-type mating systems (with few courtship chances with higher encounter rates), bisexual release was the most effective, irrespective of the relative female searching ability between wild and sterile males. In this case, sterile females indirectly reduce wild females mating with either male by absorbing courtship from both wild and sterile males. By contrast, bisexual release is the most effective for scramble-type mating systems (more courtship chances with lower encounter rates) only when the female searching ability of sterile males is lower than that of wild males. In this case, sterile females absorb courtship from males with higher searching abilities. Therefore, the net impact of sterile females depends on the difference in sexual performance between wild and sterile males. Because the sexual performance of sterile insects is often degraded during the process of sterilization, we suggest that bisexual release can be a compatible measure to efficiently suppress wild pest populations.},

  abstract     = {One of the most important questions in cell biology is how cell fate is determined when exposed to extreme stresses such as heat shock. It has been long understood that organisms exposed to high temperature stresses typically protect themselves with a heat shock response (HSR), where accumulation of denatured or unfolded proteins triggers the synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs) through the heat shock transcription factor, e.g. , heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). In this study, a dynamical model validated with experiments is presented to analyse the role of HSF1 SUMOylation in response to heat shock. Key features of this model are inclusion of heat shock response and SUMOylation of HSF1, and HSP synthesis at molecular level, describing the dynamical evolution of the key variables involved in the regulation of HSPs. The model has been employed to predict the SUMOylation levels of HSF1 with different external temperature stimuli. The results show that the SUMOylated HSF1 levels agree closely with the experimental findings. This demonstrates the validity of this nonlinear dynamic model for the important role of SUMOylation in response to heat shock.},

  abstract     = {A viral strain may infect a host, proliferate rapidly, become controlled by immune reactions, and eventually be eliminated from the body. The virulence, or the magnitude of harm to the host due to infection, depends on the abundance and duration of the viral strain in the body, and the importance of the damaged tissue of the host. In this study, we investigated how the cumulative viral load (time-integral of the number of infected cells) depends on various factors, such as the viral growth rate, the effectiveness of immune cells to kill infected cells, speed of immune activation, formation of memory cells, and longevity of immune cells. In addition, viruses may produce a mutant with different antigen types, escape the immune reaction targeting the original type, and inflate virulence. We succeeded in deriving simple and explicit formulas of the virulence in four different parameter regions. We found that, in some parameter region, enhancing memory cells is very effective in suppressing virulence, but direct activation of immune effector cells is not effective; while the opposite is the case in other regions. The result could be important in designing drug suppressing virus effectively. Additionally, we discussed the reported correlation between virulence and molecular evolution rate.},

  abstract     = {Against the COVID-19 pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions have been widely applied and vaccinations have taken off. The upcoming question is how the interplay between vaccinations and social measures will shape infections and hospitalizations. Hence, we extend the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model including these elements. We calibrate it to data of Luxembourg, Austria and Sweden until 15 December 2020. Sweden results having the highest fraction of undetected, Luxembourg of infected and all three being far from herd immunity in December. We quantify the level of social interaction, showing that a level around 1/3 of before the pandemic was still required in December to keep the effective reproduction number R eff t Refft below 1, for all three countries. Aiming to vaccinate the whole population within 1 year at constant rate would require on average 1,700 fully vaccinated people/day in Luxembourg, 24,000 in Austria and 28,000 in Sweden, and could lead to herd immunity only by mid summer. Herd immunity might not be reached in 2021 if too slow vaccines rollout speeds are employed. The model thus estimates which vaccination rates are too low to allow reaching herd immunity in 2021, depending on social interactions. Vaccination will considerably, but not immediately, help to curb the infection; thus limiting social interactions remains crucial for the months to come.},

We model a stand-off between a predator and a prey when the prey is hiding and the predator is waiting for the prey to come out from its refuge, or when the two are locked in a situation of mutual threat of injury or even death. The stand-off is resolved when the predator gives up or when the prey tries to escape. Instead of using the asymmetric war of attrition, we embed the stand-off as an integral part of the predator–prey model of Rosenzweig and MacArthur derived from first principles. We apply this model to study the coevolution of the giving-up rates of the prey and the predator, using the adaptive dynamics approach. We find that the long term evolutionary process leads to three qualitatively different scenarios: the predator gives up immediately, while the prey never gives up; the predator never gives up, while the prey adopts any giving-up rate greater than or equal to a given positive threshold value; the predator goes extinct. We observe that some results are the same as for the asymmetric war of attrition, but others are quite different.},

We study two alternative classes of nonlocal competition that differ in how each species’ characteristics determine the range of the nonlocal interactions. In both cases, nonlocal interactions can create spatial patterns of population densities in which highly populated clumps alternate with unpopulated regions. These non-populated regions provide spatial niches for a weaker competitor to establish in the community and persist in conditions in which local models predict competitive exclusion. Moreover, depending on the balance between local and nonlocal competition intensity, the clumps of the weaker competitor vary from M-like structures with higher densities of individuals accumulating at the edges of each clump to triangular structures with most individuals occupying their centers. These results suggest that long-range competition, through the creation of spatial patterns in population densities, might be a key driving force behind the rich diversity of species observed in natural ecological communities.},

We begin by analysing two well-known mechanosensory systems, the MeD1 spider trichobothria and the cricket cercal hair, offering a systematic appraisal of the physics of mechanosensory hair motion. Then we explore the biologically relevant parameter space of mechanoreceptor hairs by varying each oscillator parameter, thereby extending the theory to general arthropods. In doing so, we readily identify combinations of parameters for which a hair shows an enhanced or distinct response to either electric or aerodynamic stimuli. Overall, we find distinct behaviours in the two systems with novel insight provided through the parameter-space analysis. We show how the parameter space and balance of parameters therein of the resonant spider system are organised to produce a highly tuneable hair system through variation of hair length, whilst the broader parameter space of the non-resonant cricket system responds equally to a wider range of driving frequencies with increased capacity for high temporal resolution. From our analysis, we hypothesise the existence of two distinct types of mechanoreceptive system: the general system where hairs of all lengths are poised to detect both electro- and acousto- stimuli, and a stimuli-specific system where the sensitivity and specificity of the hairs to the different stimuli changes with length.},

However, some studies have shown that the kin competition due to the altruism among relatives can reduce, and even totally negate, the kin-selected benefits of altruism toward relatives. In order to understand how the evolution of cooperation is influenced by both kin selection and kin competition under a general theoretical framework, we here consider the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation in a finite kin population, where kin competition is incorporated into a simple Prisoner’s Dilemma game between relatives. Differently from the previous studies, we emphasize that the difference between the effects of mutually and unilaterally altruistic acts on kin competition may play an important role for the evolution of cooperation. The main results not only show the conditions that Hamilton’s rule still works under the kin competition but also reveal the evolutionary biological mechanism driving the evolution of cooperation in a finite kin population.},

  abstract     = {One of the key epidemiological characteristics that shape the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the serial interval (SI). Although SI is commonly considered following a probability distribution at a population scale, recent studies reported a slight shrinkage (or contraction) of the mean of effective SI across transmission generations or over time. Here, we develop a likelihood-based statistical inference framework with truncation to explore the change in SI across transmission generations after adjusting the impacts of case isolation. The COVID-19 contact tracing surveillance data in Hong Kong are used for exemplification. We find that for COVID-19, the mean of individual SI is likely to shrink with a factor at 0.72 per generation (95\%CI: 0.54, 0.96) as the transmission generation increases, where a threshold may exist as the lower boundary of this shrinking process. We speculate that one of the probable explanations for the shrinkage in SI might be an outcome due to the competition among multiple candidate infectors within the same case cluster. Thus, the nonpharmaceutical interventive strategies are crucially important to block the transmission chains, and mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic.},

  abstract     = {The tragedy of the commons (TOC) has been well known since it was proposed and has been widely applied not only to human society but also to many taxa. An increasing number of studies have focused on TOC in belowground competition in plants. In the presence of neighbors, plants overproduce roots to acquire more nutrients than their competitors, resulting in a reduction in reproductive yield. Game-theoretic studies on TOC in plants usually consider the amount of root biomass as a strategy and do not consider the growth of plants. However, root volume is considered an outcome of the decision-making of plants on whether they allocate more resources to the root. In this study, we incorporated resource allocation and growth dynamics into the TOC game in plants and explored the evolutionarily stable resource allocation strategy in the presence of neighbors. We demonstrated that TOC generally occurs when fitness per individual is always reduced because of the competitive response. However, the overproliferation of roots, which is emphasized as an indicator of TOC, did not necessarily occur, or was sometimes difficult to detect when fitness is largely or completely determined by root biomass. This result suggests the importance of careful observation for examining whether plant species engage in a TOC game},

  abstract     = {In natural forests at a demographic equilibrium state, the size frequency distribution (SFD) of trees is linked with their size-dependent growth and mortality rates. While the mean growth rate (MGR) of each size class is generally used for determining the SFD, the variance in the growth rate (VGR) has always been ignored. Here, based on the analyses with Kolmogorov forward equation, we show that in general, the VGR can flatten the slope of the SFD and, in particular, can address the contradiction between the size-dependent MGR and the −2 power-law SFD in the metabolic scaling theory. We traced the origin of the VGR to the intrinsic stochasticity in the allometric growth coefficients of trees and deduced its functional form based on variance propagation. Using the forest censuses data from Barro Colorado Island, we verified the prediction of the VGR and indicated its indispensability in the theory of forest size-structure formation.},

  abstract     = {Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal indirectly characterizes neuronal activity by measuring hemodynamic and metabolic changes in the nearby microvasculature. A deeper understanding of how localized changes in electrical, metabolic and hemodynamic factors translate into a BOLD signal is crucial for the interpretation of functional brain imaging techniques. While positive BOLD responses (PBR) are widely considered to be linked with neuronal activation, the origins of negative BOLD responses (NBR) have remained largely unknown. As NBRs are sometimes observed in close proximity of regions with PBR, a blood “stealing” effect, i.e., redirection of blood from a passive periphery to the area with high neuronal activity, has been postulated. In this study, we used the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to model hemodynamics in an idealized microvascular network that account for the particulate nature of blood and nonlinearities arising from the red blood cell (RBC) distribution (i.e., the Fåhraeus, Fåhraeus-Lindqvist and the phase separation effects). Using this detailed model, we evaluate determinants driving this “stealing” effect in a microvascular network with geometric parameters within physiological ranges. Model simulations predict that during localized cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases due to neuronal activation—hyperemic response, blood from surrounding vessels is reallocated towards the activated region. This stealing effect depended on the resistance of the microvasculature and the uneven distribution of RBCs at vessel bifurcations. A parsimonious model consisting of two-connected windkessel regions sharing a supplying artery was proposed to simulate the stealing effect with a minimum number of parameters. Comparison with the detailed model showed that the parsimonious model can reproduce the observed response for hematocrit values within the physiological range for different species. Our novel parsimonious model promise to be of use for statistical inference (top-down analysis) from direct blood flow measurements (e.g., arterial spin labeling and laser Doppler/Speckle flowmetry), and when combined with theoretical models for oxygen extraction/diffusion will help account for some types of NBRs.},

  abstract     = {Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory cardiovascular disease in which arteries harden through the build-up of plaques. This work is devoted to the mathematical modeling and analysis of the inflammatory process of atherosclerosis. We propose a mathematical model formed by three coupled partial differential equations of reaction-diffusion type. We take into account three key-role players: the inflammatory immune cells, the inflammatory cytokines and the oxidized low density lipoproteins. A stability analysis of the kinetic system is performed. It leads to the presence of three stable fixed points relevant to appropriate biological states of atherogenesis; no inflammation, stabilized inflammation (stable plaque) and advanced inflammation (vulnerable plaque). The cases that may occur are subject to the variation of the parameters values. A detailed discussion showing how the model fits the biological phenomena is then established. We investigate as well the existence of solutions of traveling waves type along with numerical simulations that show the wave propagation in different cases. This shows that the inflammatory process propagates inside the intima as a traveling wave. Then, we consider the effect of high density lipoprotein (HDL) on the atherosclerotic plaque formation. To do that, we elaborate a map that determines the level of risk of plaque formation with respect to the prevalence of HDL in the blood. These results confirm but also generalize previous results published in the literature. They also give a deeper understanding to the propagation of the inflammation inside the artery in terms of the interplay among the different main players in the whole process.},

By analyzing a culled protein dataset from the PDB, our results show that high local topological free energy conformations are independent of sequence and may be involved in the rate limiting step in protein folding. By analyzing a set of 2-state single domain proteins, we find that the total local topological free energy of these proteins correlates with the experimentally observed folding rates reported in Plaxco et al.

  abstract     = {Current clinician practice for thyroid hormone regulation of patients is based upon guesswork and experience rather than quantified analysis, which exposes patients under longer risk and discomfort. To quantitatively analyze the thyroid regulation for patients of different thyroid states, we develop a two-dimensional mathematical model that can be applied to analyze the dynamic behaviors of thyroid hormones with or without drug intervention. The unified model can be employed to study the regulation of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and FT4 (free thyroxine) for euthyroid (normal thyroid) subjects, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and Graves’ disease patients, respectively. The results suggest that the level of TPOAb (thyroid peroxidase antibody) may be a factor determining whether the patient would progress from euthyroid state to subclinical or clinical hypothyroidism, and that increased TRAb (TSH receptor antibody) may lead Graves’ disease to deteriorate from the early stage to overt hyperthyroidism. Given the early blood-test data, we demonstrate the feasibility for healthcare professionals to apply our model in choosing an appropriate dosage regimen for patients to achieve the desired TSH and FT4 levels within a specified time frame. This proposed model has the potential to optimize personalized treatment and shorten the therapeutic time for patients suffering from Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and Graves’ disease.},

Cell proliferation and migration in these experiments have yet to be explicitly characterised, limiting the ability of experimentalists to determine the effects of various experimental conditions, such as scaffold geometry, on cell behaviour. We consider tissue growth by osteoblastic cells in melt electro-written scaffolds that comprise thin square pores with sizes that were deliberately increased between experiments. We collect highly detailed temporal measurements of the average cell density, tissue coverage, and tissue geometry. To quantify tissue growth in terms of the underlying cell proliferation and migration processes, we introduce and calibrate a mechanistic mathematical model based on the Porous-Fisher reaction–diffusion equation. Parameter estimates and uncertainty quantification through profile likelihood analysis reveal consistency in the rate of cell proliferation and steady-state cell density between pore sizes. This analysis also serves as an important model verification tool: while the use of reaction–diffusion models in biology is widespread, the appropriateness of these models to describe tissue growth in 3D scaffolds has yet to be explored. We find that the Porous-Fisher model is able to capture features relating to the cell density and tissue coverage, but is not able to capture geometric features relating to the circularity of the tissue interface. Our analysis identifies two distinct stages of tissue growth, suggests several areas for model refinement, and provides guidance for future experimental work that explores tissue growth in 3D printed scaffolds.},

Using the global sensitivity methods of Sobol and Morris, the most important parameters are estimated. Estimation of the sensitivity variance revealed a strong interdependence between the parameters. Also, determinations of the conditions for effective therapy lead to a target of reducing the cancer cell numbers by at least 50\% 50\% . This opened the way for delimiting the parameter spaces making it possible to reach the treatment target in addition to enhancing the estimation of the minimum time of remission.

  abstract     = {Meiotic recombination and the factors affecting its rate and fate in nature have inspired many studies in theoretical evolutionary biology. Classical theoretical models have inferred that recombination can be favored under a rather restricted parameter range. Thus, the ubiquity of recombination in nature remains an open question. However, these models assumed constant recombination with an equal rate across all individuals within the population, whereas empirical evidence suggests that recombination may display certain sensitivity to ecological stressors and/or genotype fitness. Models assuming condition-dependent recombination show that such a strategy can often be favored over constant recombination. Moreover, in our recent model with panmictic populations subjected to purifying selection, fitness-dependent recombination was quite often favored even when any constant recombination was rejected. By using numerical modeling, we test whether such a ‘recombination-rescuing potential’ of fitness dependence holds also beyond panmixia, given the recognized effect of mating strategy on the evolution of recombination. We show that deviations from panmixia generally increase the recombination-rescuing potential of fitness dependence, with the strongest effect under intermediate selfing or high clonality. We find that under partial clonality, the evolutionary advantage of fitness-dependent recombination is determined mostly by selection against heterozygotes and additive-by-additive epistasis, while under partial selfing, additive-by-dominance epistasis is also a driver.},

  abstract     = {In the predator-prey system, predators can affect the prey population (1) by direct killing and (2) by inducing predation fear, which ultimately force preys to adopt some anti-predator strategies. However, the anti-predator strategy is not the same for all individual preys of different life stages. Also, anti-predator behavior has both cost and benefit, but most of the mathematical models observed the dynamics by incorporating its cost only. In the present study, we formulate a predator-prey model dividing the prey population into two stages: juvenile and adult. We assume that adult preys are only adapting group defense as an anti-predator strategy when they are sensitive to predation. Group defense plays a positive role for adult prey by reducing their predation, but, on the negative side, it simultaneously decreases their reproductive potential. A parameter, anti-predator sensitivity is introduced to interlink both the benefit and cost of group defense. Our result shows that when adult preys are not showing anti-predator behavior, with an increase of maturation rate, the system exhibits a population cycle of abruptly increasing amplitude, which may drive all species of the system to extinction. Anti-predator sensitivity may exclude oscillation through homoclinic bifurcation and avert the prey population for any possible random extinction. Anti-predator sensitivity also decreases the predator population density and produces bistable dynamics. Higher values of anti-predator sensitivity may lead to the extinction of the predator population and benefit adult preys to persist with large population density. Below a threshold value of anti-predator sensitivity, it may possible to retain the predator population in the system by increasing the fear level of the predator. We also observe our fear-induced stage-structured model exhibits interesting and rich dynamical behaviors, various types of bistabilities in different bi-parameter planes. Finally, we discuss the potential impact of our findings.},

Here we combine a generalized analytical framework of contagion with computational models of epidemic dynamics to show that variation strongly influences the rate of infection, while the infection process simultaneously sculpts the susceptibility distribution. These joint dynamics influence the force of infection and are, in turn, influenced by the shape of the initial variability. We find that certain susceptibility distributions (the exponential and the gamma) are unchanged through the course of the outbreak, and lead naturally to power-law behavior in the force of infection; other distributions are often sculpted towards these “eigen-distributions” through the process of contagion. The power-law behavior fundamentally alters predictions of the long-term infection rate, and suggests that first-order epidemic models that are parameterized in the exponential-like phase may systematically and significantly over-estimate the final severity of the outbreak. In summary, our study suggests the need to examine the shape of susceptibility in natural populations as part of efforts to improve prediction models and to prioritize interventions that leverage heterogeneity to mitigate against spread.},

We model the evolution of cooperation in epithelial cells using the Voronoi tessellation model. Unlike traditional evolutionary graph theory, this allows us to implement global updating, for which birth and death events are spatially decoupled. We compare, for a sigmoid benefit function, the conditions for cooperation to be favoured and/or beneficial for well-mixed and structured populations. We find that when population structure is combined with global updating, cooperation is more successful than if there were local updating or the population were well-mixed. Interestingly, the qualitative behaviour for the well-mixed population and the Voronoi tessellation model is remarkably similar, but the latter case requires significantly lower incentives to ensure cooperation.},

In it, the memory function is consolidated in sleep by creating up and down state oscillations (1 Hz) and fast (13–17 Hz) – slow (8–12 Hz) spindles. Recently, a nonlinear biological model for up-down oscillations and fast-slow spindles of the thalamocortical network has been proposed. In this research, the power spectral for the fast-slow spindle of the model is extracted. Dynamical properties of the model, such as the bifurcation diagrams, and attractors are investigated. The results show that the variation of the synaptic power between the excitatory neurons of the cortex and the reticular neurons in the thalamus changes the spindles&#39; activity. According to previous experimental findings, it is an essential rule for consolidating the memory function during sleep. It is also pointed out that when the fast-slow spindles of the brain increase, the dynamics of the thalamocortical system tend to chaos.},

Here, we propose a model in which dispersal rates depend on the abundance of the species interacting with the dispersing species ( e.g. , prey or predators) to determine how density-dependent dispersal shapes spatial synchrony in trophic metacommunities in response to stochastic perturbations. Thus, unlike those with passive dispersal, this model with density-dependent dispersal bypasses the classic vertical transmission of perturbations due to trophic interactions and deeply alters synchrony patterns. We show that the species with the highest coefficient of variation of biomass governs the dispersal rate of the dispersing species and determines the synchrony of its populations. In addition, we show that this mechanism can be modulated by the relative impact of each species on the growth rate of the dispersing species. Species affected by several constraints disperse to mitigate the strongest constraints ( e.g. , predation), which does not necessarily experience the highest variations due to perturbations. Our approach can disentangle the joint effects of several factors implied in dispersal and provides a more accurate description of dispersal and its consequences on metacommunity dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Invasive species , disease vectors, and pathogens are significant threats to biodiversity, ecosystem function and services, and human health. Understanding the optimal management strategy, which maximizes the effectiveness is crucial. Despite an abundance of theoretical work has conducted on projecting the optimal allocation strategy, almost no empirical work has been performed to validate the theory. We first used a consumer-resource model to simulate a series of allocation fractions of controlling treatment to determine the optimal controlling strategy. Further, we conducted rigorous laboratory experiments using spatially diffusing laboratory populations of yeast to verify our mathematical results. We found consistent results that: (1) When population growth is limited by the local resource, the controlling priority should be given to the areas with higher concentration of resource; (2) When population growth is not limited by the resource concentration, the best strategy is to allocate equal amount of controlling efforts among the regions; (3) With restricted budget, it is more efficient to prioritize the controlling effects to the areas with high population abundance, otherwise, it is better to control equally among the regions. The new theory, which was tested by laboratory experiments, will reveal new opportunities for future field interventions, thereby informing subsequent biological decision-making.},

The question arises: if an active genetic terror event is released into a population, could we prevent the total spread of the undesired allele ( Gantz, et al., 2015 , Webber et al., 2015 )? Thus far, effective protection methods require knowledge of the terror locus ( Grunwald et al., 2019 ). Here we introduce a novel approach, an autocatalytic-Protection for an Unknown Locus (a-PUL), whose aim is to spread through a population and arrest and decrease an active terror event’s spread without any prior knowledge of the terror-modified locus, thus allowing later natural selection and ERACR drives to restore the normal locus ( Hammond et al., 2017 ). a-PUL, using a mutagenic chain reaction, includes (i) a segment encoding a non-Cas9 endonuclease capable of homology-directed repair suggested as Type II endonuclease Cpf1 (Cas12a), (ii) a ubiquitously-expressed gene encoding a gRNA (gRNA1) with a U4AU4 3′-overhang specific to Cpf1 and with crRNA specific to some desired genomic sequence of non-coding DNA, (iii) a ubiquitously-expressed gene encoding two gRNAs (gRNA2/gRNA3) both with tracrRNA specific to Cas9 and crRNA specific to two distinct sites of the Cas9 locus, and (iv) homology arms flanking the Cpf1/gRNA1/gRNA2/gRNA3 cassette that are identical to the region surrounding the target cut directed by gRNA1 ( Khan, 2016 , Zetsche et al., 2015 ).

Studies across many taxa show that adult sex ratio, a major determinant of host mating dynamics, is often skewed - sometimes strongly - toward males or females. However, few predictions exist for the effects of skewed sex ratio on STI epidemiology, and none when coupled with sex biased disease characteristics. Here we use mathematical modelling to examine how interactions between sex ratio and disease characteristics affect STI prevalence in males and females. Notably, we find that while overall disease prevalence peaks at equal sex ratios, prevalence per sex peaks at skewed sex ratios. Furthermore, disease characteristics, sex-biased or not, drive predictable differences in male and female STI prevalence as sex ratio varies, with higher transmission and lower virulence generally increasing differences between the sexes for a given sex ratio. Our work reveals new insights into how STI prevalence in males and females depends on a complex interaction between host population sex ratio and disease characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Mound structures that soil termites build have diverse morphologies. Previous observational studies documented that mounds are built to provide regulated environments for the termites that live within them and their structures are formed in ways to support this purpose under the influence of the mounds’ immediate environment. The objective of this study is to provide a methodology and a predictive computational model to investigate the reason behind the different but systematic shapes of termite mounds, considering all the relevant forces imposed on them and their thermoregulatory and gas-exchange functions. The gas-exchange function accounts for the capacity of the mound to diffuse metabolic gases generated in the mound’s underground nest, while the thermoregulatory function satisfies the connection between the underground nest and deep ground temperatures. The proposed predictive model is based on the principles of heat transfer and thermodynamics and allows optimized mechanically stable structures to freely emerge. The results indicate that, while the model is free to generate any mechanically stable structure, under the relevant environmental and metabolic conditions, it produces structures with forms and geometrical characteristics similar to those of natural mounds. Investigation of the connection between the local environment and the mound shapes indicated that the Sun and wind play an important role in the mound structural form. Mounds exposed to stronger solar irradiance exhibit cone-shaped structures that are pointed towards the Sun, while shaded mounds are observed to be vertical domes. The local wind is observed to affect the external shape of the mound by preventing them to grow tall while controlling the features of the internal structure. By investigating the similarities between structures in different regions (i.e., India, Namibia, and Brazil), it is revealed that, unlike mounds with a strong need for gas-exchange, mounds with a significant demand for thermoregulation exhibit deeper nests, thicker external walls, and well-defined cone- (as opposed to the dome-) shaped structures. Overall, the form of termite mounds is strongly correlated to both regulatory functions and local environments, and the resulting mound shape arises as a combination of these factors.},

  abstract     = {It is likely that RNA replication began non-enzymatically, and that polymerases were later selected to speed up the process. We consider replication mechanisms in modern viruses and ask which of these is possible non-enzymatically, using mathematical models and experimental data found in the literature to estimate rates of RNA synthesis and replication. Replication via alternating plus and minus strands is found in some single-stranded RNA viruses . However, if this occurred non-enzymatically it would lead to double-stranded RNA that would not separate. With some form of environmental cycling, such as temperature, salinity, or pH cycling, double-stranded RNA can be melted to form single-stranded RNA, although re-annealing of existing strands would then occur much faster than synthesis of new strands. We show that re-annealing blocks this form of replication at a very low concentration of strands. Other kinds of viruses synthesize linear double strands from single strands and then make new single strands from double strands via strand-displacement. This does not require environmental cycling and is not blocked by re-annealing. However, under non-enzymatic conditions, if strand-displacement occurs from a linear template, we expect the incomplete new strand to be almost always displaced by the tail end of the old strand through toehold-mediated displacement. A third kind of replication in viruses and viroids is rolling-circle replication which occurs via strand-displacement on a circular template. Rolling-circle replication does not require environmental cycling and is not prevented by toehold-mediated displacement. Rolling-circle replication is therefore expected to occur non-enzymatically and is a likely starting point for the evolution of polymerase-catalysed replication.},

  abstract     = {The quality of hosts for a parasitoid wasp may be influenced by attributes such as host size or species, with high quality for successful development usually coincident with high quality for larger offspring. This is not always the case: for the Scelionid wasp Trissolcus basalis , oviposition in eggs of the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug, Halyomorpha halys , rather than of the normal host, the Southern Green Stink Bug, Nezara viridula , leads to lower offspring survival, but survivors can be unusually large. Adult female T. basalis engage in contests for host access. As larger contestants are typically favoured in contests between parasitoids, the larger size of surviving offspring may compensate for the mortality of others. We construct a general game-theoretic model to explore whether size advantage can sustain a maternal preference to utilize a more deadly host species. We find that size advantage alone is unlikely to sustain a shift in host preference, yet such an outcome is possible when size asymmetries act simultaneously with advantages in host possession (ownership effect). Halyomorpha halys is an invasive pest of major agro-economic importance in Europe and the Americas, and use of its eggs as hosts by native parasitoids such as T. basalis has been seen as an evolutionary trap due to their high developmental mortality. Our model suggests that the recently discovered effect of host choice on offspring size may provide an escape from the trap via effects on contest biology of T. basalis which could foster a more stable association with H. halys . An evolutionary shift in the reproductive value of H. halys could increase the efficiency of T. basalis as a biological control agent of this invasive stink bug pest.},

  abstract     = {Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD) is a cattle disease that causes substantial financial losses, in particular to the dairy industry. Hence, several countries including Germany introduced compulsory disease control programs. For the case of Germany in particular, all animals had to be tested and persistently infected animals (PI animals) were removed from the population. The program was successful in reducing the number of PI animals, but was overtly expensive. Alternative approaches were therefore discussed to eliminate the remaining PI animals and alter the testing system in order to reduce costs. Contributing to these efforts, we developed an agent-based model that aimed to cover all relevant aspects of the disease biology and would allow to evaluate different control strategies. For the biological part of the infection spread, the model includes horizontal and vertical transmission, transient and persistent infections. Moreover, several control strategies including import of animals, trade restrictions, vaccination, as well as various testing schemes were included. The model was furthermore defined to be stochastic, event-driven and hierarchical, with cattle movements as the main route of spreading between farms. For the spread within farms, we included susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) dynamics with an additional permanently infectious class. The interaction between the farms was described by a supply and demand farm manager mechanism governing the network structure and dynamics. Additionally, we carried out a sensitivity analysis of the input parameters to study the impact of extreme values on the model. Since the population size in the model is limited, we tested the influence of the initial population size on the model results. Our results showed that the model could accurately describe the dynamics of the disease in the presence and absence of disease control. Although we developed the model for the spread of BVD, it may be adapted to similar diseases of cattle and swine.},

Previous work has shown a theoretical limit to the amount of fitness benefit possible to be extracted from the cues. We show that the previously used information theoretical approaches can be generalised to scenarios involving any potential relationship between the number of possible phenotypes and environmental states. Such cases are relevant when physiological constraints or complex ecological scenarios lead to the number of environmental states exceeding potential phenotypes. We illustrate cases in which these scenarios can emerge: along environmental gradients, such as geographical transects or complex environments, where organisms adopt different bet-hedging strategies, switching stochastically between phenotypes or developing intermediate ones. In conclusion, we develop an information-theoretic extensible approach for investigating and quantifying fitness in ecological studies.},

  abstract     = {In a population of interacting individuals, the environment for interactions often changes due to individuals’ behaviors, which in turn drive the evolution of individuals’ behaviors. The interplay between the environment and individuals’ behaviors has been demonstrated to remarkably influence the evolutionary outcomes. In reality, in highly cognitive species such as social primates and human beings, individuals are often capable of perceiving the environment change and then differentiate their strategies across different environment states. We propose a model of environmental feedback with state-dependent strategies: individuals have perceptions of distinct environment states and therefore take distinct sub-strategies under each of them; based on the sub-strategy, individuals then decide their behaviors; their behaviors subsequently modify the environment state. We use the theory of stochastic games and evolutionary dynamics to analyze this idea. We find that when environment changes slower than behaviors, state-dependent strategies (i.e. taking different sub-strategies under different environment states) can outperform state-independent strategies (i.e. taking an identical sub-strategy under all environment states), such as Win-Stay, Lose-Shift, the most leading strategy among state-independent strategies. The intuition is that delayed environmental feedback provides chances for individuals with state-dependent strategies to exploit those with state-independent strategies. Our results hold (1) in both well-mixed and structured populations; (2) when the environment switches between two or more states. Furthermore, the environment changing rate decides if state-dependent strategies benefit global cooperation. The evolution sees the rise of the cooperation level for fast environment switching and the decrease otherwise. Our work stresses that individuals’ perceptions of different environment states are beneficial to their survival and social prosperity in a changing world.},

Previous computational models of brain capillary networks have predicted that heterogeneous cerebral capillary flow patterns result in lower brain tissue partial oxygen pressures PO2). However, these previous models have often considered simple capillary networks in terms of their geometric properties. In this current work, we developed and analyzed computational models of brain capillary networks to determine how perturbations of network properties impact tissue oxygen levels. The models include variabilities in both their geometric (segment lengths and diameters) and three-dimensional, topological structure. Two classes of capillary network models are considered. The first consists of equations for the oxygen partial pressure, PO 2 , in both a capillary network and the surrounding tissue. In order to gain insight into the behavior of this detailed model, we also consider a reduced model for changes in PO 2 in just the capillary network. The main result is that for a general class of networks, random perturbations of either segment diameters or conductances will always, on average, decrease the average tissue oxygen levels. This result is supported through both simulations of the models and mathematical analysis. Our results promise to expand our understanding of cerebral capillary blood flow and its impact on the brain function in health and disease.},

We present new data on the virus load infection of Ube 1 L - / - Ube1L-/- , which have been micro-printed in a checker board pattern of different sizes of the inner squares. Surprisingly, the total viral load at one day after inoculation significantly depends on the sizes of the inner squares. We explain this observation by using a reaction diffusion model and we show that mathematical homogenization can explain the observed inhomogeneities. If the individual patches are large, then the growth rate and the carrying capacity will be the arithmetic means of the patches. For finer and finer patches the average growth rate is still the arithmetic mean, however, the carrying capacity uses the harmonic mean. While fitting the PDE to the experimental data, we also predict that a discrepancy in virus load would be unobservable after only half a day. Furthermore, we predict the viral load in different inner squares that had not been measured in our experiment and the travelling distance the virions can reach after one day.},

  abstract     = {Sea turtles complete migrations across vast distances, covering entire ocean basins. To track these migrations, satellite tracking tags are attached to their shells. The impact of these tags must be considered to ensure that turtles’ natural behavior is not artificially and adversely impacted through tag-related drag, and that the data collected by a small sample of sea turtles accurately represents the larger population. Additionally, it can be difficult to study animal energetics in the field over large migration distances. In this work, we modify a computational behavior model to study how satellite tracking tags affect turtle migration behavior. Our agent based model contains synthetic magnetic field environments that are used for navigation cues, an ocean current, resource distributions that represent locations of food, and an agent that attempts to migrate to several different goals. The agent loses energy as it progresses, and searches for the resource distributions to replenish itself. Our novel simulation framework demonstrates the relationship between an agent’s available energy capacity, its energy consumption based on mechanical power expended, and its ability to navigate to all migratory goal points. This study can be utilized to (1) probe the impacts of an animal’s energy capacity and foraging behavior on its resulting navigation and ecology, (2) guide future satellite tag designs, and (3) develop usage recommendations for a suitable tracking tag based on the type of experiment being conducted. Our model can be expanded beyond sea turtles to study other marine species (e.g., sharks, whales). Additionally, this model could be expanded to other domains within the marine environment. For example, it could be modified to examine design trade-offs in remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), which share many of the same operational constraints as sea turtles and other migratory species.},

  abstract     = {Capelin (Mallotus villosus) is a short-lived (1–4 years) fish species, that plays a crucial role by dominating the intermediate trophic level in the Barents Sea. Several episodes of extreme biomass decline (collapse) have been observed during the last three decades. We postulate that these collapses might be regulated by food availability (bottom-up effect) and/or by time discrepancy between capelin feeding and abundance of its prey (match-mismatch hypothesis). This paper investigates our postulate using a model consisting of a set of coupled differential equations to describe the predator-prey system, with a single delay term, τ τ , in description of the predator dynamics. We derive theoretical conditions on τ τ , as well as determine how changes in these conditions define different stability regimes of the system. Unconstrained optimization is used to calculate optimal model parameters by fitting the predator-prey model to empirical data. The optimization results are combined with those from the theoretical analysis, to make inference about the empirical system stability. Our results show that Hopf bifurcation occurs in the predatory-prey system when τ τ exceeds a theoretically derived value τ ∗ &gt; 0 τ∗&amp;gt;0 . This value represents the critical time for prey availability in advance of the optimal predator growth period.Set into an ecological context, our findings provide mathematical evidence for validity of the match-mismatch hypothesis and a bottom-up effect for capelin.},

We study the dynamics of the system using numerical simulations, computational bifurcation analysis and mathematical analysis. We find Hopf bifurcations leading to stable and unstable rotation in the system, and we study the rotational behavior as a function of cyclic mutual repression parameter asymmetry between each gene pair in the network. We focus on how rotation co-exists with a stable heteroclinic flow linking the three saddles in the system. We find that this coexistence allows for a transition between two markedly different types of rotation leading to strikingly different phenotypes. One type of rotation belongs to Hopf-induced rotation while the other type, belongs to heteroclinic cycling between three saddle nodes in the system.

  abstract     = {Development of resistance to chemotherapy in cancer patients strongly effects the outcome of the treatment. Due to chemotherapeutic agents, resistance can emerge by Darwinian evolution. Besides this, acquired drug resistance may arise via changes in gene expression. A recent discovery in cancer research uncovered a third possibility, indicating that this phenotype conversion can occur through the transfer of microvesicles from resistant to sensitive cells, a mechanism resembling the spread of an infectious agent. We present a model describing the evolution of sensitive and resistant tumour cells considering Darwinian selection, Lamarckian induction and microvesicle transfer. We identify three threshold parameters which determine the existence and stability of the three possible equilibria. Using a simple Dulac function, we give a complete description of the dynamics of the model depending on the three threshold parameters. We also establish an agent based model as a spatial version of the ODE model and compare the outputs of the two models. We find that although the ODE model does not provide spatial information about the structure of the tumour, it is capable to determine the outcome in terms of tumour size and distribution of cell types. We demonstrate the possible effects of increasing drug concentration, and characterize the possible bifurcation sequences. Our results show that the presence of microvesicle transfer cannot ruin a therapy that otherwise leads to extinction, however it may doom a partially successful therapy to failure.},

Using an established model of the inter-follicular epidermis we find there is a limit to the proliferative cell densities that can be maintained in the basal layer (the niche) if we do not include additional mechanisms to stop the loss of proliferative cells from the niche. We suggest a new methodology that enables maintenance of a desired homeostatic population of proliferative cells in the niche: a rotational force is applied to the two daughter cells during the mitotic phase of division to enforce a particular division direction. We demonstrate that this new methodology achieves this goal. This methodology reflects the regulation of the orientation of cell division.},

There are, however, a number of situations in which one would expect this mechanism to play a role, but where no such effect has ever been demonstrated. This is the case in particular in many intraspecific interactions, such as collective hunts, in non–human animals. Here we use individual-based simulations to solve this apparent paradox. We show that the conditions for partner choice to operate are in fact restrictive. They entail that individuals can compare social opportunities and choose the best. The challenge is that social opportunities are often rare because they necessitate the co-occurrence of (i) at least one available partner, and (ii) a resource to exploit together with this partner. This has three consequences. First, partner choice cannot lead to the evolution of cooperation when resources are scarce, which explains that this mechanism could never be observed in many cases of intraspecific cooperation in animals. Second, partner choice can operate when partners constitute in themselves a resource, which is the case in sexual interactions and interspecific mutualisms. Third, partner choice can lead to the evolution of cooperation when individuals live in a rich environment, and/or when they are highly efficient at extracting resources from their environment.},

In this article, we combine the implementation of pharmacological chaperones and interferons to develop a novel model using a non-linear system of ordinary differential equations and study the quantitative effects of these two treatments on the growth rate of prions. This study aims to identify how the two treatments affect prion proliferation, both individually and in tandem. We analyze the model, and qualitative global results on the disease-free and disease equilibria are proved analytically. Numerical simulations, using parameter values from in vivo experiments that provide a pharmaceutically important demonstration of the effects of these two treatments, are presented here.

  abstract     = {In cancer, treatment failure and disease recurrence have been associated with small subpopulations of cancer cells with a stem -like phenotype. In this paper, we develop and investigate a phenotype-structured model of solid tumour growth in which cells are structured by a stemness level, which varies continuously between stem-like and terminally differentiated behaviours. Cell evolution is driven by proliferation and death, as well as advection and diffusion with respect to the stemness structure variable. Here, the magnitude and sign of the advective flux are allowed to vary with the oxygen level. We use the model to investigate how the environment, in particular oxygen levels, affects the tumour’s population dynamics and composition, and its response to radiotherapy. We use a combination of numerical and analytical techniques to quantify how under physiological oxygen levels the cells evolve to a differentiated phenotype and under low oxygen level (i.e., hypoxia) they de-differentiate. Under normoxia, the proportion of cancer stem cells is typically negligible and the tumour may ultimately become extinct whereas under hypoxia cancer stem cells comprise a dominant proportion of the tumour volume, enhancing radio-resistance and favouring the tumour’s long-term survival. We then investigate how such phenotypic heterogeneity impacts the tumour’s response to treatment with radiotherapy under normoxia and hypoxia. Of particular interest is establishing how the presence of radio-resistant cancer stem cells can facilitate a tumour’s regrowth following radiotherapy. We also use the model to show how radiation-induced changes in tumour oxygen levels can give rise to complex re-growth dynamics. For example, transient periods of hypoxia induced by damage to tumour blood vessels may rescue the cancer cell population from extinction and drive secondary regrowth.},

The influence of system size, photoperiod , and mutations of clock genes on the robustness of the oscillations are discussed. Our simulations show that the oscillations remain robust when the mRNA and protein levels are in the range of a few hundreds molecules. Entrainment by light–dark cycles enhances the robustness compared to constant conditions. Multiple light inputs and inter-cellular coupling also contribute to the robustness of the oscillations. The comparison between deterministic and stochastic simulations of single and double mutants shows that stochasticity does not qualitatively affect the behaviour of mutants but that they do not have the same robustness to noise. Finally, the model shows that noise can induce transitions between two limit cycles in a birhythmic clock mutant.},

  abstract     = {Phagocytosis is a complex process by which phagocytes such as lymphocytes or macrophages engulf and destroy foreign bodies called pathogens in a tissue. The process is triggered by the detection of antibodies that trigger signaling mechanisms that control the changes of the cellular cytoskeleton needed for engulfment of the pathogen. A mathematical model of the entire process would be extremely complicated, because the signaling and cytoskeletal changes produce large mechanical deformations of the cell. Recent experiments have used a confinement technique that leads to a process called frustrated phagocytosis, in which the membrane does not deform, but rather, signaling triggers actin waves that propagate along the boundary of the cell. This eliminates the large-scale deformations and facilitates modeling of the wave dynamics. Herein we develop a model of the actin dynamics observed in frustrated phagocytosis and show that it can replicate the experimental observations. We identify the key components that control the actin waves and make a number of experimentally-testable predictions. In particular, we predict that diffusion coefficients of membrane-bound species must be larger behind the wavefront to replicate the internal structure of the waves. Our model is a first step toward a more complete model of phagocytosis, and provides insights into circular dorsal ruffles as well.},

Since virulence evolves according to the host’s mortality, and since virulence influences the intensity of transmission, which determines the average age at infection and thus the mortality rate of a senescing host, we expected that epi-evolutionary feedbacks would underlie the evolution of virulence in a population of senescing hosts. We tested this idea by extending an age-structured model of epidemiological dynamics with the parasite’s evolution. A straightforward prediction of our model is that stronger senescence forces the evolution of higher virulence. However, the model also reveals that the evolved virulence depends on the average age at infection, giving an evolutionary feedback with the epidemiological situation, a prediction not found when assuming a constant mortality rate with age. Additionally, and in contrast to most models of parasite evolution, we found that the virulence at the evolutionary equilibrium is influenced by whether the force of infection depends on the density or on the frequency of infected hosts, due to changes in the average age at infection. Our findings suggest that ignoring age-specific effects, and in particular senescence, can give misleading predictions about parasite evolution.},

Individual agents attempted to learn to track a hidden fluctuating “source”, which, linearly mixed with other masking fluctuations, generated observable input vectors. In this model data are generated linearly, facilitating mathematical analysis. Learning was driven either solely by direct observation of input data (unsupervised, Hebbian) or, in addition, by observation of another agent&#39;s output (supervised, Delta rule). To make learning more difficult, and to enhance biological realism, the learning rules were made slightly connection-inspecific, so that incorrect individual learning sometimes occurs. We found that social interaction can foster both correct and incorrect learning. Useful social learning therefore presumably involves additional factors some of which we outline.},

This neuronal network model follows the organizational principle of modular structure. The neurons can generate spikes like biological neurons, and changes in the strength of synaptic connections conform to the STDP learning rule. Based on this neuronal network model, we first quantitatively studied whether and to what extent the connectivity within and between modules can affect spike signal transmission, and found that spike signal transmission heavily depends on the connectivity between modules, but has little to do with the connectivity within modules. More importantly, we further found that the spike activity of a module can be predicted according to the spike activities of its adjacent modules through building a resting-state functional connectivity matrix.},

  abstract     = {Repeated games are useful models to analyze long term interactions of living species and complex social phenomena. Zero-determinant (ZD) strategies in repeated games discovered by Press and Dyson in 2012 enforce a linear payoff relationship between a focal player and the opponent. This linear relationship can be set arbitrarily by a ZD player. Hence, a subclass of ZD strategies can fix the opponent’s expected payoff and another subclass of the strategies can exceed the opponent for the expected payoff. Since this discovery, theories for ZD strategies are extended to cope with various natural situations. It is especially important to consider the theory of ZD strategies for repeated games with a discount factor and observation errors because it allows the theory to be applicable in the real world. Recent studies revealed their existence of ZD strategies even in repeated games with both factors. However, the conditions for the existence has not been sufficiently analyzed. Here, we mathematically analyzed the conditions in repeated games with both factors. First, we derived the thresholds of a discount factor and observation errors which ensure the existence of Equalizer and positively correlated ZD (pcZD) strategies, which are well-known subclasses of ZD strategies. We found that ZD strategies exist only when a discount factor remains high as the error rates increase. Next, we derived the conditions for the expected payoff of the opponent enforced by Equalizer as well as the conditions for the slope and base line payoff of linear lines enforced by pcZD. As a result, we found that, as error rates increase or a discount factor decreases, the conditions for the linear line that Equalizer or pcZD can enforce become strict.},

  abstract     = {Elements within biological systems interact and frequently self-organize from initially disordered states into highly structured patterns. The local self-activation and lateral inhibition mechanism, derived from the coupling between two reacting and diffusing chemicals, has been believed to be one of the main causes for biological pattern formation. Graded positional information can be produced by the limited diffusion of one single signaling molecule through cell populations with no pre-patterns being required. We demonstrate, using multiscale computations, that spontaneous symmetry breaking can be driven within expanding and non-expanding cell populations, without local self-enhancement of activators and long-range inhibition. Instead, cells can self-organize into structured gene patterns via a combination of timing gene expression in cells and the graded positional information which has been coupled to the gene expression. We show that the genetic symmetry breaking in expanding E. coli populations occurs at a critical colony size, which is independent of the cell doubling time but scales with the diffusion speed of the signaling molecule. We also show the quasi-3D structure of gene patterns, and observe that the wave length of periodic genetic stripes is in proportion to the genetic oscillation cycle time and in inverse proportion to cell doubling time. Our results provide insights into relevant biological development processes.},

  abstract     = {The genetic code consists in a set of rules used by living organisms to translate genomic information, contained in genes, into proteins; every amino acid is coded by a set of nucleotide triplets or codons. We refer to codon choice as the choice of a given codon, among the synonymous available ones, to code a given amino acid occurrence. The aim of this work is to shed light on the pivotal role that codon choice plays in regulating the timing of translation process, through patterns of low and high translation efficiency codons. A translation efficiency value, namely codon score, was associated to each codon through a formula based on the number of tRNAs gene copies able to translate the given codon. By using codon scores, those k -mers of the proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , showing low and high average scores associated to the correspondent codons, were computed. The analysis of distribution of both low and high average score k -mers clearly showed that, in particular for higher k -mer size, they occur much more than expected, strongly suggesting a functional role. Moreover performed analysis highlighted that significant k -mers preferentially occur in some protein folding classes, such as those containing alpha helices, and in some functional classes mainly involved in transcription process while codon choice seems to have a very low impact in proteins associated to energy production and metabolism. The relationship between secondary structures and significant k -mers was investigated, revealing that low score k -mers tend to preferentially occur in coil or close to coil regions and almost never in beta sheets, while high score k -mers preferentially occur in alpha helices, avoiding beta sheets, and close to coil regions for high k -mer sizes. Finally the analysis of distribution of significant codon patterns along the proteins highlighted a relevant enrichment of low average score k -mers at the 5’ end of protein-coding sequences in the region from 5th to 25th amino acid.},

Since no effective treatment for the disease, it is crucial to investigate its transmission mechanism and control strategies in large-scale pig farms. We first established a toy model to explore ASFV spread in one pig unit. Then a switching patch model was developed to capture its spread from one initial epidemic pig house consecutively to others, even the whole farm. Assessing innocent culling rates of three large-scale epidemic pig farms in Jiangsu Province showed that it is unnecessary to slaughter all pigs in the farms compulsively. Then we explored how the disinfection and fixation of employees impact ASFV spread in the farms. To control ASFV, we can block or slow down its spreading by improving the efficiency of disinfection and decreasing employee population to some extend. We can also shrink potential areas to be infected by properly improving the matching refinement degree among employees and houses. Some essential requirements for large-scale pig farms are presented to reduce their ASFV spreading risk, which can be helpful for animal health authorities in establishing regulation to standardize large-scale pig farms.},

To investigate the interaction of disease transmission and information dissemination dynamics, we proposed a multi-scale model which explicitly models both the disease transmission with saturated recovery rate and information transmission to evaluate the effect of information transmission on dynamic behaviors. Considering time variation between information dissemination, epidemiological and demographic processes, we obtained a slow-fast system by reasonably introducing a sufficiently small quantity. We carefully examined the dynamics of proposed system, including existence and stability of possible equilibria and existence of backward bifurcation, by using the fast-slow theory and directly investigating the full system. We then compared the dynamics of the proposed system and the essential thresholds based on two methods, and obtained the similarity between the basic dynamical behaviors of the slow system and that of the full system. Finally, we parameterized the proposed model on the basis of the COVID-19 case data in mainland China and data related to news items, and estimated the basic reproduction number to be 3.25. Numerical analysis suggested that information transmission about COVID-19 pandemic caused by media coverage can reduce the peak size, which mitigates the transmission dynamics during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

It is calculated that the required vaccine coverage level for herd immunity in a heterogeneous mixing population can be varied significantly. The required vaccine coverage level is lower than the classical herd immunity level, if the vaccine coverage level in the more active group or more susceptible group is higher than the other subgroup. It is suggested that the classical herd immunity levels can be misleading in the process of planning mass vaccination programs. The analysis is further extended to study the population with more subgroups. We then study the formal vaccination games to simulate the process of vaccination decision making, in either homogeneous or heterogeneous mixing populations. It is proved that the Nash equilibrium in the vaccination game is not unique if population heterogeneity is considered. Moreover, herd immunity is not achieved if individuals are solely driven by self-interests.},

  abstract     = {Growing genetic lineage mapping experiments have definitively shown a wide-ranging plasticity of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in atherosclerotic plaque and suggested that VSMCs can modulate their phenotypes in response to plaque microenvironment. Here, a multiscale hybrid discrete–continuous (HDC) modeling system is established to investigate the complex role of VSMC phenotypic switching within atherosclerotic lesions. The cellular behaviors of VSMCs and macrophages, including proliferation, migration, phenotypic transformation and necrosis, are determined by cellular automata (CA) rules in discrete model. While the dynamics of plaque microenvironmental factors, such as lipid, extracellular matrix (ECM) and chemokines, are described by continuous reaction–diffusion equations in macroscopy. The simulation results demonstrate how the VSMC activities change the extracellular microenvironment and consequently affect the plaque morphology and stability. The regulation of VSMC phenotypes can affect not only the plaque morphology (necrotic core size and fibrous cap thickness) but also the deposition and distribution of microenvironmental factors (lipoprotein, ECM, and chemokines). In addition, it is found that plaque vulnerability can be inhibited by blocking VSMC transdifferentiation to a macrophage-like state and promoting it to a myofibroblastic phenotype, which suggests that targeting VSMC phenotypic switching could be a potential and promising therapeutic strategy for atherosclerosis.},

Yet, there is very little progress in the development of within-host models for HBV, which has subsequently hindered our understanding of this virus. The uncertainty around the proliferation of infected hepatocytes has been studied but never in association with other important biological continuous events such as integrations and superinfections. This is despite the fact that these processes affect the diversity and composition of infected cell population in the liver and an improved understanding of the cellular composition will undoubtedly assist in strategizing against this viral infection. Here, we developed novel mathematical models that incorporate these key biological processes and analyzed them both analytically and numerically. Unaffected by the extent of integrated DNA (IDNA), the outcome of HBV infection was primarily dictated by the balance between processes generating and killing infected hepatocytes containing covalent closed circular DNA (cccDNA). The superinfection was found to be a key process in the spread of HBV infection as its exclusion could not reproduce experimentally observed composition of infected hepatocytes at peak of acute HBV infection, a stage where our model predicts that infected hepatocytes most likely carry both cccDNA and IDNA. Our analysis further suggested the existence of some form of selective advantage of infected hepatocytes containing only IDNA to explain the viral dynamics observed during antiviral treatment and the transition from peak to acute infection. Finally, the fine line between liver destruction and resolution of acute HBV infection was found to be highly influenced by the fate of cccDNA during cellular proliferation.},

The experimental results are blood volume data from 20 young (half of which are women) and 20 elderly (half of which are women) subjects during rest, inotropic stress (dobutamine), and chronotropic stress (glycopyrrolate). The model is calibrated to conform with data and physiological findings in 4 different levels. First, an optimization routine is devised to find model parameter values that give good fit between the model volume curves and blood volume data in the atrium and ventricle. Patient-specific information are used to get initial parameter values as a starting point of the optimization. Also, model pressure curves must show realistic behavior. Second, parametric bootstrapping is performed to establish the reliability of the optimal parameters. Third, statistical tests comparing mean optimal parameter values from young vs elderly subjects and women vs men are examined to support and present age and sex related differences in heart functions. Lastly, statistical tests comparing mean optimal parameter values from resting condition vs pharmacological stress are studied to verify and quantify the effects of dobutamine and glycopyrrolate to the cardiovascular system.},

To investigate the influence of the parasite on behavioral changes, we created an agent-based model that provides a prediction of how fungal infected ants move before death. The model shows how alterations in movement, such as an increased turning rate, within the normal range of ant behavior, can lead a host from the nest to the underside of a leaf. This demonstrates the simplicity in how such behavioral changes could evolve, as the fungal parasite could benefit from the natural behavior of the host, contesting a hypothesis of highly directed manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Recent preclinical studies have shown that interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) within tumors can be heterogeneous Andersen et al. (2019). In that study tumors of two xenograft models, respectively, HL-16 cervical carcinoma and Panc-1 pancreatic carcinoma, were investigated. Significant heterogeneity in IFP was reported and it was proposed that this was associated with division of tissue into compartments separated by thick connective tissue bands for the HL-16 tumors and with dense collagen-rich extracellular matrix for the Panc-1 tumors. The purpose of the current work is to explore these experimental observations by using in silico generated tumor models. We consider a mathematical multiphase model which accounts for tumor cells, fibroblasts and interstitial fluid. The model has been trained to comply with experimental in vitro results reported in Shieh et al. (2011) which has identified autologous chemotaxis, ECM remodeling, and cell-fibroblast interaction as drivers for invasive tumor cell behavior. The in silico model is informed with parameters that characterize the leaky intratumoral vascular network, the peritumoral lymphatics which collect the fluid, and the density of ECM as represented through the hydraulic conductivity of the interstitial space. Heterogeneous distribution of solid stress may result in heterogeneous compression of blood vessels and, thus, heterogeneous vascular density inside the tumor. To mimic this we expose the in silico tumor to an intratumoral vasculature whose net effect of density of blood vesssels and vessel wall conductivity is varied through a 2D Gaussian variogram constrained such that the resulting IFPs lie within the range as reported from the preclinical study. The in silico cervical carcinoma model illustrates that sparse ECM was associated with uniform intratumoral IFP in spite of heterogeneous microvascular network, whereas compartment structures resulted in more heterogeneous IFP. Similarly, the in silico pancreatic model shows that heterogeneity in the microvascular network combined with dense ECM structure prevents IFP to even out and gives rise to heterogeneous IFP. The computer model illustrates how a heterogeneous invasive front might form where groups of tumor cells detach from the primary tumor and form isolated islands, a behavior which is natural to associate with metastatic propensity. However, unlike experimental studies, the current version of the in silico model does not show an association between metastatic propensity and elevated IFP.},

  abstract     = {Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) produces long time-series of noisy observations of a single variable (tissue glucose concentration), whose evolution may be explained by a dynamical model. In order to represent the unknown mixture of possible control mechanisms of different orders affecting the measured variable, a fractional differential approach seems justified. In any case, variations in food intake and/or physical activity ought to be taken into account if a plausible interpretation of the dynamics is to be obtained. In the present work, the mathematical construction and the numerical implementation of a Fractional Differential Equations (FDE) initial value problem are systematically reviewed, with the intent of offering the reader a concise and mathematically rigorous description of this approach. An FDE model for CGM is formulated: the model includes compartments for stomach and intestinal glucose contents and for blood and tissue (subcutaneous) glucose concentrations, as well as the shock effects of food ingestion and of increased glucose consumption due to physical activity. The model parameters, including the (non-integer) order of differentiation, are estimated from CGM observations on six Type 1 diabetic patients. The best-fit fractional orders for the six subjects range from 1.59 to 2.13. For comparison, best fits have also been computed for all subjects using an average fractional order of 1.9 and integer orders of 1 and 2.The results indicate that in the case of CGM the fractional differential model, which should be physiologically more appropriate, in fact fits the data much better than the first-order model and also better than the 2nd-order model.},

  abstract     = {Cancer stem cells (CSCs) often switch on their self-renewal programming aggressively to cause a relapse of cancer. Intriguingly, glucose triggers the proliferation propensities in CSCs by controlling the expression of the key transcription factor-like Nanog. However, the factors that critically govern this glucose-stimulated proliferation dynamics of CSCs remain elusive. Herein, by proposing a mathematical model of glucose-mediated Nanog regulation, we showed that the differential proliferation behavior of CSCs and cell-type similar to CSCs can be explained by considering the experimentally observed varied expression levels of key positive (STAT3) and negative (p53) regulators of Nanog. Our model reconciles various experimental observations and predicts ways to fine-tune the proliferation dynamics of these cell types in a context-dependent manner. In future, these modeling insights will be useful in developing improved therapeutic strategies to get rid of harmful CSCs.},

  abstract     = {In order to interpret animal behavior we need to understand how they see the world. As directly testing color discrimination in animals is difficult and time consuming, it is important to develop theoretical models based in the properties of visual systems. One of the most successful for the prediction of color discrimination behavior is the receptor noise-limited (RNL) model, which depends only on the level of noise in photoreceptors and opponent mechanisms. Here a complementary approach to model construction is used, and optimal color discrimination properties are obtained using information theoretical tools, for the early stages of visual systems. It is shown here that, for most biologically relevant conditions the optimal discrimination function of an ideal observer coincides with the one obtained with the RNL model. Furthermore, within this framework the influence of opponency can be studied by considering models with and without that mechanism but with exactly the same parameters at the level of photoreceptors . As an example, it is shown here that opponency is necessary to explain the discrimination of monochromatic stimuli in honeybees, but not in budgerigars . Since this is a consequence of the narrowing of absorption spectra of photoreceptors, produced by the presence of oil droplets, this could also be true for most other species of birds. This suggests that in order to study opponency in birds, stimuli should have a relatively wide spectrum.},

  abstract     = {Relationships between host species richness and levels of disease in a focal host are likely to be context-dependent, depending on the characteristics of which particular host species are present in a community. I use a multi-host epidemiological model with environmental transmission to explore how the characteristics of the host species (e.g., competence and competitive ability), host density, and the pathogen transmission mechanism affect the proportion of infected individuals (i.e., infection prevalence) in a focal host. My sensitivity-based approach identifies the indirect pathways through which specific ecological and epidemiological processes affect focal host infection prevalence. This in turn yields predictions about the context-dependent rules governing whether increased host species richness increases (amplifies) or decreases (dilutes) infection prevalence in a focal host. For example, in many cases, amplification and dilution are predicted to occur when added host species are sources or sinks of infectious propagules, respectively. However, if the added host species have strong and asymmetric competitive effects on resident host species, then amplification and dilution are predicted to occur when the added host species have stronger competitive effects on resident host species that are sources or sinks of infectious propagules, respectively. My results also predict that greater dilution and less amplification is more likely to occur under frequency-dependent direct transmission than density-dependent direct transmission when (i) the added hosts have lower competence than resident host species and (ii) interspecific competition between the added host species and resident host species is lower; the opposite conditions promote greater amplification and less dilution under frequency-dependent direct transmission. This work helps identify and explain the mechanisms shaping the context-dependent relationships between host species richness and disease in multi-host communities.},

  abstract     = {Social animals often share information about the location of resources, such as a food source or a new nest-site. One well-studied communication strategy in ants is tandem running, whereby a leader guides a recruit to a resource. Tandem running is considered an example of animal teaching because a leader adjusts her behaviour and invests time to help another ant to learn the location of a resource more efficiently. Tandem running also has costs, such as waiting inside the nest for a leader and a reduced walking speed. Whether and when these costs outweigh the benefits of tandem running is not well understood. We developed an agent-based simulation model to investigate the conditions that favour communication by tandem running during foraging. We predicted that the spatio-temporal distribution of food sources, colony size and the ratio of scouts and recruits affect colony foraging success. Our results suggest that tandem running is favoured when food sources are hard to find, differ in energetic value and are long lasting. These results mirror the findings of simulations of honeybee communication. Scouts locate food sources faster than tandem followers in some environments, suggesting that tandem running may fulfil the criteria of teaching only in some situations. Furthermore, tandem running was only beneficial above a critical colony size threshold. Taken together, our model suggests that there is a considerable parameter range that favours colonies that do not use communication by tandem running, which could explain why many ants with small colony sizes forage solitarily.},

Identifying such species is thus a key component of predicting and possibly mitigating future epidemics. Despite this importance, intermediate host species have not been investigated in much detail, and have generally only been identified by testing for the presence of pathogens in multiple candidate species. In this paper, we present a mathematical model able to identify likely intermediate host species for emerging zoonoses based on ecological data for the candidates and epidemiological data for the pathogen. Since coronaviruses frequently emerge through intermediate host species and, at the time of writing, pose an urgent pandemic threat, we apply the model to the three emerging coronaviruses of the twenty-first century, accurately predicting palm civets as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-1 and dromedary camels as intermediate hosts for MERS. Further, we suggest mink, pangolins, and ferrets as intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2. With the capacity to evaluate intermediate host likelihood among different species, researchers can focus testing for possible infection sources and interventions more effectively.},

The study compares four GSA methods based on Sobol’ indices (SIs) quantifying the parameter influence on the difference between the model output and the heart rate data. The GSA methods include standard scalar SIs determining the average parameter influence over the time interval studied and three time-varying methods analyzing how parameter influence changes over time. The time-varying methods include a new technique, termed limited-memory SIs, predicting parameter influence using a moving window approach. Using the limited-memory SIs, we perform model reduction and selection to analyze the necessity of modeling both the aortic and carotid baroreceptor regions in response to the VM. We compare the original model to systematically reduced models including (i) the aortic and carotid regions, (ii) the aortic region only, and (iii) the carotid region only. Model selection is done quantitatively using the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria and qualitatively by comparing the neurological predictions. Results show that it is necessary to incorporate both the aortic and carotid regions to model the VM.},

Lung insults, such as respiratory infections and lung injuries, can damage the pulmonary epithelium, with the most severe cases needing mechanical ventilation for effective breathing and survival. Damaged epithelial cells within the alveoli trigger a local immune response. A key immune cell is the macrophage, which can differentiate into a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from pro- to anti-inflammatory. To gain a greater understanding of the mechanisms of the immune response to VILI and post-ventilation outcomes, we developed a mathematical model of interactions between the immune system and site of damage while accounting for macrophage phenotype. Through Latin hypercube sampling we generated a collection of parameter sets that are associated with a numerical steady state. We then simulated ventilation-induced damage using these steady state values as the initial conditions in order to evaluate how baseline immune state and lung health affect outcomes. We used a variety of methods to analyze the resulting parameter sets, transients, and outcomes, including a random forest decision tree algorithm and parameter sensitivity with eFAST. Analysis shows that parameters and properties of transients related to epithelial repair and M1 activation are important factors. Using the results of this analysis, we hypothesized interventions and used these treatment strategies to modulate the response to ventilation for particular parameters sets.},

  abstract     = {Most traits expressed by organisms, such as gene expression profiles, developmental trajectories, behavioural sequences and reaction norms are function-valued traits (colloquially “phenotypically plastic traits”), since they vary across an individual’s age and in response to various internal and/or external factors (state variables). Furthermore, most organisms live in populations subject to limited genetic mixing and are thus likely to interact with their relatives. We here formalise selection on genetically determined function-valued traits of individuals interacting in a group-structured population, by deriving the marginal version of Hamilton’s rule for function-valued traits. This rule simultaneously gives a condition for the invasion of an initially rare mutant function-valued trait and its ultimate fixation in the population (invasion thus implies substitution). Hamilton’s rule thus underlies the gradual evolution of function-valued traits and gives rise to necessary first-order conditions for their uninvadability (evolutionary stability). We develop a novel analysis using optimal control theory and differential game theory, to simultaneously characterise and compare the first-order conditions of (i) open-loop traits – functions of time (or age) only, and (ii) closed-loop (state-feedback) traits – functions of both time and state variables. We show that closed-loop traits can be represented as the simpler open-loop traits when individuals do not interact or when they interact with clonal relatives. Our analysis delineates the role of state-dependence and interdependence between individuals for trait evolution, which has implications to both life-history theory and social evolution.},

In the new approach, individuals have different heritable strategies; however, individuals carrying the same strategy can differ in terms of state, role or the situation in which they act. Thus, the classical replicator dynamics is completed by the additional subsystem of differential equations describing the dynamics of transitions between different states. In effect, the interactions described by game structure, in addition to the demographic payoffs (constituted by births and deaths), can lead to the change in state of the competing individuals. Special cases of reversible and irreversible incremental stage-structured models, where the state changes can describe energy accumulation, developmental steps or aging, are derived for discrete and continuous versions. The new approach is illustrated using the example of the Owner-Intruder game with explicit dynamics of the role changes. The new model presents a generalization of the demographic version of the Hawk-Dove game, with the difference being that the opponents in the game are drawn from two separate subpopulations consisting of Owners and Intruders. Here, the Intruders check random nest sites and play the Hawk-Dove game with the Owner if they are occupied. Meanwhile, the Owners produce newborns that become Intruders, since they must find a free nest site to reproduce. An interesting feedback mechanism is produced via the fluxes of individuals between the different subpopulations. In addition, the population growth suppression mechanism resulting from the fixation Bourgeois strategy is analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Apoptosis has been extensively characterized by both experimental approaches and model simulations. However, it is still not fully understood how the regulation occurs, especially in the intrinsic pathway, which can be activated by a great variety of signals. In addition, the conditions in which a point of no return could be reached remain elusive. In this work, we use differential equations models to approach these issues. Our starting point was the model for caspase activation of Legewie et al. (Legewie S, et al., PLoS Computational Biology 2006, 2(9): e120), which exhibits irreversible bistability. We added an activation module to this model, with the main events related to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, which includes cytochrome C release by the mitochondria and its effects on caspase activation and respiratory chain disruption. This “Extended Legewie Model” (ELM) uses BAK as the apoptotic stimulus and active caspase 3 as a measure of apoptosis activation. Unexpectedly, in the extended model, BAK cannot trigger apoptosis activation using physiologically sound initial values of the variables, due to limitations in apoptosome concentration increase. Therefore, the next step was to find a regulatory mechanism, allowing apoptosis activation in the ELM, starting from physiological initial concentrations. For this aim, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the 61 parameters of the system, finding that those producing the most relevant changes in the qualitative behaviour were the rates of synthesis of caspase 3, caspase 9 and XIAP. Based on these results, the transcription factor E2F was included in the ELM because it directly regulates the rate of synthesis of caspase 3 and 9. Depending on the concentration of E2F, the ELM shows different qualitative behaviours. On one hand, for low E2F apoptosis is impossible and for high E2F apoptosis is inevitable. Therefore, if E2F is sufficiently increased, the point of no return is crossed. On the other hand, for intermediate values of E2F there is a bistable region where the fate of the system also depends on the concentration of BAK and other signalling species.},

  abstract     = {The retina is a part of the central nervous system that is accessible, well documented, and studied by researchers spanning the clinical, experimental, and theoretical sciences. Here, we mathematically model the subcircuits of the outer plexiform layer of the retina on two spatial scales: that of an individual synapse and that of the scale of the receptive field (hundreds to thousands of synapses). To this end we formulate a continuum spine model (a partial differential equation system) that incorporates the horizontal cell syncytium and its numerous processes (spines) within cone pedicles. With this multiscale modeling approach, detailed biophysical mechanisms at the synaptic level are retained while scaling up to the receptive field level. As an example of its utility, the model is applied to study background-induced flicker enhancement in which the onset of a dim background enhances the center flicker response of horizontal cells. Simulation results, in comparison with flicker enhancement data for square, slit, and disk test regions, suggest that feedback mechanisms that are voltage-axis modulators of cone calcium channels (for example, ephaptic and/or pH feedback) are robust in capturing the temporal dynamics of background-induced flicker enhancement. The value and potential of this continuum spine approach is that it provides a framework for mathematically modeling the input-output properties of the entire receptive field of the outer retina while implementing the latest models for transmission mechanisms at the synaptic level.},

  abstract     = {Many sea slugs of Sacoglossa (Mollusca: Heterobranchia) are sometimes called “solar-powered sea slugs” because they keep chloroplasts obtained from their food algae and receive photosynthetic products (termed kleptoplasty). Some species show life cycle dimorphism, in which a single species has some individuals with a complex life cycle (the mother produces planktotrophic larvae, which later settle in the adult habitat) and others with a simple life cycle (mothers produce benthic offspring by direct development or short-term nonfeeding larvae in which feeding planktonic stages are skipped). Life cycle dimorphism is not common among marine species. In this paper, we ask whether some aspects of the ecology of solar-powered sea slugs have promoted the evolution of life cycle dimorphism in them. We study the population dynamics of the two life-cycle types that differ in summer (one with planktonic life and the other with benthic life), but both have benthic life in other seasons. We obtain the conditions in which two types with different life cycles coexist stably or a single type generating offspring with different life cycles evolves. We conclude that the stable coexistence of two life cycles can evolve if benthic individuals in summer experience strongly density-dependent processes or if the between-year fluctuation of biomass growth in summer is very large. We discuss whether these results match the life cycles of solar-powered sea slugs with life cycle dimorphism.},

Kinetic growth parameters were first determined empirically for an initial cell number of 10 4 cells. Monte Carlo simulation based on the growth kinetics and Poisson distribution for different initial cell numbers predicted the results of 50 replicate growth experiments with the initial cell number of 1, 10, and 64 cells. Indeed, measured behavior of 85\% cells fell within the 95\% prediction area of the simulation. The calculations link the kinetic and stochastic birth process with Poisson distribution. The developed model can be used to calculate the probability distribution of population size for exposure assessment and for the evaluation of a probability that a pathogen would exceed critical contamination level during food storage.},

  abstract     = {Organisms continuously modify their living conditions via extended genetic effects on their environment, microbiome, and in some species culture. These effects can impact the fitness of current but also future conspecifics due to non-genetic transmission via ecological or cultural inheritance. In this case, selection on a gene with extended effects depends on the degree to which current and future genetic relatives are exposed to modified conditions. Here, we detail the selection gradient on a quantitative trait with extended effects in a patch-structured population, when gene flow between patches is limited and ecological inheritance within patches can be biased towards offspring. Such a situation is relevant to understand evolutionary driven changes in individual condition that can be preferentially transmitted from parent to offspring, such as cellular state, micro-environments (e.g., nests), pathogens, microbiome, or culture. Our analysis quantifies how the interaction between limited gene flow and biased ecological inheritance influences the joint evolutionary dynamics of traits together with the conditions they modify, helping understand adaptation via non-genetic modifications. As an illustration, we apply our analysis to a gene-culture coevolution scenario in which genetically-determined learning strategies coevolve with adaptive knowledge. In particular, we show that when social learning is synergistic, selection can favour strategies that generate remarkable levels of knowledge under intermediate levels of both vertical cultural transmission and limited dispersal. More broadly, our theory yields insights into the interplay between genetic and non-genetic inheritance, with implications for how organisms evolve to transform their environments.},

We find that the effect of syncytia on viral titer is only apparent when the basic reproduction number for infection via syncytia formation is similar to the reproduction number for cell free viral transmission. When syncytia fusion rate is high, we find the presence of syncytia can lead to slowly growing infections if viral production is suppressed in syncytia.

  abstract     = {Plant morphology emerges from cellular growth and structure. The turgor-driven diffuse growth of a cell can be highly anisotropic: significant longitudinally and negligible radially. Such anisotropy is ensured by cellulose microfibrils (CMF) reinforcing the cell wall in the hoop direction. To maintain the cell’s integrity during growth, new wall material including CMF must be continually deposited. We develop a mathematical model representing the cell as a cylindrical pressure vessel and the cell wall as a fibre-reinforced viscous sheet, explicitly including the mechano-sensitive angle of CMF deposition. The model incorporates interactions between turgor, external forces, CMF reorientation during wall extension, and matrix stiffening. Using the model, we reinterpret some recent experimental findings, and reexamine the popular hypothesis of CMF/microtubule alignment. We explore how the handedness of twisting cell growth depends on external torque and intrinsic wall properties, and find that cells twist left-handedly ‘by default’ in some suitable sense. Overall, this study provides a unified mechanical framework for understanding left- and right-handed twist-growth as seen in many plants.},

  abstract     = {Ever since Nirenberg’s discovery in 1961 in which codons code individual amino acids, numerous scientists searched for symmetries within the genetic code. The standard genetic code (SGC) table is an alphabetic artificial construct based on the U-C-A-G ordering of nucleotides without natural symmetries. Up to the present, complete symmetry in the genetic code has not been found, leaving doubt as to whether the symmetrical nature as the protector of order even exists. Our novel Ideal Symmetry Genetic Code (ISyGC) table reflects a unique fundamental physicochemical purine-pyrimidine symmetry net for all more than thirty known variations of nuclear and mitochondrial genetic codes. The nuclear genetic code for RNA and DNA viruses also contains the same purine-pyrimidine symmetry net. We show that the ISyGC table leads to automatic transformation into a DNA sequence akin to the 5′3 codon and 3′5 anticodon patterns. As a result of purine-pyrimidine symmetries between codons in the ISyGC table, algorithms of the first two bases as well of the third base of codons show how tRNA cognate anticodons can recognize synonymous codons during mRNA decoding. We show that the ISyGC purine-pyrimidine net with its physicochemical properties represents an evolutionary common “frozen accident” at the onset of each genetic code creation and RNA to DNA evolution. As such, during all of evolution the unique fundamental purine-pyrimidine symmetry net of all genetic codes remains unchangeable. In this way, evolution is a road paved with symmetries.},

In this theoretical study we use a mathematical modelling and computational approach to investigate the role of macrophages with mixed phenotype on growth/control/elimination of lung tumours. We show that tumour control in the presence of M2 → → M1 re-polarising treatments is mainly the result of macrophages with mixed phenotypes (due to the assumption of short half-life of M1-like macrophages). We also show that the half-life of various macrophage phenotypes (distinct M1 or mixed M1/M2 phenotypes) impacts the outcome of various therapeutic strategies targeting tumour-associated macrophages. All these results suggest the need for a better experimental understanding of the kinetics of macrophages inside solid tumours.},

In the framework of evolutionary game theory, punishing strategies are frequently used to promote cooperation in competitive environments. Here, we introduce altruistic punishers in the spatial public goods game. This strategy acts as a cooperator in the absence of defectors, otherwise it will punish all defectors in their vicinity while bearing a cost to do so. We observe three distinct behaviours in our model: i) in the absence of punishers, cooperators (who don’t punish defectors) are driven to extinction by defectors for most parameter values; ii) clusters of punishers thrive by sharing the punishment costs when these are low; iii) for higher punishment costs, punishers, when alone, are subject to exploitation but in the presence of cooperators can form a symbiotic spatial structure that benefits both. This last observation is our main finding since neither cooperation nor punishment alone can survive the defector strategy in this parameter region and the specificity of the symbiotic spatial configuration shows that lattice topology plays a central role in sustaining cooperation. Results were obtained by means of Monte Carlo simulations on a square lattice and subsequently confirmed by a pairwise comparison of different strategies’ payoffs in diverse group compositions, leading to a phase diagram of the possible states.},

Many of the homelands predicted by our analysis match the assumed homelands of known successful populations (e.g. Bantus, Turkic, Maya). We also predict other likely homelands as well, where further archaeological, linguistic or genetic exploration may confirm the place of origin for populations with no currently identified urheimat.

  abstract     = {The metastasis of malignant epithelial tumors begins with the egress of transformed cells from the confines of their basement membrane (BM) to their surrounding collagen-rich stroma. Invasion can be morphologically diverse: when breast cancer cells are separately cultured within BM-like matrix, collagen I (Coll I), or a combination of both, they exhibit collective-, dispersed mesenchymal-, and a mixed collective-dispersed (multimodal)- invasion, respectively. In this paper, we asked how distinct these invasive modes are with respect to the cellular and microenvironmental cues that drive them. A rigorous computational exploration of invasion was performed within an experimentally motivated Cellular Potts-based modeling environment. The model comprised of adhesive interactions between cancer cells, BM- and Coll I-like extracellular matrix (ECM), and reaction–diffusion-based remodeling of ECM. The model outputs were parameters cognate to dispersed- and collective- invasion. A clustering analysis of the output distribution curated through a careful examination of subsumed phenotypes suggested at least four distinct invasive states: dispersed, papillary-collective, bulk-collective, and multimodal, in addition to an indolent/non-invasive state. Mapping input values to specific output clusters suggested that each of these invasive states are specified by distinct input signatures of proliferation, adhesion and ECM remodeling. In addition, specific input perturbations allowed transitions between the clusters and revealed the variation in the robustness between the invasive states. Our systems-level approach proffers quantitative insights into how the diversity in ECM microenvironments may steer invasion into diverse phenotypic modes during early dissemination of breast cancer and contributes to tumor heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {A plant can sire more seeds by increasing the number of pollen recipient flowers or the amount of pollen deposited on recipient flowers. We theoretically analyzed how pollen stickiness contributes to paternal fitness through changing the pattern of pollen dispersal including both the number of recipient flowers and overall pollen deposition (the overall amount of pollen deposited on recipient flowers) in animal-pollinated plants. We developed a numerical model in which pollen stickiness to pollinators increases with production of expensive materials on pollen surfaces, and a high level of stickiness diminishes the proportions of pollen lost from a pollinator body during a flight and pollen deposited on a stigma during a visit. We found that the number of recipient flowers monotonically increased with increasing pollen stickiness allocation while overall pollen deposition was maximized at a certain amount of stickiness allocation. We demonstrated that evolutionarily stable pollen stickiness attained many recipient flowers at the expense of overall pollen deposition in most cases while it merely favored maximization of overall pollen deposition in all other cases. Sticky pollen evolved if pollinators were highly likely to drop pollen during flights and did not diffuse well. In this situation, the evolutionarily stable pattern of pollen dispersal was acquisition of many pollen recipient flowers rather than maximization of overall pollen deposition. Sticky pollen also evolved if additional sticking elements were moderately effective in increasing the force of adhesion to pollinators. Pollen stickiness has a significant effect on the pattern of pollen dispersal via the extent of pollen carryover, and our results suggest that plants maximize paternal fitness by giving pollen the optimal stickiness, which varies with pollinating partners.},

  abstract     = {The question of which mechanical variables are responsible for inducing osteogenic activity is unresolved despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigation. Candidate variables include strain magnitude, loading frequency, the interaction of magnitude and frequency (strain rate), and strain gradients. An additional challenge is discerning the coordination of periosteal and endosteal expansion during growth, and whether this coordination (or lack thereof) is fully dependent or partially independent of the local mechanical environment. In this study, under the assumption that calculated stresses correspond to relative strain magnitudes, we specify alternative growth algorithms of bone cross-sectional size and geometry to explore skeletal growth under alternative scenarios of osteogenic activity that are tracking 1) an attractor stress, 2) local stress magnitude or 3) steepness of stress gradients. These developmental simulations are initiated from two initial geometries (symmetrical and asymmetrical ellipses) under a time-varying torsional load whose magnitude is proportional to body size growth in a model primate. In addition, we model endosteal expansion under three conditions hypothesized in the literature, in which endosteal expansion is 1) independent of the mechanical milieu, 2) completely dependent on the mechanical milieu, and 3) a “hybrid” model in which intrinsic biological (independent) growth is operative early but gives way to mechanically-sensitive (dependent) growth at later ages. Three variables were recorded over each growth simulation: the safety factor (ratio of yield stress to actual stress), an efficiency ratio (invested bone area per unit of stress), and proximity to an isostress condition (an optimal design criterion in which stress is invariant throughout the structure). The attractor stress algorithm produces the most “adapted” bones in terms of mechanical competence and economy of material. Localized osteogenic activity that is guided in direct proportion to stress magnitude produces competent bones but with variable adult geometries depending on conditions of endosteal expansion. Stress gradients also produce functional but relatively inefficient bones, with widely variable safety factors during growth and heterogeneous stress fields. If, in fact, the osteocyte network monitors strain gradients to generate osteogenic signals, the resulting morphology is competent but falls well short of an optimal mechanical solution.},

  abstract     = {Random walks (RWs) have proved to be a powerful modelling tool in ecology, particularly in the study of animal movement. An application of RW concerns trapping which is the predominant sampling method to date in insect ecology and agricultural pest management. A lot of research effort has been directed towards modelling ground-dwelling insects by simulating their movement in 2D, and computing pitfall trap counts, but comparatively very little for flying insects with 3D elevated traps. We introduce the mathematics behind 3D RWs and present key metrics such as the mean squared displacement (MSD) and path sinuosity, which are already well known in 2D. We develop the mathematical theory behind the 3D correlated random walk (CRW) which involves short-term directional persistence and the 3D Biased random walk (BRW) which introduces a long-term directional bias in the movement so that there is an overall preferred movement direction. In this study, we focus on the geometrical aspects of the 3D trap and thus consider three types of shape; a spheroidal trap, a cylindrical trap and a rectangular cuboidal trap. By simulating movement in 3D space, we investigated the effect of 3D trap shapes and sizes and of movement diffusion on trapping efficiency. We found that there is a non-linear dependence of trap counts on the trap surface area or volume, but the effect of volume appeared to be a simple consequence of changes in area. Nevertheless, there is a slight but clear hierarchy of trap shapes in terms of capture efficiency, with the spheroidal trap retaining more counts than a cylinder, followed by the cuboidal type for a given area. We also showed that there is no effect of short-term persistence when diffusion is kept constant, but trap counts significantly decrease with increasing diffusion. Our results provide a better understanding of the interplay between the movement pattern, trap geometry and impacts on trapping efficiency, which leads to improved trap count interpretations, and more broadly, has implications for spatial ecology and population dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The life cycle of parasitic organisms that are the cause of much morbidity in humans often depend on reservoirs of infection for transmission into their hosts. Understanding the daily, monthly and yearly movement patterns of individuals between reservoirs is therefore of great importance to implementers of control policies seeking to eliminate various parasitic diseases as a public health problem. This is due to the fact that the underlying spatial extent of the reservoir of infection, which drives transmission, can be strongly affected by inputs from external sources, i.e., individuals who are not spatially attributed to the region defined by the reservoir itself can still migrate and contribute to it. In order to study the importance of these effects, we build and examine a novel theoretical model of human movement between spatially-distributed focal points for infection clustered into regions defined as ‘reservoirs of infection’. Using our model, we vary the spatial scale of human moment defined around focal points and explicitly calculate how varying this definition can influence the temporal stability of the effective transmission dynamics – an effect which should strongly influence how control measures, e.g., mass drug administration (MDA), define evaluation units (EUs). Considering the helminth parasites as our main example, by varying the spatial scale of human movement, we demonstrate that a critical scale exists around infectious focal points at which the migration rate into their associated reservoir can be neglected for practical purposes. This scale varies by species and geographic region, but is generalisable as a concept to infectious reservoirs of varying spatial extents and shapes. Our model is designed to be applicable to a very general pattern of infectious disease transmission modified by the migration of infected individuals between clustered communities. In particular, it may be readily used to study the spatial structure of hosts for macroparasites with temporally stationary distributions of infectious focal point locations over the timescales of interest, which is viable for the soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomes. Additional developments will be necessary to consider diseases with moving reservoirs, such as vector-born filarial worm diseases.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider the time evolution of a population of size N N with overlapping generations, in the vicinity of m m genes. We assume that this population is subject to point mutations , genetic drift, and selection. More specifically, we analyze the statistical distribution of the waiting time T m Tm until the expression of these genes have changed for all individuals, when transcription factors recognize and attach to short DNA-sequences (binding sites) within regulatory sequences in the neighborhoods of the m m genes. The evolutionary dynamics is described by a multitype Moran process, where each individual is assigned a m × L m×L regulatory array that consists of regulatory sequences with L L nucleotides for all m m genes. We study how the waiting time distribution depends on the number of genes, the mutation rate, the length of the binding sites, the length of the regulatory sequences, and the way in which the targeted binding sites are coordinated for different genes in terms of selection coefficients. These selection coefficients depend on how many binding sites have appeared so far, and possibly on their order of appearance. We also allow for back mutations, whereby some acquired binding sites may be lost over time. It is further assumed that the mutation rate is small enough to warrant a fixed state population, so that all individuals have the same regulatory array, at any given time point, until the next successful mutation arrives in some individual and spreads to the rest of the population. We further incorporate stochastic tunneling, whereby successful mutations get mutated before their fixation. A crucial part of our approach is to divide the huge state space of regulatory arrays into a small number of components, assuming that the array component varies as a Markov process over time. This implies that T m Tm is the time until this Markov process hits an absorbing state, with a phase-type distribution. A number of interesting results can be derived from our general setup, for instance that the expected waiting time increases exponentially with m m , for a selectively neutral model, when back-mutations are possible.},

It is endemic in 13 different states in Brazil and responsible for increasing morbidity in the population. One of its main characteristics is a heterogeneous distribution of worm burden in the human population, which makes the diagnosis difficult. We aimed to investigate how the sensitivity of the diagnostic method may contribute to successful control interventions against infections in a population. In order to do that, we present an ordinary differential equations model that considers three levels of worm burden in the human population, a snail population, and a miracidium reservoir. Through a steady-state analysis and its local stability, we show how this worm-burden heterogeneity can be responsible for the persistence of infection, especially due to reinfection in the highest level of worm burden. The analysis highlights sensitive diagnosis, besides treatment and sanitary improvements, as a key factor for schistosomiasis transmission control.},

In the “standard” pattern (ST), the abundance of probiotic bacteria was high in the proximal end, and it decreased toward the distal end; in contrast, the abundance of non-probiotic bacteria was low in the proximal end, and it increased toward the distal end. In the “proximal reversion” pattern (PR), non-probiotic bacteria were dominant and probiotic bacteria were suppressed in the proximal portion of the duct. Subsequently, the abundance values of the two competitors switched, followed by a spatial pattern similar to ST. In the “distal suppression” pattern (DS), the pattern was similar to ST in the proximal portion; however, toward the distal end, the abundance of probiotic bacteria remained at an intermediate level and suppressed the abundance of non-probiotic bacteria, resulting in a peak abundance of non-probiotic bacteria in the middle portion of the duct. We additionally discuss the nonmonotonic increase in the abundance of non-probiotic bacteria in ST and the transition of the spatial pattern from one type to another due to changes in the resource abundance in the influx.},

In this study, we have mathematically modelled strategies for the employment of the hospital workforce with the goal of simulating the health and productivity of the workers. The models were designed to determine if desynchronization of medical teams by dichotomizing the workers may protect the workforce.

  abstract     = {A substantial body of work has shown that local transmission selects for less acute, ‘prudent’ parasites that have lower virulence and transmission rates. This is because parasite strains with higher transmission rates ‘self-shade’ due to a combination of genetic correlations (self: clustered related parasite strains compete for susceptible individuals) and ecological correlations (shade: infected individuals clustering and blocking transmission). However, the interaction of ecological and genetic correlations alongside higher order ecological effects such as patch extinctions means that spatial evolutionary effects can be nuanced; theory has predicted that a relatively small proportion of local infection can select for highest virulence, such that there is a humped relationship between the degree of local infection and the harm that parasites are selected to cause. Here, we examine the separate roles of the interaction scales of reproduction and infection in the context of different degrees of pathogenic castration in determining virulence evolution outcomes. Our key result is that, as long as there is significant reproduction from infected individuals, local infection always selects for lower virulence, and that the prediction that a small proportion of local infection can select for higher virulence only occurs for highly castrating pathogens. The results emphasize the importance of demography for evolutionary outcomes in spatially structured populations, but also show that the core prediction that parasites are prudent in space is reasonable for the vast majority of host-parasite interactions and mixing patterns in nature.},

  abstract     = {Biological experiments have shown that yeast can be restricted to grow in a uniaxial direction, vertically upwards from an agar plate to form a colony. The growth occurs as a consequence of cell proliferation driven by a nutrient supply at the base of the colony, and the height of the colony has been observed to increase linearly with time. Within the colony the nutrient concentration is non-constant and yeast cells throughout the colony will therefore not have equal access to nutrient, resulting in non-uniform growth. In this work, an agent based model is developed to predict the microscopic spatial distribution of labelled cells within the colony when the probability of cell proliferation can vary in space and time. We also describe a method for determining the average trajectories or pathlines of labelled cells within a colony growing in a uniaxial direction, enabling us to connect the microscopic and macroscopic behaviours of the system. We present results for six cases, which involve different assumptions for the presence or absence of a quiescent region (where no cell proliferation occurs), the size of the proliferative region, and the spatial variation of proliferation rates within the proliferative region. These six cases are designed to provide qualitative insight into likely growth scenarios whilst remaining amenable to analysis. We compare our macroscopic results to experimental observations of uniaxial colony growth for two cases where only a fixed number of cells at the base of the colony can proliferate. The model predicts that the height of the colony will increase linearly with time in both these cases, which is consistent with experimental observations. However, our model shows how different functional forms for the spatial dependence of the proliferation rate can be distinguished by tracking the pathlines of cells at different positions in the colony. More generally, our methodology can be applied to other biological systems exhibiting uniaxial growth, providing a framework for classifying or determining regions of uniform and non-uniform growth.},

  abstract     = {The maximum running speed of legged animals is one evident factor for evolutionary selection—for predators and prey. Therefore, it has been studied across the entire size range of animals, from the smallest mites to the largest elephants, and even beyond to extinct dinosaurs. A recent analysis of the relation between animal mass (size) and maximum running speed showed that there seems to be an optimal range of body masses in which the highest terrestrial running speeds occur. However, the conclusion drawn from that analysis—namely, that maximum speed is limited by the fatigue of white muscle fibres in the acceleration of the body mass to some theoretically possible maximum speed—was based on coarse reasoning on metabolic grounds, which neglected important biomechanical factors and basic muscle-metabolic parameters. Here, we propose a generic biomechanical model to investigate the allometry of the maximum speed of legged running. The model incorporates biomechanically important concepts: the ground reaction force being counteracted by air drag, the leg with its gearing of both a muscle into a leg length change and the muscle into the ground reaction force, as well as the maximum muscle contraction velocity, which includes muscle–tendon dynamics, and the muscle inertia—with all of them scaling with body mass. Put together, these concepts’ characteristics and their interactions provide a mechanistic explanation for the allometry of maximum legged running speed. This accompanies the offering of an explanation for the empirically found, overall maximum in speed: In animals bigger than a cheetah or pronghorn, the time that any leg-extending muscle needs to settle, starting from being isometric at about midstance, at the concentric contraction speed required for running at highest speeds becomes too long to be attainable within the time period of a leg moving from midstance to lift-off. Based on our biomechanical model, we, thus, suggest considering the overall speed maximum to indicate muscle inertia being functionally significant in animal locomotion. Furthermore, the model renders possible insights into biological design principles such as differences in the leg concept between cats and spiders , and the relevance of multi-leg (mammals: four, insects: six, spiders : eight) body designs and emerging gaits. Moreover, we expose a completely new consideration regarding the muscles’ metabolic energy consumption, both during acceleration to maximum speed and in steady-state locomotion.},

  abstract     = {Attention Schema Theory (AST) is a recent proposal to provide a scientific explanation for the basis of subjective awareness. In AST, the brain constructs a representation of attention taking place in its own (and others’) mind (‘the attention schema’). Moreover, this representation is incomplete for efficiency reasons. This inherent incompleteness of the attention schema results in the inability of humans to understand how their own subjective awareness arises (related to the so-called ‘hard problem’ of consciousness). Given this theory, the present paper asks whether a mind (either human or machine-based) that incorporates attention, and that contains a representation of its own attention, can ever have a complete representation. Using a simple yet general model and a mathematical argument based on classical topology, we show that a complete representation of attention is not possible, since it cannot faithfully represent streams of attention. In this way, the study supports one of the core aspects of AST, that the brain’s representation of its own attention is necessarily incomplete.},

  abstract     = {The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already created emergency situations in almost every country of the world. The disease spreads all over the world within a very short period of time after its first identification in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. In India, the outbreak, starts on 2 nd 2nd March, 2020 and after that the cases are increasing exponentially. Very high population density, the unavailability of specific medicines or vaccines, insufficient evidences regarding the transmission mechanism of the disease also make it more difficult to fight against the disease properly in India. Mathematical models have been used to predict the disease dynamics and also to assess the efficiency of the intervention strategies in reducing the disease burden. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to describe the disease transmission mechanism between the individuals. Our proposed model is fitted to the daily new reported cases in India during the period 2 nd 2nd March, 2020 to 12 th 12th November, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number and epidemic doubling time from the incidence data for the above-mentioned period. We further assess the effect of implementing preventive measures in reducing the new cases. Our model projects the daily new COVID-19 cases in India during 13 th 13th November, 2020 to 25 th 25th February, 2021 for a range of intervention strength. We also investigate that higher intervention effort is required to control the disease outbreak within a shorter period of time in India. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the strength of the intervention should be increased over the time to eradicate the disease effectively.},

These viruses are well-studied, but there exist a wide range of coexisting virus lifestyles that are less understood. Temperate viruses exhibit both a lytic cycle and a latent (lysogenic) cycle, in which viral genomes are integrated into the bacterial host. Meanwhile, chronic (persistent) viruses use cell functions to produce more viruses without killing the cell; chronic viruses may also exhibit a latent stage in addition to the productive stage. Here, we study the ecology of these competing viral strategies. We demonstrate the conditions under which each strategy is dominant, which aids in control of human bacterial infections using viruses. We find that low lysogen frequencies provide competitive advantages for both virus types; however, chronic viruses maximize steady state density by eliminating lysogeny entirely, while temperate viruses exhibit a non-zero ‘sweet spot’ lysogen frequency. Viral steady state density maximization leads to coexistence of temperate and chronic viruses, explaining the presence of multiple viral strategies in natural environments.},

Despite a number of experimental and numerical studies regarding CSF flow, the underlying mechanics of CSF flow are still debated, especially regarding whether an arterial pulsation can indeed produce net CSF flow velocity. Furthermore, the relationship between CSF flow and arterial wall pulsation has not been fully defined. To clarify these questions, we numerically investigated the CSF flow in the PVS in an axisymmetric channel with a pulsating boundary, where CSF is modeled as an incompressible, Newtonian viscous fluid in non-porous space. Our numerical results show that the net CSF flow velocity driven by the arterial pulsation is consistent with that of previous animal experiments. However, the peak oscillatory velocity is two orders of magnitude larger than the net velocity. Interestingly, the net CSF flow velocity collapses on the analytical solution derived from the lubrication theory in analogy with Taylor’s swimming sheet model.},

  abstract     = {Protein synthesis is a crucial process in any cell. Translation, in which mRNA is translated into proteins, can lead to several errors, notably frame shifts where the ribosome accidentally skips or re-reads one or more nucleotides. So-called circular codes are capable of discovering frame shifts and their codons can be found disproportionately often in coding sequences. Here, we analyzed motifs of circular codes, i.e. sequences only containing codons of circular codes, in biological and artificial sequences. The lengths of these motifs were compared to a statistical model in order to elucidate if coding sequences contain significantly longer motifs than non-coding sequences. Our findings show that coding sequences indeed show on average greater motif lengths than expected by chance. On the other hand, the motifs are too short for a possible frame shift recognition to take place within an entire coding sequence. This suggests that as much as circular codes might have been used in ancient life forms in order to prevent frame shift errors, it remains to be seen whether they are still functional in current organisms.},

We synthetically consider both the number of infected population and its changing rate as the switching condition to implement the curing measures. By using the properties of the Lambert W function, we convert the proposed switching condition to a threshold value related to the susceptible population. The classical epidemic model involving media coverage, linear functions describing injecting vaccine and treatment strategies is examined when the susceptible population exceeds the threshold value. In addition, we consider another SIR model accompanied with the vaccination and treatment strategies represented by saturation functions when the susceptible population is smaller than the threshold value. The dynamics of these two subsystems and the sliding domain are discussed in detail. Four types of local sliding bifurcation are investigated, including boundary focus, boundary node, boundary saddle and boundary saddle-node bifurcations. In the meantime, the global bifurcation involving the appearance of limit cycles is examined, including touching bifurcation, homoclinic bifurcation to the pseudo-saddle and crossing bifurcation. Furthermore, the influence of some key parameters related to the three treatment strategies is explored. We also validate our model by the epidemic data sets of A/H1N1 and COVID-19, which can be employed to reveal the effects of media report and existing strategy related to the control of emerging infectious diseases on the variations of confirmed cases.},

Its application to natural systems is still limited by the complexity of ecological time series displaying great variation in the frequency and amplitude of their fluctuations, which are not fully resolved by current ecological theories of spatial synchrony. In particular, while environmental fluctuations and limited dispersal can each control the dynamics of frequency and amplitude of population fluctuations, ecological theories of spatial synchrony still need to resolve their role on synchrony and stability in heterogeneous metacommunities. Here, we adopt a heterogeneous predator–prey metacommunity model and study the response of dispersal-driven phase locking and frequency modulation to among-patch heterogeneity in carrying capacity. We find that frequency modulation occurs at intermediate values of dispersal and habitat heterogeneity. We also show how frequency modulation can emerge in metacommunities of autonomously oscillating populations as well as through the forcing of local communities at equilibrium. Frequency modulation was further found to produce temporal variation in population amplitudes, promoting local and regional stability through cyclic patterns of local and regional variability. Our results highlight the importance of approaching spatial synchrony as a non-stationary phenomenon, with implications for the assessment and interpretation of spatial synchrony observed in experimental and natural systems.},

Our model tracks a continuous phenotype distribution through the various seasons from year to year. We analyze a special case of a monomorphic population with the tools of adaptive dynamics. We analyze the general case by a moment approximation. We find that (the mean of) flowering onset converges to some intermediate time within the favorable season. In the monomorphic case, we prove that this is an ESS.

While we now have a good theoretical understanding of how individuals adjust their behavior, the population dynamical consequences of co-adaptive behaviors are rarely described. Further, mechanistic descriptions of ecosystem functions are based on population models that seldom take behavior into account. Here, we present a model that combines the population dynamics and adaptive behavior of organisms of two populations simultaneously. We explore how the Nash equilibrium of a system – i.e. the optimal behavior of its constituent organisms – can shape population dynamics, and conversely how population dynamics impact the Nash equilibrium of the system. We illustrate this for the case of diel vertical migration (DVM), the daily movement of marine organisms between food-depleted but safe dark depths and more risky nutrition-rich surface waters. DVM represents the archetypal example of populations choosing between a foraging arena (the upper sunlit ocean) and a refuge (the dark depths). We show that population sizes at equilibrium are significantly different if organisms can adapt their behavior, and that optimal DVM behaviors within the community vary significantly if population dynamics are considered. As a consequence, ecosystem function estimates such as trophic transfer efficiency and vertical carbon export differ greatly when fitness seeking behavior is included. Ignoring the role of behavior in multi-trophic population modeling can potentially lead to inaccurate predictions of population biomasses and ecosystem functions.},

As soil temperatures increase due to climate change, there is potential for faster growth rates of PCN, allowing development of multiple generations in a growing season. We develop a process-based temperature-dependent model representing the life cycle of Globodera pallida , comprising juvenile, adult and cyst/diapause stages. To incorporate variability in the amount of time spent in each stage caused by genetic/environmental variation, the model is based on a mix of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with sub-stages, and delay differential equations (DDEs). The effect of climate change is incorporated through the influence of soil temperature on the rate of development and survival in the hatching and juvenile stages. The level of the plant resistance to PCN is incorporated via the proportion of juveniles which become adults. After comparing the model with field data we run simulations to explore the effects of temperature and resistance on PCN populations. We find that with higher temperatures and longer growing seasons multiple generations of PCN can develop within a season, provided any required diapause period is short. Despite this, we show that growing resistant potatoes is a very effective control strategy and planting potatoes with even moderate levels of resistance can counter the effects of climate change.},

  abstract     = {In this review, we focus on the antennal lobe (AL) of three insect species – the fruit fly, sphinx moth, and locust. We first review the experimentally elucidated anatomy and physiology of the early olfactory system of each species; empirical studies of AL activity, however, often focus on assessing firing rates (averaged over time scales of about 100 ms), and hence the AL odor code is often analyzed in terms of a temporally evolving vector of firing rates. However, such a perspective necessarily misses the possibility of higher order temporal correlations in spiking activity within a single cell and across multiple cells over shorter time scales (of about 10 ms). Hence, we then review our prior theoretical work, where we constructed biophysically detailed, species-specific AL models within the fly, moth, and locust, finding that in each case higher order temporal correlations in spiking naturally emerge from model dynamics (i.e., without a priori incorporation of elements designed to produce correlated activity). We therefore use our theoretical work to argue the perspective that temporal correlations in spiking over short time scales, which have received little experimental attention to-date, may provide valuable coding dimensions (complementing the coding dimensions provided by the vector of firing rates) that nature has exploited in the encoding of odors within the AL. We further argue that, if the AL does indeed utilize temporally correlated activity to represent odor information, such an odor code could be naturally and easily deciphered within the Mushroom Body.},

Sometimes under-appreciated, however, is that the fitness landscape and its topography do not by themselves determine the direction of evolution: under sufficiently high mutation rates, populations can climb the closest fitness peak (survival of the fittest), settle in lower regions with higher mutational robustness (survival of the flattest), or even fail to adapt altogether (error catastrophes). I show that another measure of reproductive success, Fisher’s reproductive value , resolves the trade-off between fitness and robustness in the quasi-species regime of evolution: to forecast the motion of a population in genotype space, one should look for peaks in the (mutation-rate dependent) landscape of genotypic reproductive values—whether or not these peaks correspond to local fitness maxima or flat fitness plateaus. This new landscape picture turns quasi-species dynamics into an instance of non-equilibrium dynamics, in the physical sense of Markovian processes, potential landscapes, entropy production, etc.},

  abstract     = {Tumors have developed multitude of ways to evade immune response and suppress cytotoxic T cells. Programed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) are immune checkpoints that when activated, rapidly inactivate the cytolytic activity of T cells. Expression heterogeneity of PD-L1 and the surface receptor dynamics of both PD-1 and PD-L1 may be important parameters in modulating the immune response. PD-L1 is expressed on both tumor and non-tumor immune cells and this differential expression reflects different aspects of anti-tumor immunity. Here, we developed a mechanistic computational model to investigate the role of PD-1 and PD-L1 dynamics in modulating the efficacy of PD-1 and PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Our model incorporates immunological synapse restricted interaction of PD-1 and PD-L1, basal parameters for receptor dynamics, and T cell interaction with tumor and non-tumor immune cells. Simulations predict the existence of a threshold in PD-1 expression above which there is no efficacy for both anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1. Model also predicts that anti-tumor response is more sensitive to PD-L1 expression on non-tumor immune cells than tumor cells. New combination strategies are suggested that may enhance efficacy in resistant cases such as combining anti-PD-1 with a low dose of anti-PD-L1 or with inhibitors of PD-L1 recycling and synthesis. Another combination strategy suggested by the model is the combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 with enhancers of PD-L1 degradation rate. Virtual patients are then generated to test specific biomarkers of response. Intriguing predictions that emerge from the virtual patient simulations are that PD-1 blocking antibody results in higher response rate than PD-L1 blockade and that PD-L1 expression density on non-tumor immune cells rather than tumor cells is a predictor of response.},

  abstract     = {p53, an anti-tumour protein, is significantly inactivated in most tumours. A small molecule of nutlin-3a is used to activate its function by repressing (Mouse double minute 2 homolog) Mdm2 protein which inhibits its activity. In cancer patients, a high risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is observed owing to their multi-dosing prescriptions, which may lead them to harmful effects. In the presented work, we have aimed to investigate the effect of pharmacodynamical interaction between two anti-cancer drugs, nutlin-3a and aspirin in the activation of p53 protein. We have adapted control system techniques and designed a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. This controller is used to activate p53 protein. A drug interaction parameter is used to incorporate the effect of both drugs. Extensive simulation is performed using two different doses of aspirin, i.e. a low and a high dose of aspirin. The result shows no harmful effects of pharmacodynamical interaction when a low dose is administered along with nutlin-3a. When a high dose of aspirin is administered it acts as input disturbance and leads to undesirable over-expression of p53 protein. This can further harm other growth cells, thus inducing harmful effects. A comparative analysis is also tabulated with different dosing regimens which shows that a combination of nutlin-3a and a low dose of aspirin provides better results than a high dose of aspirin. Overall, the work provides an insight to the activation of p53 protein in cancer patients under the presence of pharmacodynamical interaction and might contribute to the effective management of cancer patients.},

  abstract     = {Haematopoiesis is the process of generation of blood cells. Lymphopoiesis generates lymphocytes, the cells in charge of the adaptive immune response. Disruptions of this process are associated with diseases like leukaemia, which is especially incident in children. The characteristics of self-regulation of this process make them suitable for a mathematical study. In this paper we develop mathematical models of lymphopoiesis using currently available data. We do this by drawing inspiration from existing structured models of cell lineage development and integrating them with paediatric bone marrow data, with special focus on regulatory mechanisms. A formal analysis of the models is carried out, giving steady states and their stability conditions. We use this analysis to obtain biologically relevant regions of the parameter space and to understand the dynamical behaviour of B-cell renovation. Finally, we use numerical simulations to obtain further insight into the influence of proliferation and maturation rates on the reconstitution of the cells in the B line. We conclude that a model including feedback regulation of cell proliferation represents a biologically plausible depiction for B-cell reconstitution in bone marrow. Research into haematological disorders could benefit from a precise dynamical description of B lymphopoiesis.},

  abstract     = {Hepatocyte insulin resistance is one of the early factors of developing type II diabetes. If insulin resistance is treated early, type II diabetes could be prevented. In recent years, scientists have been conducting extensive research on the underlying issues on a cellular and molecular level. It was found that the modulation of IP 3 -receptors, the mitochondrial ability to form the mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) and the endoplasmic reticulum stress during Ca 2+ signaling play a key role in hepatocyte being able to maintain euglycemia and provide metabolic flexibility. However, researchers cannot agree on what factor is the key one in resulting in insulin resistance. In this work, we propose a mathematical model of Ca 2+ signaling. We included in the model all the major contributors of a proper Ca 2+ signaling during both the fasting and the postprandial state. Our modeling results are in good agreement with available experimental data. The analysis of modeling results suggests that MAMs dysfunction alone cannot result in abnormal Ca 2+ signaling and the wrong modulation of IP 3 -receptors is a more definite reason. However, both the MAMs dysfunction and the IP 3 signaling dysregulation combined can lead to a robust Ca 2+ signal and improper glucose release. In addition, our model results suggest a strong dependence of Ca 2+ oscillations pattern on morphological characteristics of the ER and the mitochondria.},

  abstract     = {To better understand the environmental factors and ecological processes underlying the evolution of the irreversible transition from a free-swimming state to an immobile sessile state as seen in many aquatic invertebrates , we study the adaptive dynamics of the settling rate of a hypothetical microorganism onto the wall of a chemostat. The two states, floating or settled, differ in their nutrient ingestion, reproduction and death rate. We consider three different settling mechanisms involving competition for space on the wall: ( i ) purely exploitative competition where free-swimming individuals settle in vacant space only, ( ii ) mixed exploitative and interference competition where individuals attempt to settle in any place but fail and die if the space is already occupied, and ( iii ) mixed exploitative and interference competition, but now settling in occupied space is successful and the former occupant dies. In the simplified environment of the chemostat, the input concentration of nutrients and the dilution rate of the tank are the main environmental control variables. Using the theory of adaptive dynamics, we find that the settling mechanisms and environmental control variables have qualitatively different effects on the evolution of the settling rate in terms of the direction of evolution as well as on species diversity. In the case of purely exploitative competition a small change in the settings of the environmental control variables can lead to an abrupt reversal of the direction of evolution, while in the case of mixed exploitative and interference competition the effect is gradual. For all three settling mechanisms, periodic fluctuations in the nutrient input open the possibility of evolutionary branching leading to the long-term coexistence of an intermediate and an infinitely high settling rates (in the case of low-frequency fluctuations), and an intermediate and a zero settling rates (in the case of high-frequency fluctuations).},

It also describes mutations between these cell phenotypes in the form of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse process mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). The proposed model consists of a hybrid system of partial and stochastic differential equations that describe the evolution of epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like cancer cells, respectively, under the consideration of matrix-degrading enzyme concentrations and the extracellular matrix density.

In the absence of a safe and effective cure or vaccine during the first ten months of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world implemented these social-isolation strategies and other NPIs to reduce COVID-19 transmission. But, individual and public perception play a crucial role in the success of any social-isolation measure. Thus, in spite of governments’ initiatives to use NPIs to combat COVID-19 in many countries around the world, individual choices rendered social-isolation unsuccessful in some of these countries. This resulted in huge outbreaks that imposed a substantial morbidity, mortality, hospitalization, economic, etc., toll on human lives. In particular, human choices pose serious challenges to public health strategic decision-making in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. To unravel the impact of this behavioral response to social-isolation on the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, we develop a model framework that integrates COVID-19 transmission dynamics with a multi-strategy evolutionary game approach of individual decision-making. We use this integrated framework to characterize the evolution of human choices in social-isolation as the disease progresses and public health control measures such as mandatory lockdowns are implemented. Analysis of the model illustrates that SD plays a major role in reducing the burden of the disease compared to SQ. Parameter estimation using COVID-19 incidence data, as well as different lockdown data sets from India, and scenario analysis involving a combination of Voluntary-Mandatory implementation of SQ and SD shows that the effectiveness of this approach depends on the type of isolation, and the time and period of implementation of the selected isolation measure during the outbreak.},

The disease now shows a peculiar pattern of spreading along Chari River and its tributaries, rather than clustering around a particular drinking water source. We create a mathematical model of GWD that includes the population dynamics of the parasite as well as the dynamics of its hosts (copepods, fish, humans, and domestic dogs). We calibrate our model based on data from the literature and validate it on the recent GWD annual incidence data from Chad. The effective reproduction number predicted by our model agrees well with the empirical value of roughly 1.25 derived directly from the data. Our model thus supports the hypothesis that the parasite now uses fish as intermediate transport hosts. We predict that GWD transmission can be most easily interrupted by avoiding eating uncooked fish and by burying the fish entrails to prevent transmission through dogs. Increasing the mortality of copepods and even partially containing infected dogs to limit their access to water sources is another important factor for GWD eradication.},

  abstract     = {While most of the countries around the globe are combating the pandemic of COVID-19, the level of its impact is quite variable among different countries. In particular, the data from Nepal, a developing country having an open border provision with highly COVID-19 affected country India, has shown a biphasic pattern of epidemic, a controlled phase (until July 21, 2020) followed by an outgrown phase (after July 21, 2020). To uncover the effective strategies implemented during the controlled phase, we develop a mathematical model that is able to describe the data from both phases of COVID-19 dynamics in Nepal. Using our best parameter estimates with 95\% confidence interval, we found that during the controlled phase most of the recorded cases were imported from outside the country with a small number generated from the local transmission, consistent with the data. Our model predicts that these successful strategies were able to maintain the reproduction number at around 0.21 during the controlled phase, preventing 442,640 cases of COVID-19 and saving more than 1,200 lives in Nepal. However, during the outgrown phase, when the strategies such as border screening and quarantine, lockdown, and detection and isolation, were altered, the reproduction number raised to 1.8, resulting in exponentially growing cases of COVID-19. We further used our model to predict the long-term dynamics of COVID-19 in Nepal and found that without any interventions the current trend may result in about 18.76 million cases (10.70 million detected and 8.06 million undetected) and 89 thousand deaths in Nepal by the end of 2021. Finally, using our predictive model, we evaluated the effects of various control strategies on the long-term outcome of this epidemics and identified ideal strategies to curb the epidemic in Nepal.},

If cooperators maintain interaction with cooperators and halt interaction with defectors, then cooperation can pay and can be favored by natural selection. This is called an exit option. Here, not only cooperation in dyadic interactions but also cooperation in sizable groups can be observed. Rivalry is about whether usage of the benefit by one individual reduces its availability to others or not. A common good is a rivalrous good, whereas a public good is a non-rivalrous good. In this paper, by analyzing n -player prisoner’s dilemma games, we examine whether the effect of the group size on cooperation is positive or negative in the context of exit option. When goods are common goods, defectors always dominate cooperators when the group size is infinitely large. Thus, the group size has only negative effects on the evolution of cooperation when goods are common goods. In contrast, when goods are public goods, an increase in group size has positive effects as well as negative effects on the evolution of cooperation. In addition, we reveal that it has both positive and negative effects on the evolution of cooperation for cooperators to tolerate some defection and hope to keep the interaction.},

Here, we use tools from the study of nonlinear dynamical systems to develop a simple mathematical model for this phenomenon. Unlike some prior work, we do not assume the existence of mating types. We also model frequency dependent selection via “mean-field coupling,” whereby the likelihood that a gamete survives is an increasing function of its size relative to the population’s mean gamete size. Using theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, we demonstrate that this mean-referenced competition will almost inevitably result in a stable anisogamous equilibrium, and thus isogamy may naturally lead to anisogamy.},

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma originates in the brain and is one of the most aggressive cancer types. Glioblastoma represents 15\% of all brain tumours, with a median survival of 15 months. Although the current standard of care for such a tumour (the Stupp protocol) has shown positive results for the prognosis of patients, O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) driven drug resistance has been an issue of increasing concern and hence requires innovative approaches. In addition to the well established drug resistance factors such as tumour location and blood brain barriers, it is also important to understand how the genetic and epigenetic dynamics of the glioblastoma cells can play a role. One important aspect of this is the study of methylation status of MGMT following administration of temozolomide. In this paper, we extend our previously published model that simulated MGMT expression in glioblastoma cells to incorporate the promoter methylation status of MGMT. This methylation status has clinical significance and is used as a marker for patient outcomes. Using this model, we investigate the causative relationship between temozolomide treatment and the methylation status of the MGMT promoter in a population of cells. In addition by constraining the model to relevant biological data using Approximate Bayesian Computation, we were able to identify parameter regimes that yield different possible modes of resistances, namely, phenotypic selection of MGMT, a downshift in the methylation status of the MGMT promoter or both simultaneously. We analysed each of the parameter sets associated with the different modes of resistance, presenting representative solutions as well as discovering some similarities between them as well as unique requirements for each of them. Finally, we used them to devise optimal strategies for inhibiting MGMT expression with the aim of minimising live glioblastoma cell numbers.},

  abstract     = {Although the evolutionary response to random genetic drift is classically modelled as a sampling process for populations with fixed abundance, the abundances of populations in the wild fluctuate over time. Furthermore, since wild populations exhibit demographic stochasticity and since random genetic drift is in part due to demographic stochasticity, theoretical approaches are needed to understand the role of demographic stochasticity in eco-evolutionary dynamics. Here we close this gap for quantitative characters evolving in continuously reproducing populations by providing a framework to track the stochastic dynamics of abundance density across phenotypic space using stochastic partial differential equations. In the process we develop a set of heuristics to operationalize the powerful, but abstract theory of white noise and diffusion-limits of individual-based models. Applying these heuristics, we obtain stochastic ordinary differential equations that generalize classical expressions of ecological quantitative genetics. In particular, by supplying growth rate and reproductive variance as functions of abundance densities and trait values, these equations track population size, mean trait and additive genetic variance responding to mutation, demographic stochasticity, random genetic drift, deterministic selection and noise-induced selection. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by formulating a model of diffuse coevolution mediated by exploitative competition for a continuum of resources. In addition to trait and abundance distributions, this model predicts interaction networks defined by niche-overlap, competition coefficients, or selection gradients. Using a high-richness approximation, we find linear selection gradients and competition coefficients are uncorrelated, but magnitudes of linear selection gradients and quadratic selection gradients are both positively correlated with competition coefficients. Hence, competing species that strongly affect each other’s abundance tend to also impose selection on one another, but the directionality is not predicted. This approach contributes to the development of a synthetic theory of evolutionary ecology by formalizing first principle derivations of stochastic models tracking feedbacks of biological processes and the patterns of diversity they produce.},

  abstract     = {With the aid of the evolutionary vaccination game on a scale-free network, we design a new subsidy policy, named degree dependent subsidy, where cooperative agents get incentives according to their connectivity or degree. That is, agents, having a greater degree, receive a higher incentive, and vice versa. Here we presume that vaccinators are cooperative agents. The new scheme can be said to an intermediate policy between two previously studies policies, namely free ticket and flat discount policies. The former policy distributes free tickets to cooperative hub agents as a priority, whereas the latter dispenses a fixed discount to every cooperator. We compare the efficiency of each policy in terms of having a less infectious state with a minimum social cost. While investigating the performance of the three policies in terms of average social payoff–which takes into account the cost of vaccination as well as infection–the free ticket scheme is found to be the most appealing policies among the three when the budget for subsidy is quite low. The degree dependent subsidy policy outperforms others for a moderate budget size, while the flat discount policy requires a higher budget to effectively suppress the disease. We further estimate threshold levels of the subsidy budget for each policy beyond which subsidizing results in excessive use of vaccination. As a whole, concerning vaccination coverage and final epidemic size, the degree-dependent subsidy scheme outperforms the flat discount scheme, but is dominated by the free ticket policy.},

  abstract     = {A predator that preys on randomly-distributed stationary energetically-equivalent small prey will probably choose its next prey to be the nearest one. But what if no prey is found within the detection range of the predator? It is hypothesized that in this case the predator will move along an arbitrary chosen direction until a prey is detected, and turn towards it. In a stochastic environment this strategy leads to a certain distribution function of distances that the predator moves between consequent prey catches. It is shown that when the detection range of the predator exceeds the average distance between prey, this distribution function becomes the nearest neighbor distribution function, whereas; wherew when the detection range is small as compared with the average distance between prey, it becomes the exponential distribution, as the distribution of distances between neighbors on a line. In the first case, the average distance between catches becomes roughly half the average distance between prey; in the second case, it becomes inversely proportional to the square of the detection range. Ocean sunfish preys on practically stationary jellyfish at depth of more than a hundred meters, in dim light. Plausibly, it can detect jellyfish only at close quarters, and hence its detection range is probably small as compared with the average distance between prey. Analysis of the tracking data from seven animals over a few days yielded many thousands of swimming segments separating consequent prey catches. Indeed, lengths of these segments were shown to have the exponential distribution. This finding not only supports the initial hypothesis of this study, but also reveals the fragility of the energetic balance of this animal. A two-fold decrease in the detection range (e.g. due to a decreased visibility) is expected to increase the average distance it moves between catches four-fold, and hence decrease its specific energy intake (the number of jellyfishes per distance moved) by the same rate.},

  abstract     = {A series of prior publications has reported unusual properties of the set of genetically encoded amino acids shared by all known life. This work uses quantitative measures (descriptors) of size, charge and hydrophobicity to compare the distribution of the genetically encoded amino acids with random samples of plausible alternatives. Results show that the standard “alphabet” of amino acids established by the time of LUCA is distributed with unusual evenness over a broad range for the three, key physicochemical properties. However, different publications have used slightly different assumptions, including variations in the precise descriptors used, the set of plausible alternative molecules considered, and the format in which results have been presented. Here we consolidate these findings into a unified framework in order to clarify unusual features. We find that in general, the remarkable features of the full set of 20 genetically encoded amino acids are robust when compared with random samples drawn from a densely populated picture of plausible, alternative L-α-amino acids. In particular, the genetically encoded set is distributed across an exceptionally broad range of volumes, and distributed exceptionally evenly within a modest range of hydrophobicities. Surprisingly, range and evenness of charge (pKa) is exceptional only for the full amino acid structures, not for their sidechains - a result inconsistent with prior interpretations involving the role that amino acid sidechains play within protein sequences. In stark contrast, these remarkable features are far less clear when the prebiotically plausible subset of genetically encoded amino acids is compared with a much smaller pool of prebiotically plausible alternatives. By considering the nature of the “optimality theory” approach taken to derive these and prior insights, we suggest productive avenues for further research.},

  abstract     = {The majority of biologically inspired dynamic problems are essentially defined by the complexity of the contact surface where such motion takes place. From a statistical point of view, such a surface in many biological problems is typically a combination of a universal scale invariant (fractal) component and a well-defined component having a characteristic scale. If the biological object, here a dung ball, or its parts have a size comparable to the dimensions of the surface peculiarities, one can expect a strong influence on the motion. To avoid competition for the same food resource, some dung-feeding insect species form a dung ball and roll it away from the dung pile. In order to quickly escape competition, dung beetles seem to strictly follow an initial bearing. On flat terrain, they manage to roll a dung ball along a nearly perfect straight path. However, on a more realistic terrain, which normally includes both components mentioned above, the motion is more complex. In this study, we numerically model the ball transportation on terrain with different scales of surface profile. A strong correlation is observed between effective ball transportation (time, distance, work) and the ratio of the size of the ball relative to the size of the terrain roughness. Surface irregularities, with a characteristic size comparable to the ball diameter, are negatively correlated to the efficiency of ball transportation. In addition a strong correlation is found between the quasi random noise, numerically simulating the activity of a dung beetle trying to escape from a valley in which it is trapped, and the success in ball transportation.},

  abstract     = {Tissue geometry is an important influence on the evolution of many biological tissues. The local curvature of an evolving tissue induces tissue crowding or spreading, which leads to differential tissue growth rates, and to changes in cellular tension, which can influence cell behaviour. Here, we investigate how directed cell motion interacts with curvature control in evolving biological tissues. Directed cell motion is involved in the generation of angled tissue growth and anisotropic tissue material properties, such as tissue fibre orientation. We develop a new cell-based mathematical model of tissue growth that includes both curvature control and cell guidance mechanisms to investigate their interplay. The model is based on conservation principles applied to the density of tissue synthesising cells at or near the tissue’s moving boundary. The resulting mathematical model is a partial differential equation for cell density on a moving boundary, which is solved numerically using a hybrid front-tracking method called the cell-based particle method. The inclusion of directed cell motion allows us to model new types of biological growth, where tangential cell motion is important for the evolution of the interface, or for the generation of anisotropic tissue properties. We illustrate such situations by applying the model to simulate both the resorption and infilling components of the bone remodelling process, and to simulate root hair growth. We also provide user-friendly MATLAB code to implement the algorithms.},

The Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has been found to accelerate the development of gastritis and gastric cancer. Significant efforts have been made towards the understanding of the biology of gastric cancer on both genetic and epigenetic levels. However the physical mechanism behind the gastric cancer formation is still elusive. In this study, we constructed a model for investigating gastric cancer formation by explored the gastric cancer landscape and the flow flux. We uncovered three stable state attractors on the landscape: normal, gastritis and gastric cancer. The definition of each attractor is based on the biological function and gene expression levels. The global stabilities and the switching processes were quantified through the barrier heights and dominant kinetic paths. To investigate the underlying mechanism of the process from normal through the gastritis to the gastric cancer caused by genetic or epigenetic factors, we simulate the oncogenesis of gastric cancer through changes of several gene regulation strengths and H. pylori infection. The simulated results can illustrate the developmental and metastasis process of gastric cancer. Different H. pylori infection degrees accelerating the process from gastritis to gastric cancer can be quantified. Then we applied global sensitivity analysis, one key gene and four key regulations were found. These results are consist with the experimental results and can be used to design the polygenic anti-cancer agents through multiple key genes or regulations. The landscape approach provides a physical and simple strategy for analyzing gastric cancer in a systematic and quantitative way. It also offers new insight into treatment strategy for gastric cancer by adjusting relevant polygenic genes and regulations.},

In this work we investigate the role of RdCVFL in maintaining the health of the photoreceptors. The results of our mathematical model show the necessity of RdCVFL and also demonstrate additional stable modes that are present in this system.

We establish a lower bound on the outbreak size at the origin as a function of the speed of spread. Using the lower bound on the outbreak size at the origin, we establish an upper bound on the outbreak size at the importing locality as a function of the speed of spread and the level of preparedness for the low mobility regime. We evaluate the critical levels of preparedness that stop the disease from spreading at the importing locality. Finally, we show how the benefit of preparedness diminishes under high mobility rates.

In vivo and in vitro studies following fatiguing stimulation protocols are limited in their ability to capture the effects of K o + Ko+ on force production in combination with other simultaneously changing factors. To address this, a computational model of ECC for slow and fast twitch muscle is presented to explore the relative contributions of excitability-induced and metabolic-induced changes in force generation in response to increasing K + o K+o . The model incorporates mechanisms previously unexplored in modelling studies, including the effects of extracellular calcium on excitability, calcium-dependent inhibition of calcium release, ATP-dependent ionic pumping, and the contribution of ATP hydrolysis to intracellular phosphate accumulation rate. The model was able to capture the frequency-dependent biphasic Force- K + o K+o response observed experimentally. Force potentiation for moderately elevated K + o K+o was driven by increased action potential duration, myoplasmic calcium potentiation, and phosphate accumulation rate, while attenuation of force at higher K + o K+o was due to action potential failure resulting in reduced calcium release. These results suggest that altered calcium release and phosphate accumulation work together with elevated K o + Ko+ to affect force during sustained contractions.},

This is achieved by introducing a negative ecological feedback loop that suppresses ecological dynamics by forcing births and deaths to be coupled. We also investigate how fitness, a measure of reproductive success used in evolutionary graph theory, is related to the life-history of individuals in terms of their birth and death rates. In simple networks, these ecologically motivated dynamics are used to provide new insight into the spread of adaptive mutations, both with and without clonal interference. For example, the star network, which is known to be an amplifier of selection in evolutionary graph theory, can inhibit the spread of adaptive mutations when individuals can die naturally.},

In this study, we have modeled the PPAR pathway using a Bayesian model and inferred the sub-pathways that are potentially responsible for the activation of the output processes that are associated with high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. We examined a previously published dataset from a study that compared gene expression profiles of 40 mice maintained on HFD against 40 mice fed with chow diet (CD). Our simulations have highlighted that GPCR and FATCD36 sub-pathways were aberrantly active in HFD mice and are therefore favorable targets for anti-obesity strategies. We further cross-validated our observations with experimental results from the literature. We believe that mathematical models such as those presented in the present study can help in inferring other pathways and deducing significant biological relationships.},

  abstract     = {Among the Hominidae family of primates, Homo is characterized by more economical bipedal walking. Over the course of evolution towards bipedalism, the foot becomes the only organ directly interacting with substrate and likely influence the bipedal walking economy. However, working out the energy expenditure in bipedal walking from the specific aspect of foot morphology is still challenging, which hinders the understanding of the evolution of both hominid feet and economical bipedal walking. Here we present a functional model to quantitatively assess bipedal walking expenditure of energy from hominid foot morphology. According to our results, the feet of Homo are most suited to economical bipedal walking among hominids. However, the genus whose feet possess second best ability for economical bipedal walking is not our closest relative Pan , but is Gorilla . Using phylogenetically informed morphometric analyses, we further infer the evolutionary changes of hominid foot morphology and investigate the corresponding variation of bipedal walking expenditure. Our results reveal the economical bipedal walking benefits from the morphological changes of human foot after descending from the last common ancestor of hominids. Conversely, the foot morphologies of great apes reflect selections for other locomotor modes, at cost of larger energy expenditure in bipedal walking.},

  abstract     = {Dense innervation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) allows cardiac output to respond appropriately to the needs of the body under varying conditions, but occasionally the abrupt onset of SNS activity can trigger cardiac arrhythmias. Sympathetic activity leads to the release of norepinephrine (NE) onto cardiomyocytes, activating β 1 β1 -adrenergic receptors ( β 1 β1 -ARs) and leading to the production of the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP). Upon sudden activation of β 1 β1 -ARs in experiments, intracellular cAMP can transiently rise to a high concentration before converging to a steady state level. Although changes to cellular cAMP concentration are important in modulating the overall cardiovascular response to sympathetic tone, the underlying mechanisms of the cAMP transients and the parameters that control their magnitude are unclear. We reduce a detailed computational model of the β 1 β1 -adrenergic signaling cascade to a system of two differential equations by eliminating extraneous variables and applying quasi-steady state approximation. The structure of the reduced model reveals that the large cAMP transients associated with abrupt β 1 β1 -AR activation are generated by the interplay of production/degradation of cAMP and desensitization/resensitization of β 1 β1 -ARs. The reduced model is used to predict how the dynamics of intracellular cAMP depend on the concentrations of norepinephrine (NE), phosphodiesterases 3 and 4 (PDE3,4), G-protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), and β 1 β1 -AR, in healthy conditions and a simple model of early stages of heart failure. The key findings of the study are as follows: 1) Applying a reduced model of the dynamics of cardiac sympathetic signaling we show that the concentrations of two variables, cAMP and non-desensitized β 1 β1 -AR, capture the overall dynamics of sympathetic signaling; 2) The key factors influencing cAMP production are AC activity and PDE3,4 activity, while those that directly impact β 1 β1 -AR phosphorylation are GRK2 and PKA 1 . Thus, disease states that affect sympathetic control of the heart can be thoroughly assessed by studying AC activity, PDE3,4, GRK2 and PKA activity, as these factors directly impact cAMP production/degradation and β 1 β1 -AR (de) phosphorylation and are therefore predicted to comprise the most effective pharmaceutical targets in diseases affecting cardiac β 1 β1 -adrenergic signaling.},

  abstract     = {Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is one of the predominant causes of drug induced acute liver injury in the U.S and U.K. Clinical studies show that ingestion of alcohol may increase the risk of APAP induced liver injury. Chronic alcoholism may potentiate APAP hepatotoxicity and this increased risk of APAP toxicity is observed when APAP is ingested even shortly after alcohol is cleared from the body. However, clinical reports also suggest that acute alcohol consumption may have a protective effect against hepatotoxicity by inhibiting microsomal acetaminophen oxidation and thereby reducing N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) production. The aim of this study is to model this dual role of alcohol to determine how the timing of alcohol ingestion affects APAP metabolism and resulting liver injury and identify mechanisms of APAP induced liver injury. The mathematical model is developed to capture condition of a patient of single time APAP overdose who may be an acute or chronic alcohol user. The analysis suggests that the risk of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity is increased if APAP is ingested shortly after alcohol is cleared from the body in chronic alcohol users. A protective effect of acute consumption of alcohol is also observed in patients with APAP overdose. For example, simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and APAP overdose or alcohol intake after or before few hours of APAP overdose may result in less APAP-induced hepatotoxicity when compared to a single time APAP overdose. The rate of hepatocyte damage in APAP overdose patients depends on trade-off between induction and inhibition of CYP enzyme.},

  abstract     = {Transposable elements (TEs) are essential components of the eukaryotic genomes. While mostly deleterious, evidence is mounting that TEs provide the host with beneficial adaptations. How ‘selfish’ or ‘parasitic’ DNA persists until it helps species evolution is emerging as a major evolutionary puzzle, especially in asexual taxa where the lack of sex strongly impede the spread of TEs. Since occasional but unchecked TE proliferations would ultimately drive host lineages toward extinction, asexual genomes are typically predicted to be free of TEs, which contrasts with their persistence in asexual taxa. We designed innovative ‘Eco-genomic’ models that account for both host demography and within-host molecular mechanisms of transposition and silencing to analyze their impact on TE dynamics in asexual genome populations. We unraveled that the spread of TEs can be limited to a stable level by density-dependent purifying selection when TE copies are over-dispersed among lineages and the host demographic turn-over is fast. We also showed that TE silencing can protect host populations in two ways; by preventing TEs with weak effects to accumulate or by favoring the elimination of TEs with large effects. Our predictions may explain TE persistence in known asexual taxa that typically show fast demography and where TE copy number variation between lineages is expected. Such TE persistence in asexual taxa potentially has important implications for their evolvability and the preservation of sexual reproduction.},

The model accounts for Ca 2+ regulation of the IP 3 receptor (IP 3 R), the positive feedback from Ca 2+ on phospholipase C (PLC) and the P2Y receptor phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC). Furthermore, PKC is shown to control multiple cellular substrates.

  abstract     = {Human blood cell production is maintained by hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) which give rise to all types of mature blood cells. Experimental observation of HSC in their physiologic bone-marrow microenvironment, the so-called stem cell niche, is challenging. Therefore, the details of HSC dynamics and the cellular interactions in the stem cell niche remain elusive. Mutations that lead to a competitive advantage are the cause of clinical challenges when treating HSC-derived malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia or the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). To investigate the significance of the interaction between the HSC and the stem cell niche in these malignancies, we propose and analyse a mechanism-based mathematical model of HSC dynamics within the bone-marrow microenvironment. The model is based on the central hypothesis that HSC self-renewal depends on the niche. In the model, the interaction of HSC with specific niches located in the bone marrow are key to the indefinite HSC renewal necessary for long-term maintenance of blood cell production. We formulate a general model of n n distinct clones that differ with respect to cell properties. We identify an attractive trapping region and compute and classify all steady states. A concept of HSC fitness naturally arises from the model analysis. HSC fitness is found to determine the asymptotic behaviour of the model, as the HSC clone with the highest fitness is related to the unique locally stable steady state. Based on biological assumptions about HSC, we propose two reduced models of different complexity. A thorough mathematical analysis reveals that both reduced models have the same asymptotic behaviour as the full model. We compare the simpler of the two models, a logistic equation of the disease burden, to clinical data of MPN-patients. The reduced model is found to agree well with data and suggests a simple interpretation and possible prediction of patient prognosis. The proposed mathematical model and the reduced forms have the potential to provide insights into the regulation of HSC dynamics and blood cell formation, and ultimately for future advances in treatment of hematologic malignancies.},

In the present article, we use the prisoner’s dilemma (PD) game as a basis for long-term apprehension of the essential social dilemma related to cooperation among unrelated individuals. We upgrade the contemporary PD game with an inclusion of evolution-induced act of punishment as a third competing strategy in addition to the traditional cooperators and defectors. In a population structure, the abundance of ecologically-viable free space often regulates the reproductive opportunities of the constituents. Hence, additionally, we consider the availability of free space as an ecological footprint , thus arriving at a simple eco-evolutionary model, which displays fascinating complex dynamics. As possible outcomes, we report the individual dominance of cooperators and defectors as well as a plethora of mixed states, where different strategies coexist followed by maintaining the diversity in a socio-ecological framework. These states can either be steady or oscillating, whereby oscillations are sustained by cyclic dominance among different combinations of cooperators, defectors, and punishers. We also observe a novel route to cyclic dominance where cooperators, punishers, and defectors enter a coexistence via an inverse Hopf bifurcation that is followed by an inverse period doubling route.},

The models are motivated by marine ecosystems where they cover the size range from multicellular plankton to the largest fish. We propose to extend the size-spectrum model with spatial components. The spatial dynamics is governed by a random motion and a directed movement in the direction of increased fitness, which we call ‘fitness-taxis’. We use the model to explore whether spatial irregularities of marine communities can occur due to the internal dynamics of predator–prey interactions and spatial movements. This corresponds to a pattern-formation analysis generalized to an entire ecosystem but is not limited to one prey and one predator population. The analyses take the form of Fourier analysis and numerical experiments. Results show that diffusion always stabilizes the equilibrium but fitness-taxis destabilizes it, leading to non-stationary spatially inhomogeneous population densities, which are travelling in size. However, there is a strong asymmetry between fitness-induced destabilizing effects and diffusion-induced stabilizing effects with the latter dominating over the former. These findings reveal that fitness taxis acts as a possible mechanism behind pattern formations in ecosystems with high diversity of organism sizes, which can drive the emergence of spatial heterogeneity even in a spatially homogeneous environment.},

  abstract     = {A well-functioning placenta is critical for healthy fetal development, as the placenta brings fetal blood in close contact with nutrient rich maternal blood, enabling exchange of nutrients and waste between mother and fetus. The feto-placental circulation forms a complex branching structure, providing blood to fetal capillaries, which must receive sufficient blood flow to ensure effective exchange, but at a low enough pressure to prevent damage to placental circulatory structures. The branching structure of the feto-placental circulation is known to be altered in complications such as fetal growth restriction, and the presence of regions of vascular dysfunction (such as hypovascularity or thrombosis) are proposed to elevate risk of placental pathology. Here we present a methodology to combine micro-computed tomography and computational model-based analysis of the branching structure of the feto-placental circulation in ex vivo placentae from normal term pregnancies. We analyse how vascular structure relates to function in this key organ of pregnancy; demonstrating that there is a ‘resilience’ to placental vascular structure–function relationships. We find that placentae with variable chorionic vascular structures, both with and without a Hyrtl’s anastomosis between the umbilical arteries, and those with multiple regions of poorly vascularised tissue are able to function with a normal vascular resistance. Our models also predict that by progressively introducing local heterogeneity in placental vascular structure, large increases in feto-placental vascular resistances are induced. This suggests that localised heterogeneities in placental structure could potentially provide an indicator of increased risk of placental dysfunction.},

However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R 0 , across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented. Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.18 and 0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4 and 3.9 days). We found that for such rapid epidemic growth, high levels of intervention efforts are necessary, no matter the goal is mitigation or containment. We discuss the current estimates of the mean serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6 and 8 days in the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated the median R 0 value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7–7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. We further analyze how vaccination schedules depend on R 0 , the duration of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and show that individual-level heterogeneity in vaccine induced immunity can significantly affect vaccination schedules.},

  abstract     = {Can a regulated, legal market for wildlife products protect species threatened by poaching? It is one of the most controversial ideas in biodiversity conservation. Perhaps the most convincing reason for legalizing wildlife trade is that trade revenue could fund the protection and conservation of poached species. In this paper, we examine the possible poacher-population dynamic consequences of legal trade funding conservation. The model consists of a manager scavenging carcasses for wildlife product, who then sells the product, and directs a portion of the revenue towards funding anti-poaching law enforcement. Through a global analysis of the model, we derive the critical proportion of product the manager must scavenge, and the critical proportion of trade revenue the manager must allocate towards increased enforcement, in order for legal trade to lead to abundant long-term wildlife populations. We illustrate how the model could inform management with parameter values derived from the African elephant literature, under a hypothetical scenario where a manager scavenges elephant carcasses to sell ivory. We find that there is a large region of parameter space where populations go extinct under legal trade unless a significant portion of trade revenue is directed towards protecting populations from poaching. The model is general and therefore can be used as a starting point for exploring the consequences of funding many conservation programs using wildlife trade revenue.},

  abstract     = {The development of multicellular organisms relies on correct patterns of cell fates to produce functional tissues in the mature organism. A commonly observed developmental pattern consists of alternating cell fates, where neighboring cells take on distinct cell fates characterized by contrasting gene and protein expression levels, and this cell fate pattern repeats over two or more cells. The patterns produced by these fate decisions are regulated by a small number of highly conserved signaling networks, some of which are mediated by long range diffusible signals and others mediated by local contact-dependent signals. However, it is not completely understood how local and long range signals associated with these networks interact to produce fate patterns that are both robust and flexible. Here we analyze mathematical models to investigate the patterning of cell fates in an array of cells, focusing on a two cell repeating pattern. Bifurcation analysis of a multicellular ODE model, where we consider the cells as discrete compartments, suggests that cells must balance sensitivity to external signals with robustness to perturbations. To focus on the patterning dynamics close to the bifurcation point, we derive a continuum PDE model that integrates local and long range signaling. For those cells with dynamics close to the bifurcation point, sensitivity to long range signals determines how far a pattern extends in space, while the number of local signaling connections determines the type of pattern produced. This investigation provides a general framework for understanding developmental patterning, and how both long range and local signals play a role in generating features observed across biology, such as species differences in nematode vulval development and insect bristle patterning, as well as medically relevant processes such as control of stem cell fate in the intestinal crypt .},

I argue instead that this observation per se cannot be used to understand any aspect of the origin of the genetic code, unless it is accompanied by other assumptions concerning in the specific case: (i) the ancestrality of some amino acids, (ii) the hypothesis that the first mRNA to be translated was poly-G, which can be translated into poly-Gly, and (iii) an evolutionary mechanism for the genetic code origin based on the duplication of tRNAs. However, both the tRNA duplication mechanism and the existence of poly-G as the first mRNA to be translated are not corroborated as mechanisms through which the genetic code would have been structured. For example, the origin of the actual mRNA should have been preceded by the evolution of a proto-mRNA which evidently already coded for more than one amino acid. Therefore, when it evolved from proto-mRNA, the mRNA should already have coded for more than one amino acid. In other words, poly-G as mRNA would most likely never have existed because the first mRNAs already had to code for more than one amino acid. On the contrary, all these assumptions would have been operational if the observations of Inouye et al.

The effects of incubation temperature and sex ratio deviation on persistence of the population are captured by the sole basic reproduction number. The persistent mode can be either a stable equilibrium or periodic oscillations. Numerical simulations and sensitive analysis help us to identify vital parameters in our model.

  abstract     = {Olfaction informs animal navigation for foraging, social interaction, and threat evasion. However, turbulent flow on the spatial scales of most animal navigation leads to intermittent odor information and presents a challenge to simple gradient-ascent navigation. Here we present two strategies for iterative gradient estimation and navigation via olfactory cues in 2D space: tropotaxis, spatial concentration comparison ( i.e. , instantaneous comparison between lateral olfactory sensors on a navigating animal) and klinotaxis, spatiotemporal concentration comparison ( i.e. , comparison between two subsequent concentration samples as the animal moves through space). We then construct a hybrid model that uses klinotaxis but utilizes tropotactic information to guide its spatial sampling strategy. We find that for certain body geometries in which bilateral sensors are closely-spaced ( e.g. , mammalian nares), klinotaxis outperforms tropotaxis; for widely-spaced sensors ( e.g. , arthropod antennae), tropotaxis outperforms klinotaxis. We find that both navigation strategies perform well on smooth odor gradients and are robust against noisy gradients represented by stochastic odor models and real turbulent flow data. In some parameter regimes, the hybrid model outperforms klinotaxis alone, but not tropotaxis.},

In the peak-interval (PI) paradigm, one of the critical features of time perception is its scale invariance, i.e., the error in time estimation increases linearly with the to-be-timed interval. Brain lesions can profoundly alter time perception, but do they also change its scalar property? In particular, hippocampus (HPC) lesions affect the memory of the reinforced durations. Experiments found that ventral hippocampus (vHPC) lesions shift the perceived durations to longer values while dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) lesions produce opposite effects. Here we used our implementation of the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBFML) model with biophysically realistic Morris-Lecar (ML) model neurons and a topological map of HPC memory to predict analytically and verify numerically the effect of HPC lesions on scalar property. We found that scalar property still holds after both vHPC and dHPC lesions in our SBFML-HPC network simulation. Our numerical results show that PI durations are shifted in the correct direction and match the experimental results. In our simulations, the relative peak shift of the behavioral response curve is controlled by two factors: (1) the lesion size, and (2) the cellular-level memory variance of the temporal durations stored in the HPC. The coefficient of variance (CV) of the behavioral response curve remained constant over the tested durations of PI procedure, which suggests that scalar property is not affected by HPC lesions.},

  abstract     = {The volatility of an environment significantly impacts cooperative behavior. In environments where viability-threatening events occur on a shorter timescale than reproduction, it is reasonable to measure the costs and benefits of cooperation in terms of their direct effect on survival probability. Then, the number of offspring increases with lifespan. With such a model, is it possible for cooperation to be evolutionarily stable, and how does cooperation depend on the benefit and cost of such interactions, and the volatility of the environment? In this paper, we develop an N -player survivor’s dilemma in which prisoner’s dilemma payoffs in an iteration are survival rates, and expected lifespan is the measure of reproductive fitness . We investigate cost, benefit, and volatility parameter ranges where various cooperative behaviors may occur. We observe that free-riding results in indirect punishment as the cheated partner’s early death leaves the defector vulnerable. For 2- and 3-player versions of the game, we identify parameter regions where the repeated game becomes equivalent to a Harmony, Stag Hunt, or Prisoner’s Dilemma static game and discuss evolutionary stability. We find that with two individuals, the initial fraction of cooperators necessary for cooperation to be selected for decreases as the benefit to cost ratio increases and as environmental volatility decreases. With the presence of a third individual, there also exists a parameter region where cooperation can invade an initially all-defecting population.},

To this end, we present a mathematical method for the genomic spectrum, a kind of barcode, of SARS-CoV-2 and common human coronaviruses. The genomic spectrum is constructed according to the periodic distributions of nucleotides and therefore reflects the unique characteristics of the genome. The results demonstrate that coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exhibits predominant latent periodicity-2 regions of non-structural proteins 3, 4, 5, and 6. Further analysis of the latent periodicity-2 regions suggests that the dinucleotide imbalances are increased during evolution and may confer the evolutionary fitness of the virus. Especially, SARS-CoV-2 isolates have increased latent periodicity-2 and periodicity-3 during COVID-19 pandemic. The special strong periodicity-2 regions and the intensity of periodicity-2 in the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome may become diagnostic and pharmaceutical targets in monitoring and curing the COVID-19 disease.},

These studies, however, are still mainly centered on genes and the proteins they encode, somehow neglecting the small organic chemicals that support life processes. In this work, we selected steroids as an ancient family of metabolites widely distributed in all eukaryotes and applied unsupervised machine learning techniques to reveal the traits that natural selection has imprinted on molecular properties throughout the evolutionary process. Our results clearly show that sterols, the primal steroids that first appeared, have more conserved properties and that, from then on, more complex compounds with increasingly diverse properties have emerged, suggesting that chemical diversification parallels the expansion of biological complexity. In a wider context, these findings highlight the worth of chemoinformatic approaches to a better understanding the evolution of metabolism.},

Unlike most insects, these species typically exist at very high densities (occasionally &gt; &amp;gt; 1000/ m 2 ) and have unusually long life-spans (13 or 17 years). They spend most of their lives underground feeding on plant roots. After the underground period, adults emerge from the ground to mate and oviposit over a period of just a few days. Collections of populations that are developmentally synchronized across large areas are known as “broods”. There are usually sharp boundaries between spatially adjacent broods and regions of brood overlap are generally small. The exact mechanism behind this developmental synchronization and the sharp boundary between broods remain unknown: previous studies have focused on the impacts of predator-driven Allee-effects, competition among nymphs, and their impacts on the persistence of off-synchronized emergence events. Here, we present a nonlinear Leslie-type matrix model to additionally consider cicada movement between spatially separated broods, and examine its role in maintaining brood boundaries and within-brood developmental synchrony that is seen in nature. We successfully identify ranges of competition and dispersal that lead to stable coexistence of broods that differ between spatial patches.},

Using optimal control theory (the Pontryagin maximum principle) and numerical simulations, we determine the optimal strategy of resource allocation to maximize microalgal growth rate over a time horizon. We show that, after a transient, the optimal trajectory approaches the optimal steady state, a behavior known as the turnpike property. Then, a bi-level optimization problem is solved numerically to estimate model parameters from experimental data. The fitted trajectory represents well a Dunaliella tertiolecta culture facing a light down-shift. Finally, we study photoacclimation dynamics under day/night cycle. In the optimal trajectory, the synthesis of the photosynthetic apparatus surprisingly starts a few hours before dawn. This anticipatory behavior has actually been observed both in the laboratory and in the field. This shows the algal predictive capacity and the interest of our method which predicts this phenomenon.},

The model also captures subsequent developmental processes that lead to the different forms of the parasite within the mosquito. Continuous functions are used to model the switching transition from oocyst to sporozoites as well as human antibody density variations within the mosquito gut are proposed and used. In sum, our model integrates the developmental stages of the parasite within the mosquito such as gametogenesis, fertilization and sporogenesis culminating in the formation of sporozoites. Quantitative and qualitative analyses including a sensitivity analysis for influential parameters are performed. We quantify the average sporozoite load produced at the end of the within-mosquito malaria parasite’s developmental stages. Our analysis shows that an increase in the efficiency of the ingested human antibodies in inhibiting fertilization within the mosquito’s gut results in lowering the density of oocysts and hence sporozoites that are eventually produced by each mosquito vector. So, it is possible to control and limit oocysts development and hence sporozoites development within a mosquito by boosting the efficiency of antibodies as a pathway to the development of transmission-blocking vaccines which could potentially reduce oocysts prevalence among mosquitoes and hence reduce the transmission potential from mosquitoes to human.},

  abstract     = {The mathematical modeling of tumor growth has a long history, and has been mathematically formulated in several different ways. Here we tackle the problem in the case of a continuous distribution using mathematical tools from statistical physics. To this extent, we introduce a novel kinetic model of growth which highlights the role of microscopic transitions in determining a variety of equilibrium distributions. At variance with other approaches, the mesoscopic description in terms of elementary interactions allows to design precise microscopic feedback control therapies, able to influence the natural tumor growth and to mitigate the risk factors involved in big sized tumors. We further show that under a suitable scaling both the free and controlled growth models correspond to Fokker–Planck type equations for the growth distribution with variable coefficients of diffusion and drift, whose steady solutions in the free case are given by a class of generalized Gamma densities which can be characterized by fat tails. In this scaling the feedback control produces an explicit modification of the drift operator, which is shown to strongly modify the emerging distribution for the tumor size. In particular, the size distributions in presence of therapies manifest slim tails in all growth models, which corresponds to a marked mitigation of the risk factors. Numerical results confirming the theoretical analysis are also presented.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this work is to provide a mathematical model to describe the early stages of the embryonic development of zebrafish posterior lateral line (PLL). In particular, we focus on evolution of PLL proto-organ (said primordium ), from its formation to the beginning of the cyclical behavior that amounts in the assembly of immature proto-neuromasts towards its caudal edge accompanied by the deposition of mature proto-neuromasts at its rostral region. Our approach has an hybrid integro-differential nature, since it integrates a microscopic/discrete particle-based description for cell dynamics and a continuous description for the evolution of the spatial distribution of chemical substances (i.e., the stromal-derived factor SDF1a and the fibroblast growth factor FGF10). Boolean variables instead implement the expression of molecular receptors (i.e., Cxcr4 / Cxcr7 and fgfr1 ). Cell phenotypic transitions and proliferation are included as well. The resulting numerical simulations show that the model is able to qualitatively and quantitatively capture the evolution of the wild-type (i.e., normal) embryos as well as the effect of known experimental manipulations. In particular, it is shown that cell proliferation, intercellular adhesion, FGF10-driven dynamics, and a polarized expression of SDF1a receptors are all fundamental for the correct development of the zebrafish posterior lateral line.},

  abstract     = {Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in men, with increasing incidence worldwide. This public health concern has inspired considerable effort to study various aspects of prostate cancer treatment using dynamical models, especially in clinical settings. The standard of care for metastatic prostate cancer is hormonal therapy, which reduces the production of androgen that fuels the growth of prostate tumor cells prior to treatment resistance. Existing population models often use patients’ prostate-specific antigen levels as a biomarker for model validation and for finding optimal treatment schedules; however, the synergistic effects of drugs used in hormonal therapy have not been well-examined. This paper describes the first mathematical model that explicitly incorporates the synergistic effects of two drugs used to inhibit androgen production in hormonal therapy. The drugs are cyproterone acetate , representing the drug family of anti-androgens that affect luteinizing hormones , and leuprolide acetate, representing the drug family of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs. By fitting the model to clinical data, we show that the proposed model can capture the dynamics of serum androgen levels during intermittent hormonal therapy better than previously published models. Our results highlight the importance of considering the synergistic effects of drugs in cancer treatment, thus suggesting that the dynamics of the drugs should be taken into account in optimal treatment studies, particularly for adaptive therapy. Otherwise, an unrealistic treatment schedule may be prescribed and render the treatment less effective. Furthermore, the drug dynamics allow our model to explain the delay in the relapse of androgen the moment a patient is taken off treatment, which supports that this delay is due to the residual effects of the drugs.},

Even if the overall structure remains the same there is a turnover of cells within the tissue. This dynamic homeostasis is maintaned by numerous governing mechanisms which are finely tuned in such a way that the tissue remains in a homeostatic state, even across large timescales. Some of these governing mechanisms include cell motion, and cell fate selection through inter cellular signalling. However, it is not yet clear how to link these two processes, or how they may affect one another across the tissue. In this paper, we present a multicellular, multiscale model, which brings together the two phenomena of cell motility, and inter cellular signalling, to describe cell fate selection on a dynamic tissue. We find that the affinity for cellular signalling to occur greatly influences a cells ability to differentiate. We also find that our results support claims that cell differentiation is a finely tuned process within dynamic tissues at homeostasis , with excessive cell turnover rates leading to unhealthy (undifferentiated and unpatterned) tissues.},

  abstract     = {Androdioecy, the coexistence of hermaphrodites and males, is very rare in vertebrates but occurs in mangrove killifish living in ephemeral or unstable habitats. Hermaphrodites reproduce both by outcrossing with males and by selfing. Outbreeding is advantageous because of inbreeding depression, but it requires encounters with males. The advantages of a propensity for outcrossing among hermaphrodites and the production of males affect each other very strongly. To study the evolutionary coupling of these two aspects, we here analyze a simple evolutionary game for a population composed of three phenotypes: outcrossing-oriented hermaphrodites, selfing-oriented hermaphrodites, and males. Outcrossing-oriented hermaphrodites first attempt to search for males and perform outcrossing if they encounter males. If they fail to encounter males, they reproduce via selfing. Selfing-oriented hermaphrodites simply reproduce by selfing. The replicator dynamics may show bistability, in which both the androdioecious population (with outcrossing-oriented hermaphrodites and males) and the pure hermaphroditic population are locally stable. The model shows the fraction of males is either zero or relatively high (more than 25\%), which is not consistent with the observed low fraction of males (less than 5\%). To explain this discrepancy, we studied several models including immigration and enforced copulation. We concluded that the observed pattern can be most likely explained by a population dominated by selfing-oriented hermaphrodites receiving immigration of males.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we develop an SEIR-type model of COVID-19, with account for two particular aspects: non-exponential distribution of incubation and recovery periods, as well as age structure of the population. For the mean-field model, which does not distinguish between different age groups, we demonstrate that including a more realistic Gamma distribution of incubation and recovery periods may not have an effect on the total number of deaths and the overall size of an epidemic, but it has a major effect in terms of increasing the peak numbers of infected and critical care cases, as well as on changing the timescales of an epidemic, both in terms of time to reach the peak, and the overall duration of an outbreak. In order to obtain more accurate estimates of disease progression and investigate different strategies for introducing and lifting the lockdown, we have also considered an age-structured version of the model, which has allowed us to include more accurate data on age-specific rates of hospitalisation and COVID-19 related mortality. Applying this model to three comparable neighbouring regions in the UK has delivered some fascinating insights regarding the effect of lockdown in regions with different population structure. We have discovered that for a fixed lockdown duration, the timing of its start is very important in the sense that the second epidemic wave after lifting the lockdown can be significantly smaller or larger depending on the specific population structure. Also, the later the fixed-duration lockdown is introduced, the smaller is the resulting final number of deaths at the end of the outbreak. When the lockdown is introduced simultaneously for all regions, increasing lockdown duration postpones and slightly reduces the epidemic peak, though without noticeable differences in peak magnitude between different lockdown durations.},

  abstract     = {Oxygenic photoautotrophs are, paradoxically, subject to photoinhibition of their photosynthetic apparatus, in particular one of its major components, the Photosystem II (PSII). Photoinhibition is generalized across species, light conditions and habitats, imposing substantial metabolic costs that lower photosynthetic productivity and constrain the niches of photoautotrophy. As a process driven by light reaching PSII, light attenuation in optically thick samples influences both the actual extent, and the detection, of photoinhibition. Chlorophyll fluorescence is widely used to measure photoinhibition, but fluorescence-based parameters are affected by light attenuation of both downwelling incident radiation traversing the sample to reach PSII, and emitted fluorescence upwelling through the sample. We used modelling, experimental manipulation of within-sample light attenuation, and meta-analysis of published data, to show substantial, differential effects of light attenuation and depth-integration of emitted fluorescence upon measurements of photoinhibition. Numerical simulations and experimental manipulation of light attenuation indicated that PSII photoinactivation tracked using chlorophyll fluorescence can appear to be over three times lower than the inherent cellular susceptibility to photoinactivation, in optically-dense samples such as leaves or biofilms. The meta-analysis of published data showed that this general trend was unknowingly present in the literature, revealing an overall difference of more than five times between optically thick leaves and optically thin cell suspensions. Although fluorescence-based parameters may provide ecophysiologically relevant information for characterizing the sample as a whole, light attenuation and depth integration can vary between samples independently of their intrinsic physiology. They should be used with caution when aiming to quantify in absolute terms inherent photoinhibition-related parameters in optically thick samples.},

  abstract     = {Classical studies in evolutionary game theory assume constant payoffs. Randomly fluctuating environments in real populations make this assumption idealistic. In this paper, we study randomized two-player linear games in a finite population in a succession of birth-death events according to a Moran process and in the presence of symmetric mutation. Introducing identity measures under neutrality that depend on the mutation rate and calculating these in the limit of a large population size by using the coalescent process, we study the first-order effect of the means, variances and covariances of the payoffs on average abundance in the stationary state under mutation and selection. This shows how the average abundance of a strategy is driven not only by its mean payoffs but also by the variances and covariances of its payoffs. In Prisoner’s Dilemmas with additive cost and benefit for cooperation, where constant payoffs always favor the abundance of defection, stochastic fluctuations in the payoffs can change the strategy that is more abundant on average in the stationary state. The average abundance of cooperation is increased if the variance of any payoff to cooperation against cooperation or defection, or their covariance, is decreased, or if the variance of any payoff to defection against cooperation or defection, or their covariance, is increased. This is also the case for a Prisoner’s Dilemma with independent payoffs that is repeated a random number of times. As for the mutation rate, it comes into play in the coefficients of the variances and covariances that determine average abundance. Increasing the mutation rate can enhance or lessen the condition for a strategy to be more abundant on average than another.},

  abstract     = {The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has infected more than 79 million individuals, with 1.7 million deaths worldwide. Several countries have implemented social distancing and testing policies with contact tracing as a measure to flatten the curve of the ongoing pandemic. Optimizing these control measures is urgent given the substantial societal and economic impacts associated with infection and interventions. To determine the optimal social distancing and testing strategies, we developed a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission and applied optimal control theory, identifying the best approach to reduce the epidemiological burden of COVID-19 at a minimal cost. The results demonstrate that testing as a standalone optimal strategy does not have a significant effect on the final size of an epidemic, but it would delay the peak of the pandemic. If social distancing is the sole control strategy, it would be optimal to gradually increase the level of social distancing as the incidence curve of COVID-19 grows, and relax the measures after the curve has reached its peak. Compared with a single strategy, combined social distancing and testing strategies are demonstrated to be more efficient at reducing the disease burden, and they can delay the peak of the disease. To optimize these strategies, testing should be maintained at a maximum level in the early phases and after the peak of the epidemic, whereas social distancing should be intensified when the prevalence of the disease is greater than 15\%. Accordingly, public health agencies should implement early testing and switch to social distancing when the incidence level begins to increase. After the peak of the pandemic, it would be optimal to gradually relax social distancing and switch back to testing.},

Do the branches along a tree trunk exhibit similar patterns? Here we use branch skeleton data derived from terrestrial laser scans to empirically estimate the distributions of the divergence angles between successive branches along the trunks of mature European beech, Norway spruce , and Scots pine trees. We find that rather than clustering around a particular value, species-specific branch divergence angles feature statistical properties characteristic of a uniform distribution. We hypothesise this to be the result of the stochasticity in bud development and branch shedding, and provide a rigorous mathematical proof that even when the divergence angle between successive lateral buds is constant, the observed distribution of branch divergence angles will approximate a uniform distribution if bud mortality and branch shedding rates are high.},

  abstract     = {We developed a tumor control probability (TCP) model that incorporates variable time intervals between fractions and a kick-off time (T k ) for radiation-induced accelerated tumor proliferation. The resulting Lee-Rosen model, TCP LR , was used to compute TCPs for treatment courses with and without weekend treatment for tumors with different proliferation rates – slow (prostate), moderate (breast), and rapid (head and neck). TCPs were computed using ideal uniform dose distributions and actual patient plans. The doses for the uniform plans were the mean doses for the prostate and breast cases and the minimum tumor dose for the head and neck case. The TCP LR model predictions agreed with expectations that TCP increases with increasing T k in all cases. For standard fractionation, as T k increased from 0 to 4 weeks, TCP increased for the patient distributions by 74.7\% for the head and neck cancer, by 6.2\% for the breast cancer, and by 2.4\% for the prostate cancers. For the uniform dose distributions, the increases were 79.2\%, 5.7\%, and 2.3\%, respectively. TCP increased as the number of weekend breaks decreased. The effect of weekend breaks decreased as the tumor proliferation rate decreased. For the head and neck tumor, notable decreases in TCP of 6.0\% (uniform dose distribution) and 6.8\% (actual plan dose distribution) were observed with Friday starts compared to Monday starts for the standard 5 fx/wk schedule (T k = 4 wk). The 7 fx/wk schedule produced increases in TCP of 17.0\% and 20.5\% for the uniform and patient dose distributions, respectively, compared to the standard schedule. For the breast cancer, starting the 5 fx/wk schedule on Friday decreased the TCP by 0.2\% (T k = 4 wk) compared to a Monday start. The 7 fx/wk schedule produced increases of 0.3\% and 0.4\% in TCP compared to the standard schedule for the uniform and patient dose distributions, respectively (T k = 4 wk). For the prostate cancer, the change in TCP for 5 fx/wk schedules starting on different days was 0.1\%. The 7 fx/wk schedule increased TCP by 0.8\% compared to the standard schedule (T k = 4 wk). TCP values for the uniform dose distributions for the standard schedule (T k = 4 wk) agreed with the TCP values for the actual dose distributions within 4.5\% for the head and neck tumor and within 0.2\% for the breast and prostate tumors. This good agreement suggests that the doses chosen for the uniform dose distributions were good approximations to the clinical doses. The results for head and neck tumors support, in part, the current practice of hyperfractionated/accelerated radiotherapy. They also suggest that shortening the overall treatment time for conventional fractions by eliminating weekend breaks might be beneficial. The predicted effect on TCP of the various schedules studied was insignificant for prostate and breast tumors, suggesting that a weekend treatment might not be necessary for patients starting radiotherapy on a Friday. There is significant uncertainty in the values of the model parameters chosen for these calculations, and no consideration was given to the potential effects of these various schedules on normal tissues.},

  abstract     = {Maternal selection and overlapping generations can facilitate the stable coexistence of alleles under temporally fluctuating environment. Using mathematical models, we considered the complex effect of both factors on the maintenance of genetic polymorphism in cyclically changing environments. We concentrated on asymmetric cyclic selection, which allows describing fluctuations of environments by analogy of food resources cycles with rare peaks and prolonged decline of prey abundance. The complex effect of maternal selection and overlapping generations turned out to work as follows: although overlapping generations always tend to dilate the polymorphism region, odd and even external cycles produce different types of polymorphism regions. Maternal selection under external odd cycles extends the coexistence region comparing with classic selection. Even cycles produce a part of parameter region, where the picture changes radically, and classic selection becomes more effective in maintaining polymorphism. Our models have clear biological interpretation, because we tried to model a situation demonstrated by natural populations of arctic foxes. The litter size being a major life history trait is a sex-limited female trait. It is influenced by maternal selection with cyclical fluctuations because of oscillations in food abundance. Arctic fox is a long-lived species having an age structure. The obtained results showed that compared with the simple Mendelian inheritance in the classic model, this trait inheritance allows polymorphism to be maintained in a wider range of the parameter that characterizes the advantage of survival in a small litter. Besides, adding overlapping generations to the model further broadens the parameter space for the protected polymorphism. Thus, this study shows that maternal selection and overlapping generations increases the chances of maintaining polymorphism in populations of arctic foxes.},

  abstract     = {Murray’s law, which states that the cube of the radius of a parent vessel equals the sum of the cubes of the radii of the daughter vessels, was originally derived by minimizing the cost of operation of blood flow in a single cylindrical tube. An alternative widely cited derivation by Sherman is based upon the optimization problem of minimizing the total flow resistance subject to a material constraint, and that study claimed that “Conservation of the sum of the cubes of the radii is the condition for minimal resistance whether the parent vessel divides symmetrically or asymmetrically, and whether it divides into two, three, four, or, presumably, any number of daughter vessels.” In this paper we show that Sherman’s analysis is flawed, since with N daughter vessels there are 2 N - N - 1 2N-N-1 sets of vessel radii which satisfy Murray’s law but which do not yield minimal total flow resistance. Moreover, we show that when there are N daughter vessels, each with the same radius, the minimal total flow resistance is an increasing function of N for N ⩾ 1 N⩾1 . Since N = 1 N=1 corresponds to the degenerate case of no branching at all, our result implies that bifurcation ( N = 2 N=2 ) achieves the minimal total flow resistance. Our analysis thus offers an explanation for the preponderance of bifurcations (as opposed to trifurcations or higher level branchings) in many biological systems.},

  abstract     = {Should theories of “higher-level” cognitive effects originate in “lower-level” molecular mechanisms? This paper supports reductionist explanations of sensory perception via molecular mechanisms in neurobiology. It shows that molecular and cellular mechanisms must constitute the material foundation to derive better theories and models for neuroscience. In support of “bottom-up theorizing”, I explore the recent application of a new real-time molecular imaging technique (SCAPE microscopy) to mixture coding in olfaction. Seemingly emergent “higher-level” psychological effects in odor perception, irreducible to the physical stimulus, are linked back to underlying molecular mechanisms at the receptor level. The SCAPE study has notable theoretical impact. It provides a possible answer to the neurocomputational challenge in olfaction from combinatorial coding at the periphery: how does the brain discriminate different complex mixtures from widespread and overlapping receptor activation? The failure of previous reductionist structure-odor explanations is shown to reside in misconceptualizations of the critical causal elements involved. Causally fundamental features are not of parts independently of a mechanism. Components and their relevant features are units via their causal role within a mechanism. Here, new technologies allow revisiting our understanding of the ontology and levels of organization of a system.},

  abstract     = {In China, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) serotype O remains prevalent, and its main host is pigs. Infected but undiscovered pigs can carry foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) for a longtime. And, the virus can spread among farms through pig trade. Although individual vaccination at least 2 times a year and monthly monitoring disease and culling all individual in same group for pigs are adopted vigorously in China, the epidemic remains prevalent. Therefore, in this paper, based on these propagation characteristics and control measures of the epidemic in China, we take the pig farms as research individuals, the trade among farms as transmission routes to establish a dynamic model with nonlinear incidence. In addition, we use this model to assess the impact of trade and transport of pigs among farms on the spread of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), and to assess the effect of the immunization, monitoring and culling adopted presently in China on the control of the epidemic. By the dynamical analysis of the model, it is found that there will appear backward branching under some conditions, which means that there are two spreading thresholds for the disease, and the disease development trend is also related to the current epidemic situation. Besides, we give the threshold conditions of key parameters to control the spread of FMD. By carrying out data fitting and parameter estimation, we confirm the model rationality, and give four evaluation indexes: the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 of FMD serotype O in China, the value of the infected farms at the equilibria, annual probability of a susceptible farm being infected and annual transmission intensity of an infected farm. By carrying out the sensitivity analysis of key parameters on four evaluation indexes, the effect of parameters on the spread of the disease can be intuitively observed. All these can provide a theoretical basis for understanding of the trading-based transmission mechanism, control and prevention of foot-and-mouth disease in pigs in China.},

The sampling designs used are often biased in that they do not reflect the true underlying populations. For instance, individuals with strong symptoms are more likely to be tested than those with no symptoms. This results in biased estimates of prevalence (too high). Typical post-sampling corrections are not always possible. Here we present a simple bias correction methodology derived and adapted from a correction for publication bias in meta analysis studies. The methodology is general enough to allow a wide variety of customization making it more useful in practice. Implementation is easily done using already collected information. Via a simulation and two real datasets, we show that the bias corrections can provide dramatic reductions in estimation error.},

  abstract     = {A honey bee can dip nectar of viscosity across two orders of magnitude, by viscous lapping technique using a segmental tongue covered with erectable hairs. The drinking technique suffers risks of leakage occurring between tongue hairs, and the amount of leakage is related to hair spacing as well as nectar viscosity. When lapping, tongue segments are elongated, which enlarges the hair spacing in longitudinal direction. Experimental observations show that the hair spacing of tongue increases with respect to sucrose solution concentration until it reaches the maximum extension when sucrose solution concentration is above 35\%. Considering leakage occurring in the hairy tongue, we hypothesize that the dynamical extension of hair spacing may help honey bees minimize the effects of leakage to reach maximal nectar intake rate. A mathematical model is developed for determining the optimal hair spacing that can meet the demands of both augmenting the nectar intake rate and reducing the risk of leakage. Theoretical prediction and experimental measurements demonstrate honey bees are able to adjust the tongue to meet the optimal hair spacing when dipping nectar of concentration more dilute than 35\% and maintain a maximum extension to improve the nectar intake rate when concentration is greater than 35\%. We then give the prediction of concentration preferences of three bee species, and discuss effects of dipping frequency and gravity on the leakiness between tongue hairs. This work may not only gain insights into adaptive feeding strategy in insects, but inspire the design of adaptive microfluidic transport devices with dynamic brushy surfaces.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we assess the impact of the phage-bacteria infection and optimal control on the indirectly transmitted cholera disease. The phage-bacteria interactions are described by predator–prey system using the Smith functional response, which takes into account the number of bacteria binding sites. The study is done in two steps, namely the model without control and the model with control. For the first scenario, we explicitly compute the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 which serves as stability threshold and bifurcation parameter. The proposed model exhibits a bi-stability phenomenon via the existence of backward bifurcation, which implies that the classical requirement of bringing the reproduction number under unity, while necessary, is no longer sufficient for cholera elimination from the population. We intuitively introduce a new threshold number N 0 N0 needed for the global stability of the disease free equilibrium point which is achieved when R 0 ⩽ 1 R0⩽1 and N 0 ⩽ 1 N0⩽1 . It is further shown that the phage absorption is a possible cause of bi-stability, since in its absence, the condition R 0 ⩽ 1 R0⩽1 is sufficient for cholera to die out. The existence of endemic equilibrium points depends on the range of both R 0 R0 and N 0 N0 . Regarding the model extended to an optimal control problem, which involves the use of virulent vibriophages to reduce or eliminate the bacteria population, we use optimal control theory techniques. We establish the conditions under which the spread of cholera can be stopped, and examine the impact of control measures on the transmission dynamic of cholera. The Pontryagin’s maximum principle is used to characterize the optimal control. Numerical simulations suggest that, the release of lytic vibriophages can significantly reduce the spread of the disease. We discuss opportunities for phage therapy as treatment of some bacterial-borne diseases without side effects.},

  abstract     = {Motile cells depend on an intricate network of feedback loops that are essential in driving cell movement. Integrin-based focal adhesions (FAs) along with actin are the two key factors that mediate such motile behaviour. Together, they generate excitable dynamics that are essential for forming protrusions at the leading edge of the cell and, in certain cases, traveling waves along the membrane. A partial differential equation (PDE) model of a self-organizing lamellipodium in crawling keratocytes has been previously developed to understand how the three spatiotemporal patterns of activity observed in such cells, namely, stalling, waving and smooth motility, are produced. The model consisted of three key variables: the density of barbed actin filaments, newly formed FAs called nascent adhesions (NAs) and VASP, an anti-capping protein that gets sequestered by NAs during maturation. Using parameter sweeping techniques, the distinct regimes of behaviour associated with the three activity patterns were identified. In this study, we convert the PDE model into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to examine its excitability properties and determine all the patterns of activity exhibited by this system. Our results reveal that there are two additional regimes not previously identified, including bistability and oscillatory-like type IV excitability (generated by three steady states and their manifolds, rather than limit cycles). These regimes are also present in the PDE model. Applying slow-fast analysis on the ODE model shows that it exhibits a canard explosion through a folded-saddle and that rough motility seen in keratocytes is likely due to noise-dependent motility governed by dynamics near the interface of bistability and type IV excitability. The two parameter bifurcation suggests that the increase in the proportion of rough motion is due to a shift in activity towards the bistable and type IV excitable regimes induced by a decrease in NA maturation rate. Our results thus provide important insight into how microscopic mechanical effects are integrated to produce the observed modes of motility.},

The present paper develops a mathematical model of the multiple sclerosis plaques. Although these plaques do not provide reliable information of the clinical disability in MS, they are nevertheless useful as a primary outcome measure of Phase II trials. The model consists of a system of partial differential equations in a simplified geometry of the lesion, consisting of three domains: perivascular space, demyelinated plaque, and white matter. The model describes the activity of various pro- and anti-inflammatory cells and cytokines in the plaque, and quantifies their effect on plaque growth. We show that volume growth of plaques are in qualitative agreement with reported clinical studies of several currently used drugs. We then use the model to explore treatments with combinations of such drugs, and with experimental drugs. We finally consider the benefits of early vs. delayed treatment.},

The way new vessels are formed involves cell sprouting from pre-existing vessels and following a trail via a chemotactic mechanism (CM). Namely, it is first proposed a detailed general family of models of the CM, based on a statistical mechanics approach. The key hypothesis is that the CM is composed by two components: i) the well–known bias induced by the angiogenic factor gradient; ii) the presence of stochastic changes of the velocity direction, thus giving rise to a diffusive component. Then, some further assumptions and simplifications are applied in order to derive a specific model to be used in the simulations. The tumor progression is favored by its acidic aggression towards the healthy cells. The model includes the evolution of many biological and chemical species. Numerical simulations show the onset of a traveling wave eventually replacing the host tissue with a fully vascularized tumor. The results of simulations agree with experimental measures of the vasculature density in tumors, even in the case of particularly hypoxic tumors.},

  abstract     = {Seroepidemiological surveillance data has been demonstrated to be useful for estimating the cumulative incidence of influenza, and measures the difference between pre- and post-epidemic seropositive fractions. Despite this, such studies relied on a chosen cut-off value for seropositivity. The aim of the present study is to develop a method to analyze distributions of serial cross-sectional seroepidemiological surveillance datasets using an epidemiological model so that the transmission potential can be estimated without imposing a cut-off value. A mathematical model of influenza transmission with a discrete antibody titer level was constructed. The final size equation for pre- and post-epidemic titer levels was derived. Subsequently, using the estimated distribution of the dilution increase caused by infection and the measurement error distribution, the model parameters were optimized using the maximum likelihood method. A bootstrap-based confidence interval calculation and sensitivity analysis were also performed. Without imposing a cut-off value, the cumulative incidence was quantified, thereby yielding an estimate of the basic reproduction number. For the purpose of exposition, the proposed method was applied to influenza A/Victoria/3/75(H3N2) data, and serological data between 1975 and 1976 were compared. The estimated reproduction number was greater than that using the cut-off value of the hemagglutination inhibition level with titer level 20 (dilution 1:20) or above to define positives. The proposed method without a cut-off value offers an unbiased approach to estimating the cumulative incidence along with the reproduction number. If a cut-off value is required, the results imply that titer level 20 or above may better represent a reasonable cut-off value for calculating the incidence, but it could underestimate the basic reproduction number.},

The basic reproduction number R 0 R0 , an indication of the probability of an outbreak for homogeneous populations does not indicate the probability of an outbreak for non-homogeneous models anymore, because it changes with the initially infected case. Therefore, we use “individual R 0 R0 ” that is the expected number of secondary cases for a unique given initially infected individual. Thus, the effectiveness of intervention strategies can be assessed by their capability to reduce individual R 0 R0 values. Also a vaccination plan based on individual R 0 R0 values for fully heterogeneous populations is proposed. It is based on the recursive calculation of individual R 0 R0 values.},

  abstract     = {DNA molecules containing repetitive motifs are prone to expand in their lengths. Once there appear a head to tail tandem of two identical DNA sequences in the system, they can propagate indefinitely by the mechanism involving cycles of staggered annealing of complementary DNA strands of variable lengths and polymerase mediated filling-in of the generated overhangs. Microgene Polymerization Reaction (MPR) is an experimental model for expansion of short repetitive DNA to longer lengths. The testable kinetic model of (MPR) was formulated and solved numerically by Itsko et al . in Kinetics of Repeat Propagation in the Microgene Polymerization Reaction (2009). Here, the simple cases of MPR were solved analytically using modified Smoluchowski coagulation equation. It was found that the repeats propagate according to Gumbel probability density function when the distribution of lengths of obtained polymers follows inverted Gumbel probability density function.},

  abstract     = {Etosha National Park (ENP) is located in Namibia, where an annual anthrax outbreak (caused by Bacillus anthracis ) occurs among grazing animals such as zebras. This increases the number of carcasses in ENP, allowing for scavengers such as jackals to feed off these carcasses. Carcasses provide a location of conspecific interaction between jackals and may be a means of disease transmission among the jackals. We are interested in studying how a disease in the zebra population may help to propagate a different disease (rabies) in the jackal population since the carcasses are providing a location of interaction between the jackals. We aim to answer the following research question: how do anthrax and rabies affect each other’s ability to spread? Standard qualitative analysis techniques distinguished outcomes (stable equilibria) using reproduction numbers as threshold quantities. We found that rabies helps anthrax, and a little anthrax helps rabies invade, but a lot of anthrax prevents rabies by reducing the jackal population through its food source.},

  abstract     = {A promising, yet still under development approach to cancer treatment is based on the idea of differentiation therapy (DTH). Most tumours are characterized by poorly differentiated cell populations exhibiting a marked loss of traits associated to communication and tissue homeostasis. DTH has been suggested as an alternative (or complement) to cytotoxic-based approaches, and has proven successful in some specific types of cancer such as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). While novel drugs favouring the activation of differentiation therapies are being tested, several open problems emerge in relation to its effectiveness on solid tumors. Here we present a mathematical framework to DTH based on a well-known ecological model used to describe habitat loss. The models presented here account for some of the observed clinical and in vitro outcomes of DTH, providing relevant insight into potential therapy design. Furthermore, the same ecological approach is tested in a hierarchical model that accounts for cancer stem cells, highlighting the role of niche specificity in CSC therapy resistance. We show that the lessons learnt from metapopulation ecology can help guide future developments and potential difficulties of DTH.},

  abstract     = {Variation is characteristic of all living systems. Laboratory techniques such as flow cytometry can probe individual cells, and, after decades of experimentation, it is clear that even members of genetically identical cell populations can exhibit differences. To understand whether variation is biologically meaningful, it is essential to discern its source. Mathematical models of biological systems are tools that can be used to investigate causes of cell-to-cell variation. From mathematical analysis and simulation of these models, biological hypotheses can be posed and investigated, then parameter inference can determine which of these is compatible with experimental data. Data from laboratory experiments often consist of “snapshots” representing distributions of cellular properties at different points in time, rather than individual cell trajectories. These data are not straightforward to fit using hierarchical Bayesian methods, which require the number of cell population clusters to be chosen a priori . Nor are they amenable to standard nonlinear mixed effect methods, since a single observation per cell is typically too few to estimate parameter variability. Here, we introduce a computational sampling method named “Contour Monte Carlo” (CMC) for estimating mathematical model parameters from snapshot distributions, which is straightforward to implement and does not require that cells be assigned to predefined categories. The CMC algorithm fits to snapshot probability distributions rather than raw data, which means its computational burden does not, like existing approaches, increase with the number of cells observed. Our method is appropriate for underdetermined systems, where there are fewer distinct types of observations than parameters to be determined, and where observed variation is mostly due to variability in cellular processes rather than experimental measurement error. This may be the case for many systems due to continued improvements in resolution of laboratory techniques. In this paper, we apply our method to quantify cellular variation for three biological systems of interest and provide Julia code enabling others to use this method.},

Legumes have physiological mechanisms for regulating nodule production with chemical signals produced in leaves, called the autoregulation of nodulation. In this paper, we discuss the optimal number of root nodules that maximizes the performance of the host plant. Here, we study two models. In the stationary plant model, the acquired photosynthetic products minus cost and loss are used for reproduction. In the growing plant model, the excess material is invested to produce leaves, roots, and root nodules, resulting in the exponential growth of the whole plant. The analysis shows that having root nodules is beneficial to the plant for a high leaf nitrogen content, faster plant growth rate, a short leaf longevity, a low root/shoot ratio, and low soil nutrient concentration. We discuss the long-distance control of nodulation-autoregulation and dependence on the environmental conditions of terrestrial plants considering these results.},

The population is made of N pairs of individuals and is updated at every time step by a birth–death event according to a Moran model. Assuming an intensity of selection of order 1 / N 1/N and taking 2 N 2 2N2 birth–death events as unit of time, a diffusion approximation exhibiting two time scales, a fast one for pair frequencies and a slow one for cooperation ( C ) and defection ( D ) frequencies, is ascertained in the limit of a large population size. This diffusion approximation is applied to an additive PD game, cooperation by an individual incurring a cost c to the individual but providing a benefit b to the opponent. This is used to obtain the probability of ultimate fixation of C introduced as a single mutant in an all D population under selection, which can be compared to the probability under neutrality, 1 / ( 2 N ) 1/(2N) , as well as the corresponding probability for a single D introduced in an all C population under selection. This gives conditions for cooperation to be favored by selection. We show that these conditions are satisfied when the benefit-to-cost ratio, b / c b/c , exceeds some increasing function of ρ ρ that is approximately given by ( 1 + ρ ) / ( 1 - ρ ) (1+ρ)/(1-ρ) . This condition is more stringent, however, than the condition for tit-for-tat ( TFT ) to be favored against always-defect ( AllD ) in the absence of opting-out.},

  abstract     = {In many terrestrial, marine, and freshwater predator-prey communities, young predators can be vulnerable to attacks by large prey. Frequent prey counter-attacks may hinder the persistence of predators. Despite the commonness of such role reversals in nature, they have rarely been addressed in evolutionary modelling. To understand how role reversals affect ecological and evolutionary dynamics of a predator-prey community, we derived an ecological model from individual-level processes using ordinary differential equations. The model reveals complex ecological dynamics, with possible bistability between alternative coexistence states and an Allee effect for the predators. We find that when prey counter-attacks are frequent, cannibalism is necessary for predator persistence. Using numerical analysis, we also find that a sudden ecological shift from coexistence to predator extinction can occur through several catastrophic bifurcations, including ‘saddle-node’, ‘homoclinic’, and ‘subcritical Hopf’. The analysis of single-species evolution reveals that predator selection towards increasing or decreasing cannibalism triggers a catastrophic shift towards an extinction state of the predators. Such an evolutionary extinction of the predators may also be caused by prey selection towards increasing foraging activity because it facilitates encounters with vulnerable, young predators. The analysis of predator-prey coevolution further demonstrates that predator’s catastrophic extinction becomes an even more likely outcome than in single-species evolution. Our results suggest that when young predators are vulnerable to prey attacks, a sudden extinction of the predators may be more common than currently understood.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the current COVID-19 epidemic, this work introduces an epidemiological model in which separate compartments are used for susceptible and asymptomatic “socially distant” populations. Distancing directives are represented by rates of flow into these compartments, as well as by a reduction in contacts that lessens disease transmission. The dynamical behavior of this system is analyzed, under various different rate control strategies, and the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number to various parameters is studied. One of the striking features of this model is the existence of a critical implementation delay (CID) in issuing distancing mandates: while a delay of about two weeks does not have an appreciable effect on the peak number of infections, issuing mandates even slightly after this critical time results in a far greater incidence of infection. Thus, there is a nontrivial but tight “window of opportunity” for commencing social distancing in order to meet the capacity of healthcare resources. However, if one wants to also delay the timing of peak infections – so as to take advantage of potential new therapies and vaccines – action must be taken much faster than the CID. Different relaxation strategies are also simulated, with surprising results. Periodic relaxation policies suggest a schedule which may significantly inhibit peak infective load, but that this schedule is very sensitive to parameter values and the schedule’s frequency. Furthermore, we considered the impact of steadily reducing social distancing measures over time. We find that a too-sudden reopening of society may negate the progress achieved under initial distancing guidelines, but the negative effects can be mitigated if the relaxation strategy is carefully designed.},

  abstract     = {We present a null model to be compared with biological data to test for intrinsic persistence in movement between stops during intermittent locomotion in bounded space with different geometries and boundary conditions. We describe spatio-temporal properties of the sequence of stopping points r 1 , r 2 , r 3 , … r1,r2,r3,… visited by a Random Walker within a bounded space. The path between stopping points is not considered, only the displacement. Since there are no intrinsic correlations in the displacements between stopping points, there is no intrinsic persistence in the movement between them. Hence, this represents a null-model against which to compare empirical data for directional persistence in the movement between stopping points when there is external bias due to the bounded space. This comparison is a necessary first step in testing hypotheses about the function of the stops that punctuate intermittent locomotion in diverse organisms. We investigate the probability of forward movement, defined as a deviation of less than 90 ° 90° between two successive displacement vectors, as a function of the ratio between the largest displacement between stops that could be performed by the random walker and the system size, α = Δ ℓ / L max α=Δℓ/Lmax . As expected, the probability of forward movement is 1 / 2 1/2 when α → 0 α→0 . However, when α α is finite, this probability is less than 1 / 2 1/2 with a minimum value when α = 1 α=1 . For certain boundary conditions, the minimum value is between 1 / 3 1/3 and 1 / 4 1/4 in 1D while it can be even lower in 2D. The probability of forward movement in 1D is calculated exactly for all values 0 0&amp;lt;α⩽1 for several boundary conditions. Analytical calculations for the probability of forward movement are performed in 2D for circular and square bounded regions with one boundary condition. Numerical results for all values 0 0&amp;lt;α⩽1 are presented for several boundary conditions. The cases of rectangle and ellipse are also considered and an approximate model of the dependence of the forward movement probability on the aspect ratio is provided. Finally, some practical points are presented on how these results can be utilised in the empirical analysis of animal movement in two-dimensional bounded space.},

Butterflies and moths are taken as illustrative and representative of fluid-feeding insects. We demonstrated that the proposed mechanism of filling the proboscis with fluid through permeable lengthwise bands, in association with a thin film of saliva in the food canal, offers a competitive pathway for fluid uptake. Compared with the conventional mechanism of fluid uptake through apically restricted openings, the new mechanism provides a faster rate of fluid uptake, especially for long-tongued insects. Accordingly, long-tongued insects with permeable lengthwise bands would be able to more rapidly exploit a broader range of liquids in the form of films, pools, and discontinuous columns, thereby conserving energy and minimizing exposure to predators, particularly for hovering insects.},

  abstract     = {Metacommunity membership is influenced by habitat availability and trophic requirements. However, for multitrophic horizontally transmitted symbiont communities that are closely associated with hosts, symbiont–host interactions may affect membership criteria in novel ways. For example, failure of beneficial services from symbionts could influence the host, and in turn, the entire community. Understanding such host–symbiont feedback effects on symbiont community membership, symbiont community structure, and function is important for understanding if host–symbiont communities are fundamentally different from more traditional ecological communities. We investigate the membership criteria for a multitrophic insect symbiont community that colonizes host inflorescences at specific developmental stages termed colonization windows. The inflorescences serve as microcosm habitats. Symbionts exhibit a range of interactions from mutualism to parasitism. Hosts exhibit feedback by aborting inflorescences not pollinated by mutualistic symbionts. Habitats are consequently lost for all other symbiont species in such host-derived organs whose development is mutualist-dependent. Using empirical measurements to characterize inflorescence development, we simulate symbiont dispersal colonization across hosts. We vary host densities and lengths of symbiont colonization windows, and track the persistence of each symbiont species in the metacommunity based on its trophic requirements and resource availability within the microcosm. Since the persistence of the microcosm habitat is dictated by pollination performed by the mutualist, the mutualist fared better than all other symbionts. The length of symbiont colonization windows was positively related with colonization success and symbiont persistence. The cumulative length of the colonization windows of prey dictated predator success; diet breadth or prey colonization success did not influence predator persistence. Predators also had a greater host-plant density requirement than prey for persistence in the community. These results offer valuable insights into host densities required for maintaining symbionts, and have implications for multitrophic symbiont community stability. Special constraints can govern symbiont community membership, function and structure and symbiont persistence when host–symbiont feedback impacts host microcosm development.},

  abstract     = {The adaptive and innate branches of the vertebrate immune system work in close collaboration to protect organisms from harmful pathogens. As an organism ages its immune system undergoes immunosenescence, characterized by declined performance or malfunction in either immune branch, which can lead to disease and death. In this study we develop a mathematical framework of coupled innate and adaptive immune responses, namely the integrated immune branch (IIB) model. This model describes dynamics of immune components in both branches, uses a shape-space representation to encode pathogen-specific immune memory, and exhibits three steady states – health, septic death, and chronic inflammation – qualitatively similar to clinically-observed immune outcomes. In this model, the immune system (initialized in the health state) is subjected to a sequence of pathogen encounters, and we use the number of prior pathogen encounters as a proxy for the “age” of the immune system. We find that repeated pathogen encounters may trigger a fragility in which any encounter with a novel pathogen will cause the system to irreversibly switch from health to chronic inflammation. This transition is consistent with the onset of “inflammaging”, a condition observed in aged individuals who experience chronic low-grade inflammation even in the absence of pathogens. The IIB model predicts that the onset of chronic inflammation strongly depends on the history of encountered pathogens; the timing of onset differs drastically when the same set of infections occurs in a different order. Lastly, the coupling between the innate and adaptive immune branches generates a trade-off between rapid pathogen clearance and a delayed onset of immunosenescence. Overall, by considering the complex feedback between immune compartments, our work suggests potential mechanisms for immunosenescence and provides a theoretical framework at the system level and on the scale of an organism’s lifetime to account for clinical observations.},

  abstract     = {As protection against infectious disease, immunity is conferred by one of two main defense mechanisms, namely (i) resistance generated by previous infection (known as natural immunity) or (ii) by being vaccinated (known as artificial immunity). To analyze, a modified SVIRS epidemic model is established that integrates the effects of the durability of protection and imperfectness in the framework of the human decision-making process as a vaccination game. It is supposed that immunized people become susceptible again when their immunity expires, which depends on the duration of immunity. The current theory for most voluntary vaccination games assumes that seasonal diseases such as influenza are controlled by a temporal vaccine, the immunity of which lasts for only one season. Also, a novel perspective is established involving an individual’s immune system combined with self-interest to take the vaccine and natural immunity obtained from infection by coupling a disease-spreading model with an evolutionary game approach over a long period. Numerical simulations show that the longer attenuation helps significantly to control the spread of disease. Also discovered is the entire mechanism of active and passive immunities , in the sense of how they coexist with natural and artificial immunity. Thus, the prospect of finding the optimal strategy for eradicating a disease could help in the design of effective vaccination campaigns and policies.},

Under normal conditions, we determined that the viral infection outcome is modulated by the innate immune response and the positive-strand viral RNA concentration. Additionally, we tested system perturbations by external stimulation, such as the direct induction of the innate immune response by interferon, and a therapeutic intervention consisting of the direct application of mRNA encoding for several interferon-stimulated genes.

However, the reperfusion itself can also induce myocardial injury, in which the actual mechanism and its risk factors remain unclear. This work aims to study the mechanism of ischemia–reperfusion treatment using a three-dimensional (3D) oxygen diffusion model. An electrical model is then coupled to an oxygen model to identify the possible region of myocardial damage. Our findings show that the value of oxygen exceeds its optimum (&gt;1.0) at the ischemic area during early reperfusion period. This complication was exacerbated in a longer ischemic period. While a longer reperfusion time causes a continuous excessive oxygen supply to the ischemic area throughout the reperfusion time. This work also suggests the use of less than 0.8 of initial oxygen concentration in the reperfusion treatment to prevent undesired upsurge at the early reperfusion period and further myocardial injury. We also found the region at risk for myocardial injury is confined in the ischemic vicinity revealed by its electrical conductivity impairment. Although there is a risk that reperfusion leads to myocardial injury for excessive oxygen accumulation, the reperfusion treatment is helpful in reducing the infarct size.},

  abstract     = {Combination therapies have shown remarkable success in preventing the evolution of resistance to multiple drugs, including HIV, tuberculosis, and cancer. Nevertheless, the rise in drug resistance still remains an important challenge. The capability to accurately predict the emergence of resistance, either to one or multiple drugs, may help to improve treatment options. Existing theoretical approaches often focus on exponential growth laws, which may not be realistic when scarce resources and competition limit growth. In this work, we study the emergence of single and double drug resistance in a model of combination therapy of two drugs. The model describes a sensitive strain, two types of single-resistant strains, and a double-resistant strain. We compare the probability that resistance emerges for three growth laws: exponential growth, logistic growth without competition between strains, and logistic growth with competition between strains. Using mathematical estimates and numerical simulations, we show that between-strain competition only affects the emergence of single resistance when resources are scarce. In contrast, the probability of double resistance is affected by between-strain competition over a wider space of resource availability. This indicates that competition between different resistant strains may be pertinent to identifying strategies for suppressing drug resistance, and that exponential models may overestimate the emergence of resistance to multiple drugs. A by-product of our work is an efficient strategy to evaluate probabilities of single and double resistance in models with multiple sequential mutations. This may be useful for a range of other problems in which the probability of resistance is of interest.},

  abstract     = {It is essential to understand the failure modes and the failure moments of curved stems since trees could be damaged and may cause severe loss of life and property in urban. In our previous papers, the cracking failure mechanism of hollow erect and curved trunks under bending moment was clarified and we also found that the mechanism of cracking failure of solid trunk is different from the hollow one. While the existing equation to calculate the transverse stress of a solid curved stem under a bending moment is approximate and may cause considerable errors when the initial curvature of stem is small. To solve this problem, a series of novel equations were derived in this study. Among these newly derived equations, 3 of them are especially practical in the assessment of the risk of urban tree for both safety and environment management which are M c , c min R and c cri R. The equation of M c is to calculate the bending moment for a solid curved trunk at which the cracking failure is initiated and this equation is more accurate than the existing equation. The equation of c min R is to calculate the minimum cR ( c : curvature, R : radius of trunk) below which cracking failure will not occur, and the equation of c cri R is to calculate the critical cR which represents equal opportunities for cracking and bending failure of the stem to occur. To exert our model to practice, the equations derived in this paper were applied to literature data (Wood handbook, 1999). From the data of 41 species of softwood and 48 species of hardwood, statistically, hardwoods have larger average values of c min R and c cri R than softwoods which means that hardwoods are more resistant to cracking failure than softwoods.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the stability of equilibrium solutions of a recently formulated mathematical model of Savanna ecosystem is analytically and numerically analyzed. The mathematical model is formulated by generalizing all plant life into three components; trees, tree saplings, and grass under ecologically valid effects of fire, rainfall and competition for space. Fire has a considerable effect on trees by delaying the recruitment of saplings to trees and the recruitment rate is a piecewise linear decreasing function of grass with a sigmoidal shape. This leads to there existing different equilibria in the plant community of a Savanna ecosystem. It is rigorously demonstrated that the local stability of equilibria depends on the slope and value of the recruitment function. Moreover, it is found that the composition of high grass cover and low tree cover or low grass cover and high tree cover are the stable equilibria, while intermediate cover results in unstable equilibria. In analyzing the global stability of solutions, it is found that the limit set is an equilibrium solution. Several numerical simulations are provided to validate the analytical studies of the behavior of the equilibrium solutions. The numerical solutions are generated using a Python ordinary differential equation(ODE) solver. The analytical and numerical solutions presented in this work are very important for further developments in the area of mathematical ecology.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcing the high-dose/refuge strategy with releases of transgenic insects has been suggested as a method for simultaneously managing agricultural pest populations and resistance to transgenic crops. Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that these approaches can work when deployed against closed populations and the assumptions of the HDR strategy are met. However, field-evolved resistance is often linked to non-recessive resistance or refuge non-compliance, and pest management regimes are likely to take place at the landscape-level. It is therefore important to understand how effective such strategies are when resistance is non-recessive, and how they could be employed in agricultural landscapes. We developed a spatially-explicit model to investigate the efficacy of strategies combining refuges with transgenic insect releases to manage a pest with non-recessive resistance in agricultural landscapes. We compared two release strategies, area-wide releases and localised releases targeted at population hotspots, and analysed the effects of refuge and release parameters on population and resistance dynamics. Area-wide releases reliably achieved landscape-level pest eradication. Localised releases also eradicated the pest when low release thresholds were combined with high release ratios, and maintained the pest at low densities when insufficient to achieve extinction. Reinforcing refuges with localised releases also greatly enhanced the probability of resistance extinction. However, when resistance remained in the population, localised releases prevented resistance from reaching fixation rather than greatly delaying or reversing resistance evolution. Our work indicates that combining refuges with simple release policies is effective for landscape-level pest suppression when the HDR assumptions are violated, but more nuanced release strategies may be required to enhance the benefits to resistance management.},

  abstract     = {Odors emanating from a biologically relevant source are rapidly embedded within a windy, turbuluent medium that folds and spins filaments into fragmented strands of varying sizes. Environmental odor plumes therefore exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics, and rarely yield an easily discernible concentration gradient marking an unambiguous trail to an odor source. Thus, sensory integration of chemical input, encoding odor identity or concentration, and mechanosensory input, encoding wind speed, is a critical task that animals face in resolving the complex dynamics of odor plumes and tracking an odor source. In insects, who employ olfactory navigation as their primary means of foraging for food and finding mates, the antennal lobe (AL) is the first brain structure that processes sensory odor information. Although the importance of chemosensory and mechanosensory integration is widely recognized, the AL itself has traditionally been viewed purely from the perspective of odor encoding, with little attention given to its role as a bimodal integrator. In this work, we seek to explore the AL as a model for studying sensory integration – it boasts well-understood architecture, well-studied olfactory responses, and easily measurable cells. Using a moth model, we present experimental data that clearly demonstrates that AL neurons respond, in dynamically distinct ways, to both chemosensory and mechanosensory input; mechanosensory responses are transient and temporally precise, while olfactory responses are long-lasting but lack temporal precision. We further develop a computational model of the AL, show that our model captures odor response dynamics reported in the literature, and examine the dynamics of our model with the inclusion of mechanosensory input; we then use our model to pinpoint dynamical mechanisms underlying the bimodal AL responses revealed in our experimental work. Finally, we propose a novel hypothesis about the role of mechanosensory input in sculpting AL dynamics and the implications for biological odor tracking.},

  abstract     = {A major challenge in understanding spike-time dependent information encoding in the neural system is the non-linear firing response to inputs of the individual neurons. Hence, quantitative exploration of the putative mechanisms of this non-linear behavior is fundamental to formulating the theory of information transfer in the neural system. The objective of this simulation study was to evaluate and quantify the effect of slowly activating outward membrane current, on the non-linearity in the output of a one-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley styled neuron. To evaluate this effect, the peak conductance of the slow potassium channel ( g K-slow ) was varied from 0\% to 200\% of its normal value in steps of 33\%. Both cross- and iso -frequency coupling between the input and the output of the simulated neuron was computed using a generalized coherence measure, i.e., n:m coherence. With increasing g K-slow , the amount of sub-harmonic cross-frequency coupling, where the output frequencies (1–8 Hz) are lower than the input frequencies (15–35 Hz), increased progressively whereas no change in iso -frequency coupling was observed. Power spectral and phase-space analysis of the neuronal membrane voltage vs. slow potassium channel activation variable showed that the interaction of the slow channel dynamics with the fast membrane voltage dynamics generates the observed sub-harmonic coupling. This study provides quantitative insights into the role of an important membrane mechanism i.e. the slowly activating outward current in generating non-linearities in the output of a neuron.},

The mechanisms underlying HIV multiple infection and their relative contributions are not fully understood. In this paper, we develop and analyze a mathematical model that includes sequential cell-free virus infection (i.e. one virus is transmitted each time in a sequential infection of target cells by virus) and cell-to-cell transmission (i.e. multiple viral genomes are transmitted simultaneously from infected to uninfected cells). By comparing model prediction with the distribution data of proviral genomes in HIV-infected spleen cells, we find that multiple infection can be well explained when the two modes of viral transmission are both included. Numerical simulation using the parameter estimates from data fitting shows that the majority of T cell infections are attributed to cell-to-cell transmission and this transmission mode also accounts for more than half of cell’s multiple infections. These results suggest that cell-to-cell transmission plays a critical role in forming HIV multiple infection and thus has important implications for HIV evolution and pathogenesis.},

The model, building on the one by Rutter and Kuang, includes different types of immune cells and interactions and is parameterized on available data. Our results show that the vaccine has only a very limited effect on PCa, while repeated treatments with ipilimumab appear potentially capable of controlling and even eradicating an androgen-independent prostate cancer. From a mathematical analysis of a simplified model, it seems likely that, under continuous administration of ipilimumab , the system lies in a bistable situation where both the no-tumor equilibrium and the high-tumor equilibrium are attractive. The schedule of periodic treatments could then determine the outcome, and mathematical models could help determine an optimal schedule.},

  abstract     = {While resistance mutations are often implicated in the failure of cancer therapy, lack of response also occurs without such mutants. In bladder cancer mouse xenografts, repeated chemotherapy cycles have resulted in cancer stem cell (CSC) enrichment, and consequent loss of therapy response due to the reduced susceptibility of CSCs to drugs. A particular feedback loop present in the xenografts has been shown to promote CSC enrichment in this system. Yet, many other regulatory loops might also be operational and might promote CSC enrichment. Their identification is central to improving therapy response. Here, we perform a comprehensive mathematical analysis to define what types of regulatory feedback loops can and cannot contribute to CSC enrichment, providing guidance to the experimental identification of feedback molecules. We derive a formula that reveals whether or not the cell population experiences CSC enrichment over time, based on the properties of the feedback. We find that negative feedback on the CSC division rate or positive feedback on differentiated cell death rate can lead to CSC enrichment. Further, the feedback mediators that achieve CSC enrichment can be secreted by either CSCs or by more differentiated cells. The extent of enrichment is determined by the CSC death rate, the CSC self-renewal probability, and by feedback strength. Defining these general characteristics of feedback loops can guide the experimental screening for and identification of feedback mediators that can promote CSC enrichment in bladder cancer and potentially other tumors. This can help understand and overcome the phenomenon of CSC-based therapy resistance.},

  abstract     = {Alternate bearing, seen in many types of plants, is the variable yield with a strongly biennial pattern. In this paper, we introduce a new model for alternate bearing behavior. Similar to the well-known Resource Budget Model, our model is based on the balance between photosynthesis or other limiting resource accumulation and reproduction processes. We consider two novel features with our model, 1) the existence of a finite capacity in the tree’s resource reservoir and 2) the possibility of having low (but non-zero) yield when the tree’s resource level is low. We achieve the former using a density dependent resource accumulation function, and the latter by removing the concept of the well-defined threshold used in the Resource Budget Model. At the level of an individual tree, our model has a stable two-cycle solution, which is suitable to model plants in which the alternate bearing behavior is pronounced. We incorporate environmental stochasticity by adding two uncorrelated noise terms to the parameters of the model associated with the nutrient accumulation and reproduction processes. Furthermore, we examine the model’s behavior on a system of two coupled trees with direct coupling. Unlike the coupled Resource Budget Model, for which the only stable solution is the out-of-phase solution, our model with direct coupling has stable in-phase period-2 solutions. This suggests that our model might serve to explain spatial synchrony on a larger scale.},

  abstract     = {Sleep loss causes decrements in cognitive performance, which increases risks to those in safety-sensitive fields, including medicine and aviation. Mathematical models can be formulated to predict performance decrement in response to sleep loss, with the goal of identifying when an individual may be at highest risk for an accident. This work produces an Ensemble Mixed Effects Model that combines a traditional Linear Mixed Effects (LME) model with a semi-parametric, nonlinear model called Mixed Effects Random Forest (MERF). Using this model, we predict performance on the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), a test of sustained attention, using biologically motivated features extracted from a dataset containing demographic, sleep, and cognitive test data from 44 healthy participants studied during inpatient sleep loss laboratory experiments. Our Ensemble Mixed Effects Model accurately predicts an individual’s trend in PVT performance, and fits the data better than prior published models. The ensemble successfully combines MERF’s high rate of peak identification with LME’s conservative predictions. We investigate two questions relevant to this model’s potential use in operational settings: the tradeoff between additional model features versus ease of collecting these features in real-world settings, and how recent a cognitive task must have been administered to produce strong predictions. This work addresses limitations of previous approaches by developing a predictive model that accounts for interindividual differences and utilizes a nonlinear, semi-parametric method called MERF. We methodologically address the modeling decisions required for this prediction problem, including the choice of cross-validation method. This work is novel in its use of data from a highly-controlled inpatient study protocol that uncouples the influence of the sleep-wake cycle from the endogenous circadian rhythm on the cognitive task being modeled. This uncoupling provides a clearer picture of the model’s real-world predictive ability for situations in which people work at different circadian times (e.g., night- or shift-work).},

Any network describing metabolites or signals with arbitrary many factors can be reduced to a single or a simpler system of integro-differential equations called “effective equation” including the reduced integral kernel (called “effective kernel”) in the convolution type. As one typical example, the Mexican hat shaped kernel is theoretically derived from two component activator-inhibitor systems. It is also shown that a three component system with quite different appearance from activator-inhibitor systems is reduced to an effective equation with the Mexican hat shaped kernel. It means that the two different systems have essentially the same effective equations and that they exhibit essentially the same spatial and temporal patterns. Thus, we can identify two different systems with the understanding in unified concept through the reduced effective kernels. Other two applications of this method are also given: Applications to pigment patterns on skins (two factors network with long range interaction) and waves of differentiation (called proneural waves) in visual systems on brains (four factors network with long range interaction). In the applications, we observe the reproduction of the same spatial and temporal patterns as those appearing in pre-existing models through the numerical simulations of the effective equations.},

  abstract     = {The biological interactions underpinning the Arabidopsis circadian clock have been systematically uncovered and explored by biological experiments and mathematical models. This is captured by a series of published ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, which describe plant clock dynamics in response to light/dark conditions. However, understanding the role of temperature in resetting the clock (entrainment) and the mechanisms by which circadian rhythms maintain a near-24 h period over a range of temperatures (temperature compensation) is still unclear. Understanding entrainment and temperature compensation may elucidate the principles governing the structure of the circadian clock network. Here we explore the design principles of the Arabidopsis clock and its responses to changes in temperature. We analyse published clock models of Arabidopsis , spanning a range of complexity, and incorporate temperature-dependent dynamics into the parameters of translation rates in these models, to discern which regulatory patterns may best explain clock function and temperature compensation. We additionally construct three minimal clock models and explore what key features govern their rhythmicity and temperature robustness via a series of random parameterisations. Results show that the highly repressive interactions between the components of the plant clock, together with autoregulation patterns and three-node feedback loops, are associated with circadian function of the clock in general, and enhance its robustness to temperature variation in particular. However, because the networks governing clock function vary with time due to light and temperature conditions, we emphasise the importance of studying plant clock functionality in its entirety rather than as a set of discrete regulation patterns.},

Cancer cells vary in their response to radiation, and although many factors are involved, the tumor microenvironment is a crucial one that determines radiation efficacy. The tumor microenvironment plays a significant role in cancer initiation and propagation, as well as in treatment outcome. We have developed stochastic formulations to study the impact of arbitrary microenvironmental fluctuations on TCP and extinction probability (EP), which is defined as the probability of cancer cells removal in the absence of treatment. Since the derivation of analytical solutions are not possible for complicated cases, we employ a modified Gillespie algorithm to analyze TCP and EP, considering the random variations in cellular proliferation and death rates. Our results show that increasing the standard deviation in kinetic rates initially enhances the probability of tumor eradication. However, if the EP does not reach a probability of 1, the increase in the standard deviation subsequently has a negative impact on probability of cancer cells removal, decreasing the EP over time. The greatest effect on EP has been observed when both birth and death rates are being randomly modified and are anticorrelated. In addition, similar results are observed for TCP, where radiotherapy is included, indicating that increasing the standard deviation in kinetic rates at first enhances the probability of tumor eradication. But, it has a negative impact on treatment effectiveness if the TCP does not reach a probability of 1.},

  abstract     = {Chimeric simian and human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) are appropriate animal models for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because HIV has quite a narrow host range. Additionally, SHIVs that encode the HIV-1 Env protein and are infectious to macaques have many strains that show different pathogenesis, such as the highly pathogenic SHIV-KS661 and the less pathogenic SHIV-#64. Therefore, we used SHIVs to understand different aspects of AIDS pathogenesis. In a previous study, we established a mathematical model of in vivo early SHIV infection dynamics, which revealed the expected uninfected and infected dynamics in Rhesus macaques. In concrete, the number of uninfected CD4 + T cells in SHIV-KS661-infected Rhesus macaques decreased more significantly and rapidly than that of SHIV-#64 Rhesus macaques, and these Rhesus macaques did not any induce host immune response. In contrast, the number of uninfected CD4 + T cells in SHIV-#64-infected Rhesus macaques is maintained, and host immune response developed. Although we considered that the peak viral load might determine whether systemic CD4 + T cell depletion occurs or host immune responses develop, we could not investigate this because our model quantified only SHIV infection prior to the development of the pathogenicity or host immune responses. Therefore, we developed a new mathematical model to investigate why SHIV-#64 and SHIV-KS661 showed different long-term viral dynamics. We fitted our new model considering antibody responses to our experimental datasets that included antibody titers, CD4 + T cells, and viral load data. We performed a maximum likelihood estimation using a non-linear mixed effect model. From the results, we derived the basic reproduction numbers of SHIV-#64 and SHIV-KS661 from intravenous infection (IV) and SHIV-KS661 from intrarectal infection (IR), as well as the antiviral effects of antibodies against SHIV-#64(IV) and SHIV-KS661(IR). We found significant differences between the basic reproduction number of SHIV-#64(IV) or -KS661(IR) and that of SHIV-KS661(IV). We found no clear difference between the antiviral effects of SHIV-#64(IV) and SHIV-KS661(IR), and revealed that an antiviral effect more than 90\% of that of maximum antibody responses was induced from initial antibody responses (i.e., antibody response just after its inducement). In conclusion, we found that the basic reproduction number, rather than SHIV strains determines whether systemic CD4 + T cell depletion develops, and the subsequent antibody responses occurs.},

The social system is widely represented either by the replicator dynamics or by the best-response dynamics. We investigate the consequences of choosing one or the other with the example of a social-ecological model for eutrophication in shallow lakes, where the anthropogenic discharge of pollutants into the water is determined by a behavioural model using the replicator or a best-response dynamics. We discuss a fundamental difference between the replicator dynamics and the logit formulation of the best-response dynamics. This fundamental difference results in a different number of equilibria. We show that the replicator equation is a limit case of the best-response model, when agents are assumed to behave with infinite rationality. If agents act less rationally in the model using the best-response dynamics, the correspondence with the model using the replicator dynamics decreases. Finally, we show that sustained oscillations observed in both cases may differ substantially. The replicator dynamics makes the amplitude of the limit cycle become larger and makes the system come closer to full cooperation or full defection. Thus, the dynamics along the limit cycle imply a different risk for the system to be pushed by a perturbation into a desirable or an undesirable outcome depending on the socioeconomic dynamics assumed in the model. When analyzing social-ecological models, the choice of a socioeconomic dynamics is often little justified but our results show that it may have dramatic impacts on the coupled human-environment system.},

Various probabilistic measures are defined and analytically studied to describe extreme values and the number of vaccinations during an outbreak, and a random version of the basic reproduction number is used to measure the transmission potential during the initial phase of the epidemic.

  abstract     = {Strains and sprains of soft tissues, including tendons and ligaments, are frequently occurring injuries. Musculoskeletal models show great promise in prediction and prevention of these injuries. However, these models rarely account for the viscoelastic properties of ligaments and tendons, much less their failure properties. The purpose of this project was to develop, simplify, and analyze a collagen-distribution model to address these limitations. A distribution-moment approximation was applied to an existing partial differential equation model to reduce its computational complexity. The resulting model was equipped with a Voigt model in series, which endowed it with viscoelastic properties in addition to failure properties. The model was able to reproduce the characteristic toe, linear, and failure regions ubiquitous throughout in-vitro tests on tissue specimens. In addition, it was able to reproduce a tri-phasic creep test consisting of an initial deformation, a steady-state, and failure. Stress-relaxation and hysteresis were also reproducible by the model. The ability to reproduce so many characteristics of biological tissues suggests more bio-fidelity was achieved by the reduced model was other currently available models. Future work to further improve its bio-fidelity is proposed for specific tendons and ligaments.},

  abstract     = {The surface shape is an important aspect to take into account to ensure the success of an implant. At the cellular scale level, the cell behaviour, especially its migration, is affected by the specificities of the surface of the substrate, such as the stiffness of the surface and its roughness topography. The latter has been shown to have a great impact on various cell mechanisms, such as the cell adhesion , migration, or proliferation. In fact, the mere presence of micro roughness leads to an improvement of those mechanisms, with a better integration of the implants. However, the phenomena behind those improvements are still not clear. In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional (3D) model of a single cell migration using a Cellular Potts (CP) model to study the influence of the surface topography on cell motility. To do so, various configurations were tested, such as: (i) a substrate with a random roughness, (ii) a substrate with a rectangular groove pattern (parallel and perpendicular to the direction of motion), (ii) a substrate with a sinusoidal groove pattern. To evaluate the influence of the surface topography on cell motility, for each configuration, the cell speed and shape as well as the contact surface between the cell and the substrate have been quantified. Our numerical results demonstrate that, in agreement with the experimental observations of the literature, the substrate topography has an influence on the cell efficiency (i.e. cell speed), orientation and shape. Besides, we also show that the increase of the contact surface alone in presence of roughness is not enough to explain the improvement of cell migration on the various rough surfaces. Finally, we highlight the importance of the roughness dimension on cell motility. This could be a critical aspect to consider for further analyses and applications, such as surface treatments for medical applications.},

  abstract     = {Shared resource extraction among profit-seeking individuals involves a tension between individual benefit and the collective well-being represented by the persistence of the resource. Many game theoretic models explore this scenario, but these models tend to assume either best response dynamics (where individuals instantly switch to better paying strategies) or imitation dynamics (where individuals copy successful strategies from neighbours), and do not systematically compare predictions under the two assumptions. Here we propose an iterated game on a social network with payoff functions that depend on the state of the resource. Agents harvest the resource, and the strategy composition of the population evolves until an equilibrium is reached. The system is then repeatedly perturbed and allowed to re-equilibrate. We compare model predictions under best response and imitation dynamics. Compared to imitation dynamics, best response dynamics increase sustainability of the system, the persistence of cooperation while decreasing inequality and debt corresponding to the Gini index in the agents’ cumulative payoffs. Additionally, for best response dynamics, the number of strategy switches before equilibrium fits a power-law distribution under a subset of the parameter space, suggesting the system is in a state of self-organized criticality. We find little variation in most mean results over different network topologies; however, there is significant variation in the distributions of the raw data, equality of payoff, clustering of like strategies and power-law fit. We suggest the primary mechanisms driving the difference in sustainability between the two strategy update rules to be the clustering of like strategies as well as the time delay imposed by an imitation processes. Given the strikingly different outcomes for best response versus imitation dynamics for common-pool resource systems, our results suggest that modellers should choose strategy update rules that best represent decision-making in their study systems.},

  abstract     = {A deeper understanding of the processes underlying the distribution of animals in space is crucial for both basic and applied ecology. The Common buzzard (Buteo buteo) is a highly aggressive, territorial bird of prey that interacts strongly with its intra- and interspecific competitors. We propose and use random matrix theory to quantify the strength and range of repulsion as a function of the buzzard population density, thus providing a novel approach to model density dependence. As an indicator of territorial behaviour, we perform a large-scale analysis of the distribution of buzzard nests in an area of 300 square kilometres around the Teutoburger Wald, Germany, as gathered over a period of 20 years. The nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour spacing distribution between nests is compared to the two-dimensional Poisson distribution, originating from uncorrelated random variables, to the complex eigenvalues of random matrices, which are strongly correlated, and to a two-dimensional Coulomb gas interpolating between these two. A one-parameter fit to a time-moving average reveals a significant increase of repulsion between neighbouring nests, as a function of the observed increase in absolute population density over the monitored period of time, thereby proving an unexpected yet simple model for density-dependent spacing of predator territories. A similar effect is obtained for next-to-nearest neighbours, albeit with weaker repulsion, indicating a short-range interaction. Our results show that random matrix theory might be useful in the context of population ecology.},

  abstract     = {Adult neurogenesis – the generation of neurons during adulthood – is intensively studied, yet little is known about its consequences at the tissue level. In the teleost fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus , morphometric analysis has revealed that the total number of cells in the spinal cord increases continuously throughout adulthood, driven by the activity of neurogenic stem/progenitor cells in both the ependymal layer at the central canal and in the radially located parenchyma. This net increase in cell numbers demonstrates cellular addition, as opposed to cellular turnover which appears to be the common outcome of adult neurogenesis in mammals. Grounded on a comprehensive set of quantitative data generated through high-resolution mapping of stem cells and their progeny, we constructed a cellular automata model of the stem-cell-driven growth of the spinal cord. Simulations based on this model suggest that three cellular mechanisms play a critical role for promoting sustained tissue growth and acquisition of correct form of the spinal cord, including the development of the ependymal layer and the parenchyma: the number of symmetric stem-cell divisions versus asymmetric divisions; the probability of the progeny of progenitor cells to undergo cell death; and the radial drifting of cells.},

We build a mathematical model to study the optimal floral display to attract pollinators in a patch with kin structure. We show that when plants can attract pollinators to a whole patch through the magnet effect, the floral display should increase with the increasing relatedness of the plants in the patch. Our model also indicates that increasing investment into attracting pollinators is a form of altruism, reducing a plant’s own seed production but increasing the contribution of other plants to its fitness. We also predict that seed production should increase with increasing relatedness in the patch. Our model provides the explicit conditions when resource allocation to attract pollinators in response to neighbour relatedness can be favoured by kin selection, and a possible mechanism for the plants to deal with the consequent loss of pollinator diversity and abundance.},

Third, extant individuals can be sampled and included in the reconstructed phylogenetic tree with a fixed probability. We further consider that sampled individuals can be removed or not from the process, upon sampling, with fixed probability. We derive the probability distribution of the population size at any time in the past conditional on the joint observation of a reconstructed phylogenetic tree and a record of occurrences not included in the tree. We also provide an algorithm to simulate ancestral population size trajectories given the observation of a reconstructed phylogenetic tree and occurrences. This distribution can be readily used to draw inferences about the ancestral population size in the field of epidemiology and macroevolution. In epidemiology, these results will allow data from epidemiological case count studies to be used in conjunction with molecular sequencing data (yielding reconstructed phylogenetic trees) to coherently estimate prevalence through time. In macroevolution, it will foster the joint examination of the fossil record and extant taxa to reconstruct past biodiversity.},

  abstract     = {Human respiratory disease associated with influenza virus infection is of significant public health concern. Macrophages, as part of the front line of host innate cellular defence, have been shown to play an important role in controlling viral replication. However, fatal outcomes of infection, as evidenced in patients infected with highly pathogenic viral strains, are often associated with prompt activation and excessive accumulation of macrophages. Activated macrophages can produce a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which leads to severe symptoms and at times death. However, the mechanism for rapid activation and excessive accumulation of macrophages during infection remains unclear. It has been suggested that the phenomena may arise from complex interactions between macrophages and influenza virus. In this work, we develop a novel mathematical model to study the relationship between the level of macrophage activation and the level of viral load in influenza infection. Our model combines a dynamic model of viral infection, a dynamic model of macrophages and the essential interactions between the virus and macrophages. Our model predicts that the level of macrophage activation can be negatively correlated with the level of viral load when viral infectivity is sufficiently high. We further identify that temporary depletion of resting macrophages in response to viral infection is a major driver in our model for the negative relationship between the level of macrophage activation and viral load, providing new insight into the mechanisms that regulate macrophage activation. Our model serves as a framework to study the complex dynamics of virus-macrophage interactions and provides a mechanistic explanation for existing experimental observations, contributing to an enhanced understanding of the role of macrophages in influenza viral infection.},

  abstract     = {The kidneys play an important role in glucose homeostasis in three ways: Via endogenous glucose production from non-carbohydrate precursors (e.g. glutamine, lactate, alanine, glycerol) during both postprandial and post-absorptive states; via glucose filtration and reabsorption by the glomerulus and proximal tubule, respectively; and via glucose utilization and the elimination of its excess in the urine when glucose levels exceed 180 mg / dl 180mg/dl . The renal release of glucose into the circulation occurs mainly in the renal cortex and results from the glucose phosphorylating capacity of those renal cells, meaning that, cells in the renal cortex can form glucose-6-phosphate. Considering glucose filtration and reabsorption, the kidneys filtrate and reabsorb all circulating glucose, rendering the urine virtually glucose-free in a healthy person. Finally, the kidneys take up glucose from the circulation for energetic self-supply. Besides their role in glucose metabolism, the kidneys are the major site of insulin clearance from the systemic circulation, removing approximately 50\% of peripheral insulin. In this regard, insulin clearance by kidneys occurs by degradation in the proximal tubule after being filtered in the glomerulus. All the aforementioned mechanisms affect the glucose concentration levels in the blood, preventing the parametrization of a mathematical model for patients with diabetes mellitus, in the implementation of an artificial pancreas. Aiming for a complete physiological model of the glucose homeostasis, a physiological submodel of the kidneys is presented in a way not described in the literature so far. This submodel is a phenomenological-based semi-physical model with a basic structure rooted in the conservation law and for which the parameters are interpretable. The model’s results coincide well with the available clinical data reported for kidney functions associated with glucose and insulin.},

We constructed a simple model of life history with the following assumptions: the body size of immature individuals increases following a logistic equation. A higher quality and availability of food plants make the initial growth rate faster and the final saturating size larger. The increase in body size stops once reproduction starts. Fertility increases with adult body size and food-plant quality. Mortality due to predation is mitigated by a larger body size. We calculated the optimal body size at maturity that would maximize the lifetime reproductive success or fitness. The analysis showed that adult body size increased with food-plant quality and availability but decreased with higher mortality due to predators and other factors. This conclusion is consistent with geological studies that suggest a high quality and availability of food plants in the Mesozoic era, efficient air-sac breathing, and the lightweight bones of sauropod dinosaurs, allowing rapid growth of small individuals.},

The first step of the mechanism precedes the second step of the mechanism because the Fibonacci-rule pattern is due to the first step, while the second step distinguishes normal, anomalous and unobserved types.

Our analysis shows that the addition of the PafBC-mediated response sensitizes the overall DNA damage response, effectively lowering the DNA damage rate threshold for activation.},

  abstract     = {A theoretical model of the pyloric channel, approximated as a two-dimensional tube with sinusoidal corrugation, is developed to estimate the degree of resistance offered by the pylorus to transpyloric flow (gastric emptying and duodenogastric reflux) in the viscous regime. Study indicates that the resistance of the channel depends on pressure gradient, flow behavior index and channel diameter. Flow is majorly determined by the extent of luminal opening; since they scale to fourth power of the diameter for Newtonian flow, with the exponent being higher for pseudoplastic and lesser in case of dilatants relative to Newtonian fluid. At zero pressure difference, across the channel, the closing pylorus drives the aborad propulsion of the contents at the intestinal end, and at the gastric end the flow is driven along the orad direction. While no transfer of contents occur at the centre of pylorus due to zero pressure gradients, it is essential to have a non-zero pressure difference to drive the flow through the channel. The extent of pressure difference is found to linearly relate to the transpyloric flow rate. The resistive function of the pyloric channel is observed at a higher occlusion where there is a development of higher pressure barrier that is sensitive to the flow behavior index, frequency, occlusion, and contraction length.},

  abstract     = {As a complement to the experimental work, mathematical models are extensively used to study the functional properties of ionic channels. Even though it is generally assumed that the gating of ionic channels is a Markovian phenomenon, reports based on non-traditional analyses of experimental recordings suggest that non-Markovian processes might be also present. While the stochastic Markov models are by far the most adopted approach for the modeling of ionic channels, a model based on the idea of a deterministic process underlying the gating of ionic channels was proposed by Liebovitch and Toth (Liebovitch, L.S. and Toth, T.I., 1991. Journal of Theoretical Biology, 148(2), pp.243–267.) Here, by using a voltage-dependent K + channel as a first approximation, we propose a modified version of the deterministic model of Liebovitch and Toth that, in addition to reproducing the single-channel currents simulated by a two-states Markov model, it is capable of reproducing the whole-cell currents produced by a population of K + + channels.},

  abstract     = {Tuberculosis (TB) is still an important public health issue in Jiangsu province, China. In this study, based on the TB transmission routes and the statistical data of TB cases, we formulate a novel TB epidemic model accounting for the effects of the contaminated environments on TB transmission dynamics. The value of this study lies in two aspects. Mathematically, we define the basic reproduction number, R 0 R0 , and prove that R 0 R0 can be used to govern the threshold dynamics of the model. Epidemiologically, we find that the annual average R 0 R0 is 1.13 , &gt; 1 1.13,&amp;gt;1 and TB in Jiangsu is an endemic disease. Therefore, in order to control the TB in Jiangsu efficiently, we must decrease the virus shedding rate or increase the recovery rates, and increase the environmental clearance rate.},

  abstract     = {Flying animals morph and flex their wings during their flight. Their wings morph with the turbulent flow created around them. The wings of modern airplanes do not have this ability. In this study we show that the ability to flex the wings leads to greater stability (higher flutter speed), and that this is due to the more uniform distribution of stresses in the flexing wing. This way the flexing wing becomes the lightest per unit of flapping force, or the strongest per unit of weight.},
