  abstract     = {Cryptocurrency price forecasting plays an important role in financial markets. Traditional approaches face two challenges: (1) it is difficult to ascertain the influential factors related to price forecasting; and (2) due to the 24/7 trading policy, cryptocurrencies’ prices face very large fluctuations, thus weakening the forecasting power of traditional models. To address these issues, we focus on Bitcoin and identify the influential factors related to its price forecasting from the perspective of underlying blockchain transactions. We then propose a price forecasting model WT-CATCN, which leverages Wavelet Transform (WT) and Casual Multi-Head Attention (CA) Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), to forecast cryptocurrency prices. Our model can capture important positions of input sequences and model the correlations among different data features. Using real-world Bitcoin trading data, we test and compare WT-CATCN with other state-of-the-art price forecasting models. The experiment results show that our model improves the price forecasting performance by 25%.},

  abstract     = {With the widespread use of online social media, we have witnessed that fake news causes enormous distress and inconvenience to people&#39;s social life. Although previous studies have proposed rich machine learning methods for identifying fake news in social media, the task of detecting fake news in emerging news events/domains remains a challenging problem due to the wide range of news topics on social media as well as the evolution and variation of fake news contents in the web. In this study, we propose an approach which we term “domain-adversarial and graph-attention neural network” (DAGA-NN) model to address the challenge. Its main advantage is that, in a text environment with multiple events/domains, only partial domain sample data are needed to train the model to achieve accurate cross-domain fake news detection in those domains with few (or even no) samples, which makes up for the limitations of traditional machine learning in fake news detection tasks due to news content evolution or cross-domain identification (where there is no sample data). Extensive experiments were conducted on two multimedia datasets of Twitter and Weibo, and the results showed that the proposed model was very effective in detecting fake news across events/domains.},

  abstract     = {Decision-intensive business processes are performed by decision makers who gather different pieces of information to reach the process objective: a final decision of high quality, for instance, the final price of a quote or the diagnosis of a failure of a hightech machine, as a result of an information-gathering process with minimum costs and efforts. Gathering all possible pieces of information results in high quality decisions, but also yields high costs and efforts. Therefore, decision makers require decision support to determine which information to gather to make the best final decision. This paper introduces an approach that supports a decision maker in the continuous trade-off between the effective acquisition of more information and cost-efficient decision making . The approach uses a well-defined modeling notation for decision-intensive processes, CMMN , and links it to a standard optimization technique, Markov Decision Processes . The approach calculates an optimal information-gathering solution, such that the expected result of the main decision minus the process cost for collecting information is optimized. The approach uses the solution to configure a run-time recommendation tool for the decision maker. The approach is flexible and allows that a decision maker ignores the advice; it then continues to offer recommendations in the subsequent states . We show the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach on a real-world quote process.},

The best performing model was the proposed hybrid Genetic Algorithms ( GA ) and Support Vector Machines ( SVM ). The proposed methodology was internally validated via k-fold cross validation , and then externally validated using several separate datasets. The (GA) selected variables were ranked from the most important to the least through Information fusion ( IF ) sensitivity.

We test our core proposition and theory-driven research model using data collected from a sample of leading Chinese agribusinesses . We find that coercive and mimetic pressure play pivotal roles in motivating organizations to use social media. We also discover that social media usage improves marketing performance and that the agribusiness market uncertainty plays a positive reinforcing role in the positive effect of social media usage on marketing performance.

We determine how the platform vendor&#39;s promotional pricing strategies vary with the market expansion effect, proportion of the price-sensitive consumers, redemption cost, commission rate charged to the third-party seller, and third-party seller&#39;s choice of the promotional campaign. We find that the platform vendor will charge a higher regular price during the promotional period if the market expansion effect is weak or the commission rate is low. Further, although the market expansion effect expands the scale of the price-sensitive consumers, the promotional campaign does not always lead to an increase in the demand for the first-party product when the market expansion effect is weak, or the market expansion effect is moderate and the commission rate is high. When the third-party seller&#39;s promotional decision is given, the platform&#39;s promotional campaign is more likely to benefit both the platform and the third-party seller as the redemption cost becomes lower or the market expansion effect gets stronger. Finally, after endogenizing the third-party seller&#39;s promotional decision, as the market expansion effect intensifies, the outcome that only one player (the platform or the third-party seller) adopts the promotional strategy is more likely to occur as an equilibrium.},

Since the interests of both parties might not be aligned, we propose a proper scoring rule to elicit the expert&#39;s forecast that is tailored to the decision problem the newsvendor faces. Under the proposed scoring rule, both the newsvendor&#39;s expected profit and the expert&#39;s expected payment increase as the expert exerts a higher effort when gathering information to formulate a forecast. Trust issues arise in this setting because the ex post payment the expert receives is contingent on the accuracy of the reported forecast, which in turn depends on a future realized outcome that might be only available to the newsvendor. We show that coding the proposed proper scoring rule as a blockchain-based smart contract allows the newsvendor to signal trustworthiness while, at the same time, inducing the expert to devote more effort in information gathering. Following the design science research framework, we conclude the paper by suggesting a design and a fully functional prototype of a blockchain-based smart contract that implements the proposed tailored proper scoring rule.},

State-of-the-art research has mainly focused on the scenario in which auxiliary domains share users or items with a target domain. However, such auxiliary data is rare or the acquisition of them is limited due to privacy concerns in real-world applications. We investigate a more realistic scenario in which auxiliary domains have neither users nor items overlapped with a target domain, thereby facilitating the collection of auxiliary data. In order to extract and transfer the sharing knowledge between auxiliary domains and target domain, we assume the user-item feedback in each domain consist of two parts: domain-transferrable information containing the shared knowledge and domain-reserved information reflecting the domain-specific characteristics. Correspondingly, we propose a mixed heterogeneous factorization model to capture the sharing knowledge and the domain-specific characteristics based on adapted tensor factorization and biased matrix factorization respectively and then combine them together in an accumulative way. Meanwhile, three types of domain heterogeneity including preference heterogeneity, characteristics heterogeneity and rating bias are taken into account in this model. Experimenting on four publicly available datasets across different domains, we show that our model is superior to state-of-the-art methods in rating prediction and top- N recommendation tasks.},

  abstract     = {Missing input values weaken the ability of information systems (IS) researchers to make calculations, thereby reducing effective sample sizes and statistical power. Such technical problems with data cascade into scientific limitations resulting in the neglect of social and economic issues. Therefore, extensive missing values in data forces researchers to make crucial decisions, such as whether to impute and if so, what strategy to use. This study presents a single imputation approach that integrates and extends best practices for mitigating the effects of missing values. Using an array of missing value situations, we illustrate the Regression Imputation Optimizing Sample Size and Emulation (RIOSSE) method. The approach involves the derivation of an imputation model for each low-sample variable that leverages information available in large-sample sized inputs within the same data source . RIOSSE derives imputation equations with two competing goals in mind: 1) statistical power and 2) emulation. Direct comparisons demonstrate that RIOSSE is superior to three prominent multiple imputation methods (K-Nearest Neighbor, missForest, and LASSO) in two criteria each for achieving statistical power (parsimoniousness and sample size) and emulation (predictiveness and content validity). Further, 5-fold cross validation validated the head-to-head goal criteria comparisons. The paper contributes 1) a description of the RIOSSE method, 2) new imputation performance metrics and visualizations, 3) comparisons of our proposed method to three prominent multiple imputation methods, and 4) specified imputation models for 30 commonly used inputs to firm performance calculations.},

Spot instances have cost advantages, albeit at a trade-off of interruptions that can occur when the user&#39;s bid price falls below the spot price. The interruptions are often exacerbated since customers often require resources in bundles. For these reasons, customers might have to wait for a long time before their jobs are completed. In this paper, we propose a behavioral-economic model in the form of time-preference-based bids, wherein users are willing to use and bid for services at other times if the vendor cannot provide the resources at the preferred time. Given such bids, we consider the problem of provisioning for such service requests. We develop a time-preference-based optimization model. Since the optimization model is NP-Hard, we develop rule-based genetic algorithms . We have obtained very encouraging results with respect to standard commercial solver as a benchmark. In turn, our results provide evidence for the viability of our approach for online service-provisioning problems.},

Uplift models predict how much a marketing action will change customers&#39; behavior, known as the individual treatment effect (ITE). Marketers can then solicit customers in decreasing order of their estimated ITE. We argue that the ITE-based targeting policy is not fully consistent with a business value maximization objective. We propose business-centric evaluation metrics that integrate estimates of the ITE and the expected business value and validate their benefits relative to the ITE-based targeting baseline using real-world marketing data. The new metrics yield remarkably higher profit across different uplift models, targeting depths, profit functions, and data sets. They further contribute to the growing field of interpretable data science by uncovering interdependencies between covariates, ITE, and profit and by clarifying whether customers are worth targeting because of high responsiveness or high value.},

  abstract     = {The nature of people&#39;s web navigation has significantly changed in recent years. The advent of smartphones and other handheld devices has given rise to web users consulting websites with more than one device, or using a shared device. As a result, large volumes of seemingly disjoint data are available, which when analysed together can support decision-making. The task of identifying web sessions by linking such data back to a specific person, however, is hard. The idea of session stitching aims to overcome this by using machine learning inference to identify similar or identical users. Many such efforts use various demographic data or device-based features to train matching algorithms . However, often these variables are not available for every dataset or are recorded differently, making a streamlined setup difficult. Besides, they often result in vast feature spaces which are hard to use for actionable interpretation. In this paper, we present an alternative approach based on the fingerprinting of web pages visited by users in a single session. By learning behavioural patterns from these sequences of page visits, we obtain features that can be used for matching without requiring sensitive user-agent data such as IP, geo location, or device details as is common with other approaches. Using these sequential fingerprints does not rely on pre-defined features, but only requires the recording of web page visits, making our approach actionable. The approach is empirically tested on real-life web logs and compared with matching using regular user-agent features and state-of-the-art embedding techniques. Results in an ecommerce context show sequential features can still obtain strong performance with fewer features, facilitating decision-making on session stitching and inform subsequent related activities such as marketing or customer analysis.},

  abstract     = {The use of sophisticated machine learning models for critical decision-making faces the challenge that these models are often applied as a ‘black-box’. This has led to an increased interest in interpretable machine learning , where post-hoc model-agnostic algorithms present a useful mechanism for generating interpretations of complex learning models. This paper proposes a novel approach based on Bayesian Networks to generate local post-hoc model-agnostic interpretations of a black-box predictive model . Consequently, the proposed approach presents features that are conditionally dependent between each other and that are directly influencing the class variable. This enables the decision-maker to better understand how features are related and why a certain prediction was made. Compared to the existing post-hoc interpretation methods, the contribution of our approach is three-fold: (1) as a probabilistic graphical model , the extracted Bayesian network can provide interpretations through conditional dependencies in a graphical structure regarding what input features and how/why they contributed to a prediction; (2) for complex decision problems with many features, a Markov blanket can be generated from the extracted Bayesian network to provide interpretations with a focused view on those input features that directly contributed to a prediction; (3) the extracted Bayesian network enables the identification of four different rules which can inform the decision-maker about the confidence level in a prediction, thus helping the decision-maker assess the reliability of predictions learned by a black-box model. We implemented the proposed approach, applied it in the context of two well-known public datasets and analysed the results, which are made available in an open-source repository: https://github.com/catarina-moreira/LINDA_DSS .},

  abstract     = {Traffic pumping is a type of fraud committed in several countries, in which small telephone operators inflate the number of incoming calls to their networks, profiting from a higher access charge in relation to the network operator associated with the origin of the call. The identification of traffic pumping is complex due to the lack of labels for performing supervised learning, and the scarce literature on the topic. We propose a decision support system for fraud detection via clustering and decision trees . After data collection and feature engineering, we group the potential fraud cases into various clusters via an unsupervised learning approach. Then, we constructed a decision tree by using the cluster memberships as labels, evolving into the rules of a given variable and a certain label required for filing lawsuits against the suspicious cases. Telecommunication experts validate these rules to seek a legal resource against alleged perpetrators. We present the results of a case study from a Chilean telecommunication provider. All the lawsuits taken by the legal department were granted, confirming our success in dramatically reducing current and future fraud losses for the company.},

To illustrate the similar modelling ability of ABRB and BRB, the universal approximation ability of ABRB is proved theoretically. In the proposed ABRB, the key components, such as attributes, referential values, and the frame of discernment, can be extended to guarantee its effectiveness in the long-term practice.

One area that has great potential to leverage the value of big data and analytics is the critical analysis of traffic accidents . Investigation results help in providing an in-depth understanding of the risks and provide measures to potentially prevent these risk factors hence enhancing the well-being of individuals who may experience such accidents. This study explains existing models and proposes a data science methodology in a field where probabilistic modeling makes much sense for faster, better decision-making. The main objective of this data analytics study is to identify the high-risk factors with their apparent significance to influence the probability of injury severity on automobile crashes using a geographically representative car crash dataset. To obtain reliable, accurate, and intuitive results, a multi-step probabilistic inference model based on Bayesian Belief Network— highly-acclaimed machine learning methodology—is proposed. The underlying inference model provides researchers with a causally accurate way to explore the domain (with the subject matter expert inputs) while disengaging issues related to statistical correlations and causal effects. In this study, we also used the data to create a web-based probabilistic inference simulator, a Bayesian inference decision support tool, which will be a publicly available/accessible tool, to help decision-makers better understand and to conduct what-if analysis on variable interdependencies .},

The availability of tools for AutoML makes it possible to quickly create an effective but complex predictive model. However, the complexity of such models is often a major obstacle in applications, especially in terms of high-stake decisions. We are experiencing a growing number of examples where the use of black boxes leads to decisions that are harmful, unfair or simply wrong. In this paper, we show that very often we can simplify complex models without compromising their performance; however, with the benefit of much needed transparency. We propose a framework that uses elastic black boxes as supervisor models to create simpler, less opaque, yet still accurate and interpretable glass box models. The new models were created using newly engineered features extracted with the help of a supervisor model. We supply the analysis using a large-scale benchmark on several tabular data sets from the OpenML database. There are tree main results of this paper: 1) we show that extracting information from complex models may improve the performance of simpler models, 2) we question a common myth that complex predictive models outperform simpler predictive models, 3) we present a real-life application of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {An important business domain that relies heavily on advanced statistical- and machine learning algorithms to support operational decision-making is customer retention management. Customer churn prediction is a crucial tool to support customer retention. It allows an early identification of customers who are at risk to abandon the company and provides the ability to gain insights into why customers are at risk. Hence, customer churn prediction models should complement predictive performance with model insights . Inspired by their ability to reconcile strong predictive performance and interpretability , this study introduces rule ensembles and their extension, spline-rule ensembles, as a promising family of classification algorithms to the customer churn prediction domain. Spline-rule ensembles combine the flexibility of a tree-based ensemble classifier with the simplicity of regression analysis . They do, however, neglect the relatedness between potentially conflicting model components which can introduce unnecessary complexity in the models and compromises model interpretability . To tackle this issue, a novel algorithmic extension, spline-rule ensembles with sparse group lasso regularization (SRE-SGL) is proposed to enhance interpretability through structured regularization . Experiments on fourteen real-world customer churn data sets in different industries (i) demonstrate the superior predictive performance of spline-rule ensembles with sparse group lasso over a set well yet powerful benchmark methods in terms of AUC and top decile lift; (ii) show that spline-rule ensembles with sparse group lasso regularization significantly outperform conventional rule ensembles whilst performing at least as well as conventional spline-rule ensembles; and (iii) illustrate the interpretable nature of a spline-rule ensemble model and the advantage of structured regularization in SRE-SGL by means of a case study on customer churn prediction for a telecommunications company.},

Interpretability is however of utmost importance for the management to have confidence in the model and for designing fraud prevention strategies . Moreover, models that enable the fraud experts to understand the underlying reasons why a case is flagged as suspicious will greatly facilitate their job of investigating the suspicious transactions. Therefore, we propose several data engineering techniques to improve the performance of an analytical model while retaining the interpretability property.

We propose that the creation of the SSB provided a signal to the IS field that conveyed an additional stock of symbolic capital to the journals in the SSB. We theorize that the symbolic capital signal provided by the SSB changed the individual publication behaviors of IS researchers, specifically regarding collaboration and submission concentration. We observe that this behavioral change reduced journal participation inequality and influenced journal quality metrics for journals included and excluded from the SSB. We report a study using 5830 articles from ten journals over sixteen years (2000–2015). Our results suggest that IS scholars responded to the symbolic capital signal of the SSB in a bifurcated manner. Regarding IS research production, the level of collaboration increased at most journals, and a broader group of IS researchers published in those journals. This shift in behavior led to a reduction of inequality regarding institutional and geographic representation in publishing. However, we also report unexpected variation in the journal quality metrics of SSB journals vis-à-vis non-SSB journals that suggest that IS researchers largely ignored the SSB signal from a research consumption standpoint. Finally, we provide several recommendations for the continued evaluation of the SSB by the Senior Scholars and tenure and promotion committees.},

Drawing upon the social cognitive theory , we examine the learning effects on users&#39; knowledge contribution behaviors. Specifically, we focus on two types of learning effects: enactive learning from one&#39;s past contribution experience and vicarious learning from observation of others&#39; performances in a question thread. Using a dataset collected from one of the largest online Q&amp;A communities in China, we find that the length feature of past user contributions that garner highly positive feedback, no matter through enactive or vicarious learning, would influence the informativeness of subsequent contributions in the community. These learning effects are more effective for users with higher social status. The enactive learning effect is stronger for contributors with higher social status. For the vicarious learning on higher-status contributors, the influence of high-vote long answers is stronger, but the high-vote short answers show a weaker effect. Our research provides a deeper understanding of knowledge contribution behaviors in online knowledge communities and guides for establishing a healthy knowledge contribution environment.},

The results show a positive association among customer experience, perceived value, and customer loyalty. Notably, the physical environment and human interaction are equally important in influencing customers&#39; value judgments about their consumption experience. Moreover, perceived value has a stronger positive effect on attitudinal loyalty than on behavioral loyalty. This study adds new insights into the customer experience-perceived value-customer loyalty path by showing that the physical environment and human interaction have the same importance in affecting perceived value and identifying the subtle difference between attitudinal and behavioral loyalty influenced by perceived value in the accommodation-sharing economy. Furthermore, these findings provide managerial insights for service operations management and marketing strategy planning.},

  abstract     = {The real world contains many complex networks, including research networks, social networks, biological networks, and transport networks. Real-world complex networks are unconstrained and can be characterized as undirected and unweighted. Understanding and controlling the process of information propagation in such networks is significant for decision-making activities and has many uses, such as disease control , market advertising, rumor control, and innovation propagation. Identifying the influencers in complex networks is an important activity, as influencers play a key role in spreading information to aid the decision-making process. In this study, we consider the problem of identifying a set of top- N influential nodes for spreading the information in undirected and unweighted networks using the network structure in the absence of domain-specific knowledge. In this study, we propose a novel method that computes the ranking scores of the nodes in the network and considers the influence of other nodes simultaneously when forming the set of top- N influential nodes. The proposed method is different from other methods of identification of influential nodes in the network, in that it takes into consideration the position of the nodes in the network while computing the ranking score, thereby preventing the clustering of important nodes, which hampers the information flow. Experiments are performed using several real-world complex networks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel framework to support the generation of strategies for multi-criteria long-term improvement. It can be applied to general preference models but it is illustrated in this article on a Multi-Attribute Value Theory model. The novel contributions to the literature are twofold. Firstly, the framework addresses the issue of resistance to change that may arise during the implementation of a strategy. It constrains a step of improvement to be focused on a single criterion, and minimizes the intensity of operational changes. Secondly, it addresses the realism of the improvement scenarios by treating three types of structural dependencies differently: the positive synergies, the negative synergies and the bottlenecks . The scenarios are generated by finding a set of efficient solutions to a shortest path problem in a graph whose edges represent possible steps of improvement. Each edge is characterized by an increase of rank or level and two penalty functions relating to the difficulty of its execution, one representing a risk associated to bottleneck mechanisms and the other to operational change relative to a previous edge. A case-study using the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities is presented in order to illustrate how this framework could be useful to generate a sequence of strategic actions for the Université libre de Bruxelles.},

This paper delves into the different forms of knowledge (data, information, knowledge, wisdom, understanding, experience and learning) that are essential to support HVLFT. If a form of knowledge can be categorised as neither tacit nor explicit, it belongs to the proposed knowledge dimension X. This paper further explores the transformation of different dimensions of knowledge at the disruptive vortex between tacit, explicit, and X. The interactions between these three dimensions of knowledge are validated through a study of knowledge asymmetry among HVLFT stakeholders in the real estate industry of NZ. We conclude with the proposal of a blockchain-based architecture to counterbalance information asymmetry caused by X.},

The objective of this study is to identify and measure whether LBGs&#39; advent has shifted the consumption of other entertainment products and generate insights which can support practitioners with their strategic business decisions. To this end, we analyze the consumption of the most popular entertainment products (i.e., TV, PC-based online games, and cinema) before and after the release of Pokémon Go. Our results extend prior literature and show that the effect of LBGs—as a new type of entertainment product—is not confined to one product category but can affect multiple product categories of the entertainment industry.

However, these approaches overlook the differences in the importance of each sentence to the complete text. To solve this problem, some work has been performed to calculate sentence-level attention, but these studies use the same approach that is applied to word-level attention, which leads to unnecessary sequential structures and increased complexity of sentence representation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a sentence-to-sentence attention network 1 (S2SAN) using multihead self-attention. We conducted several domain-specific, cross-domain and multidomain sentiment analysis experiments with real-world datasets. The experimental results show that S2SAN outperforms other state-of-the-art models. Some classical sentiment classifiers [e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) models] achieve better accuracies when they are reconfigured to include sentence-to-sentence attention.},

This study introduces a new Monte Carlo simulation-based risk interdependency network model to support decision makers in assessing project risks and planning risk treatment actions more effectively. The Interpretive Structural Modeling method is integrated into this model to develop a hierarchical project risk interdependency network based on identified risks and their cause-effect relationships. The Monte Carlo method is used to model the stochastic behavior of risk occurrence and to generate numerous possible risk scenarios through simulation. To evaluate single risks and overall project risk level while considering risk interdependencies, five major risk indicators are therefore proposed, namely simulated occurrence probability of a risk, simulated local and global influence of a risk, as well as total risk loss and total risk propagation loss of a project. An additional sensitivity analysis is also included to examine the effects of input uncertainties of this model on risk assessment results. Moreover, two case studies are provided to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the proposed model. The findings accentuate the significance of considering risk interdependencies in project risk assessment and validate the model&#39;s robustness and feasibility in risk management of projects with complex interrelated risks.},

We pursue our research goals by utilizing a rich dataset from between 2005 and 2017 from an online open collaboration platform. The platform has recently utilized two types of unique bots that interact with human users in open collaboration. By employing difference-in-differences approach, we show that bot intervention in open collaboration leads to unintended consequences as it significantly demotivates user participation. We further show that the negative effect of bot intervention is alleviated if more active users are engaged or if covered topics have a higher concentration in a collaboration work. This provides directions for businesses to resolve the unintended demotivation problem in utilizing bot agents.},

The system relies on efficient solutions of bi-level optimisations, in particular, the online optimisation is shown to be a Bayesian Stackelberg game solution. The proposed solution is shown to be more efficient than both classical solutions like Harsanyi transformation and more recent efficient solvers.

In the digital service market, platforms such as Netflix, Steam, etc. often seek to enter into exclusivity deals with service providers or developers in order to get exclusive access rights to their digital services in the hopes that offering exclusive access to a digital product will entice new consumers to use their platform and thus generate increased profits. In this study we focus on this phenomenon in the mobile gaming market. For example, the game developer Electronic Arts agreed to offer Apple iOS a 4-month exclusive deal for the well-known mobile game Plants vs. Zombies 2 . The benefits of exclusivity deals for both platforms and digital service developers are unclear and have not been studied in the extant literature. We develop an analytical model of digital service profits to examine the optimal conditions of exclusivity for platforms and digital service developers. Our result shows that platforms prefer exclusivity while developers prefer offering their product on multiple platforms. We further explore the strategies that platforms and digital service developers can employ by analyzing three simultaneous and sequential game pricing and release scenarios. We find that higher profits can be generated by whichever party determines the price of a game first. However, we also found that in the presence of a leasing fee, platforms may prefer a simultaneous pricing and release scenario to even a platform-led pricing and release scenario.

The recent popularity in market-based disclosure methods such as bug bounty programs has provided new methods to control ethical hackers and effectively manage the disclosure timelines. Through a systematic literature review, we investigate and identify various vulnerability disclosure mechanisms and elaborate the disclosure process of each mechanism. We synthesize and compare the antecedents and consequences of the vulnerability disclosure under market- and non-market-based disclosure mechanisms by proposing two research frameworks. Our analysis suggests that incentivizing hackers in market mechanisms change hackers&#39; motivations, leading to behavioral changes and eventually giving firms more control over the disclosure process. Additionally, our research frameworks provide a basis for further theorizing in this area. We also identify several open research questions addressing issues and challenges in the market-based disclosures.

A second point is that combination of forecasts is more fruitful than competition or method selection in some cases.

  abstract     = {An important aspect of human resource management is understanding employees&#39; values, motivations, and factors of satisfaction. Relationships between employee satisfaction, values, positivity and negativity, employee retention, and industry allow human resource managers to make decisions on employee recruitment techniques and budgets, employee retention efforts, and even company image initiatives. Traditional methods for identifying employee values, job satisfaction, and linkages to important company outcomes are through employee entrance/exit surveys, annual evaluations, and informal interactions. In recent years, companies and researchers have begun to take advantage of the increasing ubiquity of online reviews , including unstructured text responses. In this paper we explore 682,176 employee reviews of Fortune 50 companies from Indeed.com using Structural Topic Modeling (STM) to identify salient aspects in employee reviews and automatically infer latent topics that are salient factors related to employee satisfaction. We compare these topics with the five facets of the Job Descriptive Index (JDI) that are traditionally used to measure job satisfaction among human resource experts. We conduct further analysis comparing comments of current vs. former employees. Results suggests that management may be an important salient factor in employee satisfaction and turnover, as it is consistently mentioned by current and former employees in both positive and the negative comments. Similarly, monetary benefits are mentioned as a negative by former employees, but as a positive for current employees. Furthermore, we examine topic differences by industry sector and find that retail employees frequently mention Pay and Benefits and Length of Breaks , whereas technology sector employees were more concerned with Work-Life Balance . Our results can be used to support company behavioral management decision makers to conceive and evaluate initiatives intended to enhance employee satisfaction. Furthermore, our techniques, including the visualization of topic composition and quality, are generalizable to any setting that uses topic discovery from unstructured text, such as customer reviews, social media posts, and critic reviews, especially when comparing topics across entities.},

  abstract     = {Helpfulness prediction techniques have been widely incorporated into online decision support systems to identify high-quality reviews. Most current studies on helpfulness prediction assume that a review&#39;s helpfulness only relies on information from itself. In practice, however, consumers hardly process reviews independently because reviews are displayed in sequence; a review is more likely to be affected by its adjacent neighbors in the sequence, which is largely understudied. In this paper, we proposed the first end-to-end neural architecture to capture the missing interaction between reviews and their neighbors. Our model allows for a total of 12 (three selection × four aggregation) schemes that contextualize a review into the context clues learned from its neighbors. We evaluated our model on six domains of real-world online reviews against a series of state-of-the-art baselines. Experimental results confirm the influence of sequential neighbors on reviews and show that our model significantly outperforms the baselines by 1% to 5%. We further revealed how reviews are influenced by their neighbors during helpfulness perception via extensive analysis. The results and findings of our work provide theoretical contributions to the field of review helpfulness prediction and offer insights into practical decision support system design.},

  abstract     = {Achieving timely last-mile order delivery is often the most challenging part of an e-commerce order fulfillment. Effective management of last-mile operations can result in significant cost savings and lead to increased customer satisfaction. Currently, due to the lack of customer availability information, the schedules followed by delivery agents are optimized for the shortest tour distance. Therefore, orders are not delivered in customer-preferred time periods resulting in missed deliveries. Missed deliveries are undesirable since they incur additional costs. In this paper, we propose a decision support framework that is intended to improve delivery success rates while reducing delivery costs. Our framework generates delivery schedules by predicting the appropriate delivery time periods for order delivery. In particular, the proposed framework works in two stages. In the first stage, order delivery success for every order throughout the delivery shift is predicted using machine learning models. The predictions are used as an input for the optimization scheme, which generates delivery schedules in the second stage. The proposed framework is evaluated on two real-world datasets collected from a large e-commerce platform. The results indicate the effectiveness of the decision support framework in enabling savings of up to 10.2% in delivery costs when compared to the current industry practice.},

  abstract     = {The growing amount of cyberspace threats highlights the need to evaluate cybersecurity risks and to plan for effective investments. One internationally recognized document for cybersecurity risk management is the framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It provides guidelines, best practices and standards for cybersecurity risk management. Nevertheless, as other self-assessment frameworks, it produces a static view of an organization&#39;s cyber posture and does not capture the dynamics of organizational changes and cyberattacks. Moreover, the current situation sees small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in a critical position since they need to manage their cybersecurity while usually not being skilled or equipped enough to internalize this process. Therefore, there is a need for a practical and easily applicable model able to identify a cybersecurity risk profile and its dynamics. This study proposes a system dynamics methodology and tool (SMECRA - SME Cyber Risk Assessment) for supporting cybersecurity investment decisions for SMEs through the evaluation of cyber risk and previous investments. SMECRA addresses dynamic organizational complexity and can be used to assess cyber risks and related dynamics over time. Three case studies demonstrate its capability to assess a SME&#39;s cybersecurity status and to evaluate investments impacts on an organization&#39;s risk profile, raising cybersecurity awareness. This study is important for SMEs wishing to manage their own cybersecurity risk and for insurance companies in their economic evaluation of residual risks that SMEs wish to externalize.},

Anchored in the literature on firm engagement and firm-generated content, this study discusses and empirically examines the impact of managerial response to online reviews on future ratings. A big data approach coupled with text analytics is employed on a large field dataset to analyse both structured review/response metrics and unstructured response text. Results show that an increase in future review valence is positively associated with the intensity, promptness, and sentiment of managerial responses, and the magnitude of effects is contingent upon firms&#39; rating status and market position. Mixed evidence is obtained for comprehensiveness and standardisation of response content. These findings reveal that the influence of firm engagement in the online review network is likely to be shaped by the goodwill signalled by managerial responses.},

  abstract     = {Frequent tweets of the former president of the United States, Donald Trump, provide a unique opportunity to study how financial markets respond to his statements. To do this, we utilize a precise timestamp of each tweet together with high-frequency financial data. We start by analyzing the impact of tweets in general, irrespective of their content. We find that tweets by President Trump are followed by increased uncertainty, increased trading and a decline in the US stock market. We utilize two methods in order to study whether the market reaction depends on the content of the tweets. First, classification of Trump&#39;s tweets depending on whether they contain a specific word reveals that market response is particularly negative for tweets containing the words “products” and “tariff”. Second, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation to affiliate tweets with distinct topics. We find that while most topics do not impact financial markets, the US stock market responds to tweets related to the topic of a “trade war” by price decline, increased trading volume and increased uncertainty. The “trade war” tweets affect other financial markets too, as the Chinese stock market responds to these tweets negatively, while the price of gold responds positively. We illustrate the practical importance of our approach by an automated trading system, which achieves positive abnormal returns.},

  abstract     = {Most bankruptcy prediction models used by financial institutions rely on single-period data, that is to say data that characterize firms at a given moment of their life. However, the financial literature devoted to bankruptcy considers this phenomenon to be a protracted process and time to be a fundamental explanatory variable of firm failure. The few studies that attempted to incorporate a temporal dimension into a forecasting model using multi-period data often yielded results that did not really improve model accuracy. One may then suppose that the principles that ground the historical dimension of bankruptcy are less in question to explain the poor difference between the results estimated with these two types of data than the way time is modeled into prediction rules. This is why we propose a method that relies on a particular modeling of firm history using self-organizing neural networks and a segmentation of the data space, and which makes it possible to typify subsets of firms that share a common evolution of their financial situation over time. This method leads to models that are substantially more accurate than traditional ones, especially when it comes to forecasting the fate of firms the cost of misclassification of which is the highest for any financial institution.},

We carried out a free-simulation experiment to test how users select scripts based on two factors: combined ontological completeness and ontological overlap. We find that participants indeed decided to select more than one script to achieve a more complete domain representation. But, when they selected more than three scripts, they decided to remove scripts and reduce combined completeness to increase the clarity of the combined representation. Our results indicate that script readers prefer relatively less complete scripts with high levels of clarity over more complete, but more overlapping, script combinations.

However, it has been reported that nearly 30% of cryptocurrency projects fail during ICO, indicating an important gap in research and an opportunity for more advanced research on ICO project assessment. This study reveals that previous studies primarily used project-related factors to predict ICO success while neglecting social factors such as team information and expert evaluation. Inspired by the knowledge-based theory (KBT) of the firm, we set out to examine the impact of heterogeneous team knowledge and expert evaluation on ICO success. One primary contribution of this study is the design of novel knowledge measures based on KBT. In addition, we propose a deep-learning model – an attention-based bidirectional recurrent neural network (A-BiRNN) – to automatically extract features from online comments. We validate the proposed model on a real-world dataset, and experiments show that the accuracy of the proposed prediction model outperforms those of existing models by more than 6%, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach in predicting ICO success. This study&#39;s results provide useful ideas for both investors and ICO platforms to assess the quality of cryptocurrency projects, thus improving information symmetry in ICO markets. Also, this study demonstrates the value of applying KBT in assessing firm performance in ICO markets. The generalized value of the proposed approach should be tested in more business contexts , such as crowdfunding and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending.},

To facilitate deployment, we apply a range of existing machine-learning methods to obtain predictions at monthly intervals using real HR and payroll data that contains no health-related predictors. We model employee absence as a binary classification problem with loss asymmetry and conceptualise a misclassification cost matrix of employee sickness absence . Model performance is evaluated using cost-based metrics, which have intuitive interpretation. We also demonstrate how this problem can be approached when costs are unknown. The proposed flexible evaluation procedure is not restricted to a specific model or domain and can be applied to address other HR analytics questions when deployed.

  abstract     = {Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&amp;A) systems have demonstrated their potential to enhance decision making ; however, the linkage between BI&amp;A and decision support systems (DSS) has been contested by some, if not completely denied by others. In this research, we investigate the foundations of BI&amp;A by using foundational literature on DSS to open the ‘black box’ of BI&amp;A systems. We argue that BI&amp;A is fundamentally a subfield of DSS that is seeking to convert more data into deeper insight, but it has lost its connection to DSS literature and, thereby, missed research opportunities. In this paper, we first define DSS and BI&amp;A and then present a systematic review of foundational DSS literature to assess their leveraging in BI&amp;A research. By classifying cited DSS articles and citing BI&amp;A articles into four areas: conceptual framework, design &amp; implementation, business value &amp; organizational use, and cognition &amp; decision making , potential research for BI&amp;A is uncovered. We reconcile these two research streams by mapping BI&amp;A frameworks to classical DSS components through interviews with practitioners. The result is formulated as a comparative, process-level architecture for converting data into insight. New research opportunities for BI&amp;A are suggested motivated by foundational DSS literature.},

  abstract     = {Platform-mediated network has received increasing attention from researchers and practitioners in recent years. The literature on this topic has been mainly derived from the model of two-sided network (2SN) where producers and consumers comprise the two sides and are considered the main user groups. Inadequacy, however, has been noticed where the two-sided network model cannot fully explicate the dynamics of platform competition. A more comprehensive model can help firms better understand the nature of platform competition so as to make informed decisions in this evolving landscape. By adding a higher dimension of “zone” to the existing “side” dimension, we propose a new two-zoned network (2ZN) model. A 2ZN consists of two 2SNs and the platform at the core functionally serves as a nexus connecting the two networks. In addition, we propose three properties of 2ZN (namely, zone parallelism , service diversity in the pay zone, and latent payment in the free zone) to help further explore two-zoned networks. For illustration purposes, four real business cases are identified, analyzed, and discussed to exhibit the applicability of the proposed 2ZN model. With additional insights into the structure and inner working of platform-mediated networks through the new 2ZN model, managers can make better-informed decisions to cope with platform competition. The case analysis and related discussion suggest promising opportunities for future research.},

We propose a method to recommend personalized papers based on a heterogeneous network that includes papers, venues, authors, terms, and users as well as the relations among these entities. We investigate meta-paths in the network to capture user preferences and apply random walks on these meta-paths to measure recommendation scores of candidate papers to target users. We employ a personalized weight learning process to discover a user&#39;s personalized weights on different meta-paths using Bayesian Personalized Ranking as the objective function. A global recommendation score is calculated by combining recommendation scores on different meta-paths with personalized weights. We conducted experiments using two different datasets and the results showed that the proposed method performed better than other baseline methods .},

  abstract     = {Modern aircraft have thousands of parts, systems, and components that need to be recurrently inspected or replaced. To keep the fleet airworthy, maintenance planners have to schedule the maintenance checks for each aircraft and the associated tasks. In practice, these two complex problems are solved following the experience of planners, resulting in sub-efficient solutions. This paper presents the first decision support system (DSS) developed for optimizing both aircraft maintenance check schedule and task allocation. The DSS integrates aircraft maintenance check scheduling, task allocation to each maintenance check, and shift planning in the same framework. The practical relevance of the DSS is illustrated through three test cases. The results show that the DSS can be used not only to optimize maintenance plans but also to study future maintenance policies. The results reveal substantial improvements in all key performance indicators compared with the planning approach followed by a partner airline .},

We use a difference-in-differences approach and apply the propensity score matching to 1400 DPS announcements made by 228 US firms whose stocks are publicly traded on US stock markets from 2004 to 2018. The main findings are as follows: (1) On average, DPS investment significantly reduces firms&#39; systematic risk. (2) The risk reduction effects are greater for non-BDA firms than for BDA firms. Our results indicate that DPS investment reduces firm risk and that the business value of specific information technology (IT) investment (e.g., DPS) is influenced by firms&#39; other IT assets (e.g., BDA).

  abstract     = {In digital repositories, it is crucial to refine existing subject terms and exploit a taxonomy with subject terms, in order to promote information retrieval tasks such as indexing, cataloging and searching of digital documents. In this paper, we address how to refine an existing set of subject terms, often containing irrelevant ones or creating noise, that are used to index digital documents. Further, we present how to automatically induce a subject term taxonomy to capture and utilise the semantic relations among subject terms. Most related works have little studied these problems, focusing mostly on creating subject terms or building a taxonomy of key terms from text documents. We propose a methodology 2 for refining an existing set of subject terms in a digital repository by identifying their semantics, as well as inducing a taxonomy with subject terms by analysing their mutual usages, maximising their semantic relatedness. Then, we present a case study using the (Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory) APO digital repository to analyse the proposed methodology and demonstrate its applicability. Further, to validate the generalisability of the proposed taxonomy inducing method, we evaluate it using a gold-standard taxonomy in life sciences, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), in comparison with the state–of-the-art taxonomy inducing method, TaxoFinder. Our evaluation shows that our methodology has a high potential for refining an existing set of subject terms and capturing their semantic relationships by inducing a subject term taxonomy.},

  abstract     = {Due to low switching costs and stiff competition, customer relationship management has become a central component in the marketing strategy of telecommunication service providers. Since the costs of acquiring a new customer are five times higher than the costs of maintaining an existing customer, telecommunication service providers are eager to reduce the churn rate. A solid understanding of customer churn behavior can help to address this problem. Reducing the churn rate can translate into significant revenue gains and might provide the edge to outperform the competitor. In this paper, we predict the propensity to churn for customers of a Dutch telecommunication service provider by employing a duration model. While predicting churn, we simultaneously predict the reason for which the customer churns, using a competing risks model. Since the telecommunication service provider has valuable textual data based on transcripts of calls between customers and the customer service center, we incorporate topics extracted from this textual data as variables in our models, by employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We compare four models and find that the models that have incorporated topic variables usually yield the best churn forecasts. Also, the investigated models beat the considered benchmark model, which is the model currently deployed at the telecommunication service provider.},

  abstract     = {Creating reliable and robust quality control systems that identify process errors while having a low number of false rejects is a considerable challenge in the automated manufacturing industry. Especially in the pharmaceutical industry , where a product&#39;s quality has to be ensured at all costs, a large amount of false rejects is acceptable to guarantee the integrity of all released products. As standard quality control systems mainly perform a binary classification , most of them do not provide insights about the reason behind rejections. As a result, the underlying reason for the rejects, such as degradation in equipment or wrong settings in process parameters, often goes unnoticed. Yet, these systems are based on conservative approaches that incorporate the uncertainties related to the measurement system and process variation such as batch-to-batch variations and assembly tolerances. In this contribution, a new data-driven quality control system is suggested. The system is based on well-established machine learning methods that differentiate multiple types of errors in the assembly processes of medical products. Trained on process data, the system&#39;s functionality is demonstrated in a pre-study and two real industrial use cases. Moreover, application-specific differences are discussed. It is shown that for the two use cases and a limited number of batches the system not only detects 100% of all defective products but also limits the number of false rejects to an acceptable amount. In all of the application examples, the system has the potential to be executed as a soft real-time system that allows integration into industrial processes. Moreover, it is shown that the algorithm can present the extracted knowledge in various forms understandable for humans, allowing for more informed decision making.},

Finding “small” and “good” communities in multi-layer terrorist networks, where each layer represents a particular type of relationship between network actors, is a vital step in such disruption efforts. We propose a community detection algorithm that draws on the principles of discrete-time random walks to find such “small” and “good” communities in a multi-layer terrorist network. Our algorithm uses several parallel walkers that take short independent random walks towards hubs on a multi-layer network to capture its structure. We first evaluate the correlation between nodes using the extracted walks. Then, we apply an agglomerative clustering procedure to maximize the asymptotical Surprise, which allows us to go beyond the resolution limit and find small and less sparse communities in multi-layer networks. This process affords us a focused investigation on the more important seeds over random actors within the network. We tested our algorithm on three real-world multi-layer dark networks and compared the results against those found by applying two existing approaches – Louvain and InfoMap – to the same networks. The comparative analysis shows that our algorithm outperforms the existing approaches in differentiating “small” and “good” communities.},

Ideally, a DBA should keep track of several Database Management Systems (DBMS) parameters, configure data structures , and must be aware about possible interferences among several database (DB) configurations. We claim that an automatic tuning system is a decision support system and DB tuning may also be seen as a configuration management task. Therefore, we may characterize it by means of a formal domain conceptualization, benefiting from existing control practices and computational support in the configuration management domain. This work presents Tun-O CM , a conceptual model represented as a well-founded ontology, that encompasses a novel characterization of the database tuning domain as a configuration management conceptualization to support decision making.

From a unique dataset, various free-form relationship models with their own structures and parameters have been discovered. By the comprehensive evaluations of candidate models, a guided map was offered to understand the relationship between dynamic retail prices and the volume/valence of reviews for different types of products. Experimental results show that 37.69% of products in our sample exhibit the following trend: When the price is increased to a certain level, the volume of reviews shifts from a decreasing trend to an increasing trend. Results also demonstrate that a linearly increasing relationship model between prices and the valence of reviews is more suitable for the low-involvement products than for the high-involvement products. In addition to the new findings, this research provides a powerful tool to assist domain experts in building relationship models for decision making in a highly efficient manner.},

This study examines how closed-form evaluations and open-ended textual comment options affect customers&#39; online review writing behaviors and reflect satisfaction with hotels. We find that direct and spillover effects exist. These refer to the effects of customers&#39; closed-form evaluations of a product or service attribute on their reviews of the same attribute and other attributes in their open-ended comments, respectively. Regarding the direct effect, positive closed-form evaluations of attributes reduce customers&#39; behaviors of writing details about the same attributes in open-ended comments, but negative closed-form evaluations of attributes increase that behavior. The increasing effect is greater than the reducing effect. Regarding the spillover effect, closed-form evaluations of certain attributes increase customers&#39; behaviors of writing details about other attributes in open-ended comments. Additionally, we find that the heterogeneity effect lies in the different roles of closed-form evaluations and open-ended textual comments in reflecting customers&#39; overall satisfaction. Open-ended comments about the advantages of the attributes have a more significant effect than the closed-form evaluations of the same attributes in reflecting overall customer satisfaction, but closed-form evaluations better reflect customers&#39; low overall satisfaction with the disadvantages of the attributes. The direct, spillover, and heterogeneity effects on customers&#39; evaluations and comments regarding independent hotels are higher than those effects on evaluations and comments regarding chain hotels. The findings provide insights for companies to design review systems, understand customer perceptions, and use the positive electronic word-of-mouth effect.},

  abstract     = {Digital Twin is one of the promising digital technologies being developed at present to support digital transformation and decision making in multiple industries. While the concept of a Digital Twin is nearly 20 years old, it continues to evolve as it expands to new industries and use cases. This has resulted in a continually increasing variety of definitions that threatens to dilute the concept and lead to ineffective implementations of the technology. There is a need for a consolidated and generalized definition, with clearly established characteristics to distinguish what constitutes a Digital Twin and what does not. This paper reviews 46 Digital Twin definitions given in the literature over the past ten years to propose a generalized definition that encompasses the breadth of options available and provides a detailed characterization which includes criteria to distinguish the Digital Twin from other digital technologies. Next, a process and considerations for the implementation of Digital Twins is presented through a case study . Digital Twin future needs and opportunities are also outlined.},

However, research on the effects of simultaneously offered but differently useful offline-to-online (OFF-ON) and online-to-offline (ON-OFF) integration services for consumers is lacking. Managers still find it challenging to decide for those services that increase channel quality and behavioral outcomes. Therefore, this study analyzes ramifications of integration services. The authors apply latent moderated structural equations to analyze mediation paths of most useful OFF-ON and ON-OFF services for consumers to offline and online purchase intentions via perceived quality of offerings in major sales channels. Importantly, they differentiate cross-channel effects and interesting moderators. Based on data from 722 consumer evaluations of leading omni-channel fashion firms, the results show indirect-only effects. OFF-ON services provide knowledge about and ease of access to both offline and online channels; ON-OFF services show no links to offline channels, i.e., purchase intentions depend on perceived quality of online offerings. Surprisingly, OFF-ON services increase both purchase intentions the most. Additionally, higher levels of consumers&#39; online shopping experience reduce the mediation paths, and higher levels of perceived channel congruence positively and negatively moderate them. Knowing the cross-channel effects of OFF-ON and ON-OFF services that are most important to consumers is essential for decision makers , as they logically matter most to firms in competition.},

  abstract     = {Make or buy decisions are often decisions between investing in capital for production or building supply chain relationships upstream. These are strategic decisions about production interdependence: the degree to which materials and services are provided internally versus purchased externally. Information technology (IT) has increased productivity with hardware and software such as robotics and flexible manufacturing systems . IT has also improved information sharing and coordination along the supply chain by integrating business processes with software. Within manufacturing, we examine whether hardware and software are related to choices of make versus buy differently. From a transaction cost perspective this can be due to differential impacts on reducing internal production costs versus external coordination costs. We find that in U.S. manufacturing industries from 1998 to 2016, hardware favors internal production suggesting hardware reduces costs of internal provision more; software increased purchases from upstream suppliers suggesting software reduces costs of external provision more. This result shows that hardware and software complementarity has limits in that each has distinct productivity targets, and that empirically the decision of make versus buy is manifested by investments in these different types of IT capital. That is, when facing strategic decisions about make versus buy in manufacturing, hardware and software have opposite impacts.},

However, one of the research questions in this domain that has not been addressed so far is the impact of circumstances of review writing itself, which may influence the way the review is written and affect its credibility. In this paper, we describe a controlled experiment to study the impacts of a user&#39;s exposure to past reviews and the user&#39;s own product experience on the perceived credibility of reviews written by the user. We have employed attitude-behavior linkage theories and the disconfirmation effect to study this phenomenon. Our results indicate that disconfirmation , or the difference between a user&#39;s own experience and expected experience, has a significant impact on the way a user writes reviews and hence on the review&#39;s perceived credibility with the subsequent readers of the review. We find that disconfirmation and perceived review credibility follow a U-shaped relationship, in which perceived credibility is high for the highest and lowest values of disconfirmation.},

Movie producers use social media to boost customer engagement; however, our understanding of whether there is a relationship between pre-consumption customer engagement and movie sales is limited. This research explores what drives the success of movies on the opening-weekend. We examine the relationship between pre-consumption customer engagement driven by social media (i.e., personal and interactive engagement) and movie performance (i.e., opening-weekend box office revenues). Driven by the debate about the potential capacity of social media-driven customer engagement to improve movie performance and the limited understanding of the association of pre-consumption customer engagement and movie performance, this research suggests that social media-enabled customer engagement (i.e., personal and interactive engagement) has the potential to improve movie performance, and these two types of engagement can interact to make this effect stronger. We analyze these relationships drawing from the uses and gratifications theory and the social media affordances perspective that motivate customers to interact in social media. The theoretical model evaluation was tested on a unique and original dataset composed of 966 movies released in the U.K. and Spain. The empirical analysis suggests that personal and interactive engagement are positively related to movie performance, and the positive effects of personal and interactive engagement on movie performance are mutually reinforcing. This research contributes to Information Systems (IS) research by theorizing and empirically showing how customer engagement driven by social media creates business value by improving movie performance.},

  abstract     = {As a newly-emerged financing method, crowdfunding has been gaining popularity among entrepreneurs in recent years. Two major functions are featured in crowdfunding campaigns: financing and marketing. Focusing on reward-based crowdfunding campaigns that adopt the “All-or-Nothing” mechanism, this paper mainly investigates how entrepreneurs set their funding targets and sales strategies with two cases considered—one without and the other with financial constraints. In particular, entrepreneurs without financial constraints may concentrate on profit maximization via product marketing, while those with financial constraints may start with establishing funding targets to ensure the success of the campaign first, and then the retail of products. Two theoretical models are built—one with financial constraints and the other without financial constraints—to determine the optimal product price and sales scheme. We find that the consumers&#39; perceived value of extra rewards and the probability of product matching both play a significant role in product price optimization and profit maximization. Without financial constraints, entrepreneurs&#39; choices on sales schemes vary depending on the consumers&#39; perceived value of extra rewards and the probability of product matching, whereas a two-stage sales scheme is optimal for entrepreneurs with financial constraints. Our results also reveal that a higher probability of product matching may benefit social welfare but damage consumer surplus under certain circumstances. Using real data from the Kickstarter platform, this paper offers a new perspective to enrich the understanding of theoretical results.},

For this reason, we refine patrol optimization to focus on the critical ridges in hot spots. In doing so, we extract density ridges of 2018 to early 2019 Part I crime incidents from Chicago to demonstrate that nonlinear mode-following ridges agree with broader kernel density estimations. We create multi-run confidence intervals and show that our patrol templates cover around 94% of incidents for 0.1-mile envelopes around ridges, and deliver evidence that ridges following crime densities enhances the efficiency of patrols. Our post-hoc tests show the stability of ridges, thus offering an alternative patrol route option that is effective and efficient.},

  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence is increasingly becoming integrated in many aspects of human life. One particular AI comes in the form of conversational agents (CAs) such as Siri, Alexa, and chatbots used for customer service on websites and other information systems. It is widely accepted that humans treat systems as social actors. Leveraging this bias, companies sometimes attempt to masquerade a CA as a human customer service representative. In addition to the ethical and legal questions around this practice, the benefits and drawbacks of a CA pretending to be human are unclear due to a lack of study. While more human-like interactions can improve outcomes, when users find out that the CA is not human, they may have a negative reaction that may cause reputation harm in the company. In this research we use Expectation Violation Theory to explain what happens when users have high or low expectations of a conversation. We conducted an experiment with 175 participants where some participants were told they were interacting with a CA while others were told they were interacting with a human. We further divided the groups so that some participants interacted with a CA with low conversational capability while others interacted with a CA with high conversational capability. The results show that expectations formed by the user before the interaction change how the user evaluates the CA beyond the actual performance of the CA. These findings provide guidance to developers not just of conversational agents, but also for other technologies where users may be uncertain of a system&#39;s capabilities.},

  abstract     = {To comply with sustainability goals, many companies buy green energy to serve their energy demand. This is typically done by engaging in bilateral power purchase agreements (PPA) with renewable energy producers (REP). A PPA can be flexibly structured, but the core principle is that a buyer (company) agrees to buy future energy production of a seller (REP) at an agreed-upon fixed price. PPAs are financially attractive for sellers, providing price certainty, unlike trading in electricity markets. However, PPAs can bring quantity uncertainty for buyers due to the uncertainty of future green energy delivery. This uncertainty in the long-term endangers sustainability targets, and in the short-term complicates reliable and cost-efficient demand matching. Thus, multiple strategies have been used in PPAs to encourage sellers to provide accurate and good-faith predictions of their short-term and longer-term future production. Yet, it has been shown that REPs can have incentives to misreport predicted values. This has discouraged some companies from engaging in PPAs. In this paper, we first investigate how PPA structure and pricing can incentivize REPs to provide more reliable predictions. This shifts the risk of production uncertainty to REPs, increasing the chance that REPs adopt batteries . We further study how having batteries for REPs affects their own revenue as well as the reliability of their energy predictions for buyers. We use analytical and simulation approaches to propose a decision tree for a win-win PPA structure, which improves reliability for buyers while maintaining profitability for REPs.},

  abstract     = {Online gaming has grown to be a very popular electronic entertainment for people throughout the world. However, the burgeoning popularity of online games in some cases leads to addiction, a phenomenon that has received considerable attention. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of psychological ownership, gaming motivation, and primary–secondary control on online game addiction (OGA). Based on 436 valid responses collected from online questionnaires, the partial least squares structural equation modeling approach was employed to test the research model. Findings show that the motivations of achievement and escapism are positively associated with psychological ownership toward a virtual gaming environment. Of particular interest is the inverted-U relationship between psychological ownership and OGA, suggesting that too little or too much psychological ownership is associated with less OGA. Finally, individuals with high levels of primary (secondary) control are more (less) inclined to be addicted to online games. This study provides practical implications and strategies to address the alarming increase in OGA. First, families, communities, and universities should encourage outdoor activities, such as sports competitions, and offline cosplay games to address the need for achievement and escapism. Second, individuals who play online games for relaxation should choose a relatively easy or hard mode to avoid game addiction. Finally, parents, teachers, and employers are encouraged to pay attention to individuals who have a high level of primary control since they can be susceptible to OGA. This study provides several theoretical contributions. First, the study enriches OGA and the gaming motivation literature by exploring the roles of gaming motivation, psychological ownership, and personal control strategies as they can be a factor in OGA. In addition, this study is the first to investigate the dark side of psychological ownership in terms of negative outcomes for OGA. This study also advances the personal control strategy literature by understanding the roles of primary and secondary control on OGA.},

  abstract     = {The ever-increasing reliance on loot boxes by the video game industry has attracted scrutiny from consumer groups and regulators. For example, this practice of selling random assortments of virtual items for a price has been criticized for its lack of transparency since, before purchasing a loot box, players do not necessarily know the possible items they can win and the associated probabilities . Even in the rare cases when the list of items and probabilities are available, there are no guarantees that a game is actually using that information when randomly drawing an item, which naturally results in a trust problem. We draw from decision theory to explain the transparency and trust issues faced by loot boxes, and from a recently proposed decision model by Pedersen et al. (2019) to motivate the use of blockchain technology in this context. Following the design science research framework (Peffers et al., 2007), we then explain how loot boxes can be coded as smart contracts running on a blockchain network, and why this solution effectively tackles the transparency and trust problems we mentioned above. We illustrate the use of the proposed smart contract by developing a decentralized application (DApp) that mimics the process of purchasing and opening a loot box. We carefully analyze our solution by considering its computational complexity , accuracy, security, and cost aspects. We further discuss topics related to governance and deployment so as to help the video game industry with a potential real-life implementation of our solution.},

  abstract     = {An understudied area in the field of social media research is the design of decision support systems that can aid the manager by way of automated message component generation. Recent advances in this form of artificial intelligence has been suggested to allow content creators and managers to transcend their tasks from creation towards editing, thus overcoming a common problem: the tyranny of the blank screen. In this research, we address this topic by proposing a novel system design that will suggest engagement-driven message features as well as automatically generate critical and fully written unique Tweet message components for the goal of maximizing the probability of relatively high engagement levels. Our multi-methods design relies on the use of econometrics , machine learning , and Bayesian statistics , all of which are widely used in the emerging fields of Business and Marketing Analytics. Our system design is intended to analyze Tweet messages for the purpose of generating the most critical components and structure of Tweets. We propose econometric models to judge the quality of written Tweets by way of engagement-level prediction, as well as a generative probability model for the auto-generation of Tweet messages. Testing of our design demonstrates the need to take into account the contextual, semantic, and syntactic features of messages, while controlling for individual user characteristics, so that generated Tweet components and structure maximizes the potential engagement levels.},

  abstract     = {Advances in artificial intelligence create new opportunities for computers to support humans as peers in hybrid teams in several complex problem-solving situations. This paper proposes a decision-making architecture for adaptively informing decisions in human-computer collaboration for large-scale competitive problems under dynamic environments. The proposed architecture integrates methods from sequence learning, model predictive control , and game theory. Computers in this architecture learn objectives and strategies from experimental data to support humans with strategic decisions while operational decisions are made by humans. The paper also presents data-driven methods for partitioning tasks among a team of computers in this architecture. The generalized methodology is illustrated on the real-time strategy game Starcraft II. The results from this application show that low-performing players can benefit from the game-theoretic decision support whereas this support can be overly conservative for high-performing players. The proposed approach provides safe though suboptimal suggestions particularly against an opponent with an unknown level of expertise. The results further show that problem solution with a team of computers based on non-intuitive task partitioning significantly improves the quality of decisions compared to an all-in-one solution with a single computer.},

  abstract     = {Facilitating information search to support decision making is one of the core purposes of information technology. In both personal and workplace environments, advances in information technology and the availability of information have enabled people to perform much more search and access much more information for decision making than ever before. Because of this abundance of information, there is an increasing need to develop an improved understanding of how people stop search, since information available for most decisions is now almost infinite. Our goal in this paper is to further our understanding of information search and stopping, and we do so by examining the neurocorrelates of stopping information search. This is a process that involves both stopping the search and the decision to stop the search. We asked subjects to search for information about consumer products and to stop when they believed they had enough information to make a subsequent decision about whether to purchase those products while in a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) chamber. Brain activation patterns revealed an extensive distributed network of areas that are engaged in the decision to stop searching for information that are not engaged in search itself, suggesting that stopping is a complex and cognitively demanding neurological activity. Implications for theory, particularly information overconsumption, and for IT design are discussed.},

The proposed DSS assesses the resilience of a port under possible disruptive events given its design, operations and potential pre-defined post-event recovery actions to mitigate the impact of the disruption. Digital twinning provides the fidelity required to realistically predict port performance with taken post-event recovery actions under various possible disruptive events. In addition to hedging against impacts from probabilistically known disruption events, this approach also enables inclusion of ordinary operational uncertainties within the resilience evaluation. This is not generally feasible with other existing resilience quantification approaches. To tackle computational challenges of applying a digital twin for real-world size applications, an optimal computing budget allocation policy is adopted to improve computational efficiency. Results of numerical experiments using a real-world size port demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DSS and criticality of accounting for ordinary uncertainties in operations in resilience estimation.},

However, pursuing customer repeated bookings is a challenge on these platforms. How to increase customer repeated bookings in the short-term room rental market? We examine theoretically and empirically this crucial research question. Drawing on the theoretical foundations of the social interaction theory, we identify and study three host-guest interactions that can affect customer repeated bookings: overall interaction, individual interaction, and offline interaction. We conduct a combination of empirical methods, including text mining and econometrics , using longitudinal data of 36,072 order records and review contents from 5002 listings and 2181 hosts in six cities Xiaozhu.com , which is a prevalent short-term room rental services provider in China. We find that overall host-guest interaction (online reply rate, acceptance rate, confirmation time) and individual host-guest interaction (the existence of individual interaction, absolute text length, and text similarity) increase customer repeated bookings. We also discover that offline host-guest interaction is a substitute for the effect of individual interaction (existence, text length, and similarity) on customer repeated bookings.},

In recent years, approaches have steadily moved from classical statistical methods towards the application of deep neural network architectures, which outperform the former and enable analysis without explicit knowledge of the underlying process model. While the focus of prior research was on the long short-term memory network architecture , more deep learning architectures offer promising extensions that have proven useful for other applications of sequential data. In our work, we introduce a gated convolutional neural network and a key-value-predict attention network to the task of next event prediction. In a comprehensive evaluation study on 11 real-life benchmark datasets, we show that these two novel architectures surpass prior work in 34 out of 44 metric-dataset combinations. For our evaluation, we consider the effects of process data properties, such as sparsity , variation, and repetitiveness, and discuss their impact on the prediction quality of the different deep learning architectures. Similarly, we evaluate their classification properties in terms of generalization and handling class imbalance . Our results provide guidance for researchers and practitioners alike on how to select, validate, and comprehensively benchmark (novel) predictive process monitoring models. In particular, we highlight the importance of sufficiently diverse process data properties in event logs and the comprehensive reporting of multiple performance indicators to achieve meaningful results.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for implementing student dropout prediction using data-driven methods. Extending upon profit metrics as used in business analytics , we design a novel performance measure for evaluating predictive models that is tailored to the student dropout problem and that quantifies the net savings of a retention campaign. This metric supports the identification and selection of students to optimally allocate the limited resources for preventing student dropout and to maximize the resulting savings. Experiments were performed using data from three bachelor&#39;s programs of a higher education institution containing information on dropouts and participation in a retention program, i.e., tutorials. The proposed metric allows for a better choice of prediction model and classification threshold than conventional approaches and, as a result, yields tangible savings for the institution. Finally, the presented approach and experimental results highlight pathways to design tailored student retention programs.},

Both studies show that compared to exact match, broad match leads to lower advertising performance. Moreover, the negative effect of broad match on CTR is more prominent for more specific or lower (better)-position keywords, and the effects of broad match on CR, revenue and profits are less negative for higher (worse)-position keywords.

  abstract     = {The electronic diagnostic records of patients, primarily collected by hospitals, comprise valuable data for the development of recommender systems to support physicians in predicting the risks associated with various diseases. For some diseases, the diagnostic record data are not sufficient to train a prediction model to generate recommendations; this is referred to as the data sparsity problem. Cross-domain recommender systems offer a solution to this problem by transferring knowledge from a similar domain (source domain) with sufficient data for modeling to facilitate prediction in the current domain (target domain). However, building a cross-domain recommender system for medical diagnosis presents two challenges: (1) uncertain representations, such as the symptoms characterized by interval numbers, are often used in medical records , and (2) given two different diseases, the feature spaces of the two diagnostic domains are often disparate because the diseases are only likely to share a few symptoms. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a cross-domain recommender system, named information transfer for medical diagnosis (ITMD), to provide physicians with personalized recommendations for disease risks. In ITMD, a novel dissimilarity measurement was performed for diagnosis, represented as interval numbers. The space alignment technique eliminated the feature space divergence caused by different symptoms between two diseases, and the development of collective matrix factorization enabled knowledge transfer between the source and target domains. Experiments and a case study using real-world data demonstrated that ITMD outperforms four baselines and improves the accuracy of recommendations for disease risks in patients to support physicians in determining a final medical diagnosis.},

Furthermore, we examine how the expectation disconfirmation bias impacts classification performance. Analyzing a large sample of health inspections, corresponding online reviews and restaurant visitor data, we propose and evaluate different predictive models. We find that classifiers specifically taking into account information from online review platforms outperform different baseline approaches. We thus show that online reviews encompass private information indicating strong information efficiency. Furthermore, we observe that the expectation disconfirmation bias has an influence on classification performance in case of restaurants with a low star rating and with a poor inspection history. An ensemble classifier can help to mitigate this influence. Thus, online review platforms contain relevant information to predict future health violations.

Additionally, this study examines whether the type of product networks are associated with the convergence of expressed sentiments for products in a product network differently. Data is collected from a major Swiss e-commerce platform and analyzed via various econometrics models . The results suggest that a network connection between two products via a “substitute” recommender system leads to a convergence of the two products&#39; ratings. In contrast, a connection via a “complementary” recommender system leads to the product ratings&#39; divergence. Additionally, consistent findings are shown to be present when examining the association between the network connection and product sentiment convergence. The findings contribute to WOM and recommendation systems literature and provide interesting implications of the practice.},

This study aims to identify the best cryptocurrency mining strategy based on service providers&#39; performance for cryptocurrency mining using a hybrid analytics approach, which integrates the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy-TOPSIS techniques, along with sensitivity analysis. The results show that hosted mining is the overall best cryptocurrency mining strategy, followed by home mining and cloud mining, based on both total cost of operations and cryptocurrency payout criteria. The empirical findings also suggest that the critical features of the highest performing service providers (i.e., hosted mining strategies and cloud mining) were their flexibility of contracts and the superior efficiency in terms of the daily payout. Finally, of the three location alternatives for home mining, Turkey ranks first compared to the U.S. and Europe.},

  abstract     = {Appointment no-shows are disruptive to healthcare clinics, and may increase patient waiting time and clinic overtime, resulting in increased clinic costs. Appointment scheduling models typically mitigate the negative effects of no-shows through appointment overbooking. Recent work has proposed a predictive overbooking framework, where a probabilisitic classifier predicts the no-show probability of individual appointment requests, and a scheduling algorithm uses those predictions to optimally schedule appointments. Because predicting no-shows is typically an imbalanced classification problem, the preferred classifier is often chosen based upon the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), which is a commonly used metric for many other imbalanced classification problems. Contrary to intuition, in this paper we show that employing the AUC to select a classifier results in significantly lower schedule efficiency than using other metrics such as Log Loss or Brier Score. Our computational experiments, validated on large real-world appointment data, suggest that by using Log Loss or Brier Score instead of AUC, practitioners can improve the schedule quality by 3–7%.},

While these automated identification technologies help improve convenience, effectiveness, and efficiency, associated vulnerabilities need to be carefully considered to weigh their advantages against their disadvantages.

Using 10,531 firm-year observations, we show that there is a positive association between TMT LSM and accounting conservatism, suggesting that TMT members who share similar linguistic styles respond quickly to corporate news on firm value. This implies that TMTs with better language style alignment facilitate social interactions among members to form a consensus view, enhancing decision making on how a firm should react to various corporate events that affect its value. Additional analyses indicate that the impact of LSM on conservative accounting reporting behavior is more pronounced when firms face a more competitive business environment, severe information asymmetry , and higher financial distress. By examining TMT characteristics from the dynamic psycholinguistic perspective, we shed light on the understanding of how executives&#39; cognitive values collectively affect a firm&#39;s conservative reporting decisions.},

To address the questions, we conduct this study on online games that are typical in the gaming team context.

We analyze 703 responses from gamers of the popular online game (League of Legends). Interestingly, half of the facets motivate gamers&#39; decisions to engage in defensive functions, while the other half motivate them to engage in offensive functions. Moreover, not all gaming team functions fuel loyalty. Pragmatically, our findings provide insights for game system providers to make decisions on game design to sustain members&#39; loyalty.

We use customers&#39; overall ratings in their reviews to measure their overall satisfaction. We find that customers comment on the main service provider, the restaurants, and the auxiliary service providers, which include the drivers and on-demand service platform; in their online customer reviews, which are posted on the restaurants&#39; web pages on the on-demand service platform. From text regressions, we found the determinants of customer satisfaction with the restaurants through their online reviews. There is a spillover effect from the performance of auxiliary providers on customer satisfaction with the main provider. That is, the performance of the drivers and the platform affects customers&#39; overall satisfaction with the restaurants. In addition, we find that a higher cost of the order makes customers comment more on the attributes offered by the restaurants to show their overall satisfaction. Further, we find the type of listed merchants categorized by their properties (i.e., chain or independent) and participation in the platform programs affect the influence of the various attributes, offered by different providers, on customer satisfaction with the main provider.

However, little research has been done to understand the effects of social cues in e-commerce livestreaming. Drawing on stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) theory, we develop a two-phase research framework to examine how two widely used social cues (i.e., herding message and interaction text) can affect viewers&#39; attention allocation procedure and purchase intention when watching e-commerce livestreaming. We also propose that anchor characteristics (i.e., attractiveness) may moderate the effects of social cues. To examine the above effects, we conduct a within-subject eye-tracking experiment. Using generalized linear mixed-effects models, we find that both herding message and interaction text can capture exogenous attention. In terms of endogenous attention to the product and anchor, interaction text shows a negative distracting effect, whereas herding message shows a positive spillover effect , negatively moderated by anchor attractiveness. Moreover, endogenous attention is positively related to purchase intention, while the effect of exogenous attention is relatively more complex, involving the competing mechanisms of the distracting effect and social influence.

  abstract     = {Demand forecasting works as a basis for operating, business and production planning decisions in many supply chain contexts. Yet, how to accurately predict the manufacturer&#39;s demand for components in the presence of end-customer demand uncertainty remains poorly understood. Assigning the proper order quantities of components to suppliers thus becomes a nontrivial task, with a significant impact on planning, capacity and inventory-related costs. This paper introduces a multivariate approach to predict manufacturer&#39;s demand for components throughout multiple forecast horizons using different leading indicators of demand shifts. We compare the autoregressive integrated moving average model with exogenous inputs (ARIMAX) with Machine Learning (ML) models. Using a real case study , we empirically evaluate the forecasting and supply chain performance of the multivariate regression models over the component&#39;s life-cycle. The experiments show that the proposed multivariate approach provides superior forecasting and inventory performance compared with traditional univariate benchmarks. Moreover, it reveals applicable throughout the component&#39;s life-cycle, not just to a single stage. Particularly, we found that demand signals at the beginning of the life-cycle are predicted better by the ARIMAX model, but it is outperformed by ML-based models in later life-cycle stages.},

ICE consists of two stages: the formulation of directly and indirectly associative relations, followed by a generative procedure that is designed for deriving a broad set of candidate entities that are indirectly associative with a specified focal entity; and a deep-learning-based semantic analysis with a word embedding procedure for measuring the similarities between entity profiles so as to target comparable entities from the candidate set.

Using the information of such declarations for a region in Spain during year 2002, we generated a transaction network formed by the tax declarations of buyers and sellers. Four types of error were assigned to each business in the network, defined from the mismatch between the amount declared by the firm in question and its counterpart. We applied a random forest algorithm to detect which firm-related and which network-related characteristics influence each error type. The results show the importance of relational factors among businesses in determining the probability of presenting VAT declaration errors.

Inside Airbnb (IA) collects data from places and reviews as posted by users of Airbnb.com . Visitors can effortlessly download data collected by IA for several locations around the globe. While the dataset is widely used in academic research, no thorough investigation of the dataset and its validity has been conducted. This note examines the dataset and explains an issue of incorrect data added to the dataset. Findings suggest that this issue can be attributed to systemic errors in the data collection process. The results suggest that the use of unverified open datasets can be problematic, although the discoveries presented in this work may not be significant enough to challenge all published research that used the IA dataset. Additionally, findings indicate that the incorrect data happens because of a new feature implemented by Airbnb. Thus, unless changes are made, it is likely that the consequences of this issue will only become more severe.

  abstract     = {Many goods, including pharmaceuticals, require close temperature monitoring. This is important not only for complying with regulations but also for guaranteeing safety of use. A particular challenge in controlling a product&#39;s temperature arises during transportation. In cold supply chains (SCs), temperature is maintained by refrigerated containers . However, many situations, e.g. cooling system failure, lead to ambient temperature changes, and this needs to be detected as early as possible to prevent product damage. Existing approaches to temperature prediction are confined to long-term forecasts with relatively stable ambient temperatures and/or rely on multiple sensors in the known fixed positions. Since interventions in a SC are required immediately, there is a need for methods that provide real-time predictions regarding regular ambient temperature instability, i.e. when the ambient temperature changes unexpectedly in the short term. We propose a novel method that extends the applicability of Newton&#39;s law of cooling (NLC) to changeable ambient temperatures based on a set of temperature stability conditions and a sensor measurement error. In the method, an optimal number of measurements that characterize stable ambient temperatures and improve prediction reliability are selected. We compare the adapted NLC with artificial neural networks and autoregressive moving average models with respect to deviation prediction, prediction error, and execution time . Our evaluation based on real-world data shows that the adapted NLC outperforms existing baseline methods . In contrast to existing solutions, our method does not require any knowledge about the positioning of products within the container, further increasing its practical value.},

  abstract     = {To succeed in their business processes, organizations need data that not only attains suitable levels of quality for the task at hand, but that can also be considered as usable for the business. However, many researchers ground the potential usability of the data on its quality. Organizations would benefit from receiving recommendations on the usability of the data before its use. We propose that the recommendation on the usability of the data be supported by a decision process, which includes a context-dependent data-quality assessment based on business rules. Ideally, this recommendation would be generated automatically. Decision Model and Notation (DMN) enables the assessment of data quality based on the evaluation of business rules, and also, provides stakeholders (e.g., data stewards) with sound support for the automation of the whole process of generation of a recommendation regarding usability based on data quality. The main contribution of the proposal involves designing and enabling both DMN-driven mechanisms and a guiding methodology (DMN4DQ) to support the automatic generation of a decision-based recommendation on the potential usability of a data record in terms of its level of data quality. Furthermore, the validation of the proposal is performed through the application of a real dataset.},

This study develops an improved spatial graph convolution network to learn predictive vertex embeddings with minimal information loss based on local community discovery and to handle the complexity of link predictions in the context of HINs. An optimizable kernel layer is designed to measure the similarity of pairwise vertex embeddings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using four real-world HINs: WordNet, MovieLens, DBLP, and Douban. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several benchmark algorithms, achieving F1-scores of 87.65%, 84.27%, 82.99%, and 89.96% on the four HINs, respectively.

  abstract     = {The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the value of Facebook data in predicting first-time donation behavior. More specifically, we provide evidence that Facebook data can be used as a valuable data source for nonprofit organizations in acquiring new donors. To do so, we evaluate three different dimensionality reduction techniques (i.e., singular value decomposition, non-negative matrix factorization , and latent Dirichlet allocation) over seven classification techniques (i.e., logistic regression , k-nearest neighbors, bagged trees, random forest , adaboost , extreme gradient boosting , and artificial neural networks) using five times twofold cross-validation. Next, we assess what type of Facebook data and which predictors are most important. The results indicate that we can predict first-time donation behavior based on Facebook data with high predictive performance . Our benchmark indicates that the combination of singular value decomposition and logistic regression outperforms all other analytical methodologies with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.72 and a top decile lift of 3.33. The results show that Facebook pages and categories of Facebook pages are the most important data types . The most important predictors are dimensions related to age, education, residence, materialism, responsible consumption, and interest in nonprofits. The presented acquisition models can be used by nonprofit organizations to implement a one-to-one targeted marketing campaign towards Facebook fans. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to determine the predictive value of Facebook data for nonprofits in a real-life acquisition context.},

  abstract     = {Road signs, such as traffic signs, traffic lights or pavement markings, are essential elements for the regulation of driving. Sensors embedded in vehicles (e.g., cameras) are increasingly able to detect them to provide near real-time assistance to the driver, with features such as the current speed limitation at any moment. When sensors are not able to detect road signs (e.g., because of bad weather conditions or obstructions on the road), these features usually rely on in-vehicle digital map layers. However, in-vehicle digital maps are not often up-to-date because their update cycles from map providers are often lengthy (at the scale of several months). For example, a new speed limitation on a road can sometimes take months to be reflected in the vehicle&#39;s digital map. To solve this problem, a crowdsourced process that can be used to provide more regular in-vehicle digital map updates (on an hourly or daily basis, for example) is proposed. In this paper, we focus on a crucial step in this process that consists of tracking road sign infrastructure changes by incrementally consolidating crowdsourced cameras&#39; detections of road signs and computing the real positions of the signs, while removing noise due to the imprecision of GPS positions in addition to false positive and false negative detections. This goal is achieved by using non-supervised geospatial clustering techniques and Bayesian probabilities to compute existence probabilities for road signs over time. Overall, this computation is performed in a big data context while also addressing security, privacy, safety and scalability issues. As a proof of concept , two experiments are conducted with true field data and they clearly demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach. The method or the platform can be useful for many market players such as car manufacturers, map providers, or GPS providers (including navigation software providers) to provide more frequent map updates, to make connected driving easier and safer. It can also be useful for road infrastructure maintenance by helping to identify road signs that are poorly positioned or are not very visible.},

Research has shown the importance of the “peak-end” rule in service design; that is, providing a customer with good “ peak ” service levels and “ ending” the service experience with high quality can enhance customer satisfaction and build loyalty. However, previous studies have examined this phenomenon only in contexts with unidimensional service levels. We introduce peak cubes , which enable service designers and scholars to pinpoint prominent service levels in multidimensional service experience profiles—thereby extending current research on behavioral economics and service design to more general settings. Results indicate the potential of multidimensional peak-end models to better predict customer satisfaction in various service scenarios. Using Shapley values in coalitional game theory , the resulting models can also inform service designers about the quality dimensions that are critical from the perspective of multidimensional peak-end heuristic and customer satisfaction. Our research contributions and proposed methodology will enhance decision support systems with multidimensional capabilities and have applications to fields as diverse as service operations and healthcare.},

The literature notes that this process is rife with delays that can stunt the firm&#39;s business opportunities, but no modern analytical techniques have been developed to address the problem. In this paper, we suggest the use of text analytic and machine learning techniques to predict likely delays. In collaboration with a large national mortgage firm, we derive a large dataset of transcripts from employees&#39; communications pertaining to potential loans. We first use information retrieval to generate an initial list of “seed terms,” or terms most associated with loans that were delayed. We then use an array of machine learning approaches to generate predictive models based upon these seed terms. We find that these approaches are comparable in performance to less interpretable state-of-the-art approaches utilizing word embeddings . The resultant models offer interpretable and high-performing solutions to mitigate the risk of delays through early risk detection.},

To address this problem, we develop Deep Content-enriched Ideational Impact Classification (Deep-CENIC) as the first automated approach for ideational impact classification to support researchers&#39; literature search practices. We evaluate Deep-CENIC on 1256 papers citing 24 information systems review articles from the IT business value domain.

This study investigates the impact of consumer animosity, a determinant of consumers&#39; purchase decisions in international businesses, on outbound travelers&#39; demand for sharing-based accommodations. In particular, we examine the differential effects of two types of consumer animosity: economic animosity and war animosity. Utilizing a unique geopolitical environment where Chinese consumers bear economic animosity (towards South Korea) and war animosity (towards Japan), we collected a comprehensive panel data set including listings and reviews from Airbnb, together with a list of events inducing animosity. Utilizing the events as exogenous shocks, we applied difference-in-differences (DID) approach to infer the causal effect of consumer animosity on Chinese outbound travelers&#39; demand for sharing-based accommodations. Contrary to the extant studies which mostly show a negative effect of consumer animosity on purchase intentions, we find that consumer&#39;s economic animosity is likely to have a positive effect on outbound travelers&#39; decisions in the context of sharing-based accommodations. However, war animosity has limited effect on outbound travelers&#39; decisions. Further, such effects of consumer animosity are negatively moderated by the intensity level of events inducing animosity. As the intensity increases, both war animosity and economic animosity will ultimately have a negative effect on consumers&#39; Airbnb booking decisions. This study contributes to the fast-growing literature focusing on various factors affecting consumers&#39; booking decisions on online home-sharing platforms. Our results also provide important practical implications for online home-sharing platforms.},

Offline and online test results both confirmed the predictive capability and economic benefit of transactional data–based variables. However, incorporating those features in predictive models produces high dimensional problems, which deteriorates model interpretability and increases feature acquisition costs. Thus, we propose a two-stage multiobjective feature-selection method that optimizes the number of features as well as model classification performance. The results showed that the proposed model achieved similar classification performance while greatly reducing the cardinality of the feature subset. Finally, the feature importance evaluation for features in the optimal subset confirmed the importance of transactional data and payment network-based variables for bankruptcy prediction .},

We derive the equilibrium demands of two-sided markets for platforms and the equilibrium prices for two competing platforms. We further conduct a comparative analysis among scenarios with different combinations of homing and entry strategies. We find that early-entry platforms will preserve high margins in large early markets, where fierce price competition occurs once their rivals enter these markets. However, early entry is not always beneficial for platforms because the market-cannibalization effect emerges in the subsequent period. Furthermore, this effect will be amplified by the platforms&#39; homing and entry strategies.

  abstract     = {Crowdfunding was first used by individuals and entrepreneurs to collect small-sized investments from crowds to support for-profit ventures, but now it is being touted as a valuable alternative to raise money for non-profit causes. Similar to various online settings, a key challenge for online charitable crowdfunding platform is the problem of donor retention. In this research, we disentangle donor retention behavior and build up a structural model to jointly examine donors&#39; donation and latent attrition. By incorporating donation relationship and action related covariates into the model, we illustrate the drivers of donor retention and quantitatively examine their influence on individual donor&#39;s contribution and attrition activity. After calibrating the model with longitudinal donation transaction data from a leading charitable crowdfunding platform which enables teachers to request materials and resources for their classrooms, we find that (1) Teacher-donors (people who can be both donation makers and fundraisers) usually exhibit higher donation rate and lower attrition rate than normal donors on the platform; (2) Compared with site-donors (donors directly acquired through website visit), donors acquired through teacher referral usually have lower contribution and attrition rates; (3) The provided “ charity gift card ” and “ donation matching offer ” prosocial marketing programs on the platform seem to be a double-edged sword to donor retention. They have positive impact on donors&#39; contribution rate, at the same time, they significantly increase donors&#39; attrition rate; (4) Donors&#39; initial contribution amount to the platform, successful donation result and “ Thank-You ” feedback from fundraisers can significantly decrease their attrition rate. Our results provide insights on new donor acquisition and donor relationship management in online charitable crowdfunding market.},

  abstract     = {Mobile health applications are considered to be powerful tools for activity-based wellness management. With the availability of multimodal sensors in smart devices used in our daily lives, it is possible to track human activity and deliver context-aware wellness services. The embedded sensors in naturally used devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, and wearables contain rich information that can be integrated for human activity recognition . Our research demonstrates how powerful boosting algorithms can extract knowledge for human activity classification in a real-life setting. Our results show that boosting classifiers outperform traditional machine learning classifiers in the detection of basic human activities such as walking, standing, sitting, exercise, and sleeping. Further, we perform feature engineering to compare the potential of a smartphone and a smartwatch in activity detection. Our feature engineering strategy provides directions about the selection of sensor features for improvement in classification of basic human activities. The theoretical and practical implications of this research for activity-based wellness management are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Due to the increasing occurrence of disruptions across our global society, it has become critically important to understand the resilience of different socio-economic systems, i.e., to what extent those systems exhibit the ability both to resist a disruption and to recover from one once it occurs. In order to characterize this ability, however, one must be able to quantitatively measure the relative level of resilience that a given system displays in response to a disruptive event. Such a measurement should be easily understandable and straightforward to implement, but it should also utilize a consistent frame of reference so that one can properly compare the relative performance of different systems and assess the relative effectiveness of different resilience investments. With this in mind, this paper presents an improved approach for measuring system resilience that supports better decision making by providing both consistency and flexibility across different contexts. The theoretical basis for the approach is developed first, and then its advantages and limitations are illustrated in the context of several different practical examples.},
