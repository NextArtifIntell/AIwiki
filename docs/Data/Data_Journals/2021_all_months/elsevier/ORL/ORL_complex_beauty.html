The discounting condition β β&amp;lt;1 is replaced by ρ ( B ) ρ(B)&amp;lt;1 , where B is an appropriate nonnegative matrix and ρ denotes the spectral radius .

It has been shown that the fully online version is harder than the classic version for which the achievable competitive ratio is at most 0.6317, rather than precisely 1 − 1 e ≈ 0.6321 1−1e≈0.6321 . We introduce two new ideas to the construction. By optimizing the parameters of the modified construction numerically, we obtain an improved impossibility result of 0.6297.

When extra constraints such as the long-only constraints are added, MVP in general does not admit an analytical formula anymore. An exceptional case is when the single-factor model holds among the securities considered. It is known that there exists a semi-closed form formula , which relies on an unknown quantity called the long-only beta threshold ( β L βL ). This note conducts a detailed study of β L βL and establishes its optimality property that it is the smallest among all possible thresholds. We also develop a simple bisection method for computing β L βL . Finally we include a mathematical proof for this semi-closed form formula . The results reported provide a deep understanding how the long-only MVP are constructed.},

They were able to obtain a constant factor approximation for this problem for most center based k -clustering objectives such as k -median, k -means, and k -center. Despite considerable interest in extending this problem for multiple protected attributes (e.g. women and men, with or without citizenship), so far constant factor approximations for these problems have remained elusive except in special cases.

For redundancies with SAI lifetimes, allocating a more reliable redundancy to a weaker and more heavily weighted component is found to produce a more reliable system in the sense of having higher reliability. Also, in the context of redundancies with identically distributed lifetimes, we show that allocating more redundancies to a weaker and more heavily weighted component produces a more reliable system.

It is well-known that the celebrated Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm can achieve tight regret bound for MAB under sub-Gaussian rewards. There has been subsequent work by Bubeck et al. (2013) [4] extending this tightness result to any reward distributions with finite variance by leveraging robust mean estimators. In this paper, we present three alternative UCB based algorithms, termed UCB-Rad, UCB-Warm, and UCB-Hybrid, specifically for MAB with sub-exponential rewards. While not being the first to achieve tight regret bounds, these algorithms are conceptually simpler and provide a more explicit analysis for this problem. Moreover, we present a rental bike revenue management application and conduct numerical experiments. We find that UCB-Warm and UCB-Hybrid outperform UCB-Rad in our computational experiments.},

The methodology adjusts the agent&#39;s weights based on the Sinkhorn-Knopp matrix scaling algorithm.

The corresponding Constraints-Aware RWP is experimentally tested on two sets of hard pure binary feasibility problems, and the results show that, all other things being equal, the modification leads to a more effective and robust method w.r.t. the original RFP one.},

However, if the servers are heterogeneous, throughput optimality does not hold in general. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for throughput optimality of power-of- d choices when the servers are heterogeneous, and we prove that almost the same conditions are sufficient to show heavy-traffic optimality. Additionally, we generalize the sufficient condition for throughput optimality to a larger class of routing policies.},

To achieve this, we provide a market-based allocation framework and derive payments with desirable properties . The proposed min-max least core selecting payments achieve individual rationality, budget balance, and approximate incentive compatibility and coalitional stability. The results extend the works on private discrete items to a network of continuous public choices.},

The null player property and the nullifying player property assign zero payoff to each null player and each nullifying player, respectively. It is known that if the null player property for characterizing the Shapley value is replaced by the nullifying player property, then the egalitarian value is determined uniquely. We propose several properties to replace the nullifying player property to characterize the egalitarian value. Roughly speaking, the results in this note hint that equal division for players of certain types may lead to the egalitarian allocation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we introduce the Matroid Cup Game . This cup game generalizes the One- and p -Cup Games. We show that a natural greedy strategy maintains max fill O ( log ⁡ n ) O(log⁡n) in the Matroid Cup Game with mild resource augmentation. Further, we introduce a new objective for cup game: the total water , which is the amount of water across all cups. We develop a novel Emptier strategy that maintain O ( r n ) O(rn) total water without resource augmentation . We also reveal a novel relationship between max fill and total water, which leads to an intuitive analysis of the max fill bounds in the One- and p -Cup Games.},

Also, there are r = O ( 1 ) r=O(1) budget constraints with edge costs chosen from the same distribution. We use Lagrangean duality to construct polynomial time algorithms that produce asymptotically optimal solutions.

The high price of energy storage calls for a shared storage system, but careful battery management is required so that the battery is operated in a manner that is fair to all and as efficiently as possible. In this paper, we study the tradeoffs between efficiency and fairness in operating a shared battery. We develop a framework based on constrained Markov decision processes to study both regimes, namely, optimizing efficiency under a hard fairness constraint and optimizing fairness under hard efficiency constraint. Our results show that there are fundamental limits to efficiency under fairness and vice-versa, and, in general, the two cannot be achieved simultaneously. We characterize these fundamental limits via absolute bounds on these quantities, and via the notion of price of fairness that we introduce in this paper.},

When the operator has no fixed points, the algorithm’s iterates diverge, but the difference between consecutive iterates converges to the so-called minimal displacement vector, which can be used to certify infeasibility of an optimization problem. In this paper, we establish new properties of the minimal displacement vector, which allow us to generalize some existing results.},

  abstract     = {We consider nonzero-sum games for continuous-time jump processes with unbounded transition rates under expected average payoff criterion. The state and action spaces are Borel spaces and reward rates are unbounded. We introduce an approximating sequence of stochastic game models with extended state space, for which the uniform exponential ergodicity is obtained. Moreover, we prove the existence of a stationary almost Markov Nash equilibrium by introducing auxiliary static game models. Finally, a cash flow model is employed to illustrate the results.},
