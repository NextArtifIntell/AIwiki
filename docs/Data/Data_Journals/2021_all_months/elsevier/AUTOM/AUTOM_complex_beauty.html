The distributed detector is able to update three sets of vehicle sensors: the ones surely under attack, surely attack-free, and suspected to be under attack. The adaptive observer saturates the measurement innovation through a preset static or time-varying threshold, such that the potentially compromised measurements have limited influence on the estimation. Essential properties of the proposed architecture include: (1) The detector is fault-free, and the attacked and attack-free vehicle sensors can be identified in finite time; (2) The observer guarantees both real-time error bounds and asymptotic error bounds, with tighter bounds when more attacked or attack-free vehicle sensors are identified by the detector; (3) The distributed controller ensures closed-loop stability. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is evaluated through simulations by an application to vehicle platooning.},

We study how known pathologies of gradient descent flows in Euclidean spaces carry over to consensus seeking systems that evolve on nonlinear manifolds. In particular, we show that the norms of agent states can diverge to infinity, but this will not happen if the manifold is the boundary of a convex set. Moreover, the system can be initialized arbitrarily close to consensus without converging to it, but this will not happen if the manifold is analytic. For analytic manifolds, consensus is asymptotically stable.

The aim is to control this team so as to minimize a measure of overall node state uncertainty evaluated over a finite time interval. A class of distributed threshold-based parametric controllers has been proposed in prior work to control agent dwell times at nodes and next-node destinations by enforcing thresholds on the respective node states. Under such a Threshold Control Policy (TCP), an on-line gradient technique was used to determine optimal threshold values. However, due to the non-convexity of the problem, this approach often leads to a poor local optima highly dependent on the initial thresholds used. To overcome this initialization challenge, we develop a computationally efficient off-line greedy technique based on the asymptotic analysis of the network system. This analysis is then used to generate a high-performing set of initial thresholds. Extensive numerical results show that such initial thresholds are almost immediately (locally) optimal or quickly lead to optimal values. In all cases, they perform significantly better than the locally optimal solutions known to date.},

By analyzing the relation between the transmitted nodes number and the packet loss probability, the standard round-robin protocol (RRP) is extended to the multi-node case. Firstly, the multi-node RRP (MN-RRP) is designed under Bernoulli lossy network. After marking the first access node as the token, we construct the token-dependent SMC law to ensure the stability of the closed-loop system and the reachability of the specified sliding surface. Furthermore, we design the network mode-dependent round-robin-like protocol (NMD-RRLP) under Markov lossy network, in which more sensor nodes will be selected under the good network condition, vise versa. Finally, the proposed static output-feedback SMC approach is applied to the RLC circuit system.},

The approach taken is geometric and gives insights for the behaviors of controlled trajectories as well as links between the turnpike property and stability and/or stabilizability in nonlinear control theory. It also allows us to find simpler proofs for existing results on the turnpike properties. Attempts to remove smallness restrictions for initial and target states are also discussed based on the geometry of (un)stable manifolds and a recent result on exponential stabilizability of nonlinear control systems obtained by one of the authors.},

With this new pattern, the agent circumnavigates the convex hull of multiple stationary targets with an expected enclosing distance and speed using the agent’s known position as well as the bearing-only information of the targets, in addition, no collision with this convex hull happens in the whole time domain. An algorithm containing scalar estimators and a control protocol is proposed to implement this pattern. The estimators are designed to locate the targets. In the control protocol, the velocity of the agent is decomposed to one directly pointing to the convex hull and one orthogonal to its current direction. The agent is forced to circumnavigate the convex hull of the targets’ estimated positions and finally circumnavigate the convex hull of the real targets because the estimators converge to the exact positions of the targets. The corresponding convergence analysis is provided subsequently. Numerical simulation and real time experiment are conducted to verify the proposed method.},

The transmission of the measurements is jointly determined by a stochastic event-triggering condition and a Gilbert–Elliott communication channel. Firstly, the event-triggered risk-sensitive smoothed estimate is characterized by constructing an augmented processing of the smoothed information state, which is given by the product of the forward recursive information state and the backward recursive information state under a reference measure. Secondly, the risk-neutral smoothed estimate (namely, the MMSE smoother) is proved to be a special case of the obtained risk-sensitive one when the risk-sensitive parameter approaches zero. The implementation issues of the obtained results are discussed by introducing an alternative smoothing algorithm that is numerically equivalent to the original algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed results is evaluated through a numerical example and comparative simulations with a naive risk-sensitive smoother that treats unreceived information as packet dropout.},

The second part is the looped-functionals-like functional for exploiting the internal structure inside impulse intervals, in which the decision matrix functions are approximated by piecewise linear matrix functions. The third part is a discretized adjustive factor, which makes the proposed Lyapunov functional continuous along the system trajectories. Thanks to this continuity, the resultant criteria for exponential stability and finite hybrid L 2 × l 2 -gain are expressed in terms of a combination of the continuous and discrete parts of the system. It is shown through numerical examples that the accuracy of the stability test increases with the increase of the partition number on impulse intervals, and the convergence rate is faster than that of the previous discretized functionals-based approach.},

In this paper, we investigate the (possible) variation in this index as a consequence of variation in the system parameters. To this end, we adopt a structured systems approach, typically represented by a directed graph, with the edges of the said graph being in one-to-one correspondence with the system parameters. We first show that the security index is generic. That is, for almost all choices of edge weights, the security index of a component remains the same. We refer to such an index as the generic security index. Secondly, we derive graph-theoretic conditions (and based on those an algorithm) for computing the generic security index. Third, we provide graph-theoretic conditions for computing lower (resp. upper) bounds on the values that the security index of a component can take for all nonzero choices of the edge weights of the directed graph. Finally, we provide a brute force search method for calculating the said bounds.},

The roaming agent is not directly controlled by the influencing agent, but instead moves based on some uncertain interaction dynamic. To overcome this challenge, a virtual controller is designed to yield a desired influence on the roaming agent. In addition, an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) strategy is used to develop an approximate optimal solution to the optimal control problem using a computationally efficient function approximation method. Because system uncertainties are considered in both agents, a data-based parameter identification method called integral concurrent learning (ICL) is used to identify uncertain dynamics.

  abstract     = {We study stability of multivariable control-affine nonlinear systems under sparsification of feedback controllers. Given a stabilizing feedback, sparsification in our context refers to the scheduling of the individual control inputs one at a time in rapid periodic sweeps over the set of control inputs, which corresponds to round-robin scheduling. We prove that if a locally asymptotically stabilizing feedback controller is sparsified via the round-robin scheme and each control action is scaled appropriately, then the corresponding equilibrium of the resulting system is stabilized when the scheduling is sufficiently fast; under mild additional conditions, local asymptotic stabilization of the corresponding equilibrium can also be guaranteed. Moreover, the basin of attraction for the equilibrium of scheduled system also remains the same as the original system under sufficiently fast switching Our technical tools are derived from optimal control theory, and our results also contribute to the literature on the stability of switched systems in the fast switching regime. Illustrative numerical examples depicting several subtle features of our results are included.},

Such reachability bounds are important in set-based state estimation, fault detection, robust control, etc. Interval reachability methods based on differential inequalities (DI) are desirable in these applications due to their high efficiency, but they often produce extremely conservative bounds. Here, we extend the DI approach to compute tighter enclosures using the mean value form , which is widely used to mitigate the conservatism of interval methods in non-dynamic settings. We present a general mean-value DI bounding theorem along with an efficient algorithmic implementation. We also prove that the overestimation error of mean-value DI converges to zero quadratically as the uncertainty set diminishes, rather than linearly as for interval DI methods, which is important for algorithms based on uncertainty set partitioning. Finally, we present numerical results for two challenging test problems.},

  abstract     = {Many techniques for verifying properties of continuous-time systems are limited to systems of moderate size. In this paper, we propose an approach based on assume-guarantee contracts and compositional reasoning for verifying properties of a broad class of continuous-time systems consisting of interconnected components. The notion of assume-guarantee contracts makes it possible to divide responsibilities among the system components: a contract specifies the property that a component must fulfill under some assumptions on the behavior of its environment (i.e. of the other components). We define weak and strong semantics of assume-guarantee contracts. We then establish a certain number of results for compositional reasoning, which allow us to show that a global assume-guarantee contract of the whole system is satisfied when all components satisfy their own contracts. We show that the weak satisfaction of the contract is sufficient to deal with interconnections described by a directed acyclic graph, while strong satisfaction is needed to reason about general interconnections containing cycles. Specific results for systems described by differential inclusions and invariance assume-guarantee contracts are then developed. Finally, we show how the proposed assume-guarantee framework can recast different versions of the small-gain theorem as a particular case. Throughout the paper, the main results are illustrated using simple examples.},

We establish several relations between these properties, which culminate in a set of equivalence conditions. Moreover, we investigate convergence and stability of the infinite-horizon optimal adjoint trajectories. The workhorse for our investigations is a notion of strict dissipativity in OCPs, which has been coined in the context of economic model predictive control. With respect to the link between stability and dissipativity, the present paper can be seen as an extension of the seminal work on least squares optimal control by Jan C. Willems (1971). Furthermore, we show that strict dissipativity provides a conclusive answer to the question of adjoint transversality conditions in infinite-horizon optimal control which has been raised by Hubert Halkin (1974). Put differently, we establish conditions under which the adjoints converge to their optimal steady-state value. We draw upon several examples to illustrate our findings. Moreover, we discuss the relation of our findings to results available in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Sensor and actuator selection problems (SASPs) are some of the core problems in dynamic systems design and control. These problems correspond to determining the optimal selection of sensors (measurements) or actuators (control nodes) such that certain estimation/control objectives can be achieved. While the literature on SASPs are indeed inveterate, the vast majority of the work focuses on linear(ized) representation of the network dynamics, resulting in the placements of sensors or actuators (SAs) that are valid for confined operating regions. As an alternative, herein we propose a new general framework for addressing SASPs in nonlinear dynamic systems (NDSs), assuming that the inputs and outputs are linearly coupled with the nonlinear dynamics. This is investigated through (i) classifying and parameterizing the NDSs into various nonlinear function sets, (ii) utilizing rich Lyapunov theoretic formulations, and (iii) designing a new customized branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm that exploits problem structure of the SASPs. The newly designed BnB routines are computationally more attractive than the standard one and also directly applicable to solve SASPs for linear systems. In contrast with contemporary approaches from the literature, our approach is suitable for finding the optimal SAs combination for stable/unstable NDSs that ensures stabilization of estimation error and closed-loop dynamics through a simple linear feedback control policy.},

Given a specification expressed as a regular language defined over an alphabet consisting of a finite set of states of the plant, a controller based on the finite set of experiments is designed, which guarantees that the specification is met up to an arbitrarily small error. Maximality, convergence and adaptivity of the controller as the set of experiments gets bigger are discussed.

Mathematically, the governing equation of the process is a nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation with a nonlinearity arising from the nonlocal propagation speed and the positivity state constraint. The nonlinearity makes highly non-trivial the proof of well-posedness of the closed-loop system under ETC, and the design of the triggering mechanism requires novelty because standard triggering schemes proposed in the literature of linear PDEs do not work. The designed controller can potentially operate in networked control systems subject to limited information sharing resources. A Lyapunov argument is utilized to derive the boundary controller together with a feasible event generator that avoids the occurrence of Zeno behavior for the closed-loop system. The global stability estimate is established using the logarithmic norm of the state due to the system’s nonlinearity and positivity of the density. Furthermore, robustness of the proposed controller with respect to the sampling schedule and sampled-data stabilization results are established.

Under the assumption of Lipschitz continuity of the solution, we explicitly construct a Lyapunov function for the combined system-optimizer dynamics, which shows that asymptotic stability can be obtained if the sampling time is sufficiently short. The results constitute an extension to existing attractivity results which hold in the simplified setting where inequality constraints are either not present or inactive in the region of attraction considered. Moreover, with respect to the established results on robust asymptotic stability of suboptimal model predictive control, we develop a framework that takes into account the optimizer’s dynamics and does not require decrease of the objective function across iterates.

The method is based on a hierarchy of semidefinite programming problems of increasing size with guaranteed convergence to the global attractor. The approach taken follows an established line of reasoning, where we first characterize the global attractor via an infinite dimensional linear programming problem (LP) in the space of Borel measures. The dual to this LP is in the space of continuous functions and its feasible solutions provide guaranteed outer approximations to the global attractor. For systems with polynomial dynamics, a hierarchy of finite-dimensional sum-of-squares tightenings of the dual LP provides a sequence of outer approximations to the global attractor with guaranteed convergence in the sense of volume discrepancy tending to zero. The method is very simple to use and based purely on convex optimization. Numerical examples with the code available online demonstrate the method.},

  abstract     = {It is well-known that terminal state constraints play an instrumental role in ensuring the feasibility and stability of the nonlinear model predictive control (MPC). Yet, they inherently and largely limit the size of the feasible region and restrict the use of MPC to practical applications. In this paper, a terminal cost characterized by an implicit sliding mode control (SMC) law is proposed for developing a stabilizing constrained MPC scheme. This SMC law developed for the linearized model helps compensate the model mismatch between the linearization and the original nonlinear system model. Thanks to it, the proposed MPC strategy can stabilize the constrained nonlinear system of which the corresponding linearization around the equilibrium is non-stabilizable. Moreover, by appropriately tuning the sliding mode parameters, the conventional terminal constraints and large prediction horizon typically used in the literature are no longer required. We establish the conditions of ensuring the recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, numerical comparison results on two examples of dynamic systems are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed strategy.},

By assuming the ground-truth function belongs to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the chosen kernel, and the measurement noise affecting the dataset is bounded, we adopt an approximation theory viewpoint to establish deterministic , finite-sample error bounds for the two models. Finally, we discuss their connection with Gaussian processes and two numerical examples are provided.

The communication among agents is described by a time-varying directed/undirected graph. The approach is based on the well-known Internal Model Principle which uses a specific class of unstable reference systems. One contribution of this work is the characterization of the maximal constraint admissible invariant set (MCAI) for the combined agent-reference system. Typically, MCAI sets do not exist for unstable systems. This work shows that for an important class of agent-reference systems that are unstable, MCAI exist and can be computed. This MCAI set is used in a novel Reference Governor, combined with a projected consensus algorithm, to achieve output consensus of all agents while satisfying constraints of each. An example is provided to illustrate the approach.},

Different from the traditional finite-time control methods with constant gains, an improved finite-time controller with state-dependent gains is designed. The main challenges lie in the finite-time stability analysis of the resultant closed-loop system caused by state-dependent control gains and how to make the system states keep in the constrained region. Based on the homogeneous system theory, the finite-time stability of the closed-loop system under state constraints is proved. In addition to the finite-time convergence, it is also shown that the states of the system always are kept in the constrained region. Finally, the developed finite-time controller is applied to buck converter and the validity of the proposed method is verified through a DC–DC buck converter under voltage and current constraints.},

Furthermore, since the difficulty in acquiring the accurate transition rates in practical applications, the SMJS is considered with generally uncertain transition rates. By adopting an appropriate looped functional, the sampled-data controller is designed to stabilize the SMJS even with incomplete transition rate information.

We propose two new approaches for teleoperators: a composite approach and a direct approach, and both the approaches are shown to be capable of guaranteeing the stability and infinite manipulability of teleoperators with degree one independent of the time-varying delay. The distinctive point lies in the introduction of a direct channel between the external input sources (from either the human operator or environment) and consensus equilibrium increment of the teleoperator, guided by the design paradigm for ensuring the infinite manipulability. It is demonstrated that the composite approach improves the performance of the teleoperator, and that the direct approach yields separation between the controlled dynamics of the teleoperator and the objective of achieving synchronization and infinite manipulability of the teleoperator. We also propose a hybrid bilateral controller for a typical application context. The application scenarios of the proposed approaches are further demonstrated by extensive simulation results.},

Examples include design optimization via experiments, or via costly finite elements simulations. To solve these problems, global optimization routines are used. These iterative techniques must trade-off exploitation close to the current best point with exploration of unseen regions of the search space. In this respect, a new global optimization strategy based on a Set Membership (SM) framework is proposed. Assuming Lipschitz continuity of the cost function, the approach employs SM concepts to decide whether to switch from an exploitation mode to an exploration one, and vice-versa. The resulting algorithm, named SMGO (Set Membership Global Optimization) is presented. Theoretical properties regarding convergence and computational complexity are derived, and implementation aspects are discussed. Finally, the SMGO performance is evaluated on a set of benchmark non-convex problems and compared with those of other global optimization approaches.},

Four variants of D-detectability were defined: strong (periodic) D-detectability and weak (periodic) D-detectability. Deciding weak (periodic) D-detectability is PSpace -complete, while deciding strong (periodic) detectability or strong D-detectability is polynomial, and we show that it is NL -complete. To the best of our knowledge, it is an open problem whether there exists a polynomial-time algorithm deciding strong periodic D-detectability. We show that deciding strong periodic D-detectability is a PSpace -complete problem, which means that there is no polynomial-time algorithm, unless every problem solvable in polynomial space can be solved in polynomial time.

A time-scale approach is suggested to cope with underactuated mechanical systems to overcome lack of the number of inputs. A newly developed dynamic inversion with projection is used to deal with nonaffine control inputs to increase the region of attraction as compared to linearized inputs, i.e., an affine control input form and to deal with actuator’s constraints and peaking in estimates from an Extended High-Gain Observer. The Extended High-Gain Observer is employed to quickly estimate model uncertainties and external disturbances. The singular perturbation method is used to analyze the stability of the closed-loop system in a multi-time scale structure.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a two-stage algorithm utilizing the Cauchy integral and the matrix-valued adaptive Fourier decomposition (abbreviated as matrix AFD) to identify transfer functions of linear time-invariant (LTI) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems in the continuous time case. In recent work of Alpay et al. (2017), a theory of adaptive rational approximation to matrix-valued Hardy space functions on the unit disk was established. The matrix-valued function theory has great potential in applications, in views of the practice of its scalar-valued counterparts. The algorithm and application aspects of the mentioned theory of Alpay et al. (2017) have not been developed. The theory was only written for the unit disk case corresponding to the discrete time systems. The contributions of the present paper are 3-fold. First, we construct an analogous adaptive approximation theory for complex matrix-valued Hardy space functions defined on a half of the complex plane, corresponding to the Laplace transforms of signals of finite energy whose Fourier transforms are supported on a half of the frequency domain. The half plane model corresponds to signals defined in the whole axis range which is an alternative case to signals defined in a compact interval. The second fold contribution lays on maximal selection of the pair ( a , P ) where a is a point of the right-half plane and P is an orthogonal projection. We show that the optimal selection of P is dependent on a when a is first fixed, that is P = P ( a ) , where P : a → P ( a ) has an explicit corresponding relation. Due to this relation we reduce the maximal selection of the pair ( a , P ) to only that of the parameter a . This result can be extended to the compact intervals case as well. The third fold is, with the precise rule from a to P ( a ) , we develop a practical algorithm for the adaptive approximation to the transfer function. Through an example we show that the proposed algorithm is effective in both the noise-free and noisy cases.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the problem of output regulation in heterogeneous networked systems. In order to cooperatively achieve the global objective, each agent is required to share information in its neighborhood through communication channels, which might be exposed to malicious cyber attacks. Past work shows that the performance of cooperative control can be seriously affected by network misbehaviors. Inspired by such security concerns, this paper considers the resilient cooperative output regulation (COR) in adversarial environment. Despite the presence of so-called Byzantine agents, the normally behaving ones still aim to achieve the goal of trajectory tracking or disturbance rejection. Towards this end, resilient observers with low computational cost are first developed based on a continuous-time resilient consensus protocol. When the number of Byzantine nodes is locally upper bounded and the network structure satisfies certain robustness properties, the designed observers enable each benign agent to exponentially track the exogenous signal. After that, decentralized controllers are proposed facilitating the achievement of resilient COR in the heterogeneous networks. A numerical example is finally given to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Due to its potential applications in robotics and navigation, recent years have witnessed some progress in Kalman filter (KF) with norm constraints on the state. A noticeable discovery of the existing literature is that the KF gain has an analytical expression, and the brute-force normalization (i.e., estimation without considering the norm constraints, followed by a normalization operation) is optimal in the mean-square sense. Although there are some extensions of the former works to situations with uncertainties, existing results are only limited to cases where models/bounds or statistical properties of the disturbances are known. The paper considers the design of KF for systems subject to norm constraints on the state and unknown inputs, whose models or statistical properties are not assumed to be available. Both cases with and without direct feedthrough will be discussed. For systems without direct feedthrough, we show that the KF gain can be derived explicitly and the brute-force normalization is optimal in the mean-square sense, thereby generalizing the above-mentioned works on norm-constrained KF. However, for the case with direct feedthrough, the KF gain does not seem to admit an analytical solution, as to be shown via a counterexample.},

A partially manipulated attack can inject data to replace the measurements from an infected sensor. While, a fully manipulated attack can totally control the infected sensor including its computation and transmission. Moreover, an attack on sensor is called stealthy if it produces bounded changes in the detection residue. We will study both the impacts of partially and fully manipulated stealthy attacks on the distributed state estimator. Correspondingly, a distributed state estimation system is called vulnerable if one of its local estimate can be destabilized by a stealthy attack. Considering both static and dynamic systems, we will provide four necessary and sufficient conditions for the vulnerability of static/dynamic system under partially/fully manipulated stealthy attacks.

Such WHRT constraints are window-based guarantees like for example, that the feedback loop is at least closed for n times in each window of m sampling times. WHRT constraints can, e.g., describe the packet loss properties of a communication network. We consider two different actuation strategies to deal with failures in the feedback loop: holding the last received input or setting the input to zero if no new input arrives. We present stability analysis procedures for both strategies. The procedures are based on the emulation of a sampled-data controller from continuous-time feedback. For the hold strategy, we use a graph description for the WHRT constraints and a modified version of the Viterbi algorithm to bound a Lyapunov function candidate. For the zero strategy, we employ a bound on the evolution of the Lyapunov function candidate for zero input. For both strategies, efficient stability analysis procedures based on non-monotonic Lyapunov functions are derived. In addition, we demonstrate how switched controllers, that switch depending on the past dropout sequence, can be used for the hold strategy. Such switched controllers can significantly increase the maximum allowable sampling period for the hold strategy. The proposed approaches are illustrated with a numerical example.},

A binary encoding scheme (BES) is employed during the data transmission, and only a finite-length binary bit string is transmitted due primarily to the limited network bandwidth in practice. Meanwhile, the binary bit string, transmitted via memoryless binary symmetric channels, might suffer from random bit errors with a certain probability. The purpose of this paper is to derive some consensusability conditions, under which there must exist a distributed controller such that the mean-square bounded consensus is achieved by the considered DT-MASs with BESs subject to random bit errors. To this end, the statistical properties are first revealed for the BES-induced quantization errors and the random bit errors. Then, by resorting to the solvability analysis of a modified Riccati inequality, some sufficient conditions are, respectively, derived to ensure the mean-square bounded consensus under the undirected communication topology in two scenarios: (1) identical bit-error rates (BERs); and (2) non-identical BERs. In particular, a necessary and sufficient condition is established for a single input case with identical BERs. Furthermore, the ultimate upper bound of the consensus errors in the mean-square sense is established to examine the effects of the length of bit string and the BERs. Finally, an illustrative simulation example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

The framework simultaneously seeks optimal control of the DPS and optimal guidance of the mobile actuators such that a cost function associated with both the DPS and the mobile actuators is minimized subject to the dynamics of each. The cost incurred from controlling the DPS is linear–quadratic, which is transformed into an equivalent form as a quadratic term associated with an operator-valued Riccati equation. This equivalent form reduces the problem to seeking only for guidance because the optimal control can be recovered once the optimal guidance is obtained. We establish conditions for the existence of a solution to the proposed problem. Since computing an optimal solution requires approximation, we also establish the conditions for convergence to the exact optimal solution of the approximate optimal solution. That is, when evaluating these two solutions by the original cost function, the difference becomes arbitrarily small as the approximation gets finer. Two numerical examples demonstrate the performance of the optimal control and guidance obtained from the proposed approach.},

It is shown that the regularized version of the SG algorithm can be successfully applied to identification of time-varying finite impulse response (FIR) systems. Such a solution is possible owing to the recently proposed preestimation technique, which converts the problem of identification of a time-varying FIR system into the problem of smoothing of the appropriately generated preestimates of system parameters. The resulting fast regularized local basis function estimators, optimized using the empirical Bayes approach, have very good parameter tracking capabilities, favorably comparing with the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy, computational complexity and numerical robustness.},

The event frequency can be greatly reduced without appreciable loss of consensusability compared with the case of conventional static event-triggered controllers. Each event occurs with appropriate timing because we use dynamically varying thresholds for event triggering. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulation.

  abstract     = {In offshore Oil and Gas production, it is important to ensure the quality of discharge water meets government regulations; the de-oiling hydrocyclone system is important for this kind of water treatment. Hydrocyclone’s de-oiling performance is very sensitive to the inflow variation, which is often introduced by the upstream three-phase separator’s operation. Thereby, the coordination control of both the separator and hydrocyclone turns to be crucial. Many model-based control methods can be employed for handling this coordination if mathematical models of the considered systems are developed. However, to develop models of these interacted systems is far more than trivial, with respect to the situation that each offshore de-oiling installation at different fields is a kind of tailor-made solution. Thereby, instead of using conventional model-based control design methods, this paper investigates the reinforcement-learning-based H ∞ control method for synthesizing an advanced model-free control solution for the coordination control of the separator’s (water) level and hydrocyclone’s Pressure-Drop-Ratio (PDR). The H ∞ tracking control is formulated as a 2-player zero-sum differential game and derived by employing an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm based on state feedback and output feedback, respectively. Stability and optimality of the proposed solution are analyzed. Finally, simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.},

However, the exact computation of the mRPI set is generally intractable. This paper proposes a novel ℋ ∞ -type RMPC approach for linear systems with additive disturbances. This approach enables users to compute an ellipsoidal RPI set that approximates the minimal one in online implementations. Considering that a bilinear matrix inequality is involved in the problem formulation, an alternating optimization method is proposed in this work to ensure that the optimization problem to be solved online is always convex. Furthermore, a novel dual-mode control strategy is introduced that consists of two modes, i.e., with, and without alternating optimizations. The “classic mode” achieves fast convergence of the control algorithm, while the “alternating mode” can precisely approximate the mRPI set. None of the proposed approaches requires any off-line design, which makes practical applications more convenient. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {We develop a new adaptive gain-scheduling control scheme for continuous-time linear systems with polytopic uncertainties. The gain-scheduled control law is proposed as a convex sum of a fixed set of controller gains, exploiting the polytopic representation of the system uncertainty, which is not possible with classical robust control results in the literature. To realize this scheme, an adaptation law is proposed to adaptively provide the tuning parameter for the gain-scheduling implementation. The admissible domain of the stabilizing control feedback gains, defined by the fixed set of controller gains, can be determined offline by solving a set of linear matrix inequality constraints over a scalar line search. Using Lyapunov-based arguments, the proposed design conditions and the adaptation law ensure that all closed-loop signals are bounded. In particular, if the uncertain parameters are not time-varying, then the system states asymptotically converge to the origin. Theoretical arguments and appropriate numerical illustrations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

Conducted simulations show properties of a set of the analogue filters with different values of p in the range of 1 to 2, covering step, ramp, and sinusoidal responses, as well as the ability to attenuate random noises, including stable distributions. The results prove that the elaborated filters achieve steady states faster than the typical low-pass filter and are particularly useful in the suppression of impulses. This property makes it possible that such a filter is perfectly adequate as an input filter of measurement transducers.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an optimal autonomous search framework, namely Dual Control for Exploration and Exploitation (DCEE), for a target at an unknown location in an unknown environment. Source localisation is to find sources of atmospheric hazardous material release in an unknown environment. This paper proposes a control theoretic approach to this autonomous search problem. To cope with an unknown target location, at each step, the target location is estimated by Bayesian inference. Then a control action is taken to minimise the error between future robot position and the predicted future estimation of the target location. The latter is generated by hypothesised measurements at the corresponding future robot positions (due to the control action) with the current estimation of the target location as a prior. It shows that DCEE can take into account both the error between the next robot position and the estimated target location, and the uncertainty of the estimate. This approach is further extended to deal with both an unknown source location and unknown local environment (e.g. wind speed and direction). Different from current information theoretic approaches, this new control theoretic approach achieves the optimal trade-off between exploitation and exploration in an unknown environment with an unknown target by driving the robot moving towards estimated target location while reducing its estimation uncertainty. Simulation and experimental studies demonstrate promising performance of the proposed approach. The relationships between the proposed approach, informative path planning, dual control, and classic model predictive control are discussed and compared. This work opens a door for developing control systems operating in unknown environments, or performing tasks with unknown parameters.},

Hereby, the state is the population density and the input is the restricted dilution rate. Through an appropriate choice of the steady-state input a generalized spectral analysis is carried out. By using this result and a nonlinear mapping the partial differential equation is split into an input/output-normal form and an integral delay equation. Due to the global exponential stability of the integral delay equation, a feedforward controller is designed for the input/output-normal form. This is complemented with a feedback controller to compensate the influence of the integral delay equation on the output. The global exponential attractivity of reference trajectories meeting certain requirements is proven.

The thermal state observer design exploits PDE backstepping method, with a mild assumption on the Lipschitz continuity of the nonlinear heat generation rate. A sufficient condition on the Lipschitz constant to achieve exponential convergence is derived. Furthermore, when the thermal system uncertainties are present, an analytic bound on the temperature estimation error is formulated in the sense of spatial L 2 norm, in terms of Lipschitz constant, design parameters, and bounds on system uncertainties. Simulation studies on various practical current profiles are demonstrated to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed thermal estimation framework on a commercial cylindrical Li-ion battery cell.},

Based on the single exponential smoothing method, the prediction of the missing measurement is used as the packet loss compensation when a packet is lost. Then, a partially mode-dependent filter is established in view of the fact that the mode signals of the original system may not be completely accessible to the filter. By employing a mode-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, some novel sufficient conditions are obtained and the filter parameters are derived to ensure that the filtering error system is stochastically stable with a strictly ( U , V , W )- γ -dissipative performance.

We translate the argument of energy shaping to discrete time by using the symplectic implicit midpoint rule. The method is motivated by recent results for linear systems, where feedback imposes closed-loop behavior that exactly represents the symplectic discretization of a desired target system. For the nonlinear case, the sampled system and the target dynamics are approximated with second order accuracy using the implicit midpoint rule. The implicit nature of the resulting state feedback requires the numerical solution of an in general nonlinear system of algebraic equations in every sampling interval. For an implementation with pure position feedback, the velocities/momenta have to be approximated in the sampling instants, which gives a clear interpretation of our approach in terms of the Störmer–Verlet integration scheme on a staggered grid. Both the Hamiltonian and the Lagrangian perspective are adopted. We present discrete-time versions of impedance or energy shaping plus damping injection control as well as computed torque tracking control in the simulation examples to illustrate the performance and stability gain compared to the quasi-continuous implementation. We discuss computational aspects and show the structural advantages of the implicit midpoint rule compared to other integration schemes in the appendix.},

Specifically, a decentralized triggering condition is adopted in this paper such that continuous monitoring of neighboring states, as required in some existing results, can be avoided. Besides, to handle the non-differentiability problem of virtual controllers, which arises from the utilization of neighboring states collected only at the triggering instants, the virtual controllers in each recursive step are firstly designed with continuous communication. Then, the partial derivatives of these designed virtual controllers are adopted to construct distributed adaptive consensus controllers for the event based communication case. It is shown that with the presented distributed adaptive consensus control scheme and even-triggered communication mechanism, all the closed-loop signals are uniformly bounded and the output consensus tracking errors will converge to a compact set. Besides, the tracking performance in the mean square sense can be improved by appropriately adjusting design parameters.},

As a result, it is shown that in competitive games , namely games in which the players influence the shared state via linearly independent input channels, the characterization of Nash equilibrium strategies hinges upon the solution to a single (regardless of the number of players), sign-definite Riccati equation, with coefficients described by polynomial functions of the feedback gains. The structure of the latter equation is computationally appealing since it naturally allows for gradient-descent algorithms on matrix manifolds, thus ensuring (local) guaranteed convergence to the equilibrium strategy. In the case of antagonistic games , namely games in which the players may share linearly dependent input directions, the fixed-point condition above is combined with a geometric requirement involving the largest invariant subspace contained in the kernel of an auxiliary output matrix. Finally, by building on the latter characterization it is shown that closed-form expressions for the equilibrium strategy for a class of dynamic games can be given.},

This new problem is called p -safety, and it aims to ensure that the given process reaches a forbidden set before leaving its ‘working’ state space with a probability of less than p . In the situation when an initial probability measure characterizes the initial states, a variant of p -safety is put forward. We call this form of safety weak p -safety. In this work, we characterize both p -safety and weak p -safety and show how to compute them. We employ semi-definite programming to compute p -safety and linear programming to compute weak p -safety. To get to this point, we use certificates of positivity of polynomials translated into the sum of squares and the Bernstein forms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the verification and enforcement problems of strong infinite-step opacity and k - step opacity for partially observed discrete-event systems modeled by finite state automata. Strong infinite-step opacity is a property such that the visit of a secret state cannot be inferred by an intruder at any instance along the entire observation trajectory, while strong k -step opacity is a property such that the visit of a secret state cannot be inferred within k steps after the visit. We propose two information structures called an ∞ -step recognizer and a k -step recognizer to verify these two properties. The complexities of our algorithms to verify strong infinite- and k -step opacity are O ( 2 2 ⋅ | X | ⋅ | E o | ) and O ( 2 ( k + 2 ) ⋅ | X | ⋅ | E o | ) , respectively, which are lower than that of existing methods in the literature ( | X | and | E o | are the numbers of states and observable events in a plant, respectively). We also derive an upper bound for the value of k in strong k -step opacity, and propose an effective algorithm to determine the maximal value of k for a given plant. Finally, we note that enforcement of strong infinite- and k -step opacity can be transformed into a language specification enforcement problem and hence be solved using supervisory control.},

To present our design idea, this paper focuses on the consensus problem of linear multi-agent systems defined on a fixed communication graph. In order to solve the consensus problem, a distributed adaptive event-triggered control strategy is proposed that consists of a distributed event-triggered adaptive control law and a distributed asynchronous event-triggering mechanism. It is shown that under the proposed event-triggered control strategy, the states of all agents asymptotically reach consensus via intermittent communication without using any global information of the communication graph. Moreover, using the proposed event-triggering mechanism, not only the exclusion of the Zeno behavior but also the existence of a uniform strictly positive minimum inter-event time is guaranteed for each agent. A simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Optimal decision-making tools are essential in industry to achieve high performance. One of these tools is model predictive control (MPC), which is an advanced control technique that generates an action that affects the controlled variables, while satisfying the process’ operational constraints. At the core of the MPC algorithm lies an optimization problem that is solved by a numerical method at every sample time. New demand for more self-contained modular processes has seen MPC embedded in small-scale platforms. This has prompted a need for custom-made numerical methods that help to run the computationally demanding optimization algorithms efficiently. In this paper, we propose two approaches that factorize the Newton system of the interior-point method based on the two-point boundary-value problem structure, rarely explored in MPC. By exploiting the Hamiltonian form of the augmented system, we derive an incomplete LU factorization. A direct method is available to compute the solution of the system using a forward substitution of a series of matrices. We also propose a preconditioned Krylov method that converges within a small number of iterations only depending on the number of states.},

The HIGS keeps the sign of its input and output equal, thereby inducing less phase lag than a linear integrator, much like the famous Clegg integrator. The HIGS achieves the reduced phase lag by projection of the controller dynamics instead of using resets of the integrator state, which forms a potential benefit of this control element. To formally analyze HIGS-controlled systems, we present an appropriate mathematical framework for describing these novel systems. Based on this framework, HIGS-controlled systems are proven to be well-posed in the sense of existence and forward completeness of solutions. Moreover, we propose two approaches for analyzing (input-to-state) stability of the resulting nonlinear closed-loop systems: (i) circle-criterion-like conditions based on (measured) frequency response data, and (ii) LMI-based conditions exploiting a new construction of piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions. A motion control example is used to illustrate the results.},

Inspired by the sliding mode control method, our key idea lies in the design of an error term in the standard PI controller. For a circular field, we show that the P-like controller can globally regulate the vehicle to the desired isoline where the steady-state error can be arbitrarily reduced by increasing the P gain and eliminated by the PI-like controller. Moreover, the P-like controller is shown to achieve the local regulation for smooth fields. Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of our approach are validated via both simulations and experiments with a differential steering vehicle.},

In these conditions, we produced a fresh distributed consensus algorithm by the correlative output information. By designing asynchronous switched K-filters and classical K-filters, the state variables of the leader and all followers are reconstructed. Based on the backstepping method and the Nussbaum-type functions, we put forward the distributed controller with K-filters for the follower. Then, we scrupulously prove that all agents can acquire consensus driven by the controller if the switching signal satisfies an average dwell time condition.

  abstract     = {We propose techniques for fault diagnosis in discrete-event systems modelled by labelled Petri nets, where fault events are modelled as unobservable transitions. The proposed approach combines an offline and an online algorithm. The offline algorithm constructs a diagnoser in the form of sets of inequalities that capture the legal, normal and faulty behaviour. To implement the offline algorithm, we adopt the Fourier–Motzkin method for elimination of variables from these sets of inequalities. Upon observing an event, the diagnoser is used to determine whether a fault occurred or might have occurred. The occurrence of a fault can be verified by checking the observed sequence against the sets of inequalities. This approach has the advantage that the tradeoff between the size of the diagnoser and the time for computing the diagnosis is achieved. In addition, fault diagnosis in both bounded and unbounded Petri nets can be addressed.},

  abstract     = {A non-centralized model predictive control (MPC) scheme for solving an economic dispatch problem of electrical networks is proposed in this paper. The scheme consists of two parts. The first part is an event-triggered repartitioning method that splits the network into a fixed number of non-overlapping sub-systems (microgrids). The objective of the repartitioning procedure is to obtain self-sufficient microgrids, i.e., those that can meet their local loads using their own generation units. However, since the algorithm does not guarantee that all the resulting microgrids are self-sufficient, the microgrids that are not self-sufficient must then form a coalition with some of their neighboring microgrids. This process becomes the second part of the scheme. By performing the coalition formation, we can decompose the economic dispatch problem of the network into coalition-based sub-problems such that each subproblem is feasible. Furthermore, we also show that the solution obtained by solving the coalition-based sub-problems is a feasible but sub-optimal solution to the centralized problem. Additionally, some numerical simulations are also carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

For flat continuous-time systems, no comparable result is available. The advantage of such a decomposition is that the complete system is flat if and only if the subsystem is flat. Thus, by repeating the decomposition at most n − 1 times, where n is the dimension of the state space, the flatness of a discrete-time system can be checked in an algorithmic way. If the system is flat, then the algorithm yields a flat output which only depends on the state variables. Hence, every flat discrete-time system has a flat output which does not depend on the inputs and their forward-shifts. Again, no comparable result for flat continuous-time systems is available. The algorithm requires in each decomposition step the construction of state- and input transformations, which are obtained by straightening out certain vector fields or distributions with the flow-box theorem or the Frobenius theorem. Thus, from a computational point of view, only the calculation of flows and the solution of algebraic equations is needed. We illustrate our results by two examples.},

To overcome the above shortcoming, this paper proposes an approach referred to as explicit EM (EEM). First, we fit the quantized output data by a linear Gaussian regression distribution with some compensation parameters. As a result of the linear Gaussianity, the posterior of the excited output can be explicitly computed, so that EEM has the less computation burden than the existing EMs. Second, through optimizing these compensation parameters by resorting to variational Bayesian inference, the intrinsic distribution of the quantized output can be well fitted with guaranteed identification accuracy. Third, the linear Gaussian regression distribution is independent of the specific quantization function form, which enables EEM applicable for different quantization forms. Finally, the simulation demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The noise to error attenuation within the H ∞ framework has the additional advantage of casting aside requirements concerning noise distributions, which are significantly hard to characterize within the group of rigid body transformations. Using dual quaternion algebra, we provide a connection between performance effects over the end-effector trajectory and different sources of uncertainties and disturbances while satisfying attenuation requirements with minimum instantaneous control effort. The result is an easy-to-implement closed form H ∞ control design criterion. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated within different realistic simulated scenarios and validated through real experiments.},

Modeling error is assumed to exist in each local exosystem model. Different from existing works, a local composite disturbance observer is proposed, with which the exact states of the local disturbances can be well estimated asymptotically. Accordingly, the fully distributed leaderless consensus problem can be solved. For the tracking problem, the dynamics of the leader is assumed to be linear with respect to its state variables and the coefficient matrices are unknown to all the followers. Each follower is affected by disturbances generated by exosystems. A class of distributed parameter estimation algorithms is proposed to handle the unknown coefficient matrices in the dynamics of the leader, with which, the fully distributed tracking problem can be further solved.

The attitude and angular velocity are estimated from a minimum of two linearly independent known vectors measured in the body-fixed frame, and the measured angular velocity vector is assumed to have a constant bias in addition to measurement errors. The estimated attitude evolves directly on the special orthogonal group SO(3) of rigid body rotations, avoiding any ambiguities and singularities. The constant bias in angular velocity measurements is also estimated. The estimation scheme is proven to be almost globally finite time stable in the absence of measurement errors using a Lyapunov analysis. The robustness of the scheme in the presence of bounded measurement errors is analytically shown. The estimation scheme is discretized as a geometric integrator for digital implementation. Numerical simulations demonstrate the finite time stability properties of the estimation scheme. Robustness of this estimation scheme is also demonstrated through a numerical comparison against some state-of-the-art nonlinear attitude estimation schemes.},

  abstract     = {In large dynamical systems subjected to noise or forced oscillations, disturbances constantly arise over time. In this case, the small-signal stability is determined by the energy of perturbations accumulated in the system. To analyze this perturbation energy, this study proposes a novel physically motivated Lyapunov modal analysis (LMA) framework that combines selective modal analysis with the spectral decompositions of specially chosen Lyapunov functions. Based on this approach, we propose new modal indicators that characterize individual modes and modal interactions in connection with specific state variables. Conventional participation factors characterize the relative contributions of the system modes to the evolution of states. In contrast, the proposed Lyapunov participation factors make similar contributions to the Lyapunov functions that estimate the integral energy associated with the states and signals on an infinite or finite time interval. The Lyapunov modal interaction factors characterize the pairwise interaction between modes in terms of their mutual actions produced in states over time. We prove that the proposed modal indicators characterize the stability of individual modes and resonant modal interactions in linear parameter-varying systems and demonstrate the application of these indicators for the small-signal stability analysis of a two-area power system model. New indicators can be calculated independently for a selected part of the system spectrum and used to quickly assess the behavior of critical modes in large-scale dynamical systems.},

These collective motions can be exploited to solve problems such as the shaped consensus (the rendezvous with a particular shape), the enclosing of a target , or translations with controlled speed and heading to assist mobile robots in area coverage, escorting, and traveling missions, respectively. The designed steady-state collective motions correspond to rotations around the centroid, translations, and scalings of a reference shape. The proposed modification of the weights relocates one of the Laplacian’s zero eigenvalues while preserving its associated eigenvector that constructs the desired shape. For example, such relocation on the imaginary or real axis induces rotational and scaling motions, respectively. We will show how to satisfy a sufficient condition to guarantee the global convergence to the desired shape and motions.

The performance measure used is similar to the ℓ 2 -induced norm except that the initial state and the disturbance input are considered to reside in two separate norm balls; that is, the supremum of the ℓ 2 -norm of the performance output is minimized subject to the initial state taking values in a unit Euclidean ball and the disturbance input taking values in a unit ℓ 2 -norm ball.

These sets are updated by each UAV using the information coming from its sensors as well as received from its neighbors.

  abstract     = {We study the problem of robust global synchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators (PCOs) over directed graphs. It is known that when the digraphs are strongly connected, global synchronization can be achieved by using a class of deterministic binary set-valued resetting controllers (Poveda and Teel, 2019). However, for large-scale networks, these algorithms are not scalable because some of their tuning parameters have upper bounds of the order O 1 N , where N is the number of agents. This paper resolves this scalability issue by presenting several new results about global synchronization of PCOs with more general network topologies using the frameworks of deterministic and stochastic hybrid dynamical systems. First, we establish that similar deterministic binary resetting algorithms can achieve robust global and fixed-time synchronization in any rooted acyclic digraph . Moreover, in this case, we show that the synchronization dynamics are now scalable as the tuning parameters of the algorithm are network independent , i.e., of order O ( 1 ) . However, the algorithms cannot be further extended to all rooted digraphs. We establish this new impossibility result by introducing a counter-example with a particular rooted digraph for which global synchronization cannot be achieved, irrespective of the tuning parameters. Nevertheless, we show that if the binary resetting algorithms are modified by accommodating an Erdös–Renýi type random graph model, then the resulting stochastic resetting dynamics will guarantee global synchronization almost surely for all rooted digraphs and, moreover, the tuning parameters of the dynamics are network independent. Stability and robustness properties of the resetting algorithms are studied using the tools from set-valued hybrid dynamical systems. Numerical simulations are provided at the end of the paper for demonstration of the main results.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the linear–quadratic optimal control problem for networked systems simultaneously with input delay and Markovian packet losses under hold-input compensation strategy, which is different from the literature. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of optimal control problem over a finite horizon are given by coupled difference Riccati-type equations. Moreover, the networked control system is mean-square stability if and only if coupled algebraic Riccati-type equations have a particular solution. Due to input delay and Markovian packet dropout, it leads to the failure of the separation principle, which is a fundamental obstacle. The key technique in this paper is to tackle forward and backward difference equations by decoupling.},

  abstract     = {The paper focuses on a generic optimal control problem (OCP) deriving from the competition between two microbial populations in continuous cultures. The competition for nutrients is reduced to a two-dimensional dynamical nonlinear-system that can be derived from classical quota models. We investigate an OCP that achieves species separation over a fixed time-window, suitable for a large class of empirical growth functions commonly used in quota models. Using Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle (PMP), the optimal control strategy steering the model trajectories is fully characterized. Then, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a turnpike property associated with the optimal control and state-trajectories, as well as their respective co-state trajectories. Indeed, we prove that for a sufficiently large time, the optimal strategy achieving strain separation remains most of the time exponentially close to an optimal steady-state defined from an associated simpler static -OCP. This turnpike feature is based on the hyperbolicity of the linearized Hamiltonian-system around the solution of the static -OCP. The obtained theoretical results are then illustrated on microalgae, described by the Droop model in dimension 5. The optimal strategy is numerically computed in Bocop ( open source toolbox for optimal control ) with direct optimization methods.},

We show that path-complete p -dominant switched linear systems are exactly the ones that have a p -dimensional asymptotic behavior. Then, we describe an algorithm for the computation of the cones involved in the property of p -dominance.

This treatment greatly reduces the communication frequency compared with continuous-time average consensus algorithms.

Nevertheless, none of these tools allow to predict whether the output convergence is uniform on bounded sets of initial conditions, which may lead to practical issues related to convergence speed and robustness. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a testable sufficient condition under which this uniform convergence holds. Second, we provide an extension of Barbălat’s lemma, which relaxes the uniform continuity requirement. Both these results are first stated in a finite-dimensional context and then extended to infinite-dimensional systems. We provide academic examples to illustrate the usefulness of these results and show that they can be invoked to establish uniform AOS for systems under adaptive control.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide an interesting combination of the vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities of rotary-wing (RW) and of the efficient forward flight of fixed-wing (FW) vehicles. The employed controllers must be able to handle the highly nonlinear dynamics and changing control authorities resulting from this combination, especially during the transition between the two flight modes. In this paper, a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) structure is designed and applied to a tiltrotor convertible UAV. Full-flight envelope trajectory tracking and optimal exploitation of the aircraft’s VTOL and FW properties is achieved. A common approach is to design a set of stable controllers for various trim-points in the flight envelope and make use of Gain Scheduling (GS) or controller mixing, in order to select the appropriate control law for a given flight configuration. In this paper, a unified control approach is developed. A nonlinear MPC structure is designed and applied to a tiltrotor convertible UAV whose nonlinear model is derived and presented. Thus, full-flight envelope trajectory tracking and optimal exploitation of the aircraft’s VTOL and FW properties are achieved, without the need for controller switching or scheduling policies. The proposed multi-stage control allocation handles the changing control authorities of the actuators in a continuous manner and efficiently distributes the required control actions between propellers, tilt servos and control-surfaces. The feasibility and performance of this novel control approach are successfully evaluated in real-world flight experiments. Simulation results for comparison with state-of-the-art approaches are presented.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a recursive t -distribution noise model based maximum likelihood estimation algorithm for discrete-time dynamic state estimation is proposed. The proposed estimator is robust to outliers because the “thick tail” of the t -distribution reduces the effect of large errors in the likelihood function. A computationally efficient recursive algorithm is derived using the influence function. As the t -distribution reduces to the Gaussian distribution when its degree of freedom tends to infinity, the proposed estimator reduces to the Kalman filter. The mean squared error is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimator. Compared with the Kalman filter, the proposed estimator is more robust to outliers in the process and measurement noise. Simulations show that for the particle filter to give a better mean squared error, its computational time is two orders of magnitude slower than the proposed estimator.},

Moreover, it is proved that the proposed DDUKF-CI is consistent and the estimation error is exponentially bounded in mean square using the stochastic stability theory.

Moreover, for many frequently used test input signals in automatic control, and by exploring the semiseparable structure of a kernel and the corresponding output kernel, their computational complexity, without any approximations , can be lowered to O ( N q 2 ) or O ( N q 3 ) , where q is the semiseparability rank of the output kernel that only depends on the chosen kernel and the input signal.

In detail, we use methods from the field of symplectic geometry to analyze the eigenvalues of a Koopman operator that lifts Pontryagin’s differential equation into a suitably defined infinite dimensional symplectic space. This has the advantage that methods from the field of spectral analysis can be used to characterize globally optimal control laws. A numerical method for constructing optimal feedback laws for nonlinear systems proceeds by computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix that is obtained by projecting the Pontryagin–Koopman operator onto a finite dimensional space. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach by computing accurate approximations of the optimal nonlinear feedback law for a Van der Pol control system, which cannot be stabilized by a linear control law.},

We propose in this paper an active observer based robust control scheme to reject the influence of hysteresis. Firstly, the normal piecewise C–H model of hysteresis plant was modified into a continuous form so that an active observer could be applied on. Secondly, an observer was designed based on the extended set-membership filter (ESMF). This intends to take the advantages of ESMF on the bound-guaranteed estimation and the unknown but bounded (UBB) noise tolerance. Thirdly, a robust controller was constructed using both the magnitude and the bounds of the hysteresis uncertainty estimated by the observer. The stability of the control scheme was theoretically proved. Experiments were conducted on a robotic flexible ureteroscope test-bed. The performance of the modified model, the ESMF-based observer, and the robust control were extensively verified, and the improvements benefited from this proposed scheme were demonstrated.},

Secondly, when restricted to be static (a.k.a. memoryless), such a class of systems coincides with the class of sloped-restricted monotone nonlinearities, and the classical result of using the Zames–Falb multipliers to ensure feedback stability is recovered. Thirdly, when restricted to be LTI, the first class is demonstrated to be a subset of the second, and the existence of a Zames–Falb multiplier is shown to be sufficient but not necessary for the robust feedback stability.},

A criterion that evaluates the difference between responses of the reference model and those of the feedback system is employed for tracking control. Because the criterion is nonconvex with respect to controller parameters, its second order Taylor expansion, which is convex, is used for parameter tuning. To represent the approximated criterion using plant responses instead of a plant mathematical model, it is proposed to use the responses of all entries of the plant for a test function, typically a step function. The parameter value that minimizes the approximated data-based criterion is obtained adopting the linear least-squares method.

Second, it is shown that the linear time-varying system is both uniformly exponentially stable and uniformly exponentially expanding if and only if the corresponding Lyapunov differential equation has a unique positive definite solution. Third, some degenerated Lyapunov differential equations, where the Q matrix is only positive semi-definite, are also re-examined.

The energy harvesting technology is utilized to provide the needed energy for persistently maintaining the operation of the multisensor systems. The energy level at the energy harvester is characterized by a random variable obeying a certain probability distribution. For the communication between sensors and filters, we consider a scenario where the measurements received by sensors are broadcasted via networks and then obtained by filters according to a set of preassigned communication links. The aim of this paper is to design the fusion filter over a multisensor system with locally minimized variance of the estimation error. Specifically, the local filter is firstly designed such that, in the presence of energy harvesting constraints and parameter uncertainties, an upper bound on the filtering error covariance is guaranteed and subsequently minimized by appropriately choosing the filter parameters at each time instant. Then, all the local estimates obtained by local filters are fused by using the covariance intersection fusion strategy for fusion estimation purposes.

  abstract     = {Cyber–physical systems usually have complex dynamics and are required to fulfill complex tasks. In recent years, formal methods from Computer Science have been used by control theorists for both describing the required tasks and ensuring that they are fulfilled by the systems. The crucial drawback of formal methods is that a complete model of the system often needs to be available. The main goal of this paper is to study formal verification of linear time-invariant systems with respect to a fragment of temporal logic specifications when only a partial knowledge of the model is available, i.e., a parameterized model of the system is known but the exact values of the parameters are unknown. We provide a probabilistic measure for the satisfaction of the specification by trajectories of the system under the influence of uncertainty. We assume these specifications are expressed as signal temporal logic formulae and provide an approach that relies on gathering input–output data from the system and employs Bayesian inference on the collected data to associate a notion of confidence to the satisfaction of the specification. The main novelty of our approach is to combine both data-driven and model-based techniques in order to have a two-layer probabilistic reasoning over the behavior of the system. The inner layer is with respect to the uncertainties in dynamics and observed data while the outer layer is with respect to the distribution over the parameter space. The latter is updated using Bayesian inference on the collected data. The proposed approach is demonstrated in two case studies.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we deal with the active diagnosis problem in labeled Petri nets by developing a supervisor for a plant such that the closed-loop system is diagnosable. Since control actions may introduce deadlocks even if an original plant is deadlock-free, we first generalize the classical notion of diagnosability in labeled Petri nets to the nets that may contain potential deadlocks. To avoid enumerating all reachable markings of a plant, we develop a structure called quiescent basis reachability graph , and accordingly propose a structure named Q-diagnoser to verify the diagnosability of a net. We prove that a plant is diagnosable if and only if there does not exist any indeterminate cycle in its Q-diagnoser. Finally, for an undiagnosable plant, we introduce a diagnosability enforcing supervisor to enforce the diagnosability by trimming a Q-diagnoser. Moreover, our approach guarantees that the closed-loop system cannot reach a dead marking unless a fault transition has fired.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a multi-agent resilient consensus problem, where some of the nodes may behave maliciously. The approach is to equip all nodes with a scheme to detect neighboring nodes when they behave in an abnormal fashion. To this end, the nodes exchange not only their own states but also information regarding their neighbor nodes. Such two-hop communication has long been studied in fault-tolerant algorithms in computer science. We propose two distributed schemes for detection of malicious nodes and resilient consensus with different requirements on resources for communication and the structures of the networks. In particular, the detection schemes become effective under certain connectivity properties in the network so that the non-malicious nodes can share enough information about their neighbors. It is shown that the requirements are however less stringent than those for conventional algorithms. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods in wireless sensor networks.},

  abstract     = {System identification for multibody mechanical systems such as robots and vehicles is typically formulated as a parameter optimization problem, in which the model parameters are chosen to minimize the difference between measured and predicted trajectories of the system. The problem is made difficult by the large number of parameters of different scales and physical units, and also noisy and incomplete measurements. Even more critically, the choice of reference trajectory has a decisive impact on the accuracy and robustness of the identification procedure. In this paper we propose a set of geometric optimal excitation criteria that can be optimized to generate high-quality reference trajectories. The resulting optimal trajectories are coordinate- and frame-invariant, and can be obtained efficiently and robustly using recursive analytic gradients of the criteria. For high-dimensional systems that can execute only a limited range of feasible trajectories, we also show how our geometrical framework can be used to optimally identify a reduced set of parameters for the given set of trajectories. The improved robustness and accuracy of our geometric approach vis-á-vis existing methods is demonstrated through both numerical and hardware experiments involving robot manipulators and a high-dimensional humanoid robot.},

Benefited from the cascade design, saturations can be inserted into the observer internal variables to limit the maximal implemented gain. The convergence of the new ESO with a class of nonlinear gain functions is established, and it is shown that adopting appropriate nonlinear gain mechanisms leads to improvement in measurement noise tolerance. What is more, the new ESO based output feedback control has stronger uncertainty estimation and compensation capability than the standard ESO based output feedback control. Specifically, the proposed approach only relies on the knowledge of the control direction of the uncertain nonlinear system. Finally, the obtained results are applied to suppress the wing rock motion of a slender delta wing.},

We consider a specification provided under the form of a discrete-time hybrid automaton with external inputs, which can represent, for instance, instructions or informations received from a human user or from another system. The hybrid automaton describes the intended behavior of the system and we first consider the problem of synthesizing a controller such that the maximal trajectories of the closed-loop system are also maximal trajectories of the hybrid automaton. We show that the existence of an alternating simulation relation from the specification to the open-loop system is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such controllers. To be able to solve this problem using symbolic (i.e. finite-state) abstractions, we provide a method to compute a symbolic specification that under-approximates the behavior of the hybrid automata. Then, we extend our approach to consider additional safety or reachability requirements so that some unsafe (e.g. blocking) states are avoided or some target states are reached, respectively. The originality of the problem is that these additional requirements are not formulated over the states of the system but over the states of the specification. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with two illustrative examples from autonomous vehicle control.},

This problem structure arises in a number of engineering systems and cyber–physical systems where the known function captures time-varying engineering costs, and the unknown function models user’s satisfaction; in this context, the objective is to strike a balance between given performance metrics and user’s satisfaction. Key challenges related to the problem at hand are related to (1) the time variability of the problem, and (2) the fact that learning of the user’s utility function is performed concurrently with the execution of the online algorithm. This paper leverages Gaussian processes (GP) to learn the unknown cost function from noisy functional evaluation and build pertinent upper confidence bounds. Using the GP formalism, the paper then advocates time-varying optimization tools to design an online algorithm that exhibits tracking of the oracle-based optimal trajectory within an error ball, while learning the user’s satisfaction function with no-regret. The algorithmic steps are inexact, to account for possible limited computational budgets or real-time implementation considerations. Numerical examples are illustrated based on a problem related to vehicle control.},

We establish that for any fixed k &gt; 2 , the problem of placing the minimum number of sensors/outputs required to ensure that the structural observability index is at most k , is NP-complete. Conversely, we identify a subclass of systems whose structures are directed trees with self-loops at every state vertex, for which the problem can be solved in linear time. (ii) Assuming that the set of states that each given output can measure is given, we prove that the problem of selecting a pre-assigned number of outputs in order to maximize the number of states of the system that are structurally observable (i.e., to maximize the size of the observable subgraph) is also NP-hard. As an application, we identify suitable conditions on the system structure under which there exists an efficient greedy strategy, which we provide, to obtain a ( 1 − 1 e ) -approximate solution. An illustration of the techniques developed for this problem is given on the benchmark IEEE 118-bus power network containing roughly 400 states in its linearized model.},

We do not assume that the demand is generated by a known model. We follow a multiple time-scale approach for the stability analysis. It is shown that synchronization is achieved for the case of constant power demand, by showing that the system is exponentially stable. For the case of time-varying power demand, we show the error trajectories are ultimately bounded, and the synchronization error is proportional to an upper bound on the derivative of the time-varying power demand.

However, despite hybrid dynamical systems becoming increasingly important in many fields, there has been little work on utilizing the knowledge of how probability distributions map through hybrid transitions. Here, we make use of a propagation law that employs the saltation matrix (a first-order update to the sensitivity equation) to create the Salted Kalman Filter (SKF), a natural extension of the Kalman Filter and Extended Kalman Filter to hybrid dynamical systems. Away from hybrid events, the SKF is a standard Kalman filter. When a hybrid event occurs, the saltation matrix plays an analogous role as that of the system dynamics, subsequently inducing a discrete modification to both the prediction and update steps. The SKF outperforms a naive variational update – the Jacobian of the reset map – by having a reduced mean squared error in state estimation, especially immediately after a hybrid transition event. Compared against a hybrid particle filter, the particle filter outperforms the SKF in mean squared error only when a large number of particles are used, likely due to a more accurate accounting of the split distribution near a hybrid transition.},

In this work, we propose a new exact dynamic consensus algorithm which leverages high order sliding modes, in the form of a distributed differentiator to achieve zero steady-state error of the average of time varying reference signals in a group of agents. Moreover, our proposal is also able to achieve consensus to high order derivatives of the average signal, if desired.

Particularly, we introduce new notions of simulation functions that characterize the distance between control systems while preserving opacity properties across them. Instead of treating large-scale systems in a monolithic manner, we develop a compositional scheme to construct the finite abstractions together with the overall opacity-preserving simulation functions based on those of the smaller subsystems. For a network of incrementally input-to-state stable control subsystems and under some small-gain type condition, an algorithm for designing local quantization parameters is presented to orderly build the local symbolic models of subsystems. We show that the network of those constructed symbolic models simulates the original network for an a-priori defined abstraction accuracy while preserving its opacity properties.},

  abstract     = {Constant power loads (CPLs) in power systems have a destabilizing effect that gives rise to significant oscillations or to network collapse, motivating the development of new methods to analyse their effect in AC and DC power systems. A sine qua non condition for this analysis is the availability of a suitable mathematical model for the CPL. In the case of DC systems power is simply the product of voltage and current, hence a CPL corresponds to a first–third quadrant hyperbola in the loads voltage–current plane. The same approach is applicable for balanced three-phase systems that, after a rotation of the coordinates to the synchronous frame, can be treated as a DC system. Modelling CPLs for single-phase (or unbalanced poly-phase) AC systems, on the other hand, is a largely unexplored area because in AC systems (active and reactive) power involves the integration in a finite window of the product of the voltage and current signals. In this paper we propose a simple dynamic model of a CPL that is suitable for the analysis of single-phase AC systems. We give conditions on the tuning gains of the model that guarantee the CPL behaviour is effectively captured.},

  abstract     = {H 2 static and dynamic output-feedback control problems are investigated for linear time-invariant uncertain systems. The goal is to minimize the averaged H 2 performance in the presence of nonlinear dependence on time-invariant probabilistic parametric uncertainties. By applying the polynomial chaos theory, the control synthesis problem is solved using a high-dimensional expanded system which characterizes stochastic state uncertainty propagation. Compared to existing polynomial chaos-based control designs, the proposed approach addresses the simultaneous presence of parametric uncertainties and white noises. The effect of truncation errors due to using finite-degree polynomial chaos expansions is captured by time-varying norm-bounded uncertainties, and is explicitly taken into account by adopting a guaranteed cost control approach. This feature avoids the use of high-degree polynomial chaos expansions to alleviate the destabilizing effect of expansion truncation errors, thus significantly reducing computational complexity. Moreover, rigorous analysis clarifies the condition under which the stability of the high-dimensional expanded system implies the internal mean square stability of the original system under control. Using iterations between synthesis and post-analysis, a bisection algorithm is proposed to find the smallest bounding parameter on the effect of expansion truncation errors such that robust closed-loop stability is guaranteed. A numerical example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Exact discrete-time models of nonlinear systems are difficult or impossible to obtain, and hence approximate models may be employed for control design. Most existing results provide conditions under which the stability of the approximate model in closed-loop carries over to the stability of the (unknown) exact model but only in a practical sense, i.e. the trajectories of the closed-loop system are ensured to converge to a bounded region whose size can be made as small as desired by limiting the maximum sampling period. In addition, some very stringent conditions exist for the exact model to exhibit exactly the same type of asymptotic stability as the approximate model. In this context, our main contribution consists in providing less stringent conditions by considering semiglobal exponential input-to-state stability (SE-ISS), where the inputs can successfully represent state-measurement and actuation errors. These conditions are based on establishing SE-ISS for an adequate approximate model and are applicable both under uniform and nonuniform sampling. As a second contribution, we show that explicit Runge–Kutta models satisfy our conditions and can hence be employed. An example of control design for stabilization based on approximate discrete-time models is also given.},

Specifically, the goal of the network is to minimize the sum of local costs, while satisfying local and coupling constraints. Agents communicate according to a time-varying model in which edges of an underlying connected graph are active at each iteration with certain non-uniform probabilities. By relying on a primal decomposition scheme applied to an equivalent problem reformulation, we propose a novel distributed algorithm in which agents negotiate a local allocation of the total resource only with neighbors with active communication links. The algorithm is studied as a subgradient method with block-wise updates, in which blocks correspond to the graph edges that are active at each iteration. Thanks to this analysis approach, we show almost sure convergence to the optimal cost of the original problem and almost sure asymptotic primal recovery without resorting to averaging mechanisms typically employed in dual decomposition schemes. Explicit sublinear convergence rates are provided under the assumption of diminishing and constant step-sizes. Finally, an extensive numerical study on a plug-in electric vehicle charging problem corroborates the theoretical results.},

Allowing different constraints per agent simultaneously with a time-varying communication network constitutes a distinctive feature of our approach, extending existing results on distributed subgradient methods. To highlight the necessity of dealing with a different constraint set within a distributed optimisation context, we analyse a problem instance where an existing algorithm does not exhibit a convergent behaviour if adapted to account for different constraint sets. For our proposed iterative scheme we show asymptotic convergence of the iterates to a minimum of the underlying optimisation problem for step sizes of the form η k + 1 , η &gt; 0 . We also analyse this scheme under a step size choice of η k + 1 , η &gt; 0 , and establish a convergence rate of O ( ln k k ) in objective value.

However, the use of on–off loads for frequency control can lead to chattering and undesirable limit cycle behavior, which are issues that need to be resolved for such loads to be used for network support This paper considers the problem of primary frequency regulation with ancillary service from on–off loads in power networks and establishes conditions that lead to convergence guarantees and an appropriate power allocation within the network. In particular, in order to assist existing frequency control mechanisms, we consider loads that switch when prescribed frequency thresholds are exceeded. Such control policies are prone to chattering, which limits their practicality. To resolve this issue, we consider loads that follow a decentralized hysteretic on–off policy, and show that chattering is not observed within such a setting. Hysteretic loads may exhibit, however, limit cycle behavior, which is undesirable. To address this, we propose an adapted hysteretic control scheme for which we provide convergence guarantees. Furthermore, we consider a mixed-integer optimization problem for power allocation and propose a suitable design of the control policy such that the cost incurred at equilibrium is within ϵ from the optimal cost, providing a non conservative value for ϵ . The practicality of our analytic results is demonstrated with numerical simulations on the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) 140-bus system.},

The key idea is to utilize stably distributed noise , which has the following two preferable properties for this purpose; One is its heavy-tailed distribution that is beneficial to hide extreme values including scale-free data. The other is its closedness with respect to addition similarly to Gaussian, which enables us to design filter/controller under privacy requirements based on linear control theory.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the distributed state estimation problem is studied for renewable energy microgrids with sensor saturations. A system model for the microgrids with sensor saturations is proposed. Attention is focused on the design of a distributed recursive estimation scheme such that, in the presence of the sensor saturations, an upper bound of the estimation error covariance is guaranteed. Subsequently, such an upper bound is minimized by appropriately designing the gain matrices of the corresponding state estimator. In particular, the sparsity of the gain matrices resulting from network topology is handled by using a matrix simplification method. Moreover, the performance evaluation of the designed distributed state estimator is conducted by analyzing the exponential boundedness of the estimation error in the mean square sense. Finally, simulation experiments under two cases are carried out on a renewable energy microgrid which contains two distributed generation units. The simulation results demonstrate that the developed state estimation scheme is effective.},

  abstract     = {This work presents DMPC (Data-and Model-Driven Predictive Control) to solve control problems in which some of the constraints or parts of the objective function are known, while others are entirely unknown to the controller. It is assumed that there is an exogenous “black box” system, e.g. a machine learning technique, that predicts the value of the unknown functions for a given trajectory. DMPC (1) provides an approach to merge both the model-based and black-box systems; (2) can cope with very little data and is sample efficient, building its solutions based on recently generated trajectories; and (3) improves its cost in each iteration until converging to an optimal trajectory, typically needing only a few trials even for nonlinear dynamics and objectives. Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is presented, proving that the quality of the trajectory does not worsen with each new iteration. We apply the DMPC algorithm to the motion planning of an autonomous vehicle with nonlinear dynamics.},

By incorporating a common constructed tangent-type barrier Lyapunov function, the so-called adding a power integrator technique is revamped to design state feedback controllers systematically. Then, reduced-order switched observers are constructed deliberately so that the finite-time output feedback stabilization of planar switched systems can be realized with the output constraint guaranteed.

Over-actuated systems belong to such class. In this paper, a systematic design of a reduced-order super-twisting control is proposed to track arbitrary reference signals for uncertain non-minimum phase over-actuated systems. The proposed method involves the transformation that resolves the redundancy in the control inputs so that system can be represented as a normally-actuated system with virtual control inputs. Further, unstable zero dynamics are virtually stabilized through one more transformation so that stable and virtually stable zero dynamic states can be excluded from the super-twisting control design. Finally, the computed virtual control magnitude is spread across all the actuators via a redistributed pseud-inverse type of control allocation so that the system can be operated within the actuator saturation limits.},

  abstract     = {While many physical robot systems are able to work cooperatively with humans to perform numerous tasks, existing optical cell manipulation systems can only perform either manual or automated tasks at a time. As optical cell manipulation is essentially different from robotic manipulation in the physical world due to its stochastic nature, existing human–robot interaction control techniques cannot thus be directly reproduced into optical micro-manipulation of cells. This paper proposes a human–machine interaction control approach for stochastic optical cell manipulation systems. A theoretical foundation is then developed, and thus enabling human to interpose or interact, when applicable or needed, with an automated cell manipulation system without interrupting the manipulation process. Therefore, it offers an opportunity for human to get involved with an automated cell manipulation system so as to deal with unexpected events or complex tasks, rather than to stop or restart the whole manipulation process. Both the capacity of an automated control system – which provides precise and productive cell manipulation, and human ability – in terms of decision making, if needed, are then consolidated into a single optical cell manipulation system. Rigorous mathematical formulation is developed with the consideration of the stochastic perturbations, and the stability of the human–machine interaction control system is analyzed from a stochastic perspective. Experiments are then performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

A mode-dependent alternate event-triggered mechanism (AETM) is integrated into the NSSs with transmission delays and packet losses for the first time based on continuous detection and periodic sampling, and a joint-designed switching signal with the triggering information is presented. Under transmission delays and packet losses, a series of resultant error feedback controllers are synthesized in four cases based on the relationships between switching instants and event-triggered instants. Then, a criterion ensuring asynchronous output regulation performance is formed with transmission delays by the input delay method. With the presence of packet losses, a set of sufficient conditions is also dedicated to the proposed control issue by adding the restraint in the number of successive packet losses associated with a modified AETM. Eventually, a comparison and an F-18 aircraft model reveal the effectiveness of the obtained results in the simulation.},

To overcome such a problem, we propose a transition partition rule to obtain two particular graphs called the positive basis reachability graph and the negative basis reachability graph . Then we develop an information structure, called a dual verifier , that is a parallel composition of the two basis reachability graphs and can be used to determine the marking diagnosability of a plant net.

This enables the formulation of a unified framework for the numerically reliable identification of systems expressed in the δ -domain, as well as in the traditional Laplace and Z -domains.

This is typically done by running a local filter at each node using information obtained through some procedure for fusing data across the network. A common problem with existing methods is that the outcome of local filters at each time step depends on the data fused at the previous step. We propose an alternative approach to eliminate this error propagation. The proposed local filters are guaranteed to be stable under some mild conditions on certain global structural data, and their fusion yields the centralized Kalman estimate. The main feature of the new approach is that fusion errors introduced at a given time step do not carry over to subsequent steps. This offers advantages in many situations including when a global estimate is only needed at a rate slower than that of measurements or when there are network interruptions. If the global structural data can be fused correctly asymptotically, the stability of local filters is equivalent to that of the centralized Kalman filter. Otherwise, we provide conditions to guarantee stability and bound the resulting estimation error. Numerical experiments are given to show the advantage of our method over other existing alternatives.},

This paper proposes to use an abstraction method called divergent stutter bisimulation to abstract the state space of the system. As divergent stutter bisimulation factors out stuttering steps , it typically results in a coarser and therefore smaller abstraction, at the expense of not preserving the temporal “next” operator. The paper leverages results about divergent stutter bisimulation from model checking and shows that divergent stutter bisimulation is a sound and complete abstraction method when synthesising controllers subject to specifications in LTL ∖ ∘ .},

As a first result, we show that the heat exchanger temperature that achieves the minimal value of the steady-state reactant concentration at the outlet is the maximal allowed one. Then, a control strategy is proposed to reach these optimal equilibrium profiles. As main results, we prove that the control law stabilizes exponentially the nonlinear dynamics around the optimal equilibrium while it converges to the optimal heat exchanger temperature. In addition we show that the control law is optimal for some cost criterion of infinite-horizon integral type. Finally, the main results are illustrated with some numerical simulations.},

Intuitively, the covertness property says that the attacker cannot reach a situation where its existence has been detected by the supervisor while no damage can be caused. We consider covert attackers that can exercise both actuator attacks (including enablement attacks and disablement attacks) and sensor attacks (restricted to sensor replacement attacks), where the (partial-observation) attackers may or may not eavesdrop the control commands issued by the supervisor. We shall develop an exponential time reduction from the covert attacker synthesis problem to the well studied Ramadge–Wonham supervisor synthesis problem, which generalizes our previous work on a reduction based approach for covert actuator attacker synthesis, for both the damage-reachable goal and the damage-nonblocking goal. We also provide discussions on conditions under which the exponential blowup in state sizes, due to the reduction construction, can be avoided.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses a class of network games played by dynamic agents using their outputs. Unlike most existing related works, the Nash equilibrium in this work is defined by functions of agent outputs instead of full agent states, which allows the agents to have more general and heterogeneous dynamics and maintain some privacy of their local states. The concerned network game is formulated with agents modeled by uncertain linear systems subject to external disturbances. The cost function of each agent is a linear quadratic function depending on the outputs of its own and its neighbors in the underlying graph. The main challenge stemming from this game formulation is that merely driving the agent outputs to the Nash equilibrium does not guarantee the stability of the agent dynamics. Using local output and the outputs from the neighbors of each agent, we aim at designing game strategies that achieve output Nash equilibrium seeking and stabilization of the closed-loop dynamics. Particularly, when each agent knows how the actions of its neighbors affect its cost function, a game strategy is developed for network games with digraph topology. When each agent is also allowed to exchange part of its compensator state, a distributed strategy can be designed for networks with connected undirected graphs or weakly connected digraphs.},

First, the definition of 2-D dissipativity for the Roesser model is introduced. By employing the quadratic Lyapunov function technique, sufficient conditions are developed to guarantee the pre-specified dissipativity and the asymptotic stability for the addressed system. Then the output feedback controller is designed to stabilize the system and satisfy the 2-D dissipativity performance simultaneously. Next, combined with the dissipativity performance, the event-triggered rule is established for the 2-D system to achieve the pre-specified dissipativity and meanwhile the event-triggered instants are determined. Further, based on the newly established event-triggered rule, the controller is re-designed such that the stability of the 2-D closed-loop system is guaranteed with more efficient utilization of network resources. In the end, the applicability of the proposed method is illustrated by a simulation example.},

In this paper, we extend this approach to a class of nonlinear plants and show how to carry out adaptive control so that we obtain the same desirable linear-like closed-loop properties. First, we consider plants with a known sign of the control gain; second, we consider the case when that sign is unknown, where two parameter estimators and a simple switching mechanism are used.},

We first consider the case where the system state is known at each time step, and present reciprocal and zero CBF constructions that guarantee safety with probability 1. We extend our results to high relative degree systems and present both general constructions and the special case of linear dynamics and affine safety constraints. We then develop CBFs for incomplete state information environments, in which the state must be estimated using sensors that are corrupted by Gaussian noise. We prove that our proposed CBF ensures safety with probability 1 when the state estimate is within a given bound of the true state, which can be achieved using an Extended Kalman Filter when the system is linear or the process and measurement noise are sufficiently small. We propose control policies that combine these CBFs with Control Lyapunov Functions in order to jointly ensure safety and stochastic stability.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the robust observer-based sliding mode H ∞ control issue for discrete-time stochastic Markovian jumping systems (MJSs) subject to packet losses (PLs). Here, a state variable observer of an initial system is designed to estimate the state and a series of Bernoulli random variables is utilized to model the PLs, whose occurrence probability is allowed to be imprecise. Then, a linear switching function is constructed based on the estimated state space. The aim of our paper is to design an observer-based sliding mode H ∞ control strategy such that, the stochastic stability conditions with prescribed H ∞ performance are established for augmented MJSs under the PLs with imprecise occurrence probability, which is composed of the sliding mode dynamics and the error system. The linear sliding surface can be determined by solving some linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In addition, by proposing an improved reaching condition, the desired robust observer-based H ∞ controller is designed in discrete-time setting to drive the system state from any initial one onto the designated sliding surface. Finally, the usefulness of observer-based H ∞ control method is demonstrated via some numerical simulations.},

For the first time, we evaluate and compare a broad class of guaranteed state estimators for linear time-invariant systems regarding scalability, accuracy, and real-time applicability. In particular, we consider strip-based observers, set-propagation observers, and interval observers. The performance of most guaranteed state estimators is significantly affected by the chosen set representation. Zonotopes have emerged as a popular set representation since important operations such as linear maps and Minkowski sum can be computed exactly and efficiently. Furthermore, we provide comparisons with ellipsoids and constrained zonotopes as set representations. The comparison is conducted on various models for state estimation of autonomous vehicles.},

We propose a systematic design framework to obtain two robust static gains such that the same control layer implementation can be used for both matched and unmatched modeling uncertainties. In the proposed event-triggered strategy, each agent uses only two decoupled impulsive approximators to determine its information broadcast events independently of other agents. We prove exponential convergence to the origin of all trajectories of the proposed two-layer interconnected multiagent system under the linear cooperative protocols; free of Zeno behavior in spite of the partially known nonlinearities over the agent layer and non-synchronous, non-periodic communication over the control layer. We also study practical stability with Zeno-freeness in order to reduce the noise sensitivity of the event-triggered strategy, or the number of the information broadcast events.

A corresponding set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is derived from a delay-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) and used to synthesize controllers that can achieve stable operation for specified material removal rates. Experiments on a hardware-in-the-loop flexible structure test-bed show that the LKF-LMI H ∞ controller gives significant improvements in stability regions compared with robust (non-time-delay) controller designs, confirming the method’s potential for machining vibration control.},

Our approach only involves the design of two linear filters together with a linear adaptation law. As a result, the implementation of our two linear filters is easier than that of nonlinear ones. Moreover, the linear form of our filters lends itself to the establishment of the exponential convergence of the estimated frequencies to their actual values. In addition, we obtain an interesting exponential stability result for a class of discrete-time linear time-varying systems that can be viewed as a discrete-time counterpart of a well-known stability result arising from continuous-time adaptive identification.},

We assume that the agents have access to the local information of the desired curve and to their positions with respect to their closest neighbors (as well as to their velocities for the second-order systems), whereas in addition a leader agent is able to measure its absolute position. We assume that a small number of leaders (distributed in the spatial domain) transmit their measurements to other agents through a communication network. We take into account the following network imperfections: variable sampling, transmission delay and quantization. We propose a static output-feedback controller and model the resulting closed-loop system as a disturbed (due to quantization) nonlinear heat equation (for the first-order systems) or damped wave equation (for the second-order systems) with delayed point state measurements, where the state is the relative position of the agents with respect to the desired curve. In order to cope with the open curve we consider Neumann boundary conditions that ensure mobility of the boundary agents. We derive linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that guarantee the input-to-state stability (ISS) of the system. The advantage of our approach is in the simplicity of the control law and the conditions.

Without using a mathematical model, an optimal controller can be learned from data evaluated by certain performance criteria through trial-and-error. However, the data-based learning approach is notorious for not guaranteeing stability, which is the most fundamental property for any control system. In this paper, the classic Lyapunov’s method is explored to analyze the uniformly ultimate boundedness stability (UUB) solely based on data without using a mathematical model. It is further shown how RL with UUB guarantee can be applied to control dynamic systems with safety constraints. Based on the theoretical results, both off-policy and on-policy learning algorithms are proposed respectively. As a result, optimal controllers can be learned to guarantee UUB of the closed-loop system both at convergence and during learning. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on a series of robotic continuous control tasks with safety constraints. In comparison with the existing RL algorithms, the proposed method can achieve superior performance in terms of maintaining safety. As a qualitative evaluation of stability, our method shows impressive resilience even in the presence of external disturbances.},

Their identification is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality: the number of model parameters grows exponentially with the complexity of the input–output response. This fact limits the applicability of such models and has stimulated recently much research on regularized solutions. Along this line, we propose two new strategies that use kernel-based methods. First, we introduce the multiplicative polynomial kernel (MPK). Compared to the standard polynomial kernel, the MPK is equipped with a richer set of hyperparameters, increasing flexibility in selecting the monomials that really influence the system output. Second, we introduce the smooth exponentially decaying multiplicative polynomial kernel (SED-MPK), that is a regularized version of MPK which requires less hyperparameters, allowing to handle also high-order Volterra series. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the two approaches.},

Several properties of the agents dynamic behaviors are proved by exploiting the roles of the agents having at each time-step the maximum and the minimum opinions. The convergence in finite time to (a maximum number of) practical clusters and, for sufficiently large threshold bounds, the convergence to a practical consensus are proved. Sufficient conditions for reaching a practical consensus around a stubborn are derived too. Numerical simulations verify the theoretical results.},

We develop distributed cooperative extended state observers for followers to estimate the acceleration differences between adjacent vehicles. Based on estimates of the acceleration differences, distributed cooperative control laws are designed. By using the stability theory of perturbed linear systems, we show that the control parameters can be properly designed to ensure the closed-loop and L 2 string stabilities for any given positive time headway. We further show that the proposed control law based on the ideal vehicle model can guarantee the closed-loop and L 2 string stabilities even if there are small model parameter uncertainties. Also, simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed control law against sensing noises, input delays and parameter uncertainties.},

We show that, despite the loss of information, the proposed algorithm can still achieve O ( T ) regret bound ( T is the time horizon), which matches that of the standard distributed online subgradient method with exact relative state information. We further investigate the scenario of using noisy signs, where the measurements of the directions of the relative states are perturbed by noise. We show that the regret bound is not affected as long as the noise is not too large, which manifests certain noise-tolerance property of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, we extend the algorithm to the case of bandit feedback, where only the values of the local loss functions at two points are revealed to agents at each time. We demonstrate that the regret bound is not influenced by bandit feedback in order sense. Finally, numerical experiments on decentralized online least squares and logistic regression are conducted to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.},

Then, in order to avoid collisions and maintain communication connection, the method of asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is adopted to eliminate the unfavorable assumption on spacing constraints in using symmetric BLF in the existing result. Nussbaum function is adopted to attenuate the negative effects caused by unknown direction actuator faults.

Then, by using the notion of polar dual set, a cross-section varying tube parameterization is constructed to robustly satisfy the state and control constraints. Additionally, in contrast to the classical robust MPC problems with a priory known and fixed disturbance set, the shape and size of the additive disturbance set is maximized online through the MPC optimization problem. Therefore, at each time step, the control sequence and the largest allowable disturbance set can be computed simultaneously by solving a single constrained optimal control problem.

However, for example, the case where at most n ′ events in a set of n ( &gt; n ′ ) observable events become unobservable cannot be dealt with. The purpose of this paper is to develop a general framework where the diagnosis problem can be addressed in the presence of both intermittent and permanent sensor failures. We introduce a new notion of diagnosability subject to sensor failures and present a procedure of online diagnosis in the general framework. Then, we present how to verify the diagnosability property.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the remote state estimation for a cyber–physical system (CPS) where a group of (primary) sensors transmit sensing data packets to the remote estimators for state estimation via their individual channels. In view of the complexity arising from the scale of such system, it is desirable for the primary sensors to share their channels with the newly-added (potential) ones, especially when the sensing data of primary ones contains less valuable information. However, the channel sharing inevitably leads to signal interference among sensors using the same channels, and it may further degenerate the remote estimation performance. Thus, the system designer should allocate the transmission power for sensors to maximize the global estimation accuracy. We emphasize the non-cooperative nature among sensors, and solve the problem in an exchange market framework with a platform acting on behalf of the system designer, and prove that the optimal power allocation is a spontaneous outcome of the market under well-designed prices. More specifically, under (subsidized) prices announced by the platform, the primary sensors are willing to open up their channels for sharing, in which a distributed optimal power allocation is derived explicitly. To alleviate transmission interference, the platform will charge potential sensors for the use of channels, among which the mutual interaction is formulated as a non-cooperative game and the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium is proved. We also devise an algorithm for the platform to design subsidized/toll prices, which is given in an explicit recursive form with simple iterations, and therefore suited for the platform with limited computation capability.},

Necessary and sufficient conditions on the network connectivity are provided to guarantee all the regular nodes asymptotically converge to the least square estimate of the system state in the presence of a certain number of Byzantine links/nodes and sensor noises. Further, by adopting event-triggered and minimum subset decision techniques, an improved low-complexity algorithm is proposed that allows the LMSD to be intermittently performed with average linear complexity. A main advantage over the existing CWTM-based algorithms is the use of the LMSD mechanism to significantly reduce the network connectivity requirements and do not assume any observability conditions on the local nodes.},

To develop fully distributed seeking strategies, two adaptive control laws, including a node-based control law and an edge-based control law, are proposed. In the node-based adaptive strategy, each player adjusts their own weight on their procurable consensus error dynamically. Moreover, in the edge-based algorithm, the fully distributed strategy is designed by adding an adaptively adjusted scaling parameter to the weights of the edges of the communication graph. With the adaptive control laws, the proposed methods are free of any centralized control gains, i.e., the players can update their actions without knowing any centralized information. By utilizing LaSalle’s invariance principle, it is shown that the Nash equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under both strategies. In addition, we further show that the edge-based method can be easily adapted to accommodate time-varying communication conditions, in which the communication network is switching among a set of undirected and connected graphs. In the last, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

Our first solution adopts a fixed gain, whose choice requires the knowledge of some global parameters of the game. To relax this requirement, we conceive a controller that can be tuned in a completely decentralized fashion, thanks to the use of uncoordinated integral adaptive weights. We further introduce algorithms specifically devised for generalized aggregative games. Finally, we adapt all our control schemes to deal with heterogeneous multi-integrator agents and, in turn, with nonlinear feedback-linearizable dynamical systems.

  abstract     = {Most existing literature about the discrete-time Cucker − Smale model focus on the asymptotic flocking behavior. When the communication weight has a long range, asymptotic flocking holds for any initial data. Actually, the velocity of every agent will exponentially converge to the same limit in this case. However, when the communication weight has a short range, asymptotic flocking does not exist for general initial data. In this note, we will prove the convergence of velocities for any initial data in the short range communication case. We first propose a new strategy about the convergence of velocities, and then show an important inequality about the velocity–position moment, according to which we will successfully prove the convergence of velocities and obtain the convergence rates for two kinds of communication weights. Besides, for some special initial data we show that the limits of velocities can be different from each other. Simulation results are given to validate the theoretical results.},

Voltage phase angles are measured at each node by means of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Based on this information, an interconnection of adaptive dual-layer super-twisting sliding mode observers is designed both to estimate frequency deviation in each generator node, and to perform robust detection and reconstruction of both disturbances and a class of communication attacks. The proposed estimation scheme exhibits a distributed structure, since it requires only information received from neighbouring nodes and measurements taken locally in the power network. The novelty of the proposed scheme is its capability to reconstruct simultaneous disturbances affecting the generator nodes and load nodes, automatically adjusting the values of the gains of the observers. More precisely, the adaptive gains of the observer obey a recently proposed dual-layer adaptation law for the super-twisting sliding mode architecture. A disturbance mitigation strategy is also proposed at each generator node utilising the disturbance estimates. Numerical simulations are discussed to assess the proposed distributed scheme.},

According to the existing literature and socio-psychological theories, we examine three specializations of state-dependent susceptibility, that is, stubborn positives scenario, stubborn neutrals scenario, and stubborn extremists scenario. Interactions among agents form a signed graph, in which positive and negative edges represent friendly and antagonistic interactions, respectively. We conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the generalized nonlinear opinion dynamics. For stubborn positives and stubborn neutrals scenarios, the general model is well-posed if and only if the system matrix is diagonally dominant. Based on the property of limit set and the existing results, we obtain some sufficient conditions such that the states of all agents converge to specific equilibrium point or bipartite consensus. For stubborn extremists scenario, by using the Perron–Frobenius property of eventually positive matrices, we establish some sufficient conditions such that the states of all agents converge into the subspace spanned by the right positive eigenvector of an eventually positive matrix. When there exists at least one entry of the equilibrium point or right positive eigenvector which is not equal to one, the derived results can be used to describe different levels of an opinion. In addition, for stubborn extremists scenario, we also consider the cases that the system matrix forms the opposing Laplacian and repelling Laplacian matrix, respectively. Finally, we present two examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical findings.},

First of all, an attitude control system model for rigid spacecraft is constructed by designing a selection logic for the MRP set and its shadow set. To guarantee the asymptotic stability in the large and unwinding-free performance of the closed-loop system on the sliding phase, a sliding function is presented. Then, a sliding mode control law is developed to ensure that the system states are driven to the sliding surface. Moreover, a dynamic parameter is designed in the proposed control scheme, such that the unwinding phenomenon is avoided when the system states are outside the sliding surface. Further, a boundary layer is introduced for the constructed controller to avoid the chattering phenomenon. It is also proven that the convergence property and anti-unwinding performance are ensured when the system states are within the boundary layer. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the unwinding-free performance of the closed-loop system under the proposed control scheme.},

Set-valued estimation aims to compute tight enclosures of the possible system states in each time step subject to unknown-but-bounded uncertainties. Most existing methods employ a standard prediction-update framework with set-based prediction and update steps based on various set representations and techniques. However, achieving accurate enclosures for nonlinear systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents new methods based on constrained zonotopes that improve the standard prediction-update framework for systems with invariants by adding a consistency step . This new step uses invariants to reduce conservatism and is enabled by new algorithms for refining constrained zonotopes based on nonlinear constraints. This paper also presents significant improvements to existing prediction and update steps for constrained zonotopes. Specifically, new update algorithms are developed that allow nonlinear measurement equations for the first time, and existing prediction methods based on conservative approximation techniques are modified to allow a more flexible choice of the approximation point, which can lead to tighter enclosures. Numerical results demonstrate that the resulting methods can provide significantly tighter enclosures than existing zonotope-based methods while maintaining comparable efficiency.},

Sufficient identifiability conditions for the unknown parameters are provided in terms of the system model itself, rather than relying on the exact values of optimal states or control inputs. In addition, an elegant algebraic solution is provided for the concerned identification problem that is inherently a challenging optimization problem with trilinear equality constraints, and it can recover the true parameters (up to a scalar ambiguity) in the absence of measurement noise or can consistently identify the parameters (up to a scalar ambiguity) in the presence of white measurement noise. The presented algebraic solution relies on recursive matrix calculations so that its computational burden is much less than directly solving a high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem as done in many existing works.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we provide novel conditions for stability analysis of aperiodically sampled nonlinear control systems subjected to time-varying delay. The proposed approach can also deal with cases in which delay is larger than the sampling interval. It is applicable to a general class of nonlinear systems and provides sufficient criteria for stability that aid in making trade-offs between control performance and the bounds on sampling interval and delay. As a stepping stone, a preliminary and generic result based on dissipativity, is introduced to analyse the exponential stability of a class of feedback-interconnected systems. The nonlinear sampled-data system is remodelled to consider the effects of sampling and delay in the dissipativity framework, as perturbations to the nominal closed-loop system. This leads to constructive stability conditions for a continuous time closed-loop system given by the feedback interconnection of the nominal closed-loop system and an operator(s) that captures the effects of sampling and delay. For Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems, we recover simple Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) and frequency domain conditions previously proposed in the robust control framework.},

Time-advance operations on the output of such systems result in the output dynamics being nonlinearly dependent on the control input and unknown parameters, which leads to three technical issues: implicit relative degree; nonlinearly parameterized uncertainties; and non-affine control input. To address these issues, this paper first employs feedback linearization and implicit function theory to construct a relative degree dependent normal form; then proposes an adaptive parametric reconstruction based method to simultaneously deal with linearly and nonlinearly parameterized uncertainties in the output dynamics; and finally constructs a key implicit function equation to derive a unique adaptive control law which ensures closed-loop stability and asymptotic output tracking. An explicitly iterative solution based adaptive control law is also proposed to ensure closed-loop stability and bounded output tracking within any degree of accuracy. The simulation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive control method.},

We establish a link between observability and a graph representation of measurements among spacecraft. For a system with a beacon or without beacons, it is shown that if a measurement graph topology has graph theoretic equivalence properties with a two-level tree form, the system is second-order and third-order locally weakly observable, respectively. To solve the distributed OD problem, the new interleaved distributed extended Kalman filter (IDEKF) is proposed. Several evaluation cases are designed to demonstrate the influence of measurement topology, number of spacecraft, and orbital configuration on the degree of system observability. Finally, the performance of the IDEKF estimation is illustrated for a ten-spacecraft constellation.},

Each agent is modeled by a higher-order strict-feedback continuous-time system with unknown nonlinearities and external disturbance, and only the first state variable being measurable. Extended state observers (ESOs) are used to estimate the unmeasurable agent states and the unknown nonlinear dynamics. An ESO-based distributed output feedback protocol with dynamic encoding and decoding is then presented. It is shown that, for a connected undirected network, the proposed protocol guarantees practical output consensus, in which the steady-state consensus error can be made arbitrarily small. The ESO-based protocol also shapes the transient consensus performance, as it is capable of recovering the consensus performance of a linear counterpart with fully measurable states. Furthermore, we prove that for higher-order uncertain nonlinear multi-agent systems, consensus can be achieved with merely one bit information exchange between each pair of adjacent agents at each time step. Finally, simulations on third-order pendulum systems are given, which verify the theoretical results.},

This fact motivates the application of Max-Plus algebra to approximate the value function, central to the Bellman Equation and thus also to reinforcement learning. This article proposes conditions so that this approach can be done in a simple way and following the philosophy of reinforcement learning: explore the environment, receive the rewards and use this information to improve the knowledge of the value function.

With such a new control scheme, the plant-model matching condition is achievable as with an output or state feedback MRAC design. A stable adaptive control scheme is developed based on LDS decomposition of the plant high-frequency gain matrix, which guarantees closed-loop stability and asymptotic output tracking. The proposed partial-state feedback MRAC scheme not only expands the existing family of MRAC, but also provides new features to the adaptive control system, including additional design flexibility and feedback capacity. Based on its additional design flexibility, a minimal-order MRAC scheme is also presented, which reduces the control adaptation complexity and relaxes the feedback information requirement, compared to the existing MRAC schemes. New results are presented for plant-model matching, error model, adaptive law and stability analysis.

We introduce a Riemannian approximate Newton method tailored to the LF problem, as an exact solution method guaranteeing monotonic descent and local superlinear convergence rate. Extensive numerical comparisons on several test networks illustrate that the proposed method outperforms standard Riemannian optimization methods (Gradient Descent, Newton’s), and achieves comparable performance with the traditional Newton–Raphson method (in Euclidean coordinates), albeit besting it by a guarantee to convergence. We also consider an approximate LF solution obtained by the first iteration of the proposed method, and we show that it significantly outperforms other approximants in the LF literature.

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider distributed adaptive stabilization for uncertain multivariable linear systems with a time-varying diagonal matrix gain. We show that uncertain multivariable linear systems are stabilizable by diagonal matrix high gains if the system matrix is an H-matrix with positive diagonal entries. Based on matrix measure and stability theory for diagonally dominant systems, we consider two classes of uncertain linear systems, and derive a threshold condition to ensure their exponential stability by a monotonically increasing diagonal gain matrix. When each individual gain function in the matrix gain is updated by state-dependent functions using only local state information, the boundedness and convergence of both system states and adaptive matrix gains are guaranteed. We apply the adaptive distributed stabilization approach to adaptive synchronization control for large-scale complex networks consisting of nonlinear node dynamics and time-varying coupling weights. A unified framework for adaptive synchronization is proposed that includes several general design approaches for adaptive coupling weights to guarantee network synchronization.},

We then present some results implementing the proposed method to an example and propose some variants that may help in reducing possible numerical issues.

The unknown dynamical system is expressed as a basis-function expansion, where a connection to the GP makes it possible to systematically assign priors to the basis-function weights. The approach is formulated within the sequential Monte Carlo framework, wherein each particle retains its own weights of the basis functions, which are updated recursively as measurements arrive. We report competitive results when compared to a state-of-the art offline Bayesian learning method. We also apply the method to a case study concerning tire-friction estimation. The results indicate that our method can accurately learn the tire friction using automotive-grade sensors in an online setting, and quickly detect sudden changes on the road surface.},

A fundamental question is whether a quantum sensor is capable of uniquely inferring unknown parameters in a system for a given structure of the quantum sensor and admissible measurement on the sensor. In this paper, we investigate the capability of a class of quantum sensors which consist of either a single qubit or two qubits. A quantum sensor is coupled to a spin chain system to extract information of unknown parameters in the system. With given initialization and measurement schemes, we employ the similarity transformation approach and the Gröbner basis method to prove that a single-qubit quantum sensor cannot effectively estimate the unknown parameters in the spin chain system while the two-qubit quantum sensor can. The work demonstrates that it is a feasible method to enhance the capability of quantum sensors by increasing the number of qubits in the quantum sensors for some practical applications.},

The closed-loop performance improvement is accomplished by applying a finite-difference uncertainty observer, and embedding the measure of uncertainty compensation in the error dynamics. The steady-state error band, absolute attracting layer and the monotone decreasing region of the error dynamics are derived in detail. The experimental result verifies not only the ease and efficiency in controller design, by the discretized FTS approach, but also the attractiveness and robustness properties assured in the closed-loop system.},

The communication range of the clustered agents is such that they can form a connected undirected graph topology. The total cost in this optimization problem is the sum of the local convex costs of the subagents of each cluster. We seek a minimizer of this cost subject to a set of affine equality constraints, and a set of affine inequality constraints specifying the bounds on the decision variables if such bounds exist. We design our distributed algorithm in a cluster-based framework which results in a significant reduction in communication and computation costs. Our proposed distributed solution is a novel continuous-time algorithm that is linked to the augmented Lagrangian approach. It converges asymptotically when the local cost functions are convex and exponentially when they are strongly convex and have Lipschitz gradients. Moreover, we use an ϵ -exact penalty function to address the inequality constraints and derive an explicit lower bound on the penalty function weight to guarantee convergence to ϵ -neighborhood of the global minimum value of the cost. A numerical example demonstrates our results.},

Then, three MHDs in such class, namely ordinary MHD, minimal MHD and quasi-minimal MHD, are provided as upper bounds of Rao distance on MED manifold by specifically, optimally and sub-optimally specifying parameter respectively. The second one can be efficiently computed numerically owing to its convexity with respect to the scalar parameter, and the third one has an explicit form.

We consider the case where each controller in the decentralized setting has its own sampling and actuation frequency, which translates to asynchrony between sensors and actuators. Additionally, asynchrony may be induced by delays between the sampling instants and actuation update instants as relevant in a networked context. The decentralized, asynchronous LTI system is represented as the feedback interconnection of a continuous-time LTI system operator and an operator that captures the effects of asynchrony induced by sampling and delay. By characterizing the properties of the operators using small-gain type Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQC), we provide criteria for exponential stability of the asynchronous, decentralized LTI state-space models. The approach provided in this paper considers two scenarios, namely the ‘large-delay’ case and the ‘small-delay’ case where the delays are larger and smaller than the sampling interval, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed results is corroborated by a numerical example.},

One of the main contributions of this study is the extension of the universal approximation property of neural networks for continuous homogeneous systems. Another contribution is the development of a differential non-parametric identifier based on the novel concept of homogeneous neural networks. The adjustment laws for the weights are obtained from a Lyapunov stability analysis taking homogeneity properties of the system into account. The ultimate boundedness of the origin for the identification error is demonstrated using the persistent excitation condition. The effectiveness of the proposed identifier is verified by the simulation of the three-tank homogeneous model. In this example, the proposed identification scheme is compared with a classical ANN identifier, and we present a statistical analysis of such comparison. It is shown in simulations that the identification error of the proposed homogeneous algorithm has faster convergence and less oscillations.},

  abstract     = {The transfer of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques into real-world applications is challenged by safety requirements in the presence of physical limitations. Most RL methods, in particular the most popular algorithms, do not support explicit consideration of state and input constraints. In this paper, we address this problem for nonlinear systems with continuous state and input spaces by introducing a predictive safety filter, which is able to turn a constrained dynamical system into an unconstrained safe system and to which any RL algorithm can be applied ‘out-of-the-box’. The predictive safety filter receives the proposed control input and decides, based on the current system state, if it can be safely applied to the real system, or if it has to be modified otherwise. Safety is thereby established by a continuously updated safety policy, which is based on a model predictive control formulation using a data-driven system model and considering state and input dependent uncertainties.},

  abstract     = {Complex networks are a successful framework to describe collective behaviour in many applications, but a notable gap remains in the current literature, that of proving asymptotic convergence in networks of piecewise-smooth systems. Indeed, a wide variety of physical systems display discontinuous dynamics that change abruptly, including dry friction mechanical oscillators, electrical power converters, and biological neurons. In this paper, we study how to enforce global asymptotic state-synchronization in these networks. Specifically, we propose the addition of a distributed discontinuous coupling action to the commonly used diffusive coupling protocol. Moreover, we provide analytical estimates of the thresholds on the coupling gains required for convergence, and highlight the importance of a new graph connectivity measure, termed as minimum density . The theoretical results are illustrated by a set of representative examples.},

It is the first time to introduce the novel time-varying Integral Barrier Lyapunov functions (TVIBLFs) into the adaptive control design, which not only overcomes the limitation of conservatism existing in the traditional BLFs, but also guarantees that the full state time-varying constraint bounds are not violated. The TVIBLFs are combined with the backstepping design procedure to construct the controllers and adaptation laws, and the integral mean value theorem is used to differentiate TVIBLFs. It can be proven that all the states are forced in the time-varying regions and the stability of the closed-loop system is achieved.

Particularly, the control inputs can be a general setting of heterogeneous control gains for the agents’ couplings. The main contributions in this paper are as follows: First, for the digraph being any unidirectional digraph (i.e., the corresponding Laplacian of the digraph can be expressed as an upper or lower triangular matrix if with proper numbering sequence of the agents) that contains a directed spanning-tree, we show that the necessary and sufficient condition for exponential convergence to consensus is that these gains can be merely arbitrarily positive. Second, for the digraph being generally weighted and strongly-connected (this type of the digraph includes all undirected and connected graphs), we provide the analytical lower-bounds of the heterogeneous gains for exponential convergence to consensus, whose bounds are less conservative than existing analytical results. Further, we propose the notion of the heterogeneity-metric to characterize the heterogeneity-degree of the heterogeneous gains and the notion of the maximum-heterogeneity-degree (MHD), and for the heterogeneous gains with the constraint of a designated MHD, we provide the conditions for exponential convergence to consensus, whose results are novel. Finally, we show the relation between the MHD constraint and the lower-bounds of the gains for exponential consensus.},

  abstract     = {We address the problem of optimizing the performance of a dynamic system while satisfying hard safety constraints at all times. Implementing an optimal control solution is limited by the computational cost required to derive it in real time, especially when constraints become active, as well as the need to rely on simple linear dynamics, simple objective functions, and ignoring noise. The recently proposed Control Barrier Function (CBF) method may be used for safety-critical control at the expense of sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we develop a real-time control framework that combines optimal trajectories generated through optimal control with the computationally efficient CBF method providing safety guarantees. We use Hamiltonian analysis to obtain a tractable optimal solution for a linear or linearized system, then employ High Order CBFs (HOCBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) to account for constraints with arbitrary relative degrees and to track the optimal state, respectively. We further show how to deal with noise in arbitrary relative degree systems. The proposed framework is then applied to the optimal traffic merging problem for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) where the objective is to jointly minimize the travel time and energy consumption of each CAV subject to speed, acceleration, and speed-dependent safety constraints. In addition, when considering more complex objective functions, nonlinear dynamics and passenger comfort requirements for which analytical optimal control solutions are unavailable, we adapt the HOCBF method to such problems. Simulation examples are included to compare the performance of the proposed framework to optimal solutions (when available) and to a baseline provided by human-driven vehicles with results showing significant improvements in all metrics.},

  abstract     = {In order to identify one system (module) in an interconnected dynamic network, one typically has to solve a Multi-Input-Single-Output (MISO) identification problem that requires identification of all modules in the MISO setup. For application of a parametric identification method this would require estimating a large number of parameters, as well as an appropriate model order selection step for a possibly large scale MISO problem, thereby increasing the computational complexity of the identification algorithm to levels that are beyond feasibility. An alternative identification approach is presented employing regularized kernel-based methods. Keeping a parametric model for the module of interest, we model the impulse response of the remaining modules in the MISO structure as zero mean Gaussian processes (GP) with a covariance matrix (kernel) given by the first-order stable spline kernel, accounting for the noise model affecting the output of the target module and also for possible instability of systems in the MISO setup. Using an Empirical Bayes (EB) approach the target module parameters are estimated through an Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm with a substantially reduced computational complexity, while avoiding extensive model structure selection. Numerical simulations illustrate the potentials of the introduced method in comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques for local module identification.},

By introducing two new algorithms, a simpler one based on dynamic averaging of the estimates and a more complex version where local error covariance matrices are exchanged as well, we are able to derive a complete theoretical analysis. In particular we show that dynamic averaging alone suffices to approximate the optimal centralized estimate if the number of consensus steps is large enough and that the number of consensus steps needed for stability can be computed in a distributed way. These results shed light on the advantages as well as the fundamental limitations shared by all the existing proposals for this class of algorithms in the basic case of linear time-invariant systems, that are relevant for the analysis of more complex situations.},

We develop necessary and sufficient conditions on the existence of an invariant cover for a polytopic set of states. The conditions can be checked by solving a set of linear programs, one for each extreme point of the state set. Based on these conditions, we give upper and lower bounds on the minimal cardinality of the invariant cover, and design an iterative algorithm with finite-time convergence to compute an invariant cover.

Then, a novel Lyapunov function type is constructed to analyze the L 2 -gain performance with the quantization and packet dropout effects. Furthermore, owing to the proposed method, the Zeno phenomenon resulting from the transmission instants and updates of quantizer are prevented by introducing a minimum inter-event time.

The cascade controller consists of an inner loop and an outer loop that are interconnected by a suitable mapping. The inner loop is tasked to control the attitude of the vectorized thrusters. The outer loop is designed to steer the task configuration of the system to a desired pose, while providing to the inner loop the desired attitude through a mapping. To prove the stability of the interconnected system, input-to-state stability (ISS) and small gain arguments are used. All stability properties are derived in the absence of constraints and are shown to be local. Hence, the control scheme is augmented with a Reference Governor (RG) to enforce constraints at all times. Simulations on an unmanned tiltrotor docked to a stationary platform for a refueling operation are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control framework.},

The probabilistic input constraints are transformed into a convex hull of linear feedback laws, therefore, can make the controller design less conservative.

The probabilistic input saturations are dealt with a distributed fashion by developing an iterative algorithm of the DMPC.

It is shown that the necessary and sufficient conditions can be checked in practice in the first case and, under slightly more restrictive hypotheses, also in the second case by means of algorithmic procedures, which also provide a method to synthesize the observer sought for. The employed methodology makes use of geometric concepts to reveal the structural aspects of the problem and to derive its solutions.

In this work, finite-horizon and discrete-time LQR is solved under stability constraints and uncertain system dynamics. The resulting feedback controller balances cost value and closed-loop stability. Robustness of the solution is modeled using the scenario approach, without requiring any probabilistic description of the uncertainty in the system matrices. The new methods are tested and compared on the Leslie growth model, where we control population size while minimizing a suitable finite-horizon cost function.},

In general, continuous-time GSOF controllers designed by conventional methods, i.e. so-called change-of-variables using PDLFs, depend on the derivatives of scheduling parameters, and discrete-time GSOF controllers designed by conventional methods or extended Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) technique using parameter-dependent auxiliary matrices both depend on the one-step-ahead scheduling parameters. These mean that the designed GSOF controllers are not implementable to practical systems due to the non-causality w.r.t. scheduling parameters. On this issue, we propose a formulation which circumvents the causality problem by replacing the term that introduces the causality issue with another term via the reverse use of the Elimination lemma which is also known as “S-variable” approach. A toy example and a practical example (lateral-directional motion control around wing level flight of JAXA’s research airplane MuPAL- α ) are included to demonstrate the effectiveness compared to the existing methods.},

Based on some assumptions of the classic hard sphere model, this paper presents a novel multi-agent system for chemical self-assembly that can be formulated as a group of stochastic differential equations. In consideration of this model, an existence and uniqueness theorem of the solution is presented. An optimal problem is proposed by taking the temperature as the control input and choosing the Hamiltonian as the optimal object, and a numerical solution for this optimal problem is also developed. Simulations show that the proposed control scheme can greatly improve the product of self-assembly.},

We assume that a malicious intruder can increase the firing delay of transitions by adding delay in communication, or corrupt the transmitted data. Our target is to design a transition protecting policy to guarantee that the global performance does not drop below a given lower-bound threshold. Two classes of situations are considered: (1) the operator does not know the capability of the intruder, which means that all possible attacks must be taken into account; (2) the operator knows the upper bound of the capability of the intruder, e.g., the maximal number of transitions that can be simultaneously attacked. For the former case, we develop an algorithm using mixed integer linear programming to obtain an optimal protecting policy. For the latter situation, we develop a heuristic method to compute a protecting policy that is locally optimal.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on designing, via the minimization of a suitable cost function, an input sequence to guarantee active fault diagnosis (AFD) of discrete-time linear parameter-varying systems regardless of how the scheduling variables change in the scheduling set. Convex polyhedrons are used to characterize the sets of system uncertainties such that the designed input sequence leads to outputs which are consistent with a unique fault mode or healthy mode. Considering the smoothness and energy of the input sequence simultaneously, the optimal input sequence is obtained by solving a family of linear constrained quadratic programming (LCQP) problems in a brute-force way, which will lead to inefficiency when the number of facets of the interest region becomes large. In order to handle this problem, by analyzing a geometric property of the objective function, the original optimization problem is shown to be equivalent to the minimization of the radius of a hypersphere containing the origin based on a simple linear mapping, which is much more efficient than the brute force-based resolution. At the end of this paper, a numerical example and a vehicle model are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Essentially different from the systems in the related literature, control input appears in the ODE subsystem rather than in the PDE one, and moreover, the actuator dynamics are nonlinear and possess uncertainties rather than linear without uncertainty. Note that the existing control schemes so far are ineffective to handle such systems, and hence the stabilization problem for these systems is still unsolved. For this, backstepping approaches in both infinite and finite-dimension are smartly combined with the adaptive dynamic compensation technique in order to solve the control problem. Specifically, by using an infinite-dimensional backstepping transformation and its inverse, the original PDE subsystem is first changed to a new one from which control design is much convenient. Then, based on the new system together with the actuator dynamics, an adaptive state-feedback controller is explicitly constructed by using a couple of finite-dimensional backstepping transformations, which guarantees that all the states of the resulting closed-loop systems are bounded. Moreover, both the control input and the states of the original system converge to zero ultimately. Finally, a simulation example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the established theoretical results.},

The developed framework permits that the consensusability problem can be solved when the agents’ models are completely unavailable.

The proposed compensators can also stabilise a non-square or a non-NI square plant in a positive feedback loop. Moreover, the compensators can be utilised to design a simple constant reference tracking scheme exploiting the integral controllability propoerty of SSNI systems. Subsequently, observer-based pre- and post-compensators are developed to handle the cases when some of the system states are not available for direct measurement. Then, the compensation schemes are extended to stable, non-square or non-NI square systems with polytopic uncertainty.

In this way, the closed-loop system remains the same, but extra degrees of freedom can be exploited in the proposed synthesis conditions. These conditions are described in terms of optimization problems having Linear Matrix Inequalities as constraints. Unlike other methods in the literature, all system matrices can depend on the scheduling parameter and, furthermore, the proposed approach is capable of determining a static output feedback control gain by with a one-phase one optimization problem.

Since standard backstepping approach cannot be applied, an affine Volterra integral transform is introduced which allows for the construction of a boundary controller for the PIDE and delay compensation. An observer backstepping transformation containing four kernels is realized, reconstructing the states throughout the delayed measurement. By the use of the backstepping method, a set of coupled kernel equations where one of the kernels has two boundary conditions is established. The existence and invertibility for the control and observer transformations are proved and the finite-time stability for the output system is established while results are illustrated by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to solve a distributed resource allocation problem with binary local constraints. The problem is formulated as a binary program with a cost function defined by the summation of agent costs plus a global mismatch/penalty term. We propose a modification of the Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) dynamics in order to solve this problem while incorporating a novel Newton-like weighting factor. This addition lends itself to fast avoidance of saddle points, which the gradient-like HNN is susceptible to. Turning to a multi-agent setting, we reformulate the problem and develop a distributed implementation of the Newton-like dynamics. We show that if a local solution to the distributed reformulation is obtained, it is also a local solution to the centralized problem. A main contribution of this work is to show that the probability of converging to a saddle point of an appropriately defined energy function in both the centralized and distributed settings is zero under light assumptions. Finally, we enlarge our algorithm with an annealing technique which gradually learns a feasible binary solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods are competitive with centralized greedy and SDP relaxation approaches in terms of solution quality, while the main advantage of our approach is a significant improvement in runtime over the SDP relaxation method and the distributed quality of implementation.},

The approach relies on the emulation of backstepping control along with a suitable triggering condition which establishes the time instants at which the control value needs to be updated. In this paper, it is shown that under the proposed event-triggered boundary control, there exists a minimal dwell-time (independent of the initial condition) between two triggering times and furthermore the well-posedness and global exponential stability are guaranteed. The analysis follows small-gain arguments and builds on recent papers on sampled-data control for this kind of PDE. A simulation example is presented to validate the theoretical results.},

In this problem setup, a remote estimator receives measurement data transmitted from multiple sensors over individual channels. By the method of Markovian jump linear systems, an optimal stationary estimator that minimizes the error variance in the steady state is obtained, based on the mean-square (MS) stabilizing solution to the coupled algebraic Riccati equations (CAREs). An explicit necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the existence of the MS stabilizing solution, which coincides with that of the standard Kalman filter. More importantly, we provide a sufficient condition under which the MS detectability with multiple Markovian packet drop channels can be decoupled, and propose a locally optimal stationary estimator but computationally more tractable. Analytic sufficient and necessary MS detectability conditions are presented for the decoupled subsystems subsequently. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the results on the MS stabilizing solution, the MS detectability, and the performance of the optimal and locally optimal stationary estimators.},

Different from the existing set-based AFD methods, the proposed AFD method designs an input at each time instant by solving a two-layer optimization problem. At each time instant, an input is designed such that the output sets estimated by the SVOs at the next time instant keep away from each other as far as possible. With this idea, faults can be diagnosed after a sufficiently long period by designing and injecting inputs into the system online. The key point of the proposed AFD method is to establish a logic describing the process keeping a group of output estimation sets asymptotically away from each other as far as possible, which is done by formulating a two-layer optimization problem to simultaneously optimize the center distances and sizes of output estimation sets. At the end, a case study is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Some geometric properties for the solution of the MTIP are presented, showing that the solution paths must lie in a sufficient family of 4 candidates. Necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality of each candidate are established. By employing the geometric properties, it is found that the 4 candidates are determined by the zeros of some real-valued functions when the target’s velocity is constant. In order to compute all the 4 candidates, the derivatives of these real-valued functions are transformed to polynomials so that the extrema of those real-valued functions can be computed by standard polynomial solvers. This allows employing a simple bisection method to find all the 4 candidates. Since the MTIP with a constant target’s velocity is equivalent to the path planning problem of Dubins vehicle in a constant drift field, developing such an algorithm also enables efficiently finding the shortest Dubins path in a constant drift field.

Moreover, the uncertain transition rates in the considered switched semi-Markovian process include two cases of indeterminate bounded and thoroughly unknown, rather than the common single partially unknown case. Particularly, the designed composite controller that ensures that the closed-loop system achieves stochastic admissible is easier to calculate than the related working methods.

Smart sensors transmit innovations to a remote estimator through a wireless communication network, where transmitted data can be intercepted and manipulated by attackers. To bypass the false data detector, the attack sequence should satisfy the stealthiness constraint. Instead of utilizing only the current innovation, the historical data are also used for designing the attack policy at each sampling instant. With a finite horizon of historical data used, the evolution of the estimation error covariance at the remote estimator is obtained, and the optimal attack that yields the largest estimation error is derived analytically. To reduce the online computational burden, the optimal attack using sparse combinations of historical innovations is also designed. In addition, the optimal attacks on protected systems with encryption-based countermeasures are analyzed. If encryption resources are sufficient, there always exists such a countermeasure that can completely prevent the stealthy attacks based on historical data. Numerical comparisons illustrate the theoretical results.},

The ODS-based control strategy minimizes the difference between the microrobot velocity and an integral line-of-sight (ILOS)-based reference vector field while respecting the magnetic saturation constraints and ensuring the absolute continuity of the control input. Due to the embedded integral action in the reference vector field, the microswimmer will follow the desired straight line by compensating for the drift effect of the environmental disturbances as well as the microswimmer weight.},

The main merits of the sufficient conditions are that (i) the ISS-Lyapunov function can be non-exponential; (ii) average dwell-time condition is imposed to restrict the occurrence frequency of impulses; (iii) the effects of destabilizing or stabilizing impulses can be explicitly shown compared with the existing works about the stability of mild solutions to impulsive stochastic infinite dimensional systems by the fixed point approach.

The agents under investigation are described as linear singularly perturbed dynamics representing a wide class of physical systems characterized by processes evolving on two time-scales. The collaborative decentralized control is achieved using only output information from neighboring agents and considering that the only available graph information consists in its connectivity, that is, there is no centralized information related to the interconnection network structure. As methodology, the synchronization problem is rewritten as a dynamic output feedback robust stabilization of a singularly perturbed uncertain linear system with guaranteed cost. We show that these problems can be solved by using convex conditions expressed by LMIs and by decoupling the slow and fast dynamics. As an advantage, the fast dynamic matrix can be singular (nonstandard systems) and unstable. The proposed conditions circumvent some drawbacks of the existing works on this topic by providing a dynamic controller that does not depend on the singular parameter or by allowing the design of slow controllers when the fast system is stable. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol and design method.},

The purpose is to explore conditions for subsystem dynamics and network topologies under which for almost all weights of the subsystem interaction links, the corresponding numerical NRCSs are controllable, which is called structurally controllable. Three types of subsystem interaction fashions are considered: (1) each subsystem is single-input–single-output (SISO), (2) each subsystem is multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO), and the weights for all channels between two subsystems are identical, and (3) each subsystem is MIMO, but different channels between two subsystems can be weighted differently. We show that all parameter-dependent modes of the NRCSs are generically controllable under some necessary connectivity conditions. We then derive necessary and/or sufficient conditions for structural controllability depending on subsystem dynamics and network topologies’ connectivity in a decoupled form for all the three interaction fashions. We also extend our results to handle certain subsystem heterogeneities and demonstrate their direct applications on some practical systems, including the mass–spring–damper system and the power network.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of stochastic reachability of a target tube for a discrete-time, stochastic dynamical system with bounded control authority. We propose grid-free algorithms to compute under- and over-approximations of the stochastic reach set, and a corresponding feedback-based controller associated with a given likelihood. Our approach employs set-theoretic (Lagrangian) techniques for nonlinear systems with affine stochastic disturbances. With available set computation tools, these algorithms can only be implemented on linear systems. We use the law of total probability to partition the potentially unbounded disturbance set, and compute minimal and maximal reach sets via a robust approach. We propose a heuristic to partition the disturbance set using an ellipsoid when the disturbance is Gaussian, and a polyhedron otherwise. For linear dynamics and convex and compact sets, we employ existing tools from support functions and robust linear programming to efficiently approximate the stochastic reach set. We synthesize an admissible controller using the disturbance minimal reach sets by solving a series of linear programs. We demonstrate our approach on systems with linear dynamics (time-invariant and time-varying) and arbitrary disturbances (as well as Gaussian), including trajectory following for a Dubin’s vehicle and space vehicle rendezvous and docking.},

The auxiliary output is defined as the derivative of the continuous-time input function, while the auxiliary input is defined as the input disturbance caused by the sampling or equivalently the integral of the auxiliary output over the sampling period. As a result, it forms a cyclic mapping from the input to the output via the system dynamics and back from the output to the input via the integral. The event-triggered law is constructed to make the mapping contractive such that the stabilization is achieved and an easy-to-check Zeno-free condition is provided.

The state of the system is a part of this information, however it is challenging to extract it from such measurements. An autonomous system cannot use traditional feedback control algorithms without knowledge of the state. We propose computational algorithms for the analysis and synthesis of classifier-enabled control architectures. We show how to train classifiers based on criteria that relate to both learning from data and properties of the resulting closed-loop system. The approach to deriving these algorithms involves modeling the resulting closed-loop system as a piecewise affine differential inclusion. The training method is based on the projected gradient descent algorithm. An application of this method to a navigation problem for a mobile robot demonstrates the capabilities of this approach.},

Both the aforementioned problems may be formulated as angle optimization problems, which can then be solved to obtain exact closed-form solutions. Since the proposed framework preserves the special nonlinear geometry associated with the space of attitudes, and since we present analytic solutions, the proposed framework yields faster and more accurate solutions than those that are based upon linearization techniques. Furthermore, the framework may be extended beyond traditional output error least-squares, to accommodate other practical, but unconventional, optimality metrics. Of special note, we may generalize the classic vector Triad solution, which uses a primary and a secondary measurement, to one with multiple secondary measurements. Lastly, the presented method can be used to derive previous solutions under a single unifying framework, and thus establishes how they are related to each other in a fundamental way.

Lightweight SEA robots, along with low-impedance control, can maneuver without causing damage in uncertain, confined spaces such as inside an aircraft wing during aircraft assembly. Nevertheless, substantial modeling uncertainties in SEA robots reduce the precision achieved by model-based approaches such as inversion-based feedforward. Therefore, this article improves the precision of SEA robots around specified operating points, through a multi-input multi-output (MIMO), iterative learning control (ILC) approach. The main contributions of this article are to (i)┬Āintroduce an input-weighted complex kernel to estimate local MIMO models using complex Gaussian process regression (c-GPR); (ii)┬Ādevelop Ger┼Īgorin-theorem-based conditions on the iteration gains for ensuring ILC convergence to precision within noise-related limits, even with errors in the estimated model; and (iii)┬Ādemonstrate precision positioning with an experimental SEA robot. Comparative experimental results, with and without ILC, show around 90\% improvement in the positioning precision (close to the repeatability limit of the robot) and a 10-times increase in the SEA robotŌĆÖs operating speed with the use of the MIMO ILC.},

With outputs information of neighbors, the local reference generator of each agent is constructed to generate corresponding virtual tracking trajectory belonging to the convex hull spanned by dynamic leaders. Based on the reference generator, we utilize the nonlinear function approximation method and dynamic gain scaling technique to design the linear-like distributed adaptive output feedback controller. The proposed scheme can significantly relax conditions on nonlinearities with time delays, and greatly simplify the controller design procedure. Using a novel lemma, it is proved that the containment errors can converge to an arbitrarily small compact set and the resulting closed-loop system is semi-globally stable. In addition, if uncertain nonlinearities can be modeled as the product of unknown constant parameters and known functions, the global containment control can be achieved. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we propose a solution to the problem of parameter estimation of nonlinearly parameterized regressions – continuous or discrete time – and apply it for adaptive control. We restrict our attention to parameterizations that can be factorized as the product of two functions, a measurable one and a nonlinear function of the parameters to be estimated. Although in this case it is possible to define an extended vector of unknown parameters to get a linear regression, it is well-known that overparameterization suffers from some severe shortcomings. Another feature of the proposed estimator is that parameter convergence is ensured with an excitation assumption that is strictly weaker than persistency of excitation. It is assumed that, after a coordinate change, some of the elements of the transformed function satisfy a monotonicity condition. The proposed estimators are applied to design adaptive controllers for nonlinearly parameterized systems. In continuous-time we consider a general class of nonlinear systems and those described by Euler–Lagrange models, while in discrete-time we apply the method to the challenging problem of indirect adaptive pole-placement. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated with several classical examples, which are traditionally tackled using below par performance overparameterization and assuming persistency of excitation.},

In practice, a given ideal specification might be impossible to meet. In that case, it is interesting for the system designer to be able to quantify the distance between achievable behaviors and the specification, and to synthesize the least-violating controller enforcing the closed-loop behavior that is the closest to a correct one. In this paper, we develop such an approach for three types of specifications: safety, uniform reachability and uniform attractivity. We define controllability measures associated to these properties. For finite transition systems, we present dynamic programming algorithms for the computation of these measures and of the associated least-violating controllers. We discuss how these results can be used to synthesize controllers for infinite transition systems via symbolic control techniques. To demonstrate the relevance of our approach, we show an application to adaptive cruise control.},

Our previous work designed a boundary feedback control to stabilize the phase interface position modeled by the Stefan system. This paper resolves two issues our previous work did not study, that are, the robustness analysis under the unknown heat loss and the digital control action. First, we introduce the one-phase Stefan problem with a heat loss by modeling a 1-D diffusion Partial Differential Equation (PDE) dynamics of the liquid temperature and the interface position governed by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) with a time-varying disturbance. We focus on the closed-loop system under the control law proposed in our previous work, and show an estimate of L 2 norm in a sense of Input-to-State Stability (ISS) with respect to the unknown heat loss. Second, we consider the sampled-data control of the one-phase Stefan problem without the heat loss, by applying Zero-Order-Hold (ZOH) to the control law in our previous work. We prove that the closed-loop system under the sampled-data control law satisfies the global exponential stability in the spatial L 2 norm. Analogous ISS result for the two-phase Stefan problem which incorporates the dynamics of the solid phase is also obtained. Numerical simulation verifies our theoretical results for showing the robust performance under the heat loss and the digital control implemented to vary at each sampling time.},

One possible way to avoid information leakage is to encrypt the transmitted data all the time. However, this may impose an extra operation energy burden on the sensor. In this paper, we investigate the optimal encryption scheduling in order to protect data privacy and ensure estimation accuracy under an energy constraint. Specifically, the sensor computes its local state estimate and then quantizes it using a non-subtractively dithered quantizer. Before each transmission, the sensor determines whether encrypting the data or not in order to strike a balance between data privacy and estimation accuracy. As the information about eavesdropper is unknown to the estimator, we introduce the concept of eavesdropper-invariant schedules and derive associated structural results. In addition, we propose a practical algorithm that compares a finite number of points to obtain an ε -optimal encryption schedule. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate performance benefits of the proposed methods.},

It is proved that these objectives can be achieved by a second order controller with adequate jerk resettings and a special crossing manifold. The solution is justified with the help of an intuitive geometrical approach (spherical projection of trajectories). The nominal solution is robustified as a hybrid system and simulations show satisfactory performance under output disturbances and state measurement uncertainty. The proposal is compared to several finite-time controllers previously developed in the literature.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the Nash equilibrium seeking problem for non-cooperative games subject to set and nonlinear inequality constraints. The cost function for each player and the constrained function are determined by all the players’ decision variables. Each player is assigned a constrained set while all the players are subject to a coupling nonlinear inequality constraint. A continuous-time distributed seeking algorithm using local information interaction is proposed, where the players deliver/receive information unidirectionally over a directed network. In particular, a distributed observer is first introduced for each player to estimate all the others’ decision variables. Then, by using these estimates, a seeking algorithm is synthesized with a projection operator. Based on the time-scale separation approach, it is shown that the proposed continuous-time distributed seeking algorithm guarantees the convergence of the strategy profile to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the generalized Nash equilibrium satisfying a KKT condition. An illustrative example is finally presented to validate the theoretical results.},

They are matrix valued functions of the state trajectory (i.e. the initial state and input trajectory), and it is difficult to find them as functions of the initial state and input. The main result of this paper is to show that for a fixed state trajectory, it is possible to compute the values of these Gramians by using impulse and initial state responses of the variational system. Therefore, balanced truncation is doable along the fixed state trajectory without solving nonlinear partial differential equations, differently from conventional nonlinear balancing methods. We further develop an approximation method, which only requires trajectories of the original nonlinear systems.},

To explore the stabilizing effect of the time delay in the discrete-time dynamics, a switched impulsive system approach is developed to establish non-conservative stability criteria for linear impulsive systems with periodic impulses and constant delay. Subsequently, sufficient conditions are given for stability of the impulsive systems with aperiodic impulses and time-varying delay by quasi-periodic Lyapunov function methods. By exploiting the particular structure of the stability conditions, impulsive stabilization problem using artificial impulse-delay is further discussed. These results are applied to sampled-data systems with input delay. Compared with the well-known input-delay approach, the proposed switched impulsive system approach not only provides simple stability conditions but also captures the stabilizing effect of the delay.

A measure of mean overall node state uncertainty evaluated over a finite period is to be minimized by controlling the motion of a cooperating team of agents. To address this problem, we propose an event-driven receding horizon control approach that is computationally efficient, distributed and on-line. The proposed controller differs from the existing on-line gradient-based parametric controllers and off-line greedy cycle search methods that often lead to either low-performing local optima or computationally intensive centralized solutions. A critical novel element in this controller is that it automatically optimizes its planning horizon length, thus making it parameter-free. We show that explicit globally optimal solutions can be obtained for every distributed optimization problem encountered at each event where the receding horizon controller is invoked. Numerical results are provided showing improvements compared to state of the art distributed on-line parametric control solutions.},

  abstract     = {In privacy-preserving controller design, there is usually a trade-off between the privacy level and control performances, and we show in this paper that this trade-off in particular determines a lower bound on the differential privacy level of the closed-loop system. The control task we consider is reference tracking in a plug-and-play setting, and the plant under control is a networked system of modules, each of which has no access to the models of the others. For a module, we first identify the whole set of tracking local controllers based on the Youla parametrization. At the same time, each module, to protect its own privacy, tries to prevent the other interconnected modules to identify its private information; in this context, for example, the tracking reference signal (say, the target production amount if each module is a workshop in a factory) can be viewed as a piece of private information. Each module can tune the parameters of its local controller to increase the privacy level of its reference signal. However, if the distribution of Laplace (resp. uniform) noise is fixed, the differential privacy level of a Laplace (resp. uniform) mechanism cannot be further improved from a ceiling value no matter how one tunes parameters. In other words, for modular systems under local reference tracking control, there is a lower bound on the differential privacy level.},

We first present a novel mode and switch-dependent integral switching surface, based upon which the resulting sliding mode dynamics (SMD) only suffers from the unmatched perturbation that is not amplified in the Euclidean norm sense. To overcome the difficulty of synthesizing the nominal controller, we rewrite the SMD into the equivalent descriptor form. By virtue of the fixed-point principle and stochastic system theory, we give a rigorous proof for the existence and uniqueness of the solution and the mean-square exponential admissibility for the transformed SMD. A generalized framework that covers arbitrary switching and Markov switching of the TPs as special cases is further achieved. Then, by analyzing the stochastic reachability of the sliding motion, we synthesize a mode and switch-dependent SMC law. The adaptive technique is further integrated to estimate the unavailable boundaries of the matched perturbation. Finally, simulation results on an electronic circuit system confirm the validity and benefits of the developed control strategy.},

In network models with delay, the delayed channels are low-dimensional and accounting for this heterogeneity is not possible in the DDE framework. In addition, DDEs cannot be used to model difference equations. Furthermore, estimation and control of systems in DDE format has proven challenging, despite decades of study. In this paper, we examine alternative representations for systems with delay and provide formulae for conversion between representations. First, we examine the Differential-Difference (DDF) formulation which allows us to represent the low-dimensional nature of delayed information. Next, we examine the coupled ODE–PDE formulation, for which backstepping methods have recently become available. Finally, we consider the algebraic Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation, which allows the optimal estimation and control problems to be solved efficiently through the use of recent software packages such as PIETOOLS. In each case, we consider a very general class of delay systems, specifically accounting for all four possible sources of delay — state delay, input delay, output delay, and process delay. We then apply these representations to 3 archetypical network models.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays stocks and futures are traded in electronic order-driven markets, in which orders to buy and sell are centralized in a Limit Order Book (LOB), and LOB provides more information about the stocks than their prices, such as the price dynamics and the prediction probability of the next move. In this paper, we investigate how and why Limit Order Book can improve the trading decision making. We propose a conditional binomial model for a stock price with conditional upward probability based on observations. We formulate the stock portfolio management as an optimization problem with observations, and optimal schemes are given for single-stock and multi-stock portfolios with observations. Compared with the strategies that do not consider the observations, we show that the final expected wealth achieves significant improvements. Finally, two real-data-based examples are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of our schemes. Our work points to a new direction in improving the final wealth in portfolio management; and it illustrates the advantages of event-based optimization approach, which was successfully applied in discrete event dynamics systems.},

  abstract     = {When deploying autonomous agents in unstructured environments over sustained periods of time, adaptability and robustness oftentimes outweigh optimality as a primary consideration. In other words, safety and survivability constraints play a key role and in this paper, we present a novel, constraint-learning framework for control tasks built on the idea of constraints-driven control. However, since control policies that keep a dynamical agent within state constraints over infinite horizons are not always available, this work instead considers constraints that can be satisfied over some finite time horizon T &gt; 0 , which we refer to as limited-duration safety. Consequently, value function learning can be used as a tool to help us find limited-duration safe policies. We show that, in some applications, the existence of limited-duration safe policies is actually sufficient for long-duration autonomy. This idea is illustrated on a swarm of simulated robots that are tasked with covering a given area, but that sporadically need to abandon this task to charge batteries. We show how the battery-charging behavior naturally emerges as a result of the constraints. Additionally, using a cart–pole simulation environment, we show how a control policy can be efficiently transferred from the source task, balancing the pole, to the target task, moving the cart to one direction without letting the pole fall down.},

We extend these ideas to the stochastic setting by employing a highly flexible model for the Hessian and infer its value based on observing noisy gradients.

Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, the predesignated formation tracking performance and stability of the proposed control system have been analyzed without using potential-like functions and function approximation techniques.

Such set exclusion constraints represent obstacles that must be avoided by the motion system. This paper presents a simple and efficient method for solving optimization problems with general set exclusion and implicit constraints. The method embeds the set exclusion constraints in a quadratic penalty framework and solves the inner optimization problems using a proximal algorithm that deals directly with the implicit constraints. We derive convergence results for this method by transforming the generated iterates to points of a reformulated problem with complementarity constraints. Furthermore, the practical application of the solution method is validated in numerical simulations of a model predictive control approach to path planning for a mobile robot. Finally, a runtime comparison with state-of-the-art solvers applied to the problem with complementarity constraints illustrates the efficiency of the proposed method.},

Concretely, a less conservative error estimation between the actual and predicted states is utilized to design the triggering mechanism, leading to a sufficient reduction in the frequency of solving optimal control problems. By introducing a contraction mapping function, the prediction horizon shrinking strategy is proposed to shorten the length of prediction horizon as the state close to the target set, which further reduces the computational complexity of optimal control problems at each triggered instant. Two involved tuning parameters, performance factor and horizon shrinking factor, can be used to achieve a sensible compromise between system properties and energy saving. The sufficient conditions to guarantee the validity and implementations of the proposed algorithm are indispensable and hence investigated technically with reference significance for nonlinear MPCs. The proposed algorithm is shown to ensure recursive feasibility and robust stability, and its efficiency is illustrated through a numerical example.},

Each time instant, a subset of sensors is selected to transmit their measurements to a remote estimator. We formulate an optimization problem, in which a network schedule is searched to minimize a linear combination of the averaged estimation error and the averaged transmission energy consumption. It is shown that the optimal network schedule forms a tree with root at the gateway node. From this observation, we manage to separate the optimization problem into two subproblems: tree planning and sensor selection. We solve the sensor selection subproblem by a Markov decision process, showing that the optimal solution admits a periodic structure when the transmission cost is sufficiently low. Efficient algorithms are proposed and they are shown to reduce the computational complexity of the original optimization problem. Numerical studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and show that they are scalable to large networks.},

After reviewing existing approaches to the definition and computation of a collision probability we argue that the question “What is the probability of collision within the next three seconds¿‘ can be answered on the basis of a collision probability rate. Using results on level crossings for vector stochastic processes we derive a general expression for the upper bound of the distribution of the collision probability rate. This expression is valid for arbitrary prediction models including process noise. We demonstrate in several examples that distributions obtained by large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations obey this bound and in many cases approximately saturate the bound. We derive an approximation for the distribution of the collision probability rate that can be computed on an embedded platform. An upper bound of the probability of collision is then obtained by one-dimensional numerical integration over the time period of interest. A straightforward application of this method applies to the collision of an extended object with a second point-like object. Using an abstraction of the second object by salient points of its boundary we propose an application of this method to two extended objects with arbitrary orientation. Finally, the distribution of the collision probability rate is identified as the distribution of the time-to-collision.},

  abstract     = {Identification of a nonlinear nonparametric system is not easy. On the other hand, many systems are sparse in the sense that some variables do not contribute and some contribute only marginally. If these variables that do not contribute or contribute marginally can be detected and removed, the identification problem becomes lower dimensional and is relatively easy to deal with. The first goal of the paper is to develop an overlap group Lasso method to detect which variables contribute and which variables do not. The algorithm developed favors sparsity in terms of partial derivatives and provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a variable to contribute. Once contributing variables are identified, the second goal of the paper is to rank the importance of these variables based on the squared derivative averages. Since both the function and its derivatives are unknown, how to estimate the squared derivative averages is a concern. To this end, two methods are proposed with convergence results. The first one is nonparametric based on the Fourier transform of some intermediate variables. The other is to cast the problem in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).},

An I-observer is constructed so as to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for checking strong I-detectability, weak I-detectability, and I-opacity, with exponential complexity. In addition, an approach based on diagnosability analysis is proposed for verifying strong I-detectability. Compared with an I-observer-based approach, the diagnosability-based approach has a lower complexity, and in the case where all the unobservable events in an unambiguous weighted automaton are represented by a unique symbol, the diagnosability-based approach has polynomial complexity.},

  abstract     = {We consider persistent monitoring of a finite number of inter-connected geographical nodes by a group of heterogeneous mobile agents. We assign to each geographical node a concave and increasing reward function that resets to zero after an agent’s visit. Then, we design the optimal dispatch policy of which nodes to visit at what time and by what agent by finding a policy set that maximizes a utility that is defined as the total reward collected at visit times. We show that this optimization problem is NP-hard and its computational complexity increases exponentially with the number of the agents and the length of the mission horizon. By showing that the utility function is a monotone increasing and submodular set function of agents’ policy, we propose a suboptimal dispatch policy design with a known optimality gap. To reduce the time complexity of constructing the feasible search set and also to induce robustness to changes in the operational factors, we perform our suboptimal policy design in a receding horizon fashion. Then, to compensate for the shortsightedness of the receding horizon approach we add a new term to our utility, which provides a measure of nodal importance beyond the receding horizon. This term gives the policy design an intuition to steer the agents towards the nodes with higher rewards on the patrolling graph. Finally, we discuss how our proposed algorithm can be implemented in a decentralized manner. A simulation study demonstrates our results.},

For each control area, decentralized event-triggering conditions that only depend on locally available information are designed for the control center to determine time instants when to sample the frequency and for each communication channel to decide instants when to broadcast corresponding information. Further, a strictly positive dwell time is introduced to prevent Zeno behaviors. Small disturbance frequency stability of the interconnected power network under the developed ETC law is analyzed, and a sufficient stability criterion on the selection of event-triggered parameters is established.

We take advantage of the underlying time-scale separation property of the plant to learn a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for only its slow dynamics, thereby saving significant amount of learning time compared to the conventional full-dimensional RL controller. We analyze the sub-optimality of the designs using SP approximation theorems, and provide sufficient conditions for closed-loop stability. Thereafter, we extend both designs to clustered multi-agent consensus networks, where the SP property reflects through clustering. We develop both centralized and cluster-wise block-decentralized RL controllers for such networks, in reduced dimensions. We demonstrate the details of the implementation of these controllers using simulations of relevant numerical examples, and compare them with conventional RL designs to show the computational benefits of our approach.},

A novel static low-gain observer is first proposed for each follower by only utilizing the output information of the follower and its neighbor agents. Based on an appropriate state transformation, the distributed output feedback controller with a static gain is then designed for each follower such that the consensus of the multiagent system is achieved. It is however noted that under the static gain controllers, the consensus convergence speed is slow and transient performance leaves much to be desired. To improve performance of the consensus protocol, the distributed output feedback controllers with bounded time-varying gains are further designed. It is shown that the proposed time-varying gain approach plays a significant role in improving the convergence speed and transient performance of the distributed consensus protocol. Through a simulation example, the effectiveness of the proposed consensus protocol is illustrated, and the advantages of the proposed time-varying gain approach are also demonstrated.},

In this paper, we propose two PI methods, called differential PI (DPI) and integral PI (IPI), and their variants, for a general RL framework in continuous time and space (CTS), where the environment is modeled by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The proposed methods inherit the current ideas of PI in classical RL and optimal control and theoretically support the existing RL algorithms in CTS: TD-learning and value-gradient-based (VGB) greedy policy update. We also provide case studies including (1) discounted RL and (2) optimal control tasks. Fundamental mathematical properties – admissibility, uniqueness of the solution to the Bellman equation (BE), monotone improvement, convergence, and optimality of the solution to the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation (HJBE) – are all investigated in-depth and improved from the existing theory, along with the general and case studies. Finally, the proposed ones are simulated with an inverted-pendulum model and their model-based and partially model-free implementations to support the theory and further investigate them beyond.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers global optimization of a continuous nonconvex piecewise affine (PWA) function over a polytope. This type of optimization problem often arises in the context of control of continuous PWA systems. In literature, it has been shown that the given problem can be formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, the worst-case complexity of which grows exponentially with the number of polyhedral subregions in the domain of the PWA function. In this paper, we propose a solution approach that is more efficient for continuous PWA functions with a large number of polyhedral subregions. The proposed approach is based on optimistic optimization, which uses hierarchical partitioning of the feasible set and which can guarantee bounds on the suboptimality of the returned solution with respect to the global optimum given a prespecified finite number of iterations. Since the function domain is a polytope with arbitrary shape, we introduce a partitioning approach by employing Delaunay triangulation and edgewise subdivision. Moreover, we derive the analytic expressions for the core parameters required by optimistic optimization for continuous PWA functions. The numerical example shows that the resulting algorithm is faster than MILP solvers for PWA functions with a large number of polyhedral subregions.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of estimating the attitude of a robotic platform using biased measurements of: (i) the direction of the gravitational field and (ii) angular velocity obtained from a set of high-grade gyroscopes sensitive to the Earth’s rotation. A cascade solution is proposed that features a Kalman filter (KF) tied to a rotation matrix observer built on the special orthogonal group of order 3. The KF, whose model stems from a uniformly observable linear time-varying system, yields estimates of: (i) the Earth’s total rotational rate; (ii) two sensor biases associated with the aforementioned measurements; and, (iii) noise-filtered and bias-corrected accelerometer data. All estimates are expressed in the platform’s body-fixed frame. In turn, the attitude observer put forward is shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable, in particular locally input-to-state stable with respect to the KF errors. Experimental results are showcased that successfully demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed attitude estimation solution.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes new robust nonlinear optimal control formulations in the weighted Sobolev space, here called nonlinear W 2 and W ∞ controllers, to handle with two classes of underactuated mechanical systems: the reduced ones with a reduced number of DOF; and the entire underactuated mechanical systems with input coupling. The optimal control problems are formulated via dynamic programming and particular solutions are presented for the resulting Hamilton–Jacobi equations with the corresponding stability analysis. Also, the concepts of W m , p , σ -stability and W m , p , σ -gain for a general class of systems are established, with the demonstration for the particular case of study. The novel W 2 and W ∞ controllers are synthesized for an unmanned aerial vehicle benchmark. The results demonstrate that these controllers provide better transient performance with faster response against external disturbances in comparison with a classic nonlinear H ∞ controller, in addition to have a simple design.},

The first result gives a standardized representation for coupled linear PDEs in a single spatial variable and shows that any such PDE, suitably well-posed, admits an equivalent PIE representation, defined by the given conversion formulae. This leads to a new prima facie representation of the dynamics without the implicit constraints on system state imposed by boundary conditions. The second result is to show that for systems in this PIE representation, convex optimization may be used to verify stability without discretization. The resulting algorithms are implemented in the Matlab toolbox PIETOOLS, tested on several illustrative examples, compared with previous results, and the code has been posted on Code Ocean. Scalability testing indicates the algorithm can analyze systems of up to 40 coupled PDEs on a desktop computer.},

The proposed controller is designed such that it retains the gyroscopic stability structure in the closed loop and renders the desired equilibrium almost-globally asymptotically stable. Due to the time-critical nature of the control input, in particular its sensitivity with respect to delays/neglected dynamics, the controller is extended to incorporate the effect of actuator dynamics for practical implementation. Thereafter, a comparison in performance is shown between the proposed controller and a conventional reduced attitude geometric controller with numerical simulation.

We provide a complete, analytical solution of the low-level optimization problem that includes the rear-end, speed-dependent safety constraint. Furthermore, we provide a problem formulation for the upper-level optimization in which there is no duality gap. The latter implies that the optimal time trajectory for each CAV does not activate any of the state, control, and safety constraints of the low-level optimization, thus allowing for online implementation. Finally, we present a geometric duality framework with hyperplanes to derive the condition under which the optimal solution of the upper-level optimization always exists.

First, a novel finite-time ISMC framework is established based on the functional observer whose parameters can be directly found. Second, an adaptive compensator is designed to counteract the effect of the unknown nonlinear function such that the composite integral sliding mode controller ensures that the closed-loop system reaches boundedness in a predefined finite time. Moreover, some sufficient conditions in the form of matrix inequalities are proposed to guarantee the finite-time boundedness with H ∞ performance (FTB- H ∞ ) over the sliding phase and the reaching phase of the closed-loop system. Then the FTB- H ∞ conditions over the whole finite-time interval are also provided. Due to introducing more degrees of freedom in the functional observer, the designed finite-time integral sliding mode controller is more flexible and less conservative. Finally, a simulation example is given to show the validity of the proposed method.},

Conventionally, when not all follower nodes have access to the leader’s state information, distributed observers are designed to estimate the leader’s state, and the observers are coupled via communication network. Then each follower node only needs to track its observer’s state independently, without interacting with its neighbors. This paper deliberately introduces certain coupling effect among follower nodes, such that the follower nodes tend to converge to each other cooperatively on the way they converge to the leader. Moreover, by suitably designing the control law, the poles of follower nodes can be assigned as desired, and thus transient tracking performance can also be adjusted.},

  abstract     = {While presenting many advantages in application, the loss of actuators also brings about great challenge to the control of underactuated systems. Specifically, the unactuated DOFs (degrees of freedom) cannot be directly controlled, instead, they have to be stabilized indirectly through appropriate regulation of actuated ones. As an unfortunate fact, the natural couplings between actuated and unactuated states are often relatively weak. Hence, in many practical cases, even the actuated states are well regulated, the performance of the unactuated states still fails to meet expectations. Such phenomenon is particularly obvious when the system faces various disturbances, since the unactuated states are more vulnerable to them and more difficult to be re-stabilized. To deal with the aforementioned issues, a nonlinear gain-adapting controller is proposed for a class of underactuated mechanical systems, which incorporates extra unactuated states-related information into the controller to enhance the state couplings. In this way, the closed-loop system reacts more appropriately and efficiently to the unactuated dynamics, which is expected to obtain improved transient performance and robustness. With a relatively concise structure, the proposed strategy imposes few requirements on the system configuration, which makes it more convenient for practical application. Theoretical analysis and experiment results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

We consider the stochastic reachability problem, which maximizes the probability that the state remains within time-varying state constraints (i.e., a “target tube”), despite bounded control authority. This problem subsumes the stochastic viability and terminal hitting-time stochastic reach-avoid problems. Of special interest is the stochastic reach set, the set of all initial states from which it is possible to stay in the target tube with a probability above a desired threshold. We provide sufficient conditions under which the stochastic reach set is closed, compact, and convex, and provide an underapproximative interpolation technique for stochastic reach sets. Utilizing convex optimization, we propose a scalable and grid-free algorithm that computes a polytopic underapproximation of the stochastic reach set and synthesizes an open-loop controller. This algorithm is anytime, i.e., it produces a valid output even on early termination. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on several numerical examples, and show that our algorithm outperforms existing software tools for verification of linear systems.},

In lieu of estimating the state by observers, we utilize the output with distinct delays to construct static output feedback control laws. A nested saturation design technique is employed to handle the nonlinearity in the control. An appealing feature of the proposed nonlinear controllers is that no observer is needed. The bounded and static output feedback control scheme is validated by an application to the triple integrators.},

  abstract     = {For linear time-invariant time delay systems, the so-called Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals of complete type (Kharitonov and Zhabko, 2003) are known to be effective in the stability analysis and a number of applications. More precisely, there exist the necessary and sufficient asymptotic stability and instability conditions expressed in terms of these functionals. The case excluded from consideration in the theory (since the functionals either do not exist or are not uniquely defined) is violation of the Lyapunov condition, i.e. the case of systems with the eigenvalues placed symmetrically with respect to the origin of the complex plane. In this paper, an analogue of this theory for a class of nonlinear time delay systems with homogeneous right-hand sides of degree greater than one and a constant delay is developed. An explicit expression for the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals as well as necessary and sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability and instability of the trivial solution based on these functionals are given. An important assumption, which constitutes an analogue of the Lyapunov condition for linear systems, is existence of the Lyapunov function for a delay free system, obtained from the original one setting the delay equal to zero. Furthermore, this Lyapunov function is a key element in the construction of the functional. The functionals are applied to estimating the region of attraction.},

Two control modes that alternatively switch and control a wearable robotic system are designed to overcome these challenges. A multiple Lyapunov functional analysis with state-dependent constraints on the switch criteria is performed to prove the stability.

This paper focuses on quantifying the global changes that result from the application of an intervention to produce a desired effect, which we define as the total effect of the intervention. The type of mathematical models that we will consider are discrete dynamical systems which include the widely used Boolean networks and their generalizations. The potential interventions can be represented by a set of nodes and edges that can be manipulated to produce a desired effect on the system. We use a class of regulatory rules called nested canalizing functions that frequently appear in published models and were inspired by the concept of canalization in evolutionary biology. In this paper, we provide a polynomial normal form based on the canalizing properties of regulatory functions. Using this polynomial normal form, we give a set of formulas for counting the maximum number of transitions that will change in the state space upon an edge deletion in the wiring diagram. These formulas rely on the canalizing structure of the target function since the number of changed transitions depends on the canalizing layer that includes the input to be deleted. We also present computations on random networks to compare the exact number of changes with the upper bounds provided by our formulas. Finally, we provide statistics on the sharpness of these upper bounds in random networks.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a generalized set-theoretic interval observer (GSIO) for robust state estimation of discrete linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with bounded uncertainties. Including the previous set-theoretic interval observer (SIO) as a special case, the proposed GSIO only requires to transform the system matrix of the first subsystem to be nonnegative. Based on this idea, a nonsmooth H ∞ optimization method is used to design a nonnegative subsystem matrix for the first subsystem based on an element-wise nonnegativity transformation. The advantage of this method is that it can design a nonnegative subsystem matrix by transforming each of its elements to be nonnegative, which does not impact any structural constraints on matrix elements. This implies that more extra design degrees of freedom could be obtained from the coordinate transformation and observer gain matrices, which can optimize state estimation performance of GSIO (e.g., suppress the effects of disturbances and noises). In this way, we could not only achieve an expected balance between robust state estimation conservatism and computational complexity but also better robust state estimation performance. Besides, under the framework of the proposed GSIO, this paper further proves its existence, gives its stability condition and compares it with the set-valued observer (SVO) and the interval observer (IO) in state estimation conservatism, which together forms a complete theoretic system for the proposed GSIO. At the end of this paper, numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the GSIO.},

The proposed approach is used to design a new kind of RB, called passivation block (PB), which is generically employed for sensor and actuator faults and achieves simultaneously series, feedback and feedfoward passivation of the controller during a fault occurrence. Based on the dissipativity theory, new conditions are obtained to design a dynamic PB (DPB) which requires minimum information on the system model. In particular, the proposed DPB can be systematically obtained by combining the LMI-based conditions based on the knowledge about the passivity indices. Numerical simulations are carried out and indicate that the PBs are able to stabilize an example of a faulty nonlinear system.},

Firstly, a networked controller is designed achieving output synchronization for identical finite-dimensional reference models, which deliver the state of the global reference model required for the synchronization to the parabolic agents. The latter can be subject to local disturbances acting in-domain, on all boundaries and on the anti-collocated output to be controlled. The cooperative output regulation problem is solved by designing local output feedback regulators for the parabolic agents. This requires the solution of time-varying regulator equations and the design of disturbance observers for parabolic systems with spatially- and time-varying coefficients. For this, a systematic backstepping approach is provided and it is shown that cooperative output regulation with exponential convergence is ensured for the resulting multi-agent system. The results of the paper are applied to the cooperative output regulation of a heterogeneous network of four parabolic agents in the presence of local disturbances.},

We consider an unconstrained reward model in which two or more agents can choose the same arm and collect independent rewards. And we consider a constrained reward model in which agents that choose the same arm at the same time receive no reward. We design a dynamic, consensus-based, distributed estimation algorithm for cooperative estimation of mean rewards at each arm. We leverage the estimates from this algorithm to develop two distributed algorithms: coop-UCB2 and coop-UCB2-selective-learning, for the unconstrained and constrained reward models, respectively. We show that both algorithms achieve group performance close to the performance of a centralized fusion center. Further, we investigate the influence of the communication graph structure on performance. We propose a novel graph explore–exploit index that predicts the relative performance of groups in terms of the communication graph, and we propose a novel nodal explore–exploit centrality index that predicts the relative performance of agents in terms of the agent locations in the communication graph.},

Its salient feature is the guaranteed robustness against the inexactness of probability distribution of unknown disturbances. The integrated design problem is formulated as a distributionally robust chance constrained program (DRCCP). It maximizes fault detectability subject to the constraint on the worst-case false alarm rate among a continuum of probability distributions. The moment-based and Wasserstein ambiguity sets are used as two different ways of uncertainty description, which differ manifestly from generic settings where disturbances follow either Gaussian or norm-bounded assumptions. We show that the use of two different ambiguity sets in fault detection leads to specific statistical properties. To solve DRCCPs efficiently, we develop exact reformulations and tailored solution algorithms, and in some cases the optimal solution turns out to be classical fault detection design. In addition, a distributionally robust assessment strategy is developed, which evaluates the worst-case and best-case detectability under known faults by solving tractable convex programs. The efficacy of the proposed approach is illustrated on the fault detection of a laboratory three-tank system.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new lexicographic multi-objective model predictive control (MoMPC) scheme for constrained nonlinear systems with changing objective prioritization. The lexicographic optimization-based receding horizon optimal control problem is firstly formulated to accommodate the concern on prioritized control of multiple (economic) objectives. Then an elaborate generic function and the notion of general terminal constraints are introduced to regain feasibility of lexicographic MoMPC in the presence of constraints and changing objective prioritization. Moreover, the LaSalle invariance set theorem is used to establish stability of the closed-loop system with the lexicographic MoMPC. An example of a coupled-tank level control problem with three conflicting objectives is adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {We propose two perturbation-based extremum seeking control (ESC) schemes for general single input single output nonlinear dynamical systems, having structures similar to that of the classical ESC scheme. We propose novel adaptation laws for the excitation signal amplitudes in each scheme that drive the amplitudes to zero. The rates of decay for both the laws are governed by the gradient measures of the unknown reference-to-output equilibrium map We show that the proposed ESC schemes achieve practical asymptotic convergence to the extremum with a proper tuning of the parameters in the proposed schemes. As the extremum is reached, and the magnitudes of the gradient measures become small, the excitation signal amplitudes converge to zero. Thus, the proposed schemes ensure that the excitation signal is driven to zero as the system output converges to a neighborhood of the extremum and the steady-state oscillations about the extremum, typically observed for the classical ESC schemes, are attenuated. Simulation examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

Like all optimal experiment design problems, this optimization problem depends on the unknown true system, which is generally replaced by an initial estimate. One important consequence of this is that we can underestimate the actual cost of the experiment and that the accuracy of the identified model can be lower than desired. Here, based on an a-priori uncertainty set for the true system, we propose a convex optimization approach that allows to prevent these issues from happening. We do this when the to-be-determined spectrum is the one of a multisine signal.},

A Liveness Enforcing Supervisory Policy (LESP) for a PN enforces liveness by preventing the firing of a subset of transitions called the controllable transitions , which correspond to the preventable events in a DES. In this paper, we consider the existence and synthesis of LESPs for arbitrary PNs in the presence of faults , where a subset of controllable transitions become temporarily uncontrollable, for a finite number of event occurrences. Following the formal specification of the fault model, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of Fault-Tolerant LESPs (FT-LESPs) for arbitrary PNs. We show that, even when an LESP is given, the existence of an FT-LESP for an arbitrary PN is undecidable. We then identify a class of PNs for which the existence of FT-LESPs is decidable. We conclude with some suggestions for future research.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a sufficient condition and its certification algorithm for solving box-constrained linear model predictive control (MPC) problems within a certain number of iterations equal to the number of constrained prediction points. For implementing a model predictive controller in industrial applications, it is crucial to guarantee a concrete upper bound on the computational load so that the processor specifications can be determined. To address this matter, we transform the constrained quadratic optimization of MPC into an equivalent linear complementarity problem (LCP). Then, we show that if a modified n-step vector exists for a given problem, the corresponding LCP is feasible and solvable within a predetermined number of iterations, each comprising fundamental arithmetic operations. The existence of a modified n-step vector is independent of the current states and box constraint bounds. Thus, the total computational load required to solve an MPC problem can be explicitly determined. In addition, an explicit certification algorithm for checking the existence of a modified n-step vector is proposed. Utilizing this algorithm, the existence range of a modified n-step vector is investigated for various problem configurations. Numerical tests show that the computational speed of the proposed method is competitive with those of commonly available algorithms.},

We quantify the privacy level based on the estimation error of a subsystem’s state and propose a novel framework to compare different mechanisms based on their privacy guarantees. We develop a local attack detection scheme without assuming the knowledge of the global dynamics, which uses local and shared information to detect attacks with provable guarantees. Additionally, we quantify a trade-off between security and privacy of the local subsystems. Interestingly, we show that, for some instances of the attack, the subsystems can achieve a better detection performance by being more private. We provide an explanation for this counter-intuitive behavior and illustrate our results with examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an online estimation method for highly nonlinear systems. This method fits the data to a nonlinear in the parameters regression model, where each parameter is an unknown function of known variables that we call causal regressors. We define this model as an Autoregressive with eXogenous inputs and Causal-regressors-Dependent Parameters (ARX-CDP) model. We are interested on modeling problems where the causal regressors can vary rapidly, as well as the parameters, to the point that the latter cannot be estimated by standard methods. Since the parameters causally depend on the causal regressor but do not depend directly on time, we propose to model each parameter evolution as a random walk process in its causal regressors domain, rather than in the time variable domain, as usual. Therefore, the parameter prediction depends on some past estimates at instants when the causal regressors are similar to the present one. The absolute difference between the current and past causal regressors is used to measure this similarity. We call this prediction method as causal prediction, which, together with a standard recursive least square algorithm, used to update the model, makes up the online causal estimator. Finally, a finite impulse response and a system with multi-dependent parameters are modeled using this proposal. We show experimentally that the causal regression method has a similar performance with other offline methods from literature, with the important advantage of operating in online mode.},

In particular, it is shown that at rotor standstill – when the system is not observable – it is possible to inject a probing signal to enforce the persistent excitation condition.

The key idea is to compensate the uncertainty at the current sampling instant by using a true value of the uncertainty at the last sampling instant. A rigorous convergence and stability result on the discrete-time compensation control is obtained by developing an eigenvalues-and-sequences-based analytic method. It is shown that the tracking error can be made arbitrarily small if the sampling period is sufficiently small. When the system functions are time-independent, the tracking error converges to zero as time tends to infinity.

This, however, becomes impractical with the increase in network size. In the past years a number of scalable techniques have been devised, which relax this constraint while yet maintaining a number of desired statistical properties like consistency and convergence to consensus. Here, we present a methodological approach for designing and analyzing information fusion in potentially large-scale networks. Tangle networks, the objects of study in our formalism, are flexible diagrammatic models that capture key properties of scalable information fusion. A tangle network comes equipped with a natural notion of equivalence: two networks are equivalent if they can be transformed one into the other by successive application of local deformations. Any such deformation preserves the information content and consistency of estimators in the network. We derive novel particle-filtering-based algorithms for distributed information fusion over tangle networks and analyze their performance in various settings. The algebraic properties of tangle networks are shown to bear resemblance to algebraic properties of graphs. In particular, we show that the agreement between estimators in the network is governed by the spectral gap of the network’s associated matrix, the analog of a graph Laplacian. The utility of the framework is demonstrated through comparison with state-of-the-art distributed information fusion techniques.},

A general framework for this problem has been recently developed, which alternates between parameter estimation and sample-mode assignment, solving both tasks to global optimality under mild conditions. This article extends this framework to the nonlinear case, which further aggravates the combinatorial complexity of the identification problem, since a model structure selection task has to be addressed for each mode of the system. To solve this issue, we reformulate the learning problem in terms of the optimization of a probability distribution over the space of all possible model structures. Then, a randomized approach is employed to tune this distribution. The performance of the proposed approach on some benchmark examples is analyzed in detail.},

This assumption not only precludes many practical applications in which only the output of the leader system is available, but also leads to a high dimension observer. In this communique, we propose an adaptive distributed output observer which only makes use of the output of the leader system, and is thus more practical than the state based adaptive distributed observer.

For a special functional form previously used in the literature of transboundary pollution dynamic games we analytically characterize the feedback Nash equilibrium. We show that at the equilibrium both the level and the location of emissions of each region depend on the particular geographical relationship among agents.

The power system is measured by the SCADA and the phasor measurement unit (PMU), and the state updating period of the power system is allowed to be different from the sampling periods of the SCADA and the PMU. The phenomenon of the randomly occurring SCADA measurement delays is characterized by a set of Bernoulli distributed random variables. To facilitate the state estimator design, a new approach is developed to transform the multi-rate power system into single-rate one. First, two local state estimators are designed, respectively, based on the SCADA and the PMU measurements such that upper bounds of the local estimation error covariances are guaranteed at each sampling instant, and such upper bounds are subsequently minimized by appropriately designing the gains of both local state estimators. Then, the asynchronous estimates from the local state estimators are fused by recurring to the covariance intersection fusion scheme. Finally, a simulation experiment is carried out on the IEEE 14-bus system to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion estimation scheme.},

Moreover, the cost functions are often expensive to evaluate, and therefore designers prefer to reduce the number of evaluations. In this paper, surrogate-based methods are utilised to approximate the true functions, and conditions for constructing smooth and convex surrogates are established, by which the requirements for explicit functions are eliminated. To improve the quality of surrogate models, a distance-based infill strategy is proposed to balance the exploitation and exploration, which guarantees the density of the decision sequence in a compact set. Then, a distributed optimisation algorithm is developed to solve the reformulated auxiliary sub-problems, and the convergence of the proposed algorithm is established via Lyapunov theory.

We show that the solution attributes to solving a two-point boundary value problem of stochastic version whose drift terms contain some conditional mean terms. We then propose a layered calculation method to solve this problem. In the inner layer calculation, the adjoint state variable’s estimate is expressed as a linear functional of the state estimate. In the outer layer calculation, the adjoint state variable is expressed as a linear functional of the state and its estimate.

The spectrum solution is also discrete, which occurs naturally when the underlying random field is periodic. We show that a solution to the discrete problem exists, is unique and depends smoothly on the problem data. Therefore, we have a well-posed problem whose solution can be tuned in a smooth manner.

For solvability of the resulting BVP, a setup function is introduced such that additional parameters are provided in the differential equation of the internal dynamics. Based on the linearized dynamics about the nominal trajectory, a linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) controller is implemented to compensate for measurement noise, model uncertainties, and external disturbances.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the problem of designing data-driven stochastic Model Predictive Control (MPC) for linear time-invariant systems under additive stochastic disturbance, whose probability distribution is unknown but can be partially inferred from data. We propose a novel online learning based risk-averse stochastic MPC framework in which Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraints on system states are required to hold for a family of distributions called an ambiguity set. The ambiguity set is constructed from disturbance data by leveraging a Dirichlet process mixture model that is self-adaptive to the underlying data structure and complexity. Specifically, the structural property of multimodality is exploited, so that the first- and second-order moment information of each mixture component is incorporated into the ambiguity set. A novel constraint tightening strategy is then developed based on an equivalent reformulation of distributionally robust CVaR constraints over the proposed ambiguity set. As more data are gathered during the runtime of the controller, the ambiguity set is updated online using real-time disturbance data, which enables the risk-averse stochastic MPC to cope with time-varying disturbance distributions. The online variational inference algorithm employed does not require all collected data be learned from scratch, and therefore the proposed MPC is endowed with the guaranteed computational complexity of online learning. The guarantees on recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability of the proposed MPC are established via a safe update scheme. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed MPC.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we focus on the study of quotients of Boolean control networks (BCNs) with the motivation that they might serve as smaller models that still carry enough information about the original network. Given a BCN and an equivalence relation on the state set, we consider a labeled transition system that is generated by the BCN. The resulting quotient transition system then naturally captures the quotient dynamics of the BCN concerned. We therefore develop a method for constructing a Boolean system that behaves equivalently to the resulting quotient transition system. The use of the obtained quotient system for control design is discussed and we show that for BCNs, controller synthesis can be done by first designing a controller for a quotient and subsequently lifting it to the original model. We finally demonstrate the applicability of the proposed techniques on a biological example.},

First, a class of higher degree matrix-valued polynomial inequalities are transformed into the first degree matrix-valued polynomial inequalities by introducing some slack matrices. As a result, a convex property is applied to derive sufficient conditions for a class of higher degree matrix-valued polynomial inequalities on closed intervals. Second, by choosing a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional with a quadratic matrix-valued polynomial on a time-varying delay, and estimating its time-derivative as a third-degree matrix-valued polynomial on the time-varying delay, the proposed sufficient conditions are utilized to formulate a novel bounded real lemma on the existence of H ∞ filters for time-delay systems. Third, some algorithms to filter design are provided and discussed in detail. It is pointed out that, if the filter gain is derived through a generalized inverse matrix method, it may be a fake solution, which is demonstrated through a liquid monopropellant rocket motor with a pressure feeding system.},

We construct the admissible set on the initial states, in which the theoretical results on the attitude synchronization, rigidity maintenance and collision avoidance are established simultaneously without relying on the dynamical connectivity of the neighbor graphs.

  abstract     = {Recent control trends are increasingly relying on communication networks and wireless channels to close the loop for Internet-of-Things applications. Traditionally these approaches are model-based, i.e., assuming a network or channel model they are focused on stability analysis and appropriate controller designs. However the availability of such wireless channel modeling is fundamentally challenging in practice as channels are typically unknown a priori and only available through data samples. In this work we aim to develop algorithms that rely on channel sample data to determine the mean square stability and performance of networked control tasks. In this regard our work is the first to characterize the amount of channel modeling that is required to answer such a question. Specifically we examine how many channel data samples are required in order to answer with high confidence whether a given networked control system is stable or not. This analysis is based on the notion of sample complexity from the learning literature and is facilitated by concentration inequalities. Moreover we establish a direct relation between the sample complexity and the networked system stability margin, i.e., the underlying packet success rate of the channel and the spectral radius of the dynamics of the control system. This illustrates that it becomes impractical to verify stability under a large range of plant and channel configurations. We validate our theoretical results in numerical simulations.},

This is done by taking a so-called jump/hybrid systems approach, which allows formulating linear matrix inequalities using an explicit solution to the Riccati differential equation. Furthermore, the sampled-data problem is formulated such that continuous-time design techniques like H ∞ loop-shaping can be used in a sampled-data context. To do so, it is essential to consider mixed discrete/continuous specifications, in which both discrete and continuous signals are weighted using weighting filters. This leads to a generalised plant that has both continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics. The controller design method is demonstrated on a benchmark example, in which we compare to existing results in the literature, and on a design example of reference tracking of a two-mass–spring–damper system.},

The macroscopic second-order two-class AR traffic model consists of four hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) describing the dynamics of densities and velocities on freeway. Each vehicle class is characterized by its own vehicle size and driver’s behavior. The considered equilibrium profiles of the model represent evenly distributed traffic with constant densities and velocities of both classes along the investigated track section. After linearizing the model equations around those equilibrium profiles, it is observed that in the congested traffic one of the four characteristic speeds is negative, whereas the remaining three are positive. Backstepping control design is employed to stabilize the 4 × 4 heterodirectional hyperbolic PDEs. The control input actuates the traffic flow at outlet of the investigated track section and is realized by a ramp metering. The output feedback controller is obtained by designing an anti-collocated observer and combining it with a full state feedback result. Overall, the output feedback control law achieves the damping of stop-and-go waves in finite time by measuring the velocities and densities of both vehicle classes at the inlet of the investigated track section. The performance of the developed controller is verified by simulation of the linearized model and quantified by performance indices for the fuel consumption, comfort and total travel time.},

The scheme employs a robust form of distributed model predictive control for which recursive feasibility and stability are guaranteed, yet – uniquely – the reliance on robust invariant sets is merely implicit, thus enabling applicability to higher-order systems. The robust control algorithm is combined with an algorithm for coalition forming based on consensus theory and potential games; we establish conditions under which controllers reach a consensus on the sets of coalitions.

  abstract     = {This paper develops output feedback boundary control to mitigate traffic congestion of an unidirectional two-lane freeway segment. The macroscopic traffic dynamics are described by the Aw–Rascle–Zhang (ARZ) model respectively for both the fast and slow lanes. The traffic density and velocity of each of the two lanes are governed by coupled 2 × 2 nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Lane-changing interactions between the two lanes lead to exchanging source terms between the two pairs second-order PDEs. Therefore, we are dealing with 4 × 4 nonlinear coupled hyperbolic PDEs. Based on driver’s preference for the slow and fast lanes, a reference system of lane-specific uniform steady states in congested traffic is chosen. To stabilize traffic densities and velocities of both lanes to the steady states, two distinct variable speed limits (VSLs) are applied at outlet boundary, controlling the traffic velocity of each lane. Using backstepping transformation, we map the coupled heterodirectional hyperbolic PDE system into a cascade target system, in which the traffic oscillations are damped out through actuation of the velocities at the downstream boundary. Two full-state feedback boundary control laws are developed. We also design a collocated boundary observer for state estimation with sensing of the densities at the outlet. Output feedback boundary controllers are obtained by combining the collocated observer and full-state feedback controllers. The finite time convergence to equilibrium is achieved and a performance improvement in fuel consumption, drivers’ comfort and total travel time is demonstrated with the proposed output feedback controllers for some parameter choice, compared with the open-loop system. The proposed output feedback design is also validated for different congested traffic scenarios and compared with one-lane backstepping and PI control designs.},

The centrality measures are defined using the H 2 -norm of the network. We quantify the centrality measures as functions of time-delay, the graph Laplacian, and the covariance matrix of the input noise. Several practically relevant uncertainty structures are considered, where we discuss two notions of centrality: one w.r.t intensity of the noise and the other one w.r.t coupling strength between the agents. Furthermore, explicit formulas for the centrality measures are obtained for all types of uncertainty structures. Lastly, we rank agents and communication links based on their centrality indices and highlight the role of time-delay and uncertainty structure in each scenario. Our counter-intuitive grasp is that some of centrality measures are highly volatile with respect to time-delay.},

We present a modeling framework that reflects conservation principles, and for which a centralized controller optimizes a performance metric for the entire network over a finite time horizon. Our main result is a computationally efficient projection-based approach that exploits the sparse structure of the system dynamics for tightening state and input constraints, in the meantime ensuring that average performance, recursive feasibility, and asymptotic stability of the system are maintained. An inventory control problem under demand uncertainty is presented to illustrate the advantages of the proposed framework and benchmark against nominal economic model predictive control.},

  abstract     = {Quantum entanglement plays a fundamental role in quantum computation and quantum communication. Feedback control has been widely used in stochastic quantum systems to generate given entangled states since it has good robustness, where the time required to compute filter states and conduct filter-based control usually cannot be ignored in many practical applications. This paper designed two control strategies based on the Lyapunov method to prepare a class of entangled states for qubit systems with a constant delay time. The first one is bang–bang-like control strategy, which has a simple form with switching between a constant value and zero, the stability of which is proved. Another control strategy is switching Lyapunov control, where a constant delay time is introduced in the filter-based feedback control law to compensate for the computation time. Numerical results on a two-qubit system illustrate the effectiveness of these two proposed control strategies.},

However, when the system is affected by external disturbances, its future state is dependent on the forthcoming disturbance; which is –in most of the cases– unknown and impossible to measure. In this scenario, making predictions of the future system-state is not straightforward and –indeed– there are scarce contributions provided to this issue. This paper treats the following problem: given a LTI system affected by continuously differentiable unknown disturbances, how its future state can be predicted in a sufficiently small time-horizon by high-order observers. Observer design methodologies in order to reduce the prediction errors are given. Comparisons with other solutions are also established.},

In particular, we study the properties of the null-spaces of the reachability matrix pencil and of the Rosenbrock system matrix, which have been extensively used as two computational building blocks for the calculation of pole placing state feedback matrices and pole placing friends of output-nulling subspaces. Our objective is to show that the subspaces in the chains of kernels obtained in the construction of these feedback matrices interact with each other in ways that are entirely independent from the choice of eigenvalues. So far, these chains of subspaces have only been studied in the case of stationarity. In this case, it is known that these chains converge to the classic Kalman reachable subspace ℛ for the reachability matrix pencil and to the largest reachability subspace ℛ ⋆ in the case of the Rosenbrock matrix, respectively. Here we are interested in showing that even before stationarity has been reached, the partial chains are linked to structural properties of the system, and are therefore independent of the closed-loop eigenvalues that we wish to assign. We further characterize these subspaces by investigating the notion of largest subspace on which it is possible to assign the closed-loop spectrum (possibly maintaining the output at zero) without resorting to non-trivial Jordan forms.},

We first examine an infinite-dimensional linear system (constructed using independent Koopman eigenfunctions) and relate its observability properties to the observability of the original nonlinear system. Next, we derive an analytic relation between symmetry and nonlinear observability; it is shown that symmetry in the nonlinear dynamics is reflected in the symmetry of the corresponding Koopman eigenfunctions, as well as presence of repeated Koopman eigenvalues. We then proceed to show that loss of observability in symmetric nonlinear systems can be traced back to the presence of these repeated eigenvalues. In the case where we have a sufficient number of measurements, the nonlinear system remains unobservable when these functions have symmetries that mirror those of the dynamics. The proposed observability framework provides insights into the minimum number of measurements needed to make an unobservable nonlinear system, observable. The proposed results are then applied to a network of nano-electromechanical oscillators coupled via a symmetric interaction topology.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we provide several results on controllability and stabilizability properties of the Kolmogorov forward equation of a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) evolving on a finite state space, with the transition rates defined as the control parameters. First, we show that any target probability distribution can be reached asymptotically using time-varying control parameters. Second, we characterize all stationary distributions that are stabilizable using time-independent control parameters. For bidirected graphs, we construct rational and polynomial density feedback laws that stabilize stationary distributions while satisfying the additional constraint that the feedback law takes zero value at equilibrium. This last result enables the construction of decentralized density feedback controllers, using tools from linear systems theory and sum-of-squares based polynomial optimization, that stabilize a swarm of robots modeled as a CTMC to a target state distribution with no state-switching at equilibrium. In addition to these results, we prove a sufficient condition under which the classical rank conditions for controllability can be generalized to forward equations with non-negativity constraints on the control inputs. We apply this result to prove local controllability of a forward equation in which only a small subset of the transition rates are the control inputs. Lastly, we extend our feedback stabilization results to stationary distributions that have a strongly connected support .},

  abstract     = {This paper revisits the problem of estimating the set of states of a positive system, that are reachable from the origin, by constrained exogenous inputs. More specifically, we seek the smallest polyhedron that bounds the reachable set of a positive system, subject to inputs whose column sums have a bounded peak value. By resorting to a particular auxiliary function, the maximum of linear functions of state variables, a sufficient condition is given such that the reachable set is bounded by a prescribed polyhedron. This auxiliary function is not necessarily positive definite even for nonnegative state variables and, therefore, the face normals of the resulting bounding polyhedron may not be positive vectors. This greatly improves the existing results using linear copositive Lyapunov functions, and also paves the way for the reachable set estimation of unstable positive systems. Moreover, we provide an approach to compute the bounding hyper-rectangle, which turns out to be nonconservative for the single-input case. The obtained bounding polyhedron depends on the time delays, while the bounding hyper-rectangle does not. On the other hand, for a positive system subject to inputs with the integral of their column sums bounded by a prescribed value, we give an estimate for the reachable set using the convex hull of hyper-rectangles, as well as a bounding polyhedron whose outward face normals are not necessarily positive vectors. These two categories of bounding sets are both delay independent. Finally, we show via numerical examples the superiority of the developed results.},

  abstract     = {Classical thermodynamics aimed to quantify the efficiency of thermodynamic engines, by bounding the maximal amount of mechanical energy produced, compared to the amount of heat required. While this was accomplished early on, by Carnot and Clausius, the more practical problem to quantify limits of power that can be delivered, remained elusive due to the fact that quasistatic processes require infinitely slow cycling, resulting in a vanishing power output. Recent insights, drawn from stochastic models, appear to bridge the gap between theory and practice in that they lead to physically meaningful expressions for the dissipation cost in operating a thermodynamic engine over a finite time window. Indeed, the problem to optimize power can be expressed as a stochastic control problem. Building on this framework of stochastic thermodynamics we derive bounds on the maximal power that can be drawn by cycling an overdamped ensemble of particles via a time-varying potential while alternating contact with heat baths of different temperature ( T c cold, and T h hot). Specifically, assuming a suitable bound M on the spatial gradient of the controlling potential, we show that the maximal achievable power is bounded by M 8 ( T h T c − 1 ) . Moreover, we show that this bound can be reached to within a factor of ( T h T c − 1 ) ∕ ( T h T c + 1 ) by operating the cyclic thermodynamic process with a quadratic potential.},

In the present paper we aim to extend this method to the case of input/output general time-varying delays or sawtooth delays (that correspond to network-based control). We assume known measurement delays and, for the first time under observer-based control of PDEs, unknown input delays. We use a modal decomposition approach, and consider boundary or non-local sensing together with non-local actuation, or Dirichlet actuation with non-local sensing. The dimension of the controller is equal to the number of unstable modes, whereas the observer may have a larger dimension N . Under the Dirichlet actuation we present two methods: a direct one that manages with time-varying input and output delays, and a dynamic-extension-based one that treats constant input and time-varying output delays. To compensate the fast-varying output delay (without any constraints on the delay derivative) that appears in the infinite-dimensional part of the closed-loop system, we combine Lyapunov functionals with Halanay’s inequality. For the slowly-varying output delay (with the delay derivative smaller than d &lt; 1 ), we suggest a direct Lyapunov method. We provide LMIs for finding N and upper bounds on the delays that preserve the exponential stability.},

We also consider the dual problem of constructing an observer for ODE–PDE cascade systems in which the output of the ODE system drives the PDE system, whose output is measured. The PDE in these problems is exponentially stable and the ODE is unstable. While the ODE system models the plant in both the problems, the PDE system models the actuator in the stabilization problem and the sensor in the dual problem. In the literature, these problems have been solved for specific PDE models using the backstepping approach. In contrast, in the present work we consider these problems in an abstract framework by letting the PDE system be any regular linear system. Using a state transformation obtained by solving a Sylvester equation with unbounded operators, we first diagonalize the state operator corresponding to the cascade systems. We then solve the stabilization problem and the dual estimation problem, provided they are solvable, by solving certain finite-dimensional counterparts. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions for verifying the solvability of these problems. We show that the controller which solves the stabilization problem is robust to certain unbounded perturbations. We illustrate our theory by designing a stabilizing controller for a PDE–ODE cascade in which the PDE is a 1D diffusion equation and an observer for an ODE–PDE cascade in which the PDE is a 1D wave equation.},

In particular, we propose a family of extremum seeking (ES) dynamics that can be universally modeled as singularly perturbed hybrid dynamical systems with restarting mechanisms. From this family of dynamics, we synthesize four fast algorithms for the solution of convex, strongly convex, constrained, and unconstrained optimization problems. In each case, we establish robust semi-global practical asymptotic or exponential stability results, and we also show how to obtain well-posed discretized algorithms that retain the main properties of the original dynamics. Given that existing averaging theorems for singularly perturbed hybrid systems are not directly applicable to our setting, we derive an extended averaging theorem that relaxes some of the assumptions made in the literature, allowing us to make a clear link between the K L bounds that characterize the rates of convergence of the hybrid dynamics and their average dynamics. We also show that our results are applicable to non-hybrid algorithms, thus providing a general framework for accelerated ES dynamics based on averaging theory. We present different numerical examples to illustrate our results.},

This model is sufficiently rich to capture various properties of a real-world communication channel, such as distortion, interference, and nonlinearity. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the robust finite-gain stability of such an NCS when the model uncertainties in the plant and controller are measured by the gap metric and those in the nonlinear channels are measured by operator norms of the uncertain elements. This condition is given by an inequality involving “arcsine” of the uncertainty bounds and is derived from novel geometric insights underlying the robustness of a standard closed-loop system in the presence of conelike nonlinear perturbations on the system graphs.},

The event weights capture variations of a given resource (i.e., energy) expended or replenished during the operation of the system and the mean payoff is then defined as the average of the accumulative event weights. Two supervisory control problems are considered in this work. For the first, the system is equipped with a fixed amount of initial energy to support its operation and the supervised system should always have a nonnegative energy level. For the second, the limit mean payoff of any event sequence should never drop below zero in the supervised system. We further optimize the worst case limit mean payoff of infinite event sequences under both scenarios. The two problems are solved sequentially. In order to capture information on both the state estimate and the energy level of the system, we define energy information states which incorporate sufficient information for the decision making of the supervisor. Then we propose the First Cycle Energy Inclusive Controller (FCEIC) and further transfer the supervisory control problems into two-player games with properly defined objectives on the FCEIC. Finally, we perform a min–max search on the game graphs to synthesize the optimal supervisors for both scenarios.},

Our primary objective is to seek a distributed design that can handle heterogeneous time-delays, while preserving agents’ privacy—a fundamental prerequisite that has become gradually important for cyber–physical systems. For this purpose, we design a state predictor for each agent to compensate for the effect of heterogeneous time-delays, which allows the agents to predict the missing states between two consecutive update times. Based upon the predictor, we present a distributed gradient-descent algorithm to locally update the outputs of the generators, which guarantees that the optimal solution is attained in an asymptotic manner. Among other things, we incorporate a privacy preservation scheme to the proposed algorithm in order to preserve agents’ privacy and delicately characterize its convergence, differential privacy properties, as well as accuracy.},

It is, however, challenging to ensure system safety and efficiency as the wireless channels in VNS are often subject to state-dependent deep fades where the data rate suffers a severe drop and changes as a function of vehicle states. Such couplings between vehicle states and channel states in VNS thereby invalidate the use of separation principle to design event-based control strategies. By adopting a state-dependent fading channel model , this paper presents a novel self-triggered scheme under which the VNS ensures efficient use of communication bandwidth while preserving stochastic stability. Under the proposed self-triggered scheme, this paper presents a novel source coding scheme that tracks vehicle’s states with performance guarantee in the presence of state-dependent fading channels. The efficacy and advantages of the proposed scheme over other event-based strategies are verified by a leader–follower example.},

  abstract     = {This paper, for the first time, provides sub-predictors for networked control systems (NCSs) under uncertain large communication delays. We use a time-delay approach to NCS and employ sub-predictors to partially compensate large uncertain transmission delays in the sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channels by dividing the long delay into small pieces. We consider systems with norm-bounded uncertainties, and take into account Round-Robin scheduling protocol in sensor-to-controller channel. In comparison with the traditional reduction-based classical predictor involving distributed input, the sub-predictor-based feedback is more friendly in the presence of norm-bounded uncertainties and is simpler for implementation. The sub-predictor-based feedback is further extended to decentralized control of interconnected systems provided that the couplings are not strong. The stability analysis of the closed-loop system is based on the Lyapunov–Krasovskii method and the stability conditions are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities.},

The obtained results can be applied to time delay systems of strict-feedback structure, transport Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with nonlocal terms, and feedback interconnections of Ordinary Differential Equations with a transport PDE. The proposed design approach consists in exploiting any existing observer that features robust exponential convergence of the error when continuous-time output measurements are available. The (continuous-time) observer is then modified, mainly by adding an inter-sample output predictor, to compensate for the effect of data-sampling. Using small-gain analysis, we show that robust exponential stability of the error is preserved, provided the sampling period is not too large. The results are applied to a chemical reactor and to the class of triangular globally Lipschitz delay systems.},

A concept of meta sequence list consisting of finite switching subsequences is presented, which can represent all admissible PDT switching sequences by concatenating the list elements. Two novel Lyapunov functions only based on the meta sequence list are constructed, which break the limitation of traditional mode dependency and quasi-time dependency. Two equivalent stability criteria are accordingly developed, and the widely-used nonconvex stability conditions for PDT switched linear systems are proved to be sufficient to them. Moreover, the presented convex stability criterion is further extended to l 2 -gain computation and H ∞ filter design. The designed meta-sequence-dependent (MSD) filter can guarantee that the filtering error system is globally uniformly asymptotically stable with a standard H ∞ performance index, which contrasts with the indices in weighted or parameter-dependent forms, i.e., weaker noise attenuation, in the existing literatures of switched systems under average dwell-time or PDT constraints. Two examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed results.},

The proposed control design strategy consists of a constant-delay predictor feedback designed based on the known nominal value of the control input delay and is synthesized on a finite-dimensional truncated model capturing the unstable modes of the original infinite-dimensional system. By using a small-gain argument, we show that the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially stable provided that the variations of the delay around its nominal value are small enough. The proposed proof actually applies to any distributed-parameter system associated with an unbounded operator that 1) generates a C 0 -semigroup on a weighted space of square integrable functions over a compact interval; and 2) is self-adjoint with compact resolvent.},

The link state evolves as a two-state Markov chain, and its state transition depends on the network usage. The aim is to design the scheduling policy which balances the estimation quality and the energy consumption. We identify the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and prove the structural properties of the optimal policy. Furthermore, based on the structural properties, we derive the sufficient and necessary condition of the mean square stability of the remote estimator.

The discrete time CSVIU model is particularly useful when an accurate dynamic model is unattainable, and only a rough model is available. Interesting features arise from the optimal control solution for the model. In particular, the optimal control action is to remain idle within a certain region of the state space — the inaction region. This feature, peculiar to the CSVIU approach, has ties to cautionary control policies found in economics. The convexity of the cost function holds for the discounted control problem with quadratic costs when the noise is Gaussian, and the control policy admits a solution in closed form in some regions of the state space. A linearly perturbed Lyapunov equation inside the inaction region, and a rational Riccati equation, asymptotically in far-off regions, characterize the control. We show the stochastic stability of solutions and provide numerical experiments that underline CSVIU model control’s interesting peculiarities.},

A challenging problem is to efficiently incorporate all collected data simultaneously to infer the underlying dynamic network. This paper addresses the reconstruction of dynamic networks from heterogeneous datasets under the assumption that the underlying networks share the same Boolean structure across all experiments. Parametric models are derived for dynamical structure functions, which describe causal interactions between measured variables. Multiple datasets are integrated into one regression problem with additional demands on group sparsity to assure network sparsity and structure consistency. To acquire structured group sparsity, we propose a sampling-based method, together with extended versions of l 1 -methods and sparse Bayesian learning. The performance of the proposed methods is benchmarked in numerical simulation. In summary, this paper presents efficient methods on network reconstruction from multiple experiments, and reveals practical experience that could guide applications.},

With this, a constructive solution of the output regulation problem is presented for coupled wave–ODE systems with disturbances acting in-domain, at a boundary or at the ODE. The output to be controlled can depend both on the distributed and lumped states, while in the former case in-domain and boundary outputs are allowed.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the optimal control of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) arriving from two roads at a Merging Point (MP) where the objective is to jointly minimize the travel time and energy consumption of each CAV. The optimal solution can be used as a reference for tracking control and it guarantees that a speed-dependent safety constraint is satisfied both at the MP and everywhere within a Control Zone (CZ) which precedes it. We analyze the case of no active constraints and prove that under certain conditions the safety and speed constraints remain inactive, thus significantly simplifying the determination of an explicit decentralized solution. When these conditions do not apply, a complete solution is still obtained which includes all possible constraints becoming active. Our analysis allows us to study the tradeoff between the two objective function components (travel time and energy within the CZ). Simulation examples are provided to compare the performance of the optimal controller to a baseline consisting of human-driven vehicles with results showing improvements in both metrics.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of identifying the graph structure of a dynamical network using measured input/output data. This problem is known as topology identification and has received considerable attention in recent literature. Most existing literature focuses on topology identification for networks with node dynamics modeled by single integrators or single-input single-output (SISO) systems. The goal of the current paper is to identify the topology of a more general class of heterogeneous networks, in which the dynamics of the nodes are modeled by general (possibly distinct) linear systems. Our two main contributions are the following. First, we establish conditions for topological identifiability, i.e., conditions under which the network topology can be uniquely reconstructed from measured data. We also specialize our results to homogeneous networks of SISO systems and we will see that such networks have quite particular identifiability properties. Secondly, we develop a topology identification method that reconstructs the network topology from input/output data. The solution of a generalized Sylvester equation will play an important role in our identification scheme.},

We also provide several sufficient conditions for convergence to the healthy state for mutating viruses over dynamic networks. We analyze various endemic states of the multi-virus model over static graphs, including providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of parallel equilibria.

We investigate how an attacker that has access to the measurements transmitted from the plant to the controller can perfectly estimate the internal state of the controller. This attack on sensitive information of the control loop is, on the one hand, a violation of the privacy, and, on the other hand, a violation of the security of the closed-loop system if the obtained estimate is used in a larger attack scheme. Current literature on sensor attacks often assumes that the attacker has already access to the controller’s state. However, this is not always possible. We derive conditions for when the attacker is able to perfectly estimate the controller’s state. These conditions show that if the controller has unstable poles a perfect estimate of the controller state is not possible. Moreover, we propose a defence mechanism to render the attack infeasible. This defence is based on adding uncertainty to the controller dynamics. We also discuss why an unstable controller is only a good defence for certain plants. Finally, simulations with a three-tank system verify our results.},

The design of the controllers needs only a single communication step for the information exchange between neighboring subsystems. The main results of the paper are a new representation of the internal dynamics as differential–algebraic equations that lead to a relation between the tracked flat output and the original subsystem output and the proof that the proposed networked controllers ensure trajectory tracking.},

Specifically, we address the multiphase mixed-integer nonlinear optimal control problem that arises when the optimal gear choice, torque split and engine on/off controls are sought in off-line evaluations. We propose an efficient model by introducing vanishing constraints and a phase specific right-hand side function that accounts for the different powertrain operating modes. The gearbox and driveability requirements translate into combinatorial constraints. These constraints have not been included in previous research; however, they are part of the algorithmic framework for this investigation. We devise a tailored algorithm to solve this problem by extending the combinatorial integral approximation ( CIA ) technique that breaks down the original mixed-integer nonlinear program into a sequence of nonlinear programs and mixed-integer linear programs, followed by a discussion of its approximation error. Finally, numerical results illustrate the proposed algorithm in terms of solution quality and run time.},

  abstract     = {The growing complexity of modern Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) and the frequent communication between their components make them vulnerable to malicious attacks. As a result, secure state estimation is a critical requirement for the control of these systems. Many existing secure state estimation methods suffer from combinatorial complexity which grows with the number of states and sensors in the system. This complexity can be mitigated using optimization-based methods that relax the original state estimation problem, although at the cost of optimality as these methods often identify attack-free sensors as attacked. In this paper, we propose a new optimal graph-search algorithm to correctly identify malicious attacks and to securely estimate the states even in large-scale CPS modeled as linear time-invariant systems The graph consists of layers, each one containing two nodes capturing a truth assignment of any given sensor, and directed edges connecting adjacent layers only. Then, our algorithm searches the layers of this graph incrementally, favoring directions at higher layers with more attack-free assignments, while actively managing a repository of nodes to be expanded at later iterations. The proposed search bias and the ability to revisit nodes in the repository and self-correct, allow our graph-search algorithm to reach the optimal assignment faster and tackle larger problems. We show that our algorithm is complete and optimal provided that process and measurement noises do not dominate the attack signal. Moreover, we provide numerical simulations that demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to correctly identify attacked sensors and securely reconstruct the state. Our simulations show that our method outperforms existing algorithms both in terms of optimality and execution time.},

In addition, in the case of scalar plants, the estimation and transmission performances under different kinds of event-based scheduling policies are compared theoretically. An important inequality on a truncated covariance of some particular multivariate Gaussian distribution is proved, which builds a bridge between performances of the two event-based policies. Based on this inequality, it is proved that for any considered stochastic event-based transmission policy, there always exists a deterministic counterpart that leads to better estimation performance using the same communication and computational resources.

In this paper, we will develop a systematic approach for addressing such SCCs. First, we will parametrize the local SCCs through proposing an algorithm, with which the parametrization in the general case can be obtained. It will be seen that the parametrization in the general case is subject to some systems of Puiseux series, a new notion introduced in this paper. With the systems of Puiseux series, we can further explore the algebraic as well as the geometric properties of local SCCs. Next, all possible cases regarding the systems of Puiseux series and the topological structure will be appropriately classified. The resultant topological classifications, which take into account the distribution of the characteristic roots (from the stability standpoint), are insightful for the stability and stabilization studies. Finally, the asymptotic behavior issue when the parameters move along any given curve is addressed. We will show that the asymptotic behavior, in this case, corresponds to a group of Puiseux series, from which the detailed information on the local root loci is available. Moreover, this approach helps to verify the approaches proposed previously, such that all the approaches presented in our paper can be cross-validated.},

Such problems can be solved via a proximal gradient method and its variants, thereby generalizing gradient descent to a nonsmooth setup. In this paper, we view proximal algorithms as dynamical systems and leverage techniques from control theory to study their global properties. In particular, for problems with strongly convex objective functions, we utilize the theory of integral quadratic constraints to prove the global exponential stability of the equilibrium points of the differential equations that govern the evolution of proximal gradient and Douglas–Rachford splitting flows. In our analysis, we use the fact that these algorithms can be interpreted as variable-metric gradient methods on the suitable envelopes and exploit structural properties of the nonlinear terms that arise from the gradient of the smooth part of the objective function and the proximal operator associated with the nonsmooth regularizer. We also demonstrate that these envelopes can be obtained from the augmented Lagrangian associated with the original nonsmooth problem and establish conditions for global exponential convergence even in the absence of strong convexity.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the resilient beamforming problem for a network of collaborative sensors in presence of faulty nodes. The main objective is to synchronize the signal phases at an intended destination and maximize the signal power. Towards this objective, we first propose a random grouping distributed beamforming (RG-DB) algorithm in the fault-free setup. For the RG-DB algorithm, each sensor classifies itself into one of two groups according to a random mechanism over a time horizon, during which a group of sensors control the phases of their transmissions, while the other group of sensors do not update their phases. This paper shows global convergence towards phase synchronization with probability one by applying the RG-DB algorithm. On the basis of the RG-DB algorithm, a random grouping based resilient distributed beamforming (RG-RDB) algorithm is then developed to solve the resilient beamforming problem in presence of faulty sensors. It is shown that the RG-RDB algorithm asymptotically makes the probability of selecting a faulty node for collective signal transmitting converge to zero, and thus solves the resilient beamforming problem by a subset of properly functioning sensors. Simulations are provided validating the algorithms developed in this paper.},

  abstract     = {We consider a multidimensional closed-loop control problem where a stochastic linear time-invariant plant is connected via a communication system that includes an encoder, vector additive Gaussian noise (AGN) channel, decoder to a controller. For this setup, we first examine the impact of the communication link when causal side information (CSI) that is correlated to the plant is (possibly) allowed at the decoder and the performance criterion is the classical linear quadratic (LQ) cost. The CSI is modeled as a time-invariant vector-valued Gaussian process and when available at the decoder, it happens concurrently to the signal obtained from the vector AGN channel. Under the assumption that our encoder is linear, we leverage the separation principle of control and estimation, to obtain the following new results. (i) For multivariate Gaussian processes, we completely characterize a lower bound on the communication cost term of the optimal LQ Gaussian (LQG) cost in the form of a convex optimization problem and identify the best linear policies that achieve this bound. (ii) For scalar-valued Gaussian processes, we derive an analytical solution to the lower bound of the optimal communication cost term and show that for linear policies, CSI at the encoder does not improve the specific bound. (iii) For scalar-valued Gaussian processes, we also derive a linear time-invariant low delay joint source-channel coding (JSCC) scheme without bandwidth constraints, when CSI is available at the encoder, which demonstrates the case at which the specific lower bound communication cost expression is achievable. Further, we give a suboptimal linear time-invariant JSCC scheme when CSI is available only at the decoder. We supplement our results with various simulation studies.},

The SMPC procedure is based on a scenario tree that encodes the most likely system behavior for a given tree density, where each branch of the tree represents a specific evolution of the system that occurs with a certain probability. A mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is developed that maximizes the average time until constraint violation for a given scenario tree. Feedback is provided by reconstructing the scenario tree and recomputing the MILP solution over a receding time horizon based on the current state of the system. The average time until constraint violation achieved by the SMPC strategy approaches the optimal value as the scenario tree density is increased. Two numerical case studies, including an adaptive cruise control problem, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SMPC strategy compared to dynamic programming solutions.},

The investigation makes use of a laboratory-prototype emulating an architecture composed by a sample to be analyzed, and by a metrology platform whose task is to carry out in-line measurements, while the whole system is being affected by exogenous vibrations. The control objective is to lock the distance between the metrology platform and the sample, thereby allowing the pursuit of the measurement task. The proposed solution achieves robustness with respect to unknown plant parameters and exogenous disturbances by means of a combination of high-frequency and high-gain tools, and by relying on a novel “learning observer”. The proposed design is formally analyzed, and then experimentally validated by providing a comparative study with a PID-based control-strategy. The experimental results indicate, overall, a favorable performance of the proposed control algorithm over the PID counterpart.},

Firstly, by introducing Pontryagin’s maximum principle in distributed fashions, a new kind of distributed fixed-time bipartite synchronization protocols is developed. Then, through multi-step motion planning techniques, the designed protocols can ensure that the states of agents converge to values with the same module but different sign at a pre-appointed settling time. Compared with existing results, an important contribution of this paper is that it is over directed networks that fixed-time bipartite synchronization problems are solved. Meanwhile, the fixed settling time can be appointed in advance. Finally, the application to formation problems with a pre-appointed settling time is further considered to indicate the utility of proposed protocols.},

This allows us to prove asymptotic stability in significant cases that were not amenable to previous Lyapunov function constructions, and in cases that violate the contraction requirement that was needed to prove asymptotic stability in previous trajectory based results.

  abstract     = {The moving average (MA)-type scheme, also known as the smoothing method, has been well established within the multivariate statistical process monitoring (MSPM) framework since the 1990s. However, its theoretical basis is still limited to smoothing independent data, and the optimality of its equally or exponentially weighted scheme remains unproven. This paper aims to weaken the independence assumption in the existing MA method, and then extend it to a broader area of dealing with autocorrelated weakly stationary processes. With the discovery of the non-optimality of the equally and exponentially weighted schemes used for fault detection when data have autocorrelation, the essence that they do not effectively utilize the correlation information of samples is revealed, giving birth to an optimally weighted moving average (OWMA) theory. The OWMA method is combined with the Hotelling’s T 2 statistic to form an OWMA T 2 control chart (OWMA-TCC), in order to detect a more challenging type of fault, i.e., intermittent fault (IF). Different from the MA scheme that puts an equal weight on samples within a time window, OWMA-TCC uses correlation (autocorrelation and cross-correlation) information to find an optimal weight vector (OWV) for the purpose of IF detection (IFD). In order to achieve a best IFD performance, the concept of IF detectability is defined and corresponding detectability conditions are provided, which further serve as selection criteria of the OWV. Then, the OWV is given in the form of a solution to nonlinear equations, whose existence is proven with the aid of the Brouwer fixed-point theory. Moreover, symmetrical structure of the OWV is revealed, and the optimality of the MA scheme for any IF directions when data exhibit no autocorrelation is proven. Finally, simulations on a numerical example and a continuous stirred tank reactor process are carried out to give a comprehensive comparison among OWMA-TCC and several existing static and dynamic MSPM methods. The results show a superior IFD performance of the developed methods.},

This framework enables us to derive novel LPV SID schemes that are extensions of existing linear time-invariant (LTI) methods. More specifically, we derive the open-loop, closed-loop, and predictor-based data-equations (input–output surrogate forms of the SS representation) by systematically establishing an LPV subspace identification theory. We also show the additional challenges of the LPV setting compared to the LTI case. Based on the data-equations, several methods are proposed to estimate LPV-SS models based on a maximum-likelihood or a realization based argument. Furthermore, the established theoretical framework for the LPV subspace identification problem allows us to lower the number of to-be-estimated parameters and to overcome dimensionality problems of the involved matrices, leading to a decrease in the computational complexity of LPV SIDs in general. To the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first in-depth examination of the LPV subspace identification problem. The effectiveness of the proposed subspace identification methods are demonstrated and compared with existing methods in a Monte Carlo study of identifying a benchmark MIMO LPV system.},

  abstract     = {Closed-loop functional electrical stimulation (FES) control methods are developed to enable motorized assistive split-crank (i.e., a cycle without mechanical coupling between the lower limbs) cycling for rehabilitation efforts for people with lower limb movement disorders. The non-dominant side tracks a desired range of cadence and the dominant side tracks a range of position offsets centered around the position of the non-dominant side. A multi-level switched system with switched control objectives is applied to both sides of the cycle-rider system. Assistive, uncontrolled, and resistive modes for the dominant and non-dominant subsystems are based on position and cadence, respectively. Global exponential tracking to upper and lower bounds of an uncontrolled desired region is proven for each side via Lyapunov-based analysis using switched system methods. Experiments on both able-bodied participants and participants with neuromuscular conditions show the performance of the switched control system for split-crank FES-cycling. From volitional to controlled pedaling in able-bodied participants, average RMS cadence error of the non-dominant, RMS position error of the dominant, and cadence differential between the two legs improved by 76.2\%, 65.3\%, and 58.0\%, respectively. On average, experiments on participants with neuromuscular conditions resulted in RMS errors that were 45.8\%, 92.6\%, and 52.0\% higher than controlled trials on able-bodied participants, but 65.3\%, 33.3\%, and 36.3\% lower than volitional-only trials of able-bodied participants.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new control framework for an insect-scale flapping-wing vehicle is presented that exploits passive aerodynamic effects to stabilize the attitude dynamics. Many flapping-wing robotic flyers and flying insects share a common morphological feature in that the center of mass (CoM) is below the center of pressure (CoP), which makes the hovering configuration intrinsically unstable with open-loop control. Motivated by the fact that the CoM should be ahead of the CoP to ensure the longitudinal stability of the flight dynamics, a new coordinate system is proposed by placing a virtual control point (VCP) above the CoP. The dynamics in the new coordinates are derived using a near-identity diffeomorphism which admits a partial feedback linearization with stable zero dynamics. The behavior of the zero dynamics resembles the dynamics of a 3D pendulum with an aerodynamic damper. An adaptive controller is proposed to make the upright orientation almost globally asymptotically stable over a bounded uncertainty of the aerodynamic drag coefficient. The controller is evaluated in simulation with a Harvard RoboBee following a virtual control point reference trajectory.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel static output feedback stabilization of polynomial systems with bounded actuators. We propose a new sufficient condition for static output feedback design for nominal polynomial systems with constraints on input magnitudes. In the proposed stabilization condition, the system matrices and the Lyapunov matrices are separated, and hence parameterization of the controller is independent of the Lyapunov matrices. The main result is the novel parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions that are readily applied to robust static output feedback design of polynomial systems subject to parametric uncertainty. The proposed design conditions are bilinear in the decision variables. Hence, we provide iterative algorithms to solve the design problems. At each iteration, the design condition is cast as parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities using the sum-of-squares technique and can be efficiently solved. The proposed approach leads to enhanced static output feedback design with computationally tractable formulation. Effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes opportunistic state-triggered strategies for solving convex multiobjective optimization problems that involve human–robot interaction. The robot is aware of the multiple objective functions defining the problem, but requires human input to find the most desirable Pareto solution. In order to avoid overloading the human with queries, we view her as a limited resource to the robot, and design event-triggered controllers that opportunistically prescribe the information exchanges among them. We consider various models of human performance, starting with an ideal one where queries are responded instantaneously, and later considering constraints on the response time and the interaction frequency. For each model, we formally establish the asymptotic convergence to the desired optimizer and rule out the existence of Zeno behavior.},
