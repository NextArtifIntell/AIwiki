  abstract     = {Many engineering problems rely on causal reasoning to analyze the interactions among the numerous causes/variables. Probabilistic graphical models (e.g., Bayesian networks) are widely used for such analyses, but the conditional probability tables (CPTs) grow exponentially with respect to the number of variables (nodes). Several canonical models have been developed to reduce the amount of information needed to complete the CPTs. In this paper, the Extended Recursive Noisy OR (ERNOR) is developed. It is an improved version of the long-established RNOR, in that it resolves the asymmetry problem when the number of causes exceeds three. Like RNOR, it is not restricted to the independence of causal influence , thus synergy can be considered. The dynamic form of the ERNOR is also developed, which provides a continuous causal influence function. This function is dependent on cumulative distributions that represent the presence level of each time-dependent cause, useful for models that do not rely on CPTs. The derivation of the ERNOR is presented, and it is contrasted with its predecessor, the RNOR.},

  abstract     = {Covering rough set theory and binary relation based rough set theory are regarded as two important different generalizations of Z. Pawlak&#39;s classical rough set theory. In fact, when serial relations are considered, they are the same thing. If R is a serial relation from a universe U to another universe V , then { { R − 1 ( y ) } : y ∈ V } {{R−1(y)}:y∈V} is a covering of U and { { R ( x ) } : x ∈ U } {{R(x)}:x∈U} is a covering of V . In a covering approximation space ( U , C ) (U,C) , the relation R defined as R ( x ) = { C ∈ C : x ∈ C } R(x)={C∈C:x∈C} is just a serial relation from U to V = C V=C . So U and V have the same status and ( U , V , R ) (U,V,R) is indeed a whole, then ( U , V , R ) (U,V,R) is called an Approximation System in order to take a comprehensive study from a new and higher perspective. By introducing n t h l nthl neighborhoods and k t h r kthr neighborhoods recursively, a new set of upper and lower approximation operators is established, and the Approximation System is further referred to as the Generalized Rough Approximation System (GRAS). In order to describe some stability of the Approximate System, characteristic numbers such as l-cycle number, r-cycle number, link number and connect number are also introduced. From there, partitions of GRAS can be constructed and sub-GRAS can be defined. This makes the whole of GRAS modularized, which is a big simplification when it comes to solving real problems. In addition, some applications of characteristic numbers and approximation operators are illustrated by examples, and the Boolean matrix calculation formulas of all approximations are proved. Finally, the important special GRAS ( U , U , R ) (U,U,R) is studied in detail and an application example is given.},

Such task falls under the umbrella of Risk-Sensitive Markov Decision Processes, which optimize a non-additive, non-linear function of cumulative cost that incorporates the user&#39;s attitude towards risk. Current algorithms for solving that task, for any budget equal or smaller than an user-defined budget, scale poorly when the support of the cost function is large, since they operate in an augmented state space which enumerates all possible remaining budgets. To circumvent this issue, we develop (i) an improved version of the Topological Value Iteration with Dynamic Programming algorithm ( tvi-dp ), and (ii) the first symbolic dynamic programming algorithm for this class of problems, called rs-spudd , that exploits conditional independence in the transition function in the augmented state space. The proposed algorithms improve efficiency by pruning irrelevant states and terminating early, without sacrificing optimality . Empirical results show that rs-spudd is able to solve problems up to 10 3 times larger than tvi-dp .},

This requires that the uncertainty measure has generalization performance . Fuzzy rough set (FRS) theory is a popular mathematical tool for uncertainty measure, but the theory does not work well for some data distributions. For example, when the class density difference of the data set is large, FRS theory cannot effectively evaluate the classification uncertainty of samples. In this study, we combine the relative measure with the lower approximation of FRSs to propose a relative uncertainty measure which can address the above-mentioned problem. Furthermore, a fuzzy rough feature selection algorithm is designed, and it is mainly used to test the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed measure. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed feature selection algorithm has good performance. It indirectly proves that the relative uncertainty measure is effective and efficient in classification tasks .},

According to whether the absorbing element of a 2-uninorm is consistent with the neutral element of a uninorm or not, we study the migrativity properties of uninorms in the usual classes over the three different subclasses of 2-uninorms. In addition, all solutions of the migrative equations are respectively analyzed and characterized for all possible combinations of uninorms in the usual classes and the three different subclasses of 2-uninorms.

  abstract     = {Fuzzy rough sets (FRS) provides effective ways for selecting the compact/relevant feature subset for hybrid decision systems. However, the underlying complexity of the existing FRS methods through batch processing is often costly or intractable on large data and also suffer from continuous model adaptation on dynamic data. This paper proposes a FRS based incremental feature subset selection (IvFMFRS) framework using fuzzy min-max neural network (FMNN) as a preprocessor step in aiding to deal with data dynamically without sacrificing classification performance. FMNN is a single epoch learning algorithm employed to construct fuzzy hyperboxes (information granules) of pattern spaces very fast. Fuzzy hyperboxes facilitate the formation of interval-valued decision system (IDS) from the numerical decision system of much smaller size. In IvFMFRS, on each sample subset arrival, an incremental mechanism for updating fuzzy discernibility matrix (FDM) based on constructed IDS is first formulated and then update feature subset by adding and deleting features based on updated FDM. A comparative analysis has been conducted comprehensively to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm with the existing FRS methods on numerical datasets. And, the results show that the IvFMFRS obtained the relevant feature subsets with similar classification accuracy with significantly less computational time than existing FRS methods.},

Subsequently, we present the concepts of conflict, neutrality and alliance sets on one issue and multiple issues respectively, and introduce a method to compute the three sets via Bayesian decision theory. Moreover, the degree of conflict, neutrality and alliance among agents with respect to an issue are defined respectively. According to the conflict and alliance degrees, the set of issues is divided into three parts: the main reason, secondary reason and irrelevant reason.

In this theoretical paper we give an implicit characterization of the minimal set of inequalities. Specifically, we introduce a dual polyhedron (to the chordal graph polytope) defined by trivial equality constraints, simple monotonicity inequalities and certain inequalities assigned to incomplete chordal graphs. Our main result is that the vertices of this polyhedron yield the facet-defining inequalities for the chordal graph polytope. We also show that the original conjecture is equivalent to the condition that all vertices of the dual polyhedron are zero-one vectors. Using that result we disprove the original conjecture: we find a vector in the dual polyhedron which is not in the convex hull of zero-one vectors from the dual polyhedron.},

  abstract     = {The notion of q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) enables decision makers to record diverse uncertain information in a larger scope by easing the limitation of membership and non-membership degrees. The paper introduces q-ROFSs into the framework of multi-granularity three-way decisions (MG-3WD) and explores a novel multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) approach in q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) information systems. After reviewing some fundamental issues on q-ROFSs and MG-3WD, we first propose different types of multigranulation q-ROF probabilistic models and discuss some of their theoretical properties. Afterwards, a q-ROF MAGDM approach is constructed in light of the proposed multigranulation q-ROF probabilistic models and decision making-based 3WD methods. Then, we provide an example of corporate financial quality matching (CFQM) to show the practicability of the established q-ROF MAGDM approach. At last, corresponding sensitivity analysis, validity tests, comparative analysis and experimental analysis are arranged to reveal the applicability of the established approach from the aspect of MG-3WD.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian network (BN) structure learning from complete data has been extensively studied in the literature. However, fewer theoretical results are available for incomplete data, and most are related to the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Balov [1] proposed an alternative approach called Node-Average Likelihood (NAL) that is competitive with EM but computationally more efficient; and he proved its consistency and model identifiability for discrete BNs. In this paper, we give general sufficient conditions for the consistency of NAL; and we prove consistency and identifiability for conditional Gaussian BNs, which include discrete and Gaussian BNs as special cases. Furthermore, we confirm our results and the results in Balov [1] with an independent simulation study. Hence we show that NAL has a much wider applicability than originally implied in Balov [1] , and that it is competitive with EM for conditional Gaussian BNs as well.},

  abstract     = {Many instance selection algorithms have been introduced to reduce the high storage requirements and computation complexity of K -nearest neighbor ( K -NN) classification rules. However, the information provided by the neighbors of one instance was still not completely utilized in many studies. The information is usually in the form of a quantitative metric for determining whether an instance can be selected. Thus, many instances may have the same quality, which confuses the selection results. In addition, the proposed metrics are simply added without deeper fusion and the information loss has further negative effects. To address these issues, we propose a new instance selection algorithm for K -NN rules in the evidence theory framework called evidential instance selection (EIS). The basic idea is that all neighbors of every instance first provide distinct items of evidence regarding the estimated value of the label (called the estimation label) for each instance. After fusing the items of evidence and computing the conflicts among them, instances with higher conflict are considered more likely to be near the class boundaries. Finally, the selection of boundary instances is formalized as solving an optimal problem, where the objective function considers both the reduction rate and classification accuracy . When dealing with big data sets, EIS is enhanced as a distributed and parallel version called EIS-AS by applying Apache Spark to alleviate the computational bottleneck . We tested EIS and EIS-AS with 30 small data sets and six big data sets, respectively, which contained up to 11 million instances. The experimental results showed that EIS performed well at simplifying the raw training data and EIS-AS could cope with big data sets in an appropriate manner.},

Finally, we validate its performance using synthetic data, and we discuss its strengths and limitations comparing it with the score-based structure learning algorithm from Nodelman et al. [23] . We find the latter to be more accurate in learning networks with binary variables, while our constraint-based approach is more accurate with variables assuming more than two values. Numerical experiments confirm that score-based and constraint-based algorithms are comparable in terms of computation time.},

Firstly, the parameter estimation and Akaike information criterion analysis are utilized to select an optimal copula based on available samples, by which the joint cumulative distribution function is constructed for the correlated input variables. Then, using the obtained joint cumulative distribution function, the correlated parametric probability-boxes are transformed into independent normal variables, and an efficient method based on sparse grid numerical integration is proposed to calculate the bounds on statistical moments of a response function.

  abstract     = {Bayesian networks (BN) are a popular representation for reasoning under uncertainty. The analysis of many real-world use cases, that in principle can be modeled by BNs, suffers however from the computational complexity of inference. Inference methods based on Weighted Model Counting (WMC) reduce the cost of inference by exploiting patterns exhibited by the probabilities associated with BN nodes. However, these methods require a computationally intensive compilation step in search of these patterns, which effectively prohibits the handling of larger BNs. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by extending WMC methods with a framework called Compositional Weighted Model Counting (CWMC). CWMC reduces compilation cost by partitioning a BN into a set of subproblems , thereby scaling the application of state-of-the-art innovations in WMC to scenarios where inference cost could previously not be amortized over compilation cost. The framework supports various target representations that are less or equally succinct as decision-DNNF. At the same time, its inference time complexity O ( n exp ⁡ ( w ) ) O(nexp⁡(w)) , where n is the number of variables and w is the tree-width, is comparable to mainstream algorithms based on variable elimination, clustering and conditioning.},

However many practical decision-making problems face the information with uncertainty and complexity, which makes it impossible to obtain relative loss functions in MA3WD. By introducing the thinking of ideal solutions (IS), this study extends MA3WD to interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment, giving a more flexible and general model to handle with uncertain MADM problems. In this paper, we firstly propose an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy three-way decision (IVIF3WD) model by obtaining relative loss functions derived from evaluation values, and introduce ideal solutions to construct an ideal-solution based three-way decision model with single interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy attribute. Then in consideration of all the attributes, two multi-attribute IVIF3WD models are proposed in the perspectives of individual ideal solutions and global ideal solutions respectively. Finally, two cases of investment with different fuzzy information are utilized to illustrate the application and superiority of proposed models.},

First, the cophenetic distances, based on a time series linear cross-dependency measure, are obtained. Second, these distances are used as an input of a non-Euclidean fuzzy relational clustering algorithm . As a result, we obtain a robust fuzzy procedure capable of detecting groups of time series with different types of cross-dependency.

  abstract     = {The high computational impact when mining fuzzy association rules grows significantly when managing very large data sets, triggering in many cases a memory overflow error and leading to the experiment failure without its conclusion. It is in these cases when the application of Big Data techniques can help to achieve the experiment completion. Therefore, in this paper several Spark algorithms are proposed to handle with massive fuzzy data and discover interesting association rules. For that, we based on a decomposition of interestingness measures in terms of α -cuts, and we experimentally demonstrate that it is sufficient to consider only 10 equidistributed α -cuts in order to mine all significant fuzzy association rules . Additionally, all the proposals are compared and analysed in terms of efficiency and speed up, in several datasets, including a real dataset comprised of sensor measurements from an office building.},

In this paper, we utilize degree values to reflect the weights of possible linguistic terms and first propose a novel concept called degree-based linguistic term set (DLTS) from the perspective of degree. Then we present a new multi-attribute three-way decision method under the environment of DLTSs. Furthermore, considering that if only one person is involved in decision-making process, it may produce unreasonable or unfair evaluation results. We choose multiple decision-makers to participate in the decision-making process, and propose a multi-attribute group three-way decision method by utilizing the idea of TOPSIS method under the environment of DLTSs. Since the weights of multiple decision-makers (DMs) may be different, we give a method to determine the weights by using the idea of information gain based on the three-way decision results of each decision-maker (DM). Finally, we compare our decision method with an existing decision method, and illustrate the effectiveness of our method through a concrete example.},

  abstract     = {Inferential challenges that arise when data are censored have been extensively studied under the classical frameworks. In this paper, we provide an alternative generalized inferential model approach whose output is a data-dependent plausibility function. This construction is driven by an association between the distribution of the relative likelihood function at the interest parameter and an unobserved auxiliary variable. The plausibility function emerges from the distribution of a suitably calibrated random set designed to predict that unobserved auxiliary variable. The evaluation of this plausibility function requires a novel use of the classical Kaplan–Meier estimator to estimate the censoring rather than the event distribution. We prove that the proposed method provides valid inference, at least approximately, and our real- and simulated-data examples demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing methods.},

The player wins the game if the budget reaches a given objective value g , and loses the game if the budget drops to zero (the gambler is ruined). This article introduces the decisional gambling process , where the parameter p is hidden, and the player has the possibility to stop the game at any round keeping earnings. In this case, the best a player can do is to maintain an estimate of p based on the observed outcomes, and use it to decide whether is better to stay or quit the game. The main contribution of this article is to bring the question of finding the optimal stopping time to the gambler&#39;s ruin game.

Aiming at the shortcoming of KWFLICM algorithm, this paper proposes a novel fuzzy local information c-means clustering algorithm utilizing total Bregman divergence driven by polynomial kernel function (TKWFLICM). Firstly, total Bregman divergence (TBD) is kernelized by global polynomial kernel function to solve the problem of kernel-based distance metric without rotation-invariance. Secondly, TBD with polynomial kernel metric is modified by local neighborhood information of current pixel to further enhance the ability to suppress the noise in image. In the end, the modified TBD with polynomial kernel is introduced into the objective function of KWFLICM, and then a novel robust fuzzy clustering with high robustness is obtained. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than existing state-of-the-art KWFLICM algorithm, and the kernelized TBD can also be utilized in fuzzy clustering-related algorithms, which will enhance the anti-noise robustness of these algorithms.},

IGs formalise analyses performed by domain experts in the informal reasoning tools they are familiar with, such as mind maps used in crime analysis. Based on principles for reasoning with causal and evidential information given the evidence, we impose constraints on the inferences that may be performed with IGs. Our IG-formalism is intended to facilitate the construction of formal representations within AI systems by serving as an intermediary formalism between analyses performed using informal reasoning tools and formalisms that allow for formal evaluation. In this paper, we investigate the use of the IG-formalism as an intermediary formalism in facilitating Bayesian network (BN) graph construction . We propose a structured approach for automatically constructing from an IG a directed BN graph, together with qualitative constraints on the probability distribution represented by the BN. Moreover, we prove a number of formal properties of our approach and identify assumptions under which the construction of an initial BN graph can be fully automated.},

In this paper, a novel rule-based granular ITS model is proposed by considering the interval-valued data as interval information granules in the framework of granular computing (GrC). The development of the proposed granular model consists of three components with progressive relationship, that is, the generation of granular prototypes, the formation of initial granular model and the refinement of the initial granular model. Further, the detail computation of reasoning of the corresponding granular model is also given. The resulting granular models have not only interpretability but also an ability to process ITS containing linguistic variables . Numerical experiments on six financial datasets and two meteorological datasets from real world reveal the impact of the parameter involved in the proposed method on the resulting granular model, and also exhibit that the resulting granular model is superior to seven existing competitive models including interval Holt one, multi-output support vector regression one and interval arithmetic-based multilayer perceptron one etc.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider compound conditionals, Fréchet-Hoeffding bounds and the probabilistic interpretation of Frank t-norms. By studying the solvability of suitable linear systems, we show under logical independence the sharpness of the Fréchet-Hoeffding bounds for the prevision of conjunctions and disjunctions of n conditional events. In addition, we illustrate some details in the case of three conditional events. We study the set of all coherent prevision assessments on a family containing n conditional events and their conjunction, by verifying that it is convex. We discuss the case where the prevision of conjunctions is assessed by Lukasiewicz t-norms and we give explicit solutions for the linear systems; then, we analyze a selected example. We obtain a probabilistic interpretation of Frank t-norms and t-conorms as prevision of conjunctions and disjunctions of conditional events, respectively. Then, we characterize the sets of coherent prevision assessments on a family containing n conditional events and their conjunction, or their disjunction, by using Frank t-norms, or Frank t-conorms. By assuming logical independence, we show that any Frank t-norm (resp., t-conorm) of two conditional events A | H and B | K , T λ ( A | H , B | K ) (resp., S λ ( A | H , B | K ) ), is a conjunction ( A | H ) ∧ ( B | K ) (resp., a disjunction ( A | H ) ∨ ( B | K ) ). Then, we analyze the case of logical dependence where A = B and we obtain the set of coherent assessments on A | H , A | K , ( A | H ) ∧ ( A | K ) ; moreover we represent it in terms of the class of Frank t-norms T λ , with λ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] . By considering a family F containing three conditional events, their conjunction, and all pairwise conjunctions, we give some results on Frank t-norms and coherence of the prevision assessments on F . By assuming logical independence, we show that it is coherent to assess the previsions of all the conjunctions by means of Minimum and Product t-norms. In this case all the conjunctions coincide with the t-norms of the corresponding conditional events. We verify by a counterexample that, when the previsions of conjunctions are assessed by the Lukasiewicz t-norm, coherence is not assured. Then, the Lukasiewicz t-norm of conditional events may not be interpreted as their conjunction. Finally, we give two sufficient conditions for coherence and incoherence when using the Lukasiewicz t-norm.},

  abstract     = {Supervised learning is an important branch of machine learning (ML), which requires a complete annotation (labeling) of the involved training data. This assumption is relaxed in the settings of weakly supervised learning, where labels are allowed to be imprecise or partial. In this article, we study the setting of superset learning, in which instances are assumed to be labeled with a set of possible annotations containing the correct one. We tackle the problem of learning from such data in the context of rough set theory (RST). More specifically, we consider the problem of RST-based feature reduction as a suitable means for data disambiguation , i.e., for the purpose of figuring out the most plausible precise instantiation of the imprecise training data. To this end, we define appropriate generalizations of decision tables and reducts, using tools from generalized information theory and belief function theory. Moreover, we analyze the computational complexity and theoretical properties of the associated computational problems. Finally, we present results of a series of experiments, in which we analyze the proposed concepts empirically and compare our methods with a state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction algorithm , reporting a statistically significant improvement in predictive accuracy .},

It is essentially based on the weighted disjunctive operator, and new weighted and mean ( S , N ) (S,N) -implication functions are introduced. Then using the pliant operators – where all the operators have a common generator function – we give a parametric form of the implication, namely the neutral value-dependent implication, and we show that some weakened properties of the fuzzy weighted implications are valid such as the identity principle, the ordering principle, the T -conditionality, the strong negation principle, etc. With this new concept, we use the fixed point of the negation as a threshold.

The same advantages of this decomposition approach hold in the more general setting: reduced complexity and increased power of computational independence tests. Moreover, latent (hidden) variables can be represented in MVR CGs by using bidirected edges, and our algorithm correctly recovers any independence structure that is faithful to an MVR CG, thus greatly extending the range of applications of decomposition-based model selection techniques. Simulations under a variety of settings demonstrate the competitive performance of our method in comparison with the PC-like algorithm (Sonntag and Peña, 2012) [43] . In fact, the decomposition-based algorithm usually outperforms the PC-like algorithm except in running time. The performance of both algorithms is much better when the underlying graph is sparse.},

In the context of conflict analysis, there are three attitudes for agents to describe the opinion, including supportive, opposite, and neutral. Then, the conflict situation is discussed and analyzed. In this paper, we propose an extended Pawlak conflict model concerning the trust mechanism to solve the problem of the reaching consensus process. Firstly, the degree of conflict is defined by the weights of agents considering the penalty factors, and an extended Pawlak conflict model is presented. Then, the trust recommendation mechanism is proposed to modify the opinions of agents and reach conflict consensus. Four kinds of feedback mechanism are discussed by using four perspectives: 1) without the penalty factors and no limit to the range of adjustments; 2) without the penalty factors and the attitude of agents vary from pessimistic to neutral; 3) with the penalty factors and no limit to the range of adjustments; 4) with the penalty factors and the attitude of agents vary from pessimistic to neutral. Furthermore, this paper presents a process of reaching consensus based on the trust recommendation mechanism for the conflict analysis problem. Finally, a case study is used to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. A comparative analysis is completed for the parameters and the maximum alliances could be obtained with the original Pawlak conflict model.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems are an effective tool to resolve information overload by enabling the selection of the subsets of items from a universal set based on user preferences. The operation of most of recommender systems depends on the prediction ratings, which may introduce a degree of uncertainty into the process of recommendation. However, systems equipped with only two strategies lack the flexibility to address such uncertain decision-making problems. Thus, the presence of far-fetched recommendations accompanied by uncertainties often decreases recommendation quality. To resolve this issue, a three-way recommendation model based on a novel shadowed set is proposed in this paper to reduce decision-making risk and improve quality. To this end, a neighborhood rough set model is first introduced into three-way recommendation to determine similar user to active users with respect to the original rating decision system. This helps to avoid the uncertainty generated during the assignment of prediction rating. Subsequently, the optimal neighborhood radius is defined to overcome the subjectivity associated with the construction of the aforementioned neighborhood with a subjective parameter. Following this, a novel shadowed set model, based on neighborhood memberships of boundary users, is proposed to partition all users into positive region, negativity region and boundary region. This facilitates the adoption of different decisions by recommender systems for users in different regions. Finally, the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed model are verified on two Movielens datasets via comparison analyses.},

How to deal with this problem in medical diagnosis? Domain adaptation is an effective machine learning method to solve the scarce or no labeled samples problem. In this paper, an improved adversarial domain adaptation network is presented to solve this problem in tumor image diagnosis. We construct the tumor image diagnosis adversarial domain adaptation network framework. The framework consists of three parts: a feature extractor, a domain discriminator and a label predictor. The loss function of framework is designed in the paper. We design a feature extractor to acquire the domain invariant feature between the source domain and target domain. The feature extractor is an improved neural network consisting of several convolutional layers and sampling layers. The feature extractor pre-processes the input samples and gets the initial feature of the input space. The domain discriminator predicts the domain label and works adversarial with the feature extractor. The adversarial learning between the feature extractor and the domain discriminator acts as a regularization in the framework. The adversarial game can minimize the distance between the two domains and make sure the feature extractor learns the domain invariant feature. A label predictor is designed to classify the tumor image of the target domain based on the domain-invariant feature. The experiments on tumor image dataset are presented to validate the performance of proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the other domain adaptation methods.},

  abstract     = {Background modeling is a crucial step in various computer vision applications such as video surveillance, object tracking , and moving object detection . Classifying image pixels as foreground or background is yet a challenging task particularly in complicated situations such as illumination variations , rippling water, camera jitter, and the presence of fast and slow moving objects. Therefore, for a better detection of the moving objects, the multi-modal nature of a scene in those intricate situations should be modeled by multiple models for each image pixel. To this end, in this article, we improve our previous work by fusing color features and texture features using Choquet fuzzy integral . Thereby, our proposed spatial color features that are described by Atanassov&#39;s Intuitionistic 3D Fuzzy Histon Roughness Index are fused by the texture features extracted using a covariance matrix . As handling multi-modal background updating is an arduous task, we also propose a new model updating for tackling various challenges such as model initializing with moving objects, existence of fast and slow moving objects in a scene, and existence of the moving objects that stop for a while. We intensively evaluate our proposed approach on diverse benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and supremacy of our proposed approach compared to its previous version and the state-of-the-art algorithms in the field.},

We first propose two new construction methods of nullnorms derived from an arbitrary t-norm (resp. an arbitrary t-conorm) using a closure operator (resp. an interior operator) on bounded lattices, where some sufficient and necessary conditions are considered. Then, we introduce two other methods to obtain nullnorms based on a closure operator (an interior operator) on bounded lattices with some constraints. In particular, we obtain some new classes of idempotent nullnorms on bounded lattices. Moreover, we provide some examples for a better understanding of new classes of nullnorms on bounded lattices.},

The dependence and information distance between ISts are discussed, and characterizations of ISts in a FSVIS are acquired. Additionally, as an application of ISts in a FSVIS, the entropy measure of uncertainty for a FSVIS is discussed, and on the basis of this uncertainty measure, the optimal selection of ISts is investigated. The obtained consequence will be conducive to establishing a framework for GrC in a FSVIS.

Our proposal consists of an individual information database management system that can provide information on-demand on various variables. Such a system has to deal with several sources of uncertainty: lack of information, evolving information and reliability of the information sources. We consider that the features of the person may evolve with time causing uncertainty due to obsolete information. Our context includes new information received bit by bit, with no possibility to collect all required information at once. This paper establishes a first proposal to manage a set of uncertain observations, in order to reduce erroneous and obsolete information while keeping the benefit of previously collected information. We propose an architecture of the system based on a probabilistic knowledge model about the characteristics of interest, a set of decay functions that help to evaluate the confidence degree in previous observations, and a reasoning module to manage new observations, maintain the compatibility and the quality of the observation set. We detail the algorithms of the reasoning module, and the algorithm to update the confidence degree of the observations.},

In Choquet calculus, Sugeno (2013) [10] and Torra and Narukawa (2016) [2] studied Choquet integral and derivative with respect to monotone measures on the real line. Then as a very challenging problem, the definition of entropy and relative entropy on monotone measures for infinite sets based on Choquet integral was proposed by Torra (2017) [1] and Agahi (2019) [12] . These results show that based on the submodularity condition on monotone measures, entropy and relative entropy for Choquet integral are non-negative. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of Lin divergence (Lin, 1991, [8] ), including Choquet integral and derivative with respect to monotone measures. Then some fundamental properties of this concept in information theory are given. In special case, we show that we can omit the submodularity condition in previous results on entropy and relative entropy for Choquet integral.},

  abstract     = {In machine learning , instance weighting is commonly used to control the influence of individual data points in a learning process. The general idea is to improve results (e.g., the accuracy of a predictor) by restricting the influence of training examples that do not appear to be representative and may bias the learner in an undesirable way. The simplest and most common approach is to modulate the influence of each data point through multiplicative scaling. In this paper, we elaborate on the idea of instance weighting through data imprecisiation as a viable alternative to existing methods, and formalize this approach within the framework of superset learning. Roughly speaking, the idea is to reduce the influence of training examples by turning a precise data point into an imprecise observation. Within the framework of optimistic superset learning, a generic approach to superset learning, this effectively comes down to modifying an underlying loss function on a per-instance basis. We illustrate our approach for the case of binary classification with support vector machines , showing that it compares favorably with existing approaches to instance weighting in support vector machines. In a further case study, we demonstrate the usefulness of instance weighting through data imprecisiation for the practical problem of depth estimation in monocular images.},

This method unifies many results in quantitative possibility theory concerning information modeling, data analysis, and the construction of joint distributions. Furthermore, we show how it enables new results about possibilistic information aggregation and how it may refine frequentist inference in (im-)precise statistical models. The approach is characterized by a clear distinction between the elementary events&#39; well-known objective possibilities from quantitative possibility theory and the elementary events&#39; subjective plausibilities, a reimagination of qualitative possibility measures, which helps overcome several non-uniqueness issues.},

Amongst existing semi-supervised clusterings, Semi-supervised Evidential Clustering (SECM) deals with the problem of uncertain/imprecise labels and creates a credal partition. In this work, a new heuristic algorithm , called SECM-h, is presented.

Specifically, we use efficient ways, based on previous work, to find common initial feasible points for these algorithms. Exploiting these initial feasible points, we develop early stopping criteria to determine whether gambles are either Γ-maximin, Γ-maximax or interval dominant. We observe that the primal-dual interior point method benefits considerably from these improvements. In our simulation, we find that our proposed algorithms outperform the standard algorithms when the size of the domain of lower previsions is less or equal to the sizes of decisions and outcomes.

We provide the conditions for which these modifier operators satisfy the requirements for a dual pair of necessity and possibility operators. Next, the necessary and sufficient condition for the distributivity of unary operators over conjunctive and disjunctive operators is presented. This also means that setting the distributivity as a requirement results in a unary operator that is identical to the modal operators mentioned above. Using this property, we establish an important connection between modal operators and linguistic hedges. Previously, we demonstrated that the unary operators induced by compositions of two strong negations satisfy the requirements for a dual pair of modal operators. Here, we view the negation operator as a modifier operator. Then, it is shown that (1) the strong negations, (2) the substantiating and weakening modifier operators, modal operators and linguistic hedges mentioned above, and (3) the unary operators, which are distributive over conjunctive and disjunctive operators, may be viewed as special cases of a unified unary operator class.},

Therefore, it is important to accurately anticipate future expenditures in order to optimize energy generation and to avoid unexpected wastes. As a result, we developed Machine Learning models to predict electricity demand. In particular, our study has been performed using data of the Spanish Electricity Network from 2007 to 2019. To this end, we propose the implementation of a set of Machine Learning techniques using various frameworks. In particular, we implemented six different prediction models: Linear Regression, Regression Trees , Gradient Boosting Regression, Random Forests , Multi-layer Perceptron , and three types of recurrent neural networks . Our experimentation shows promising results in all cases, since our models provides better prediction than the one estimated by the Spanish Electricity Network with an improvement of 12\% in the worst case and up to 37\% for the best predictor, which turned out to be the Gated Recurrent Unit neural network.},

Hence, it has the ability of globally determining the fuzzy sets and the fuzzy relations to be represent a large number of time series simultaneously, ii) it can construct FTS models even if time series have very small sample size since panel data are constructed by combining the time and cross-section dimensions. In order to evaluate the performance of proposed approach and compare it with its traditional version, two experiments which compose of a simulation study and a real time examples are conducted.

  abstract     = {We compare two interval time series (ITS) by testing whether their underlying distributions are significantly different or not. To perform hypothesis testing , we make use of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) which decomposes a time series into a set of coefficients over a number of frequency bands or scales. We obtain the DWT of the radius and centre of each of the two ITS at different scales, and perform randomisation tests . In order to use a randomisation test, the observations must be uncorrelated; this condition is more or less satisfied since at each scale, the DWT coefficients are approximately uncorrelated with each other. Our proposed test statistic is the ratio of the determinants of the covariance matrix of radius and centre DWTs of the two ITS, at each scale. This test statistic ensures that the variability between the upper and lower bounds of each ITS is encompassed. Simulation studies conducted to evaluate the performance of the test show reasonably good estimates of size and power under most conditions, and applications to real interval time series reveal the practical usefulness of this test.},

  abstract     = {As one of the research tools for data processing and knowledge discovery, concept lattice can effectively extract information. In daily life, due to the ambiguity and uncertainty of the decision environment, different experts may provide different evaluation information according to individual needs which may be expressed with linguistic values . In order to handle these problems, we study the rule extraction method of linguistic-valued intuitionistic fuzzy layered concept lattice. First, we propose a linguistic-valued intuitionistic fuzzy formal decision context based on the intuitionistic fuzzy lattice implication algebra, which can simultaneously process the obtained comparable and incomparable linguistic information from both positive and negative aspects. Furthermore, by setting different linguistic-valued trust degrees, we put forward the linguistic-valued hierarchical concept construction operator. On this basis, a linguistic-valued intuitionistic fuzzy layered concept lattice can be constructed to meet the requirements of different experts at different levels. And then through the relationship between the conditional concept and decision concept in the obtained concept set, we get a rule set of the formal decision context. Finally, we present a rule extraction method to help people make more reasonable decisions, combining the confidence and support degree of linguistic-valued intuitionistic fuzzy decision rules. And a practical example involving individual financial investment decision-making is used to verify the efficiency and applicability of the proposed approach.},

For this purpose, a three-stage support vector machine algorithm was introduced based on a modified robust loss function. Some common goodness-of-fit criteria and a popular kernel were also employed to examine the performance of the proposed method in cases where the outliers occur in the data set. The effectiveness of the proposed method was illustrated through three numerical cases including a simulation study and two applied examples. The proposed method was also compared with several common fuzzy linear/nonlinear/nonparametric regression models. The numerical results clearly indicated that the proposed model is capable of providing accurate results in the cases involving data sets with or without outliers. Thus, the proposed fuzzy regression model can be successfully applied to improve the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the fuzzy regression models for real-life applications in the intelligence systems .},

  abstract     = {We study the limit behaviour of upper and lower bounds on expected time averages in imprecise Markov chains ; a generalised type of Markov chain where the local dynamics, traditionally characterised by transition probabilities , are now represented by sets of ‘plausible’ transition probabilities. Our first main result is a necessary and sufficient condition under which these upper and lower bounds, called upper and lower expected time averages, will converge as time progresses towards infinity to limit values that do not depend on the process&#39; initial state. Our condition is considerably weaker than that needed for ergodic behaviour; a similar notion which demands that marginal upper and lower expectations of functions at a single time instant converge to so-called limit—or steady state—upper and lower expectations. For this reason, we refer to our notion as ‘weak ergodicity’. Our second main result shows that, as far as this weakly ergodic behaviour is concerned, one should not worry about which type of independence assumption to adopt—epistemic irrelevance, complete independence or repetition independence. The characterisation of weak ergodicity as well as the limit values of upper and lower expected time averages do not depend on such a choice. Notably, this type of robustness is not exhibited by the notion of ergodicity and the related inferences of limit upper and lower expectations. Finally, though limit upper and lower expectations are often used to provide approximate information about the limit behaviour of time averages, we show that such an approximation is sub-optimal and that it can be significantly improved by directly using upper and lower expected time averages.},

  abstract     = {Improving classification performance is one of the main challenges in a variety of real-world applications. Unfortunately, classification models are sensitive to undesirable features of data such as redundant and irrelevant features. Feature selection (FS) is a powerful solution to address the negative effect of these features. Among various methods, Feature selection based on mutual information (MI) is an effective method to select the significant features and deny the undesirable ones. Although most of the existing methods can estimate the feature relevancy efficiently, they may find difficulty to estimate the feature redundancy well. This is due to the individual estimation between the candidate feature and the features of pre-selected subset. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel feature selection method, called Fuzzy Joint Mutual Information (FJMI). The proposed method also overcomes common limitations as dealing with continuous feature without information loss and returns the best feature subset automatically without a user-defined threshold. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, FJMI is compared with six conventional and state-of-the-art feature selection methods. The experimental results on 16 benchmark datasets, with moderate size, show a promising improvement by the proposed method in terms of classification performance, feature selection stability, and number of selected features.},

However, little effort has been paid to conflict analysis on triangular fuzzy information systems (TFISs). In this paper, we study three-way conflict analysis based on TFISs. First, we propose the concept of TFISs and then establish a TFIS for conflict analysis. Further, relative area Δ S is defined to describe concrete attitudes of agents about issues. Second, since the importance of the same issue may vary for agents, we attach fuzzy weights to issues according to triangular fuzzy symmetric judgment matrices (TFSJMs) of agents. Third, we determine the total attitude of each agent to all issues. Then we illustrate how to compute thresholds α and β using the theory of triangular fuzzy decision-theoretic rough sets. Finally, a tri-partition of agents is obtained based on the thresholds.},

  abstract     = {Optimal decision-making in social settings is often based on forecasts from time series (TS) data. Recently, several approaches using deep neural networks (DNNs) such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been introduced for TS forecasting and have shown promising results. However, the applicability of these approaches is being questioned for TS settings where there is a lack of quality training data and where the TS to forecast exhibit complex behaviors. Examples of such settings include financial TS forecasting, where producing accurate and consistent long-term forecasts is notoriously difficult. In this work, we investigate whether DNN-based models can be used to forecast these TS conjointly by learning a joint representation of the series instead of computing the forecast from the raw time-series representations. To this end, we make use of the dynamic factor graph (DFG) to build a multivariate autoregressive model . We investigate a common limitation of RNNs that rely on the DFG framework and propose a novel variable-length attention-based mechanism (ACTM) to address it. With ACTM, it is possible to vary the autoregressive order of a TS model over time and model a larger set of probability distributions than with previous approaches. Using this mechanism, we propose a self-supervised DNN architecture for multivariate TS forecasting that learns and takes advantage of the relationships between them. We test our model on two datasets covering 19 years of investment fund activities. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms typical DNN-based and statistical models at forecasting the 21-day price trajectory. We point out how improving forecasting accuracy and knowing which forecaster to use can improve the excess return of autonomous trading strategies.},

  abstract     = {In the Pawlak model of conflict analysis, a rating of −1, 0, and +1 indicates that an agent is negative, neutral, and positive towards an issue. One defines measures of alliance and conflict of agents based on their three-valued ratings on a set of issues. Existing studies make some restrictive assumptions. One assumption is that a single distance function determines alliance, conflict, and neutrality. Another assumption is that all issues are equally important. The third assumption is that different pairs, such as ( + 1 , + 1 ) (+1,+1) , ( 0 , 0 ) (0,0) , and ( − 1 , − 1 ) (−1,−1) , contribute equally to alliance and conflict. Intuitively, different issues may have different importances and a ( + 1 , + 1 ) (+1,+1) agreement may be stronger than a ( 0 , 0 ) (0,0) agreement. To address these weaknesses, in this paper we use a pair of an alliance measure and a conflict measure, rather than a single distance measure. We propose and study a new class of additive measures of alliance and conflict by assigning different weights to different issues and assigning different values to different pairs of ratings. Existing measures are special cases of the new measures. By using the new measures, we construct a general model of three-way conflict analysis. Finally, we give an application of the new alliance and conflict measures in making the development plan of Gansu Province in China.},

  abstract     = {Analogical proportions are statements of the form ‘ a is to b as c is to d ’, formally denoted a : b : : c : d a:b::c:d . They are the basis of analogical reasoning which is often considered as an essential ingredient of human intelligence. For this reason, recognizing analogies in natural language has long been a research focus within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community. With the emergence of word embedding models, a lot of progress has been made in NLP, essentially assuming that a word analogy like m a n : k i n g : : w o m a n : q u e e n man:king::woman:queen is an instance of a parallelogram within the underlying vector space. In this paper, we depart from this assumption to adopt a machine learning approach, i.e., learning a substitute of the parallelogram model. To achieve our goal, we first review the formal modeling of analogical proportions, highlighting the properties which are useful from a machine learning perspective. For instance, the postulates supposed to govern such proportions entail that when a : b : : c : d a:b::c:d holds, then seven permutations of a , b , c , d a,b,c,d still constitute valid analogies. From a machine learning perspective, this provides guidelines to build training sets of positive and negative examples. Taking into account these properties for augmenting the set of positive and negative examples, we first implement word analogy classifiers using various machine learning techniques , then we approximate by regression an analogy completion function, i.e., a way to compute the missing word when we have the three other ones. Using a GloVe embedding, classifiers show very high accuracy when recognizing analogies, improving state of the art on word analogy classification. Also, the regression processes usually lead to much more successful analogy completion than the ones derived from the parallelogram assumption.},

  abstract     = {Argumentative agents in AI are inspired by how humans reason by exchange of arguments. Given the same set of arguments possibly attacking one another (Dung&#39;s AA framework) these agents are bound to accept the same subset of those arguments (aka extension) unless they reason by different argumentation semantics. However humans may not be so predictable, and in this paper we assume that this is because any real agent&#39;s reasoning is inevitably influenced by her own preferences over the arguments. Though such preferences are usually unobservable, their effects on the agent&#39;s reasoning cannot be washed out. Hence by reconstructing her reasoning process, we might uncover her hidden preferences, which then allow us to predict what else the agent must accept. Concretely we formalize and develop algorithms for such problems as uncovering the hidden argument preference relation of an agent from her expressed opinion, by which we mean a subset of arguments or attacks she accepted from a given AA framework; and uncovering the collective preferences of a group from a dataset of individual opinions. A major challenge we addressed in this endeavor is to deal with “answer sets” of argument preference relations which are generally exponential or even infinite. So we start by developing a compact representation for such answer sets called preference states . Preference revelation tasks are then structured as derivations of preference states from data, and reasoning prediction tasks are reduced to manipulations of derived preference states without enumerating the underlying (possibly infinite) answer sets. We also apply the presented results to two non-trivial problems: learning preferences over rules in structured argumentation with priorities – an open problem so far; and analyzing public polls in apparently deeper ways than existing social argumentation frameworks allow.},

  abstract     = {Distributivity of fuzzy implications over t-norms and t-conorms provides an effective way to solve the combinatorial rule explosion problems caused by addition of inputs in fuzzy inference systems , and hence has received considerable attention in the literature. In this paper, we explore the distributivity of a newly-born class of ordinal sum fuzzy implications with respect to t-norms and t-conorms, where the involving fuzzy implications are constructed by following the structure of ( S , N ) (S,N) -implications generated from ordinal sum t-conorms and fuzzy negations, and are called N -ordinal sum fuzzy implications with the typical feature that the summand domains of linear transformations of given fuzzy implications are rectangles displayed almost along the minor diagonal of [ 0 , 1 ] 2 [0,1]2 . The main results of this paper are characterizations of the t-norm and t-conorm solutions to the four usual distributive equations of N -ordinal sum fuzzy implications, where, of particular interest is that the t-norm and t-conorm solutions have the ordinal sum representations with only one nontrivial summand, and then the necessary and sufficient conditions under which N -ordinal sum fuzzy implications distribute over t-norms and t-conorms in different ways are obtained.},

  abstract     = {Numerous Bayesian Network (BN) structure learning algorithms have been proposed in the literature over the past few decades. Each publication makes an empirical or theoretical case for the algorithm proposed in that publication and results across studies are often inconsistent in their claims about which algorithm is ‘best’. This is partly because there is no agreed evaluation approach to determine their effectiveness. Moreover, each algorithm is based on a set of assumptions, such as complete data and causal sufficiency, and tend to be evaluated with data that conforms to these assumptions, however unrealistic these assumptions may be in the real world. As a result, it is widely accepted that synthetic performance overestimates real performance, although to what degree this may happen remains unknown. This paper investigates the performance of 15 state-of-the-art, well-established, or recent promising structure learning algorithms. We propose a methodology that applies the algorithms to data that incorporates synthetic noise, in an effort to better understand the performance of structure learning algorithms when applied to real data. Each algorithm is tested over multiple case studies, sample sizes, types of noise, and assessed with multiple evaluation criteria. This work involved learning approximately 10,000 graphs with a total structure learning runtime of seven months. In investigating the impact of data noise, we provide the first large scale empirical comparison of BN structure learning algorithms under different assumptions of data noise. The results suggest that traditional synthetic performance may overestimate real-world performance by anywhere between 10\% and more than 50\%. They also show that while score-based learning is generally superior to constraint-based learning, a higher fitting score does not necessarily imply a more accurate causal graph . The comparisons extend to other outcomes of interest, such as runtime, reliability, and resilience to noise, assessed over both small and large networks, and with both limited and big data. To facilitate comparisons with future studies, we have made all data, raw results, graphs and BN models freely available online.},

  abstract     = {Image caption is an important application field of artificial intelligence technique. When a machine can describe a picture reasonably like a human, it represents that the machine has higher intelligence to understand the picture. However, for complex machine learning tasks such as image caption, data annotation is time-consuming and laborious. Usually in a new application scenario, data annotation rarely results in poor model performance. A large number of easily available unlabeled image data make it possible to semi-supervised learning of image caption methods. Based on the existing end-to-end deep learning paradigm, a semi-supervised deep learning method is proposed in this paper, called N-gram + Pseudo Label NIC method. The method combines the current mainstream deep neural network method, e.g. the NIC (Neural Image Caption) model, and the semi-supervised deep learning idea of pseudo labels, and N-gram. This method generates pseudo labels by N-gram Search algorithm, and improves the effect of the model by utilizing the prior knowledge of the N-gram table and people&#39;s descriptive habits. This method has achieved better results than the original NIC model on different sub-data sets of Flickr 8K data set and MSCOCO data set of 0.5k, 1k, 2k and 3k under BLEU-1 evaluation criteria.},

Furthermore, we are devoted to the study of rule extraction of fuzzy linguistic formal decision context by constructing property-oriented linguistic decision concepts. In order to obtain more decision knowledge from known linguistic rules, an extension method of linguistic decision rules is developed, which takes advantage of the dominance relation between similar rules on the premise of consistent property-oriented linguistic decision rules. In addition, we construct a multiple multidimensional linguistic reasoning model for predicting uncertain decision information. Moreover, we input a multiple multidimensional linguistic reasoning model with property-oriented linguistic decision information into neural network to obtain unknown decision results, which can not only improve the accuracy of inference results but also reduce the loss of linguistic information.

  abstract     = {To model discrete-time finite-state uncertain processes, we argue for the use of a global belief model in the form of an upper expectation that is the most conservative one under a set of basic axioms. Our motivation for these axioms, which describe how local and global belief models should be related, is based on two possible interpretations for an upper expectation: a behavioural one similar to Walley&#39;s, and an interpretation in terms of upper envelopes of linear expectations. We show that the most conservative upper expectation satisfying our axioms, that is, our model of choice, coincides with a particular version of the game-theoretic upper expectation introduced by Shafer and Vovk. This has two important implications: it guarantees that there is a unique most conservative global belief model satisfying our axioms; and it shows that Shafer and Vovk&#39;s model can be given an axiomatic characterisation and thereby provides an alternative motivation for adopting this model, even outside their game-theoretic framework. Finally, we relate our model to the upper expectation resulting from a traditional measure-theoretic approach. We show that this measure-theoretic upper expectation also satisfies the proposed axioms, which implies that it is dominated by our model or, equivalently, the game-theoretic model. Moreover, if all local models are precise, all three models coincide.},

The fuzzy sets, being characterized by Gaussian type of membership functions, are used to represent unknown functions associated to the layers of the model. The learning of the deep model would require a quantification of the uncertainties on the signals across the layers of the deep model. We derive analytically the mathematical expressions for membership functions using variational optimization to quantify the uncertainties on variables. The most significant feature of the learning approach is that all of the unobserved variables and parameters, associated to the deep model, are averaged out where the averages are computed taking into account the uncertainties (on variables and parameters). The uncertainties are quantified by means of fuzzy sets with membership functions optimally learned from the observed data. A rigorous mathematical treatment of the learning problem results in the development of a competitive classification algorithm . The study is a theoretical contribution to the field of fuzzy machine learning , nevertheless, offering practical machine learning algorithms .},

In this note, we give a positive answer to this problem and provide a union-join condition. Furthermore, note that the main reason that the expected identity hold not consists in the fact that the union of two topologies is not a topology, in general. Then replacing the union of two topologies with the supremum of them, we give a sufficient and necessary condition (supremum-join condition) such that the supremum of generated topologies by two binary relations, is identical with the generated topology by the join of two binary relations. We verify that the supremum-join condition is much simpler than the union-join condition.

For binary classification , it divides samples into positive, negative and boundary regions (POS, NEG, and BND).

Many existing boundary processing methods are oriented only toward the data and not to the problem. How to obtain effective decision rules from the problem itself to guide boundary division is a challenge. In this article, we propose an adaptive hierarchical feature representation model based on three-way decision theory (named A H 3 AH3 ) with a problem oriented for boundary processing. We firstly divide all samples into two certain regions (POS and NEG) and an uncertain region (BND) using a three-way decision model based on a minimum covering algorithm. Secondly, we obtain the hierarchical feature representation of POS and NEG regions on the basis of fuzzy quotient space theory , and select the optimal layer with a problem-oriented validating BND region of the training set. Finally, we adaptively decompose the optimal layer between the upper layer and the lower layer to find the adaptive granular space for boundary processing. The experimental results obtained with five University of California, Irivine datasets show that our algorithm effectively increases binary classification accuracy.},

However, little attention has been paid to the construction of dominance-based DqRS (DDqRS) models, optimal scale selection and optimal scale reduction in multi-scale dominance intuitionistic fuzzy decision tables (MS-DIFDTs). In reality, this task is very important because it can provide a way to select an appropriate simplified scale for some given objective in MS-DIFDTs. To address this issue, this study mainly focuses on constructing two DDqRS models and selecting the simplest optimal scale of the given MS-DIFDTs. First, a novel ranking approach for ranking IF values is presented and used to construct a dominance relation in IF-valued decision tables. Second, by considering the combination of probabilistic and graded rough set, we propose two types of DDqRSs in MS-DIFDTs. Third, on the basis of the presented DDqRSs, we discuss optimal scale selection and scale reduction approaches to acquire classification or decision rules in MS-DIFDTs. Using the presented approaches, an optimal scale reduct can be acquired in MS-DIFDTs. The results obtained in this study are helpful for users to select a simplest optimal scale for meeting the knowledge representation requirement.},

The lack of joint information on the variables of interest leads to uncertainty about the data generating model. In this paper we propose the use of graphical models to deal with the statistical matching uncertainty for multivariate categorical variables . The use of Bayesian networks in the statistical matching context allows both to introduce extra sample information on the dependence structure between the variables of interest and to use such an information to factorize the joint probability distribution according to the graph decomposition of a multivariate dependence in lower dimension components. This representation of the joint probability distribution, taking advantage of local relationships, allows to simplify both parameters estimation and statistical matching quality evaluation in a multivariate context. A simulation experiment is performed in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology with and without auxiliary information, as well as to compare it with the saturated multinomial model, in terms of uncertainty reduction. Finally, an application to a real case is provided. Results show a considerable improvement in the quality of statistical matching when the dependence structure is taken into account.},

  abstract     = {Reasoning about uncertainty is one of the main cornerstones of Knowledge Representation. Formal representations of uncertainty are numerous and highly varied due to different types of uncertainty intended to be modeled such as vagueness, imprecision and incompleteness. There is a rich body of theoretical results that has been generated for many of these approaches. It is often the case though, that pragmatic tools for reasoning with uncertainty lag behind this rich body of theoretical results. Rough set theory is one such approach for modeling incompleteness and imprecision based on indiscernibility and its generalizations. In this paper, we provide a pragmatic tool for constructively reasoning with generalized rough set approximations that is based on the use of Answer Set Programming ( Asp ). We provide an interpretation of answer sets as (generalized) approximations of crisp sets (when possible) and show how to use Asp solvers as a tool for reasoning about (generalized) rough set approximations situated in realistic knowledge bases. The paper includes generic Asp templates for doing this and also provides a case study showing how these techniques can be used to generate reducts for incomplete information systems. Complete, ready to run clingo Asp code is provided in the Appendix, for all programs considered. These can be executed for validation purposes in the clingo Asp solver.},

In addition, the fuzzy concept shows great strictness when applying to crisp sets . To overcome these problems, we propose several new kinds of variable-precision concepts within L -contexts in this paper. First, we present two kinds of variable-precision two-way (VP2W) concepts: α -positive concept and β -negative concept. The family of each kind of VP2W concept forms a complete lattice . Next, considering both the positive and negative parts, we investigate two kinds of variable-precision three-way (VP3W) concepts: (α,β) -object-induced three-way concept and (α,β) -attribute-induced three-way concept. The family of each kind of VP3W concept forms a complete lattice. Then, we study the relationships between VP2W concepts and VP3W concepts. The results show that VP3W concept lattices can be directly generated by VP2W concept lattices. Finally, the experiments are preformed to verify the effectiveness of our model.},

Because of the lack of efficient algorithms, they are not to accommodate the bigger and bigger set-valued information table. Therefore, it is a real challenge on how to efficiently calculate a high-quality approximation set in set-valued information systems. To address the challenge, we propose reliable approximation operators based on semi-monolayer covering for set-valued information systems. Benefiting from considerable research about tolerance rough set models and covering rough set models, the proposed approximation operators used a piecewise design to effectively reduce the negative effects of the set-valued records and provided high-quality approximation sets for set-valued information systems. Furthermore, the reliable semi-monolayer covering approximation sets are more easily granulated and efficiently calculated than before. Based on the equivalent granule-based forms, the corresponding granular algorithms are designed for the improved approximation sets. The experiments on some UCI data sets show the improved approximation sets are high quality and efficient computational in set-valued information systems.},

Recently, as a weaker version of k -limited bisimilarity, the notion of k -limited similarity was proposed and applied to graph pattern matching . (Bi)simulations have been widely used in comparing the behavior of fuzzy transition systems. In order to study the (bi)simulation semantics of labeled fuzzy transition systems in the residuated lattice-valued logic setting, we introduce an extension of labeled approximation spaces, called the quantitative fuzzy approximation spaces (QFASs), whose labels are equipped with a residuated lattice-valued equality relation. In a QFAS, we define a new notion of limited approximate similarity, to quantify to what extent one state is simulated by another in the neighboring subgraphs, and provide its properties. Based on the new notion, we give a definition of limited approximate simulation and discuss its properties. Then we introduce an ordered pair of relations, one on the state (vertex) set (limited approximate simulation) and one on the edge (transition) set induced by the relation on state set, called VE limited approximate simulation in this paper. We also present a new notion of limited approximate bisimilarity in a QFAS, to quantify to what extent two states are similar in the neighboring subgraphs, and give its properties. One main contribution of the paper is to give a condition for two states to be limited approximate bisimilar and investigate the degree of similarity between two states in a QFAS. Finally, we discuss the relationships between the rough approximations based on the underlying crisp relation induced by underlying labeled fuzzy relation and the rough approximations based on limited approximate bisimilarity.},

A three-way cluster is based on a pair of sets known as the core and support of a cluster. Given the results of a hard clustering algorithm in the form of hard clusters, RE3WC uses reduction and elevation operations to shrink and enlarge a hard cluster into the core and support of a three-way cluster. The two sets are then used to obtain the three regions of a three-way cluster namely, inside, outside and partial regions. Experimental results on CHAMELEON and other similar datasets indicate that the RE3WC can detect an additional 2.5\% to 4.6\% of objects as outliers that went undetected with clustering algorithms that detect outliers . The RE3WC results in more compact and precise clusters when applied on top of clustering algorithms that only provide partitioning of the data. Finally, RE3WC produces comparable results to some of the notable approaches such as LOF , LoOP , ABOD and IF.},

To address this issue, herein, we propose two clustering approaches based on the Ward method using interval-valued dissimilarity for the interval-valued data. Each clustering method has different interval-valued dissimilarities. An interval-valued dissimilarity is generally not used to elucidate the computational result of a hierarchical clustering method by a traditional dendrogram; this is because the nodes of a dendrogram only designate real numbers and not an interval of numbers. We also present a new dendrogram with an arrow symbol, which is named arrow-dendrogram , to demonstrate the results of the clustering methods proposed in this study. In addition, we present the differences between the two clustering methods using numerical examples and numerical experimentation. The results of this study prove that the proposed clustering methods can intuitively provide reasonable and consistent results for our example data, thereby enabling us to completely comprehend the results of the clustering methods using interval-valued dissimilarity, via the arrow-dendrogram.},

In this study, we consider the manipulation of weight information strategically in a TOPSIS MADM method under two scenarios: (1) completely unknown weight information i.e. the decision maker does not provide any weight information; (2) incomplete weight information i.e. the decision maker provides only partial preference information over the attributes. This weight manipulation problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem which is highly constrained. Therefore, for solving the MINLP model, a genetic algorithm based solution procedure is developed. A practical example is presented to illustrate the strategic manipulation procedure.},

  abstract     = {Successful decision-making analysis needs to take both advantages of human analysts and computers, and human knowledge is usually expressed in a qualitative way. Computer based approaches are good at handling quantitative data, while it is still challenging on how to well structure qualitative knowledge and incorporate them as part of decision analytics. This paper develops a logical reasoning based decision-making framework for handling qualitative human knowledge. In this framework, an algebraic structure is adopted for modelling qualitative human knowledge in a systematic way, and a logic based approximate reasoning method is then proposed for inferring the final decision based on the structured qualitative knowledge. By taking a non-classical logic as its formal foundation, the proposed logical reasoning based decision making method is able to model and infer with qualitative human knowledge directly without numerical approximation in a strict way.},

In this paper, we propose the notion of nondeterministic finite automaton based on quantum logic whose underlying structure is a complete orthomodular lattice l , called nondeterministic l -valued finite automaton (N l -FA, for short). We show that nondeterministic l -valued finite automata, deterministic l -valued finite automata, and nondeterministic l -valued finite automata with ε -moves are equivalent if and only if l satisfies the distributive law. Next, two l -valued relations in terms of language equivalence are given. Some properties of the two l -valued relations under various operations such as reversal, union, product, and concatenation, are investigated. Finally, we give the degree of the closeness between two N l -FAs with the same set of states to reflect the robustness, and obtain some interesting results. The theory developed in this paper enriches the automata theory based on quantum logic.},

  abstract     = {One natural way to express preferences over items is to represent them in the form of pairwise comparisons , from which a model is learned in order to predict further preferences. In this setting, if an item a is preferred to the item b , then it is natural to consider that the preference still holds after multiplying both vectors by a positive scalar (e.g., 2 a ≻ 2 b 2a≻2b ). Such invariance to scaling is satisfied in maximum margin learning approaches for pairs of test vectors, but not for the preference input pairs, i.e., scaling the inputs in a different way could result in a different preference relation being learned. In addition to the scaling of preference inputs, maximum margin methods are also sensitive to the way used for normalizing (scaling) the features, which is an essential pre-processing phase for these methods. In this paper, we define and analyse more cautious preference relations that are invariant to the scaling of features, or preference inputs, or both simultaneously; this leads to computational methods for testing dominance with respect to the induced relations, and for generating optimal solutions (i.e., best items) among a set of alternatives. In our experiments, we compare the relations and their associated optimality sets based on their decisiveness, computation time and cardinality of the optimal set.},

  abstract     = {Multi-label learning deals with cases where every instance corresponds to multiple labels. The objective is to learn mapping from an instance to a relevant label set. Existing multi-label learning approaches assume that the significance for all related labels is same for every instance. Several problems of label ambiguity can be dealt with using multi-label learning, but some practical applications with significance among related labels for every instance cannot be effectively processed. To achieve superior results by conducting different significance of labels, label distribution learning is used for such applications. First, the probability model and rough set are embedded in the labeling significance, thus more supervised information can be obtained from original multi-label data. Subsequently, to resolve the feature selection problem of label distribution data, according to the feature dependency and the rough set, a novel feature selection algorithm for multi-label classification is designed. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, an extensive experiment is conducted on 15 real-world multiple label data sets. The performance of the proposed algorithm through the multi-label classifier is compared with seven state-of-the-art approaches, thereby indicating the applicability and effectiveness of label distribution feature selection.},

One benefit of this approach is that the estimator can be obtained from that of the corresponding (joint) distribution function via plug-in method. Additional proof is not required. Our approach is to naturally embed the space of subcopulas into the space of distribution functions. This allows us to consider two common modes of convergence, namely, the uniform convergence and the weak convergence on the space of (sub)copulas. Since these modes of convergence are well-studied, we will be able to combine our results with existing results in the same way that is done for distribution functions. Instead of proving these results directly, however, we will apply two common distances characterizing these modes of convergence, namely, the Chebyshev distance and the Levy distance. By using distances, the rate of convergence is also known. Topological properties of the space of subcopulas based on these two distances are also compared and contrasted with that of previously defined distances.},
