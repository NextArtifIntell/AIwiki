  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with conforming finite element discretizations for quasilinear elliptic problems in divergence form, of a class that generalizes the p -Laplace equation and allows to show existence and uniqueness of the continuous and discrete problems. We derive discretization error estimates under general regularity assumptions for the solution and using high order polynomial spaces, resulting in convergence rates that are then verified numerically. A key idea of this error analysis is to consider carefully the relation between the natural W 1 , p W1,p -seminorm and a specific quasinorm introduced in the literature. In particular, we are able to derive interpolation estimates in this quasinorm from known interpolation estimates in the W 1 , p W1,p -seminorm. We also give a simplified proof of known near-best approximation results in W 1 , p W1,p -seminorm starting from the corresponding result in the mentioned quasinorm.},

  abstract     = {A computational model is developed to analyze the geometrically nonlinear response of porous functionally graded shells when subjected to various mechanical loadings and boundary conditions. This mathematical modeling is based on High-Order-Shear Deformation Theory (HSDT) using double directors vectors. The material properties are supposed to vary continuously along the thickness referring to power law distribution including even and uneven porosity distributions. The nonlinear shell model is developed using a weak form formulation. Then, a finite element model based on an isoparametric concept is employed. A convergence analysis is carried out to determine the minimum required number of elements in the numerical simulations. The potential of the presented nonlinear shell modeling is highlighted through comparisons between linear and nonlinear formulations with their counterparts in the literature. Very good agreements are obtained between the numerical simulations of the developed model with previous results of various kinds of plates subjected to different loadings and porosity distributions. The nonlinear shell modeling, material gradation , and porosity effects are also examined for complex structures including bioinspired ring and cylindrical panel. It is shown that the porosity and material gradation have significant effects on the ring&#39;s displacement and shear stress. As for the cylindrical roof-like panel, it is demonstrated that the linear formulation gives erroneous results for the displacement without detecting the snap-through phenomenon due to the large deformation of the structure. The results show the significant effect of the porosity distribution type of the response of complex dynamical systems .},

  abstract     = {In this paper a computational methodology leading to the development of a new class of FEs, based on the application of continuous and smooth approximation polynomials, being splines, has been presented. Application of the splines as appropriately defined piecewise elemental shape functions led the authors to the formulation of a new approach for FEM, named as spFEM, where contrary to the well-known NURBS approach, the boundaries of spFEs are well-defined, exactly as it is in the case of the traditional FEM. The current approach has been computationally verified by the authors it terms of high frequency dynamics including such problems as: spectra of natural frequencies, modes of natural vibrations as well as wave propagation problems, especially in the aspect of high frequency responses, all in the case of selected problems involving one- and two-mode theories of 1-D structural elements. The applicability of the proposed approach has been evaluated and compared, in terms of calculated dynamic responses, with the results obtained by the use of well-established FEM approaches: classical FEM as well as TD-SFEM. In all cases investigated by the authors the proposed spFEM approach turned out to be the most accurate approach, free from the main drawback of the other tested FEM approaches thanks to the class of differentiability of approximation polynomials, which guarantees the absence of frequency band gaps in calculated spectra of natural frequencies. A direct consequence of this feature of the proposed approach is that a larger part of the calculated spectra of natural frequency, the same as modes of natural vibrations, can effectively be used for more accurate calculations of dynamic reposes even in the case of multi-mode theories. This in contrast to the other tested FEM approaches.},

  abstract     = {We propose a nonlinear reduced basis method for the efficient approximation of parametrized partial differential equations (PDEs), exploiting kernel proper orthogonal decomposition (KPOD) for the generation of a reduced order space and neural networks for the evaluation of the reduced order approximation. In particular, we use KPOD in place of the more classical POD, on a set of high-fidelity solutions of the problem at hand to extract a reduced basis. This method provides a more accurate approximation of the snapshots&#39; set featuring a lower dimension, while maintaining the same efficiency as POD. A neural network (NN) is then used to find the coefficients of the reduced basis by following a supervised learning paradigm and shown to be effective in learning the map between the time/parameter values and the projection of the high-fidelity snapshots onto the reduced space. In this NN, both the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons vary according to the intrinsic dimension of the differential problem at hand and the size of the reduced space. This adaptively built NN attains good performances in both the learning and the testing phases. Our approach is then tested on two benchmark problems, a one-dimensional wave equation and a two-dimensional nonlinear lid-driven cavity problem. We finally compare the proposed KPOD-NN technique with a POD-NN strategy, showing that KPOD allows a reduction of the number of modes that must be retained to reach a given accuracy in the reduced basis approximation. For this reason, the NN built to find the coefficients of the KPOD expansion is smaller, easier and less computationally demanding to train than the one used in the POD-NN strategy.},

We establish (i) the existence and local uniqueness of the discrete solutions using fixed point argument, (ii) a best approximation result in energy norm, (iii) error estimates in the energy and L 2 L2 norms with ℓ -discretization parameter dependency for the conforming finite element method .

  abstract     = {Stability condition is a more restrictive constraint that leads to unnecessary small-time steps with respect to the accuracy and results in computational time wastage. We propose a node by node adaptive time scheme to relax the stability constraint enabling a larger global time step for all the nodes. A nonlinear procedure for optimising both the schemes in time and space is proposed in view of increasing the numerical efficiency and reducing the computational time. The method is based on a four-parameter family of schemes we shall tune in function of the physical data (velocity, diffusion), the characteristic size in time and space, and the local regularity of the function leading to a nonlinear procedure. The a posteriori strategy we adopt consists in, given the solution at time t n tn , computing a candidate solution with the highest accurate schemes in time and space for all the nodes. Then, for the nodes that present some instabilities, both the schemes in time and space are modified and adapted in order to preserve the stability with a large time step. The updated solution is computed with node-dependent schemes both in time and space. For the sake of simplicity, only convection-diffusion problems are addressed as a prototype with a two-parameters five-points finite difference method for the spatial discretisation together with an explicit time two-parameters four-stages Runge–Kutta method. We prove that we manage to obtain an optimal time-step algorithm that produces accurate numerical approximations exempt of non-physical oscillations.},

The properties of such surfaces (e.g. the unit square is their domain) are used for automatically concentrating the interpolation nodes around the regions with singular stress/strain fields. This, in turn, limits the global number of nodes in favor of their accumulation in specific places. The proposed approach of node concentration requires only a few parameters to be defined. In order to take into account the complex nature of the plastic strain fields, a special method of their interpolation is selected. The Kriging approach effectively involves an interactive investigation of the spatial behavior of the strains to choose the best estimate. It is also the method that bases on irregularly spaced interpolation nodes. Some examples are solved, and obtained results are compared with the finite element method (FEM).},

  abstract     = {In the current work, we present a variational mechanics framework for the coupled numerical prediction of cavitating turbulent flow and structural motion via a stabilized finite element formulation. To model the finite mass transfer rate in cavitation phenomena, we employ the homogenous mixture-based approach via phenomenological scalar transport differential equations given by the linear and nonlinear mass transfer functions. Stable linearizations of the finite mass transfer terms for the mass continuity equation and the reaction term of the scalar transport equations are derived for the robust and accurate implementation. The linearized matrices for the cavitation equation are imparted a positivity-preserving property to address numerical oscillations arising from high-density gradients typical of two-phase cavitating flows. The proposed formulation is strongly coupled in a partitioned manner with an incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes finite element solver, and the unsteady problem is advanced in time using a fully-implicit generalized- α time integration scheme. We first verify the implementation on the benchmark case of the Rayleigh bubble collapse. We demonstrate the accuracy and convergence of the cavitation solver by comparing the numerical solutions with the analytical solutions of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation for bubble dynamics. We find our solver to be robust for large time steps and the absence of spurious oscillations/spikes in the pressure field. The cavitating flow solver is coupled with a hybrid URANS-LES turbulence model. We validate the coupled solver for a very high Reynolds number turbulent cavitating flow over a NACA0012 hydrofoil section. Finally, the proposed method is applied in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian framework to study turbulent cavitating flow over a pitching hydrofoil section and the characteristic features of cavitating flows such as re-entrant jet and periodic cavity shedding are discussed.},

We show that the convergence rate is limited by the regularity of an extraneous Lagrange multiplier variable which naturally appears via a saddle-point analysis. In turn, limited convergence rates appear because the regularity of this Lagrange multiplier is determined, in part, by the geometry of the domain. Numerical experiments support our conclusions.},

The trial space for discretization is provided via standard kernels that reproduce the Sobolev spaces as their native spaces. The error analysis of the method is given, but it is partly subjected to an inverse inequality on the boundary which is still an open problem. The condition number of the final linear system is approximated in terms of the smoothness of the kernel and the discretization quality.

Such approximations are based on a Reduced Order Model, which in this work is constructed using the method of weighted Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. This Reduced Order Model then is used to efficiently compute the reduced basis approximation for any outcome of the random parameter. We demonstrate that such OCPs are well-posed by applying the adjoint approach, which also works in the presence of admissibility constraints and in the case of non linear-quadratic OCPs, and thus is more general than the conventional Lagrangian approach. We also show that a step in the construction of these Reduced Order Models, known as the aggregation step, is not fundamental and can in principle be skipped for noncoercive problems, leading to a cheaper online phase. Numerical applications in three scenarios from environmental science are considered, in which the governing PDE is steady and the control is distributed. Various parameter distributions are taken, and several implementations of the weighted Proper Orthogonal Decomposition are compared by choosing different quadrature rules.},

Hence, hardware memory limitations in fully resolved simulations constrain the maximum domain size for this flow class.

In the present paper, a domain transferring scheme is implemented in LBM , enabling simulations of particle motion in a virtually infinite domain, and it is combined with a high-quality Lagrangian mesh algorithm to be solved with the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM). A thorough mesh generation procedure for ellipsoidal particles is disclosed, as well as an extension of the internal mass compensation strategy of Suzuki and Inamuro (2011). Comparison with analytical results shows that the numerical model appropriately describes the particle rotation and can predict a terminal velocity close to Stokes solution. The numerical results of a buoyant sphere moving diagonally presented remarkable concordance with experimental data. Also, an excellent agreement with a numerical study of oblate spheroids settling in a vast domain was found. The domain transferring scheme reduced the memory demand in one order of magnitude.},

The method uses a two-step proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique to extract the reduced basis from a collection of high-fidelity solutions called snapshots. A third POD level is then applied on the data of the projection coefficients associated with the reduced basis to separate the time-dependent modes from the stochastic parametrized coefficients. These are approximated in the stochastic parameter space using B-splines basis functions defined in the corresponding Bézier element. The accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed method are assessed using benchmark steady-state and time-dependent problems and compared to the reduced-order model-based artificial neural network (POD-ANN) and to the full-order model-based polynomial chaos expansion (Full-PCE). The POD-BSBEM is then applied to analyze the uncertainty propagation through a flood wave flow stemming from a hypothetical dam-break in a river with a complex bathymetry.

The continuous impact of hot fluids causes significant damage to its surface, which is made of refractory concrete. In particular, the initial impact on the dry runner is expected to be critical. This work deals with the analysis of the mechanical impact on the runner through the numerical simulation of the process. We propose an incompressible turbulent isothermal Navier-Stokes model, where turbulence is modelled considering two k − ω k−ω models (standard and SST). The interface dynamics is described by applying the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method, while the surface tension vector is provided by the Continuum Surface model (CSF). Their numerical results are performed in 2D. A comparative analysis of the most suitable transient turbulent multiphase model is presented by simulating benchmark physical experiments. The shear stress arising from the impact of the jet on the runner is also analyzed. An improvement of the classical analytical expression given in [1] is proposed. Both, the chosen turbulence model, and the formulas to compute the shear stress are validated using two benchmark laboratory tests and three numerical experiments. Numerical results are given for the impact of the jet on the dry runner of the blast furnace.},

In the temporal direction, the Crank-Nicolson (CN) method and product-integration (PI) rule are employed, from which the non-uniform meshes are used to eliminate the singular behaviour of the exact solution at t = 0 t=0 . Then, a fully discrete scheme is obtained by the spatial discretization based on the finite difference method. Simultaneously, an alternating direction implicit (ADI) algorithm is designed to reduce the computational cost. The stability in L 2 L2 norm and convergence are derived via the energy method, in which the convergence orders are O ( k 2 + h 2 ) O(k2+h2) with certain suitable assumptions, where k and h are corresponding space-time step sizes, respectively. Numerical results confirm the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Application of a Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) method for simulation of compressible viscous flows in three dimensions is presented. The approach enables construction of stable schemes for problems with a small perturbation parameter . The main idea of the method is a weak formulation with a relaxed interelement continuity of the solution. The formulation satisfies the inf-sup condition with the stability constant independent of the small perturbation parameter, which here is the viscosity constant for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The DPG discrete formulation uses the specially designed so-called optimal test functions. They do not compromise the inf-sup stability of the continuous formulation. DPG does not use any artificial dissipation for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Being a residual minimization method it has got a built-in a posteriori error estimation which allows for mesh adaptivity leading to resolving reliable viscous fluxes, the major difficult task in simulations of viscous flows. We illustrate the method with a few steady state laminar solutions.},

Our interest in this subject is motivated by the respective need that arises from the solvability studies of nonlinear coupled problems in continuum mechanics that involve these equations. We consider pseudostress-based approaches in both cases and apply a suitable integration by parts formula for ad-hoc Sobolev spaces to derive the corresponding continuous schemes. We utilize known and new preliminary results, along with the Babuška-Brezzi theory in Banach spaces, to establish the well-posedness of the formulations for a particular range of the indexes of the Lebesgue spaces involved. Among the aforementioned new results from us, we highlight the construction of a particular operator mapping a tensor Lebesgue space into itself, and the generalization of a classical estimate in L 2 L2 for deviatoric tensors, which plays a key role in the Hilbertian analysis of linear elasticity, to arbitrary Lebesgue spaces.

By conducting dissipation analysis of Godunov-type schemes and a sequence of numerical experiments, we are able to clarify that the instability may be attributed to insufficient entropy production inside the numerical shock structure. As a result, a general entropy-control technique for improving the robustness of various Godunov-type schemes at strong shocks is developed. It plays a part in guaranteeing that enough entropy is produced inside the numerical shock structure. Furthermore, such a modified approach does not introduce any additional numerical dissipation on linear degenerate waves to suppress the shock instability.

  abstract     = {We propose, analyze mathematically, and study numerically a novel approach for the finite element approximation of the spectrum of second-order elliptic operators . The main idea is to reduce the stiffness of the problem by subtracting a least-squares penalty on the gradient jumps across the mesh interfaces from the standard stiffness bilinear form . This penalty bilinear form is similar to the known technique used to stabilize finite element approximations in various contexts. The penalty term is designed to dampen the high frequencies in the spectrum and so it is weighted here by a negative coefficient . The resulting approximation technique is called softFEM since it reduces the stiffness of the problem. The two key advantages of softFEM over the standard Galerkin FEM are to improve the approximation of the eigenvalues in the upper part of the discrete spectrum and to reduce the condition number of the stiffness matrix . We derive a sharp upper bound on the softness parameter weighting the stabilization bilinear form so as to maintain coercivity for the softFEM bilinear form. Then we prove that softFEM delivers the same optimal convergence rates as the standard Galerkin FEM approximation for the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors . We next compare the discrete eigenvalues obtained when using Galerkin FEM and softFEM. Finally, a detailed analysis of linear softFEM for the 1D Laplace eigenvalue problem delivers a sensible choice for the softness parameter. With this choice, the stiffness reduction ratio scales linearly with the polynomial degree . Various numerical experiments illustrate the benefits of using softFEM over Galerkin FEM.},

The thermophysical properties of Al 2 O 3 –H 2 O nanoliquid are deliberated in the study by modeling them through the use of correlations based on experimental data. The thermal boundary layer equation comprises the Brownian motion and thermo-migration effects caused by nanoparticles. Zero mass flux boundary condition is also accounted. Optimization of the heat transfer rate of nanoliquid is made using the Response surface methodology (RSM). Two stream functions are used to derive the similarity transformations and they are employed to arrive nonlinear ordinary differential system from the governing partial differential system, and then the subsequent nonlinear problem is treated numerically using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The heat flow features are scrutinized using two-dimensional, surface, and streamline plots. The results of flow due to a moving wedge in the same direction of free stream velocity are compared with those of a moving wedge in the opposite direction of free stream velocity. The thermal layer and nanoparticles volume fraction layers are enlarged due to the chaotic movement of nanoparticles. The thermophoresis mechanism improves the thermal layer at the wedge surface. The high level of pressure gradient factor, high level of shear-to-strain rate and low level of Lewis number, were found to be the optimal operating condition that would maximize the heat transfer rate.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates on the buckling treatment of a three layered rectangular nanocomposite microplate resting on elastic foundation. The core is a laminated nanocomposite layer reinforced with graphene platelets bonded with two piezoelectric facesheets. The microplate is subjected to thermo-electro-mechanical loads. The governing equations are developed in the framework of the first order shear deformation theory alongside with the modified couple stress theory. The effective laminated nanocomposite core layer thermo-mechanical properties are determined by the Halpin-Tsai micromechanical model . The Ritz method is employed to discretize the governing equations of motion in order to achieve the buckling loads for different boundary condition types. The outcomes are developed for both thermo-electrical and electro-mechanical buckling examinations. For the latter case, the microplate is studied when it is subjected to uniaxial, biaxial, and shear mechanical loads. The effects of boundary condition types, the external applied voltage , the graphene platelet distribution pattern, the elastic foundation parameters and the graphene platelet weight fraction as well as its geometrical features on the buckling loads are studied. The results reveal that the types of boundary condition, the graphene platelet dispersion pattern, the graphene platelet weight fraction, and the applied voltage affect noticeably the thermal/mechanical buckling load. Moreover, when the elastic foundation effect is considered the increment percent in the thermal and shear mechanical buckling loads is not affected by the graphene platelets dispersion pattern while for some certain boundary condition types, the graphene platelets distribution pattern affects the increment percent of the critical uniaxial and biaxial mechanical loads.},

We propose the use of two operator splitting schemes for nonlinear cross-diffusion processes in order to lower the computational load, and establish their stability properties using discrete L 2 L2 energy methods. Furthermore, by attaining a stable factorization of the system matrix as a forward-backward pass, corresponding to the Thomas algorithm for self-diffusion processes, we show that the use of implicit cross-diffusion can be competitive in terms of execution time, widening the range of viable cross-diffusion coefficients for on-the-fly applications.},

Standard stability results on mixed methods do not apply due to the singular coefficients in the differential operator and due to the singular or vanishing weights in the associated function spaces. We develop new finite element analysis in these weighted spaces, and propose macroelement conditions that are sufficient to ensure the well-posedness of the mixed methods for the ASP. These conditions are local, relatively easy to verify, and therefore will be useful for validating the stability of a variety of mixed finite element methods . These new conditions can not only re-verify existing stable mixed methods for the ASP, but also lead to the discovery of new stable conservative mixed methods.

Fluid flow problem is solved with time-discontinuous deforming domain stabilized space-time finite element method. Flow is computed with pressure primitive variables which permit to use the same numerical technique for both compressible and incompressible regimes. Elastic deformation of the structure is modelled in the Lagrangian frame of reference with Saint-Venant Kirchhoff and Neo-Hookean material models - both are non-linear and valid for large deformations. Structure equations are discretized with Galerkin finite element method for space and with generalized-alpha method for the time. Mesh motion is modelled with the elastic deformation method. An implicit algorithm is presented to couple the different solvers. The details are provided on the implementation of the solvers in parallel software. The numerical code is verified and validated on several compressible and incompressible flow benchmarks widely used in the literature. The results demonstrate that the developed solver successfully detects the accurate interaction between fluid and structure.},

The objective of this study consists of validating the scheme accuracy with well documented laminar incompressible flow test cases. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed interpolation method to successfully solve closed and open flows with either straight or curved walls.

In this paper we present a novel framework for FWI in the visco-acoustic regime. The new framework is based on a new elegant derivation of the system of state and adjoint PDEs which are approximated by the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. The inverse problem is then solved by the well established regularization scheme CG-REGINN which has not yet been applied in the context of FWI. For the DG discretization we provide a preconditioner for the efficient computation of the time steps by GMRES which yields optimal convergence estimates in space and time and which is confirmed by numerical tests. The inverse solver expresses the required Fréchet derivative and its adjoint in the DG setting. Successful reconstructions in a simplified cross-well setting serve as a proof of concept for our framework and demonstrate the applicability of our new combination of DG method and inverse solver. Some of the inversion experiments use seismograms generated by an independent finite difference time domain forward solver to avoid inverse crime.},

Using a set of modified singular functions around the voids, along with the library-rational-exponential basis functions (EBFs) satisfying the governing differential equation, an enriched spatial solution is locally constructed on a generic computational cloud/cell (GCC) of nodes containing the voids. Within each GCC, the boundary conditions are satisfied through a weighted least-squares approximation.

  abstract     = {Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) is a computational technique for the numerical approximation of partial differential equations (PDEs). This technique is based on the use of spline-type basis functions, that are able to hold a global smoothness and allow to exactly capture a wide set of common geometries. The current rise of this approach has encouraged the search of fast solvers for isogeometric discretizations and nowadays this topic is receiving a lot of attention. In this framework, a desired property of the solvers is the robustness with respect to both the polynomial degree p and the mesh size h . For this task, in this paper we propose a two-level method such that a discretization of order p is considered in the first level whereas the second level consists of a linear or quadratic discretization. On the first level, we suggest to apply one single iteration of a multiplicative Schwarz method. The choice of the block-size of such an iteration depends on the spline degree p , and is supported by a local Fourier analysis (LFA). At the second level one is free to apply any given strategy to solve the problem exactly. However, it is also possible to get an approximation of the solution at this level by using an h -multigrid method. The resulting solver is efficient and robust with respect to the spline degree p . Finally, some numerical experiments are given in order to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed solver.},

  abstract     = {In simulation of heat conduction with temperature-independent physical properties and boundary conditions (BCs), Galerkin residual analysis and variational analysis yield equivalent finite element method (FEM), the conventional FEM. However, if the properties and BCs are temperature-dependent, it is discovered that their derivatives further induce nonlinearity of FEM which consequently generates divergence between the two analyses. A general FEM, extension of variational analysis, is derived as general form of conventional FEM modeling nonlinear heat conduction. Numerical examples demonstrate that the general FEM produces results with considerably higher accuracy and stability and also possesses higher performances on conforming with both two analyses. Since general FEM degenerates to conventional FEM if derivatives are of small-amplitude or zero and its direct implementation to the entire domain is costive, general FEM is alternatively utilized as local refinement of governing equation only to points with significant derivatives. The strategy of local refinement is optimized to enhance efficiency.},

First-, second-, and third-order backward difference schemes are evaluated. The problem is solved in a decoupled manner using a nested iterative algorithm for the Navier–Stokes and energy equations to eliminate decoupling errors. For the space discretization, a stabilized finite element formulation of the variational multiscale type is applied to enable the use of equal order interpolation between the problem unknowns and ensure stable solutions for convection-dominated cases. The integration schemes are compared by solving the flow over a confined square including mixed heat convection in two and three dimensions. Improved numerical approximation of dynamic solutions using high-order schemes is demonstrated in the Richardson number range of 0 ≤ | R i | ≤ 10 0≤|Ri|≤10 up to a Reynolds number of R e = 225 Re=225 .},

  abstract     = {In the framework of the development of new passive safety systems for the second and third generations of nuclear reactors, the numerical simulations, involving complex turbulent two-phase flows around thin or massive inflow obstacles, are privileged tools to model, optimize and assess new design shapes. In order to match industrial demands, computational fluid dynamics tools must be the fastest, most accurate and most robust possible. To face this issue, we have chosen to solve the Navier-Stokes equations using a projection scheme for a mixture fluid coupled with an Immersed Boundary (IB) approach: the penalized direct forcing method – a technique whose characteristics inherit from both penalty and immersed boundary methods – adapted to infinitely thin obstacles and to a Finite Element (FE) formulation. Various IB conditions (slip, no-slip or Neumann) for the velocity on the IB can be managed by imposing Dirichlet values in the vicinity of the thin obstacles. To deal with these imposed Dirichlet velocities, we investigated two variants: one in which we use the obstacle velocity and another one in which we use linear interpolations based on discrete geometrical properties of the IB (barycenters and normal vectors) and the FE basis functions. This last variant is motivated by an increase of the accuracy/computation time ratio for coarse meshes. As a first step, concerning academic test cases for one-phase dilatable-fluid laminar flows, the results obtained via those two variants are in good agreement with analytical and experimental data. Moreover, when compared to each other, the linear interpolation variant increases the spatial order of convergence as expected. An industrial test case illustrates the advantages and drawbacks of this approach. In a shortcoming second step, to face two-phase turbulent fluid simulations, some methodology modifications will be considered such as adapting the projection scheme to low-compressible fluid and immersed wall-law boundary conditions.},

  abstract     = {Fictitious domain methods enable to solve physical problems on unfitted grids, thereby avoiding time-consuming and error prone meshing phases. However, an accurate integration of the weak formulation is still mandatory, leading to the need for efficient quadrature strategies in the elements that are partially located in the physical domain. Various methodologies have been proposed to this end. Among them, the design of element-specific moment-fitting quadrature rules seems promising. However, some of the resulting weights are usually negative and the points located out of the domain which may lead to a lack quadrature stability. In this contribution, we aim to construct quadrature rules whose weights are all positive and points all located in the physical domain. Such rules can be constructed based on a non-negative least square resolution of the moment-fitting equations. The resulting quadrature formulas are compared to empirical quadrature rules and different variants of classical moment-fitting quadrature rules in both 1D and 2D. Benchmarks show that non-negative moment-fitting quadrature rules are robust and efficient although their setup cost can be significantly higher than classical moment-fitting. Finally, their application to linear elastic and small-strain elasto-plastic problems highlight their robustness for engineering applications.},

The governing equations are discretized by a finite volume method with explicit time stepping. SCB uses a fully parallel environment via Message Passing Interfaces (MPI). With the fast growing number of heterogeneous computing platforms including disparate hardware architectures, it becomes nowadays necessary to develop hybrid parallelization strategies with a special care to portability. In this context, we present an heterogeneous computing framework based on MPI library and OpenACC. The choice of OpenACC is discussed. Performances, scalability and adaptability are illustrated through a series of tests on an heterogeneous architecture. Validations are proposed on various bubble collapses, in free-field or near a rigid wall. Comparisons are done with existing results and analytical solutions. Furthermore a stiff shock-induced bubble collapse demonstrates the capabilities and the high potential of the code.},

The analyses based on the IEFG–RIPM are performed under a standard Galerkin weak-formulation, i.e. without the need of introducing streamline-upwind or pressure stabilizing terms in order to suppress the appearance of non-physical oscillations. Solutions in a wide range of high Reynolds numbers are successfully achieved, and the results obtained have exhibited an excellent agreement with mesh-based solutions reported in the literature. The numerical performance of the proposed IEFG–RIPM in the solution of such benchmark problem has been analysed in terms of velocity distribution, streamline patterns, vorticity and pressure contours, and also in terms of the properties of primary and secondary vortices. The outcomes of this study demonstrate the potential of the IEFG–RIPM as a feasible and reliable numerical technique for the analysis of lid-driven square cavity flows at high Reynolds numbers, allowing the fulfilment of accuracy and stability numerical requirements demanded in the solution of this benchmark problem in a remarkably simple manner.},

  abstract     = {We consider two parallel-in-time approaches applied to a (reaction) diffusion problem , possibly non-linear. In particular, we consider PFASST (Parallel Full Approximation Scheme in Space and Time) and space-time multigrid strategies. For both approaches, we start from an integral formulation of the continuous time dependent problem. Then, a collocation form for PFASST and a discontinuous Galerkin discretization in time for the space-time multigrid are employed, resulting in the same discrete solution at the time nodes. Strong and weak scaling of both multilevel strategies are compared for varying orders of the temporal discretization . Moreover, we investigate the respective convergence behavior for non-linear problems and highlight quantitative differences in execution times . For the linear problem, we observe that the two methods show similar scaling behavior with PFASST being more favorable for high order methods or when few parallel resources are available. For the non-linear problem, PFASST is more flexible in terms of solution strategy, while space-time multigrid requires a full non-linear solve.},

Thanks to the simple structure of rectangular meshes, the discrete gradients across the boundaries of rectangular elements are easily defined, making numerical implementation much easier.

This novel combination of LRBFs and LSM has the capability of controlling the topological variations automatically, i.e., hole insertion, merging with each other and with the boundary. The governing equations of heat conduction system are solved with the finite element method to obtain the sensitivities at level set grid points as a velocity field for evolution of the structural geometry. The objective function is set to the heat transfer potential with the maximum material volume as the design constraint.

In this paper, a novel rotation-free quadrature element formulation based on Kirchhoff plate theory is presented to solve the problem. Different from all existing quadrature thin plate element formulations, rotational degrees of freedom are not used. Instead, a boundary point is modeled by two nodes separated by a very small distance and thus the C 1 C1 continuity is easily enforced. Explicit formulations with arbitrary number of nodes and nodes of any type are worked out to ease the p -refinement. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed formulation is simple, straightforward and has excellent performance for solving thin sectorial plate with arbitrary combinations of boundary supports. Some tabulated data are believed new which may serve as a reference.},

Unlike standard (FSDT) theory, the proposed model presents an improvement of the FSDT via the introduction of a quadratic shear function allowing the exact representation of the parabolic distribution of the shear strains and avoiding the utilization of shear correction factors which are computationally costs. The finite element method is used for the discretization of the equations of motion and the assumed natural transverse shear strain (ANS) method is employed to avoid shear locking problems. The effect of porosity parameter and its distributions, namely even and uneven forms, is investigated through different numerical illustrative examples. The present finite shell element model provides better agreement with exact solutions in comparison by other theories. Finally, effects of different factors on vibrational behavior of imperfect FGM porous plates and shells are examined in detail.},

  abstract     = {The moving particle semi-implicit method (MPS) is a well-known Lagrange method that offers advantageous in addressing complex fluid problems, but particle distribution is an area that requires refinement. For this study, a particle smoothing algorithm was developed and incorporated into the weakly compressible MPS (sWC-MPS). From the definition and derivation of basic MPS operators, uniform particle distribution is critical to numerical accuracy. Within the framework of sWC-MPS, numerical operators were modified by implementing coordinate transformation and smoothing algorithm. Modifying numerical operators significantly improved particle clustering, smoothed pressure distributions, and reduced pressure oscillations. To validate the numerical feasibility of the method, several cases were numerically simulated to compare sWC-MPS to the weakly compressible MPS (WC-MPS): a pre-defined two-dimensional (2-D) analytical function, Poiseuille&#39;s flow, Taylor Green vortex, and dam break. The results showed a reduction of errors caused by irregular particle distribution with lower particle clustering and smaller pressure oscillation. In addition, a larger Courant number, which represents a larger time step, was tested. The results showed that the new sWC-MPS algorithm achieves numerical accuracy even using a larger Courant number, indicating improved computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Let Γ be a smooth curve inside a two-dimensional rectangular region Ω. In this paper, we consider the Poisson interface problem − ∇ 2 u = f −∇2u=f in Ω ∖ Γ Ω∖Γ with Dirichlet boundary condition such that f is smooth in Ω ∖ Γ Ω∖Γ and the jump functions [ u ] [u] and [ ∇ u ⋅ n → ] [∇u⋅n→] across Γ are smooth along Γ. This Poisson interface problem includes the weak solution of − ∇ 2 u = f + g δ Γ −∇2u=f+gδΓ in Ω as a special case. Because the source term f is possibly discontinuous across the interface curve Γ and contains a delta function singularity along the curve Γ, both the solution u of the Poisson interface problem and its flux ∇ u ⋅ n → ∇u⋅n→ are often discontinuous across the interface. To solve the Poisson interface problem with singular sources, in this paper we propose a sixth order compact finite difference scheme on uniform Cartesian grids . Our proposed compact finite difference scheme with explicitly given stencils extends the immersed interface method (IIM) to the highest possible accuracy order six for compact finite difference schemes on uniform Cartesian grids, but without the need to change coordinates into the local coordinates as in most papers on IIM in the literature. Also in contrast with most published papers on IIM, we explicitly provide the formulas for all involved stencils and therefore, our proposed scheme can be easily implemented and is of interest to practitioners dealing with Poisson interface problems. Note that the curve Γ splits Ω into two disjoint subregions Ω + Ω+ and Ω − Ω− . The coefficient matrix A in the resulting linear system A x = b Ax=b , following from the proposed scheme, is independent of any source term f , jump condition g δ Γ gδΓ , interface curve Γ and Dirichlet boundary conditions, while only b depends on these factors and is explicitly given, according to the configuration of the nine stencil points in Ω + Ω+ or Ω − Ω− . The constant coefficient matrix A facilitates the parallel implementation of the algorithm in case of a large size matrix and only requires the update of the right hand side vector b for different Poisson interface problems. Due to the flexibility and explicitness of the proposed scheme, it can be generalized to obtain the highest order compact finite difference scheme for non-uniform grids as well. We prove the order 6 convergence for the proposed scheme using the discrete maximum principle. Our numerical experiments confirm the sixth accuracy order of the proposed compact finite difference scheme on uniform meshes for the Poisson interface problems with various singular sources.},

From a median-dual area perspective, these signals can be interpreted as a line integral of the fluxes along the control volume boundaries of the cell-vertex approach. The new method includes a first-order version which is positive together with a linearity-preserving second order approach. A second order limited version is also presented using entropy as the guiding principle for limiting.

This operator can be rewritten as a blend of function values with cardinal basis functions, which are a combination of the inverse distance weighting basis functions with multivariate Lagrange fundamental polynomials. The key for simply computing the latter, on a unisolvent set of points, is to use a translation of the canonical polynomial basis and the P A = L U PA=LU factorization of the associated Vandermonde matrix. In this paper, we propose a method to numerically solve a Poisson equation with Dirichlet conditions through multinode Shepard interpolants by collocation. This collocation method gives rise to a collocation matrix with many zero entrances and a smaller condition number with respect to the one of the well known Kansa method. Numerical experiments show the accuracy and the performance of the proposed collocation method.},

We will focus here on computational challenges and try to identify the best algorithm and numerical strategy for a few well-known benchmark cases arising in applications. The aim is to cover, through numerical experimentation and consideration of the best implementation strategies, the main two-level domain decomposition methods developed in recent years for the Helmholtz equation. The theory for these methods is either out of reach with standard mathematical tools or does not cover all cases of practical interest. More precisely, we will focus on the comparison of three coarse spaces that yield two-level methods: the grid coarse space, DtN coarse space, and GenEO coarse space. We will show that they display different pros and cons, and properties depending on the problem and particular numerical setting.},

  abstract     = {In this study, two schemes to treat fluid-solid interaction on complex boundaries are proposed and solved in the framework of lattice Boltzmann method . The schemes are applied on the phase-field-based wettability implementation methods for binary and ternary fluids to simulate static contact angle on a circular surface generated by the staircase approximation . For the binary system, surface-energy and geometric wetting conditions are adopted, while for the ternary system , surface-energy model with two discretization schemes resulting in explicit and implicit wetting conditions are developed and examined. It is proven that the implicit wetting condition approximating the value of order parameters on the boundary node , as the average of their value between the neighboring fluid node and solid node, enhances the accuracy of predicted contact angles. For modeling of contact angle on the circular surface and identifying the direction of normal vectors required for incorporating wetting condition, the gradient of fluid-solid field is calculated. Two methods namely, round-off and interpolation describing how the information of neighboring nodes given the direction of normal vector on the boundary nodes should be used, are discussed. It is illustrated that results of the interpolation method exhibit a good agreement with the analytical solution as opposed to the round-off when tested in the case of static contact angle on a circular surface for both binary and ternary systems. Finally, it is shown incorporating different wetting conditions with the appropriate way of handling normal vectors and in combination with the conservative phase-field model can model static contact angle at high-density ratios for both binary and ternary fluids with good accuracy.},

The variable-order Riesz fractional derivative and variable diffusion coefficient are introduced to simulate diffusion phenomena in heterogeneous, irregularly shaped biological tissues. The fractional Bloch-Torrey equation is discretised by the weighted and shifted Grünwald-Letnikov formula with respect to time and by finite volume method with respect to space. Additionally, to improve the accuracy of the numerical method for dealing with non-smooth solutions, some appropriate correction terms are introduced in the time approximation. Numerical examples on different irregular domains with various non-smooth solutions are explored to verify the effectiveness of the presented numerical scheme. Furthermore, we also solve the coupled variable-order fractional Bloch-Torrey equation on a human brain-like domain which is composed of white matter and grey matter. The solution behaviour of this model is compared with that of the constant-order fractional model, and the transverse magnetisation in magnetic resonance imaging on different biological micro-environments are graphically analysed. Results suggest that incorporation of the non-local property and spatial heterogeneity in the model by use of fractional operators can lead to a better capability for capturing the complexities of diffusion phenomena in biological tissues.

This flow model is also coupled with the mechanical deformation of the matrix assuming that the fractures are open and filled by the fluids, as well as small deformations and a linear elastic constitutive law. The model is discretized using the gradient discretization method [30] , which covers a large class of conforming and non conforming schemes. This framework allows for a generic convergence analysis of the coupled model using a combination of discrete functional tools. Here, we describe the model together with its numerical discretization and, using discrete compactness techniques, we prove a convergence result (up to a subsequence) assuming the non-degeneracy of the phase mobilities and that the discrete solutions remain physical in the sense that, roughly speaking, the porosity does not vanish and the fractures remain open. This is, to our knowledge, the first convergence result for this type of model taking into account two-phase flows in fractured porous media and the non-linear poromechanical coupling. Previous related works consider a linear approximation obtained for a single phase flow by freezing the fracture conductivity [41] , [42] . Numerical tests employing the Two-Point Flux Approximation (TPFA) finite volume scheme for the flows and P 2 P2 finite elements for the mechanical deformation are also provided to illustrate the behavior of the solution to the model.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we intend to construct a structure preserving difference scheme for two-dimensional space-fractional nonlinear Schrödinger (2D SFNS) equation with the integral fractional Laplacian . The temporal direction is discretized by the modified Crank-Nicolson method, and the spatial variable is approximated by a novel fractional central difference method. The mass and energy conservations and the convergence are rigorously proved for the proposed scheme. For 1D SFNS equation, the convergence relies heavily on the L ∞ L∞ -norm boundness of the numerical solution of the proposed scheme. However, we cannot obtain the L ∞ L∞ -norm boundness of the numerical solution by using the similar process for the 2D SFNS equation. One of the major significance of this paper is that we first obtain the L ∞ L∞ -norm boundness of the numerical solution and L 2 L2 -norm error estimate via the popular “cut-off” function for the 2D SFNS equation. Further, we reveal that the spatial discretization generates a block-Toeplitz coefficient matrix , and it will be ill-conditioned as the spatial grid mesh number M and the fractional order α increase. Thus, we exploit an linearized iteration algorithm for the nonlinear system , so that it can be efficiently solved by the Krylov subspace solver with a suitable preconditioner , where the 2D fast Fourier transform (2D FFT) is applied in the solver to accelerate the matrix-vector product, and the standard orthogonal projection approach is used to eliminate the drift of mass and energy. Extensive numerical results are reported to confirm the theoretical analysis and high efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

[1] and recently studied by Valli et al. [2] . The new DD method, based on a two-scale approach, introduces locally and dynamically an extra stability through a nonlinear operator acting in all scales of the discretization. We prove existence of discrete solutions, stability, and a priori error estimates. We theoretically show that the new DD method has convergence rate of O ( h 1 / 2 ) O(h1/2) in the energy norm, and numerical experiments have led to optimal convergence rates in the L 2 ( Ω ) L2(Ω) , H 1 ( Ω ) H1(Ω) , and energy norms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we introduce a new method called the Dirac Assisted Tree (DAT) method, which can handle 1D heterogeneous Helmholtz equations with arbitrarily large variable wave numbers. DAT breaks an original global problem into many parallel tree-structured small local problems, which are linked together to form a global solution by solving small linking problems. To solve the local problems in DAT, we propose a compact finite difference method (FDM) with arbitrarily high accuracy order and low numerical dispersion for piecewise smooth coefficients and variable wave numbers. This compact FDM is particularly appealing for DAT, because the local problems and their fluxes in DAT can be computed with high accuracy. DAT with such compact FDMs can solve heterogeneous Helmholtz equations with arbitrarily large variable wave numbers accurately by solving small linear systems — 4 × 4 4×4 matrices in the extreme case — with tridiagonal coefficient matrices in a parallel fashion. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of DAT using the M th order compact FDMs with M = 6 , 8 M=6,8 for numerically solving heterogeneous Helmholtz equations with variable wave numbers. We shall also discuss how to solve some special 2D Helmholtz equations using DAT.},

To solve the problem numerically, spatial polar coordinates are used; a finite difference method is constructed on a mesh that is graded in time and spherical in space. The discretisation uses the L1 scheme in time and a polar-coordinate discretisation of the diffusion term .

The key idea of the multiscale mortar mixed approach is to decompose the domain into the smaller subregions separated by the interfaces with the Dirichlet pressure boundary condition. Each subdomain is partitioned independently on the fine scale and the standard mixed methods are used to solve each local problem. Each interface is partitioned on coarse scale and a finite element space is defined to enforce the weak continuity of flux across the mortar interface. We consider both the continuous time and discrete time settings, and derive optimal error estimates for both scalar and flux unknowns. An error estimate for the mortar pressure is also presented. Several numerical results are presented to justify the theoretical convergence estimates.},

The algorithm is essentially oriented on common-offset vector (COV) gathers seismic migration based on an OWE, includes several parallelism levels, and utilizes message passing interface (MPI), Nested OpenMP, and CUDA technologies. The uppermost level of parallelism involves data splitting to ensure that each dataset can be processed independently to construct parts of the COV images. The algorithm is embarrassingly parallel at this level. Next, each independent run processes several datasets to compute COV images. Each MPI process computes all COV images for a single dataset, then MPI processes exchange data to build up a single COV image for all datasets at a single node. Computation of the COV image at a node requires OpenMP parallelization so that one thread governs the GPU-based calculations and facilitates the construction of images within a thick slab. All other threads perform image interpolation within the slab. Finally, CUDA technology is used for the most computationally intense part of the algorithm—wavefield extrapolation. Such a complex algorithm structure makes it possible to process all COV images for full-azimuth seismic data employing OWE-based migration.},

The lower wavy surface of the cavity is kept at a constant hot temperature ( T h Th ) while the upper flat surface is kept at a constant cold temperature ( T c Tc ). The remaining surfaces (vertical surfaces) are maintained adiabatic. An Al 2 O 3 Al2O3 /water nanofluid is filled inside the cavity and a non-homogeneous approach is adopted to solve governing equations by using the Galerkin method. The effect of some parameters such as the angular rotational speed, the volume fraction of nanoparticles, Hartmann number on the flow and heat transfer characteristics are examined. The results indicate that the waving of the hot base of the cavity enhances the Nusselt number. The maximal Nusselt numbers are obtained when the number of undulations N is 2, where the Nusselt number augments by 18% when N is boosted from 0 to 2 and by 16% from 0 to and 5. Also, the outcomes reveal that the enhancement of the Nusselt number as a result of raising the rotational speed of the two cylinders from 0 to ± 500 is about 315%.},

This paper focuses on the development of efficient inverse solvers for scenarios where the evolution of boundary conditions can vary in time. A transient heat model with two material parameters – volumetric capacity and a coefficient of thermal conductivity – is introduced for the description of the underlying physical phenomena . All proposed identification algorithms are deterministic methods based on a regularised Gauss-Newton method. A basic framework, implementation details, and the modification of general constraints initially derived for a standard setup of the Calderón problem are discussed here. Moreover, the algorithms are numerically verified for numerous examples, and results obtained show that the inverse problem exhibits a certain degree of ambiguity for a particular measurement-loading scenario. In other words, the important material property minimising the magnitude of error of the objective function seems to be the effusivity field rather than accurate identification of the individual thermal fields.},

Sensitivity derivatives are computed along the fluid-solid interfaces via the continuous adjoint method. Changes in topology are caused by expressing the computed sensitivity derivatives w.r.t. an auxiliary background material distribution, that helps updating the fluid-solid interfaces. The proposed method performance is assessed on three 2 D benchmark examples and a 3 D case. Two out of the three 2 D examples are also solved using a porosity-based topology optimization approach in which impermeable regions are penalized by a Brinkman term and useful conclusions are drawn.

In the lattice Boltzmann method, the discrete distribution functions for every grid in the analysis domain need to be stored to compute the flow field , while in the LKS, only the flow velocities and the densities are stored, and thus requiring less storage. Moreover, in the LKS, the macroscopic boundary conditions in terms of the velocity and the pressure can be imposed directly rather than considering the bounce-back boundary condition against the distribution function. In this study, the optimization is performed based on the gradient of the objective functional with respect to the design variables and the design sensitivity is computed by the adjoint variable method . Both the forward and the adjoint problems are solved using the LKS. The validity of the design sensitivity is verified by comparing it with the finite difference approximation of objective functional. Numerical examples of solving two-dimensional flow channel design problems are presented to demonstrate the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is a powerful method for solving elastostatics problems based on polygonal elements. In this paper, we firstly construct the quadratic polygonal scaled boundary element only depends on the boundary nodal displacements by transforming the additional degrees of freedom derived from the constant body loads to those by the boundary nodes. Further, combining with the discrete Kirchhoff theory, we construct the polygonal scaled boundary thin plate element, which can possess the second order completeness. The element stiffness matrix for the thin plate problem can be transformed by the stiffness matrix for the plane problem directly by avoiding to compute the shape functions of SBFEM. Numerical examples verify that the proposed polygonal scaled boundary thin plate element has good accuracy.},

  abstract     = {An implementation of a massively parallel domain decomposing direct finite element equation solver named FALKSOL is tested using the parallel version of the state of the art open-source solver MUMPS (MUltifrontal Massively Parallel Solver) as a reference. FALKSOL includes its own very advanced multi-level domain decomposition and load balancing procedure. In the elemental mode, MUMPS uses a single level domain decomposition, and then solves the interface problem. FALKSOL offers a full out-of-core functionality, while MUMPS offers only a partial one. The problem size that can be solved by MUMPS is therefore hard limited by the amount of physical memory plus swap space 1 present. This is an actual bottleneck. FALKSOL can solve much larger problems. It is essentially only limited by the size of the secondary storage available. With modern so-called Non-Volatile Memory express (NVMe) on the PCI bus, enough I/O bandwidth is obtained with a couple of raided units. The results show that MUMPS is about twice as fast as FALKSOL in the limited range of problem size it copes with. The solvers are complementary. The out-of-core multi-level domain decomposition algorithm in FALKSOL makes it scale. The test indicates that there is a considerable potential gain in scalability/elasticity choosing the FALKSOL multi-level domain-decomposition out-of-core approach. Especially considering more powerful and larger compute systems. The price to be paid in speed compared with MUMPS is reasonable. The current stand-alone implementation of FALKSOL is interfaced with the 3Dhp code Demkowicz (2007) [32] , Demkowicz et al. (2008) [33] . The described MUMPS-like interface can be used to select the best solver for the task.},

The calculation, however, suffers from a massive amount of computing resources. A predictive model , to reduce the computing cost and accelerate the calculations, is proposed in this work. By employing an artificial neural network , composed of convolution layers and convolution long short-term memory layers, the model is an equivalent substitution of multiple time steps. A physical informed training loss function is introduced to improve the model predictive accuracy ; and for the two-dimensional driven cavity problem, the mean square error of the prediction is less than 1.5 × 10 − 6 1.5×10−6 . For non-stationary flow, a time-dependent computing structure based on the current model is established. Nine iterative model calculations are performed consecutively for a two-dimensional driven cavity model, and the results are validated by comparing with the original (serial) lattice Boltzmann algorithm. Generally, in the case of training Reynolds number , for velocity and speed, the mean and the maximum absolute errors are lower than 0.012 and 0.12. Similarly, in the generalizing case, the mean and the maximum absolute errors are lower than 0.017 and 0.012. Besides, the current model&#39;s efficiency is about 15 times higher than that of the original lattice Boltzmann method.},

  abstract     = {A meshless numerical scheme, named as space-time backward substitution method (STBSM), is proposed for 3D unsteady advection-diffusion equations (ADEs). In this method, the numerical solution is composed by approximation of boundary points and approximation of internal domain. Here, the space-time radial basis function (STRBF) is applied to construct internal approximation which satisfies homogeneous boundary condition. While, time dimension, as a new variable in radial coordinate, is incorporated into the global space-time basis function. Different from using other common global basis functions, the STBSM with STRBF does not require the temporal discretization, which makes it easy-to program and time saving. In addition, compactly supported space-time radial basis function (CS-STRBF) is introduced to reduce the original resultant full matrix to a sparse matrix, compared with global space-time radial basis function. It can overcome ill-conditioned matrix caused by an excessive condition number. Numerical results of two examples show that the proposed method provides accurate and stable solutions with low computational cost for three dimensional advection-diffusion equations. Moreover, comparison results indicate that the accuracy of the method is 2 − 4 2−4 orders of magnitude higher than the dimension splitting element-free Galerkin (DSEFG) [19] algorithm with less time expense.},

It can adopt the flexible meshes, meanwhile, the flux calculation is simple. However, the original DUGKS is proposed for the compressible flows. When we try to solve a problem governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations, the original DUGKS may bring some undesirable errors because of the compressible effect. To eliminate the compressible effect, the DUGKS for incompressible N-S equations is developed in this work. In addition, the Chapman-Enskog analysis ensures that the present DUGKS can solve the incompressible N-S equations exactly, meanwhile, a new non-extrapolation scheme is adopted to treat the Dirichlet boundary conditions. To test the present DUGKS for incompressible N-S equations, four problems are adopted. The first one is a periodic problem driven by an external force, which is used to test the influences of Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition number and the M a c h Mach number ( Ma ). Besides, some comparisons between the present DUGKS and some available results are also conducted. The second problem is Womersley flow, it is also used to test the influence of Ma , and the results show that the compressible effect is reduced obviously. Then, the two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow is considered. In these simulations, the Reynolds number is varied from 400 to 1000000 to illustrate the accuracy, stability and efficiency of the present DUGKS. Finally, the numerical solutions of the three-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow suggest that the present DUGKS is suitable for the three-dimensional problems.},

  abstract     = {316L stainless steel is currently one of the most critical stainless-steel materials due to its excellent corrosion resistance and comprehensive mechanical properties. Selective laser melting (SLM), as an additive manufacturing technology for directly forming complex metal parts, has been applied in the production of 316L stainless steel components. By introducing reasonable and comprehensive equivalent processing models (e.g., gasification pressure, gasification heat dissipation, and equivalent physical parameters), a predictive model of the dynamic behavior of the molten pool on the workpiece scale (two-phase flow model) was established for the SLM process of 316L stainless steel. The related equivalent processing models were customized by secondary development means based on the commercial software Fluent. By comparing and analyzing the different calculation schemes, it was found that surface tension stabilizes the liquid metal surface, while the Marangoni effect and the gasification recoil force cause the liquid metal surface to appear concave. The tangential movement of the liquid metal surface, caused by the Marangoni effect, causes the molten metal to accumulate around the central region , forming a liquid surface morphology resembling a crater. The influence of different processing parameters (scanning speed and laser power) on the SLM process of 316L stainless steel was analyzed. The simulated and experimentally obtained solidified track sizes were in good agreement .},

  abstract     = {In layered media, the solution of the Maxwell equations has discontinuity of the derivative or the function itself at media interfaces. For the first time, finite-difference schemes providing convergence for discontinuous solutions across straight media interfaces are proposed for the one-dimensional formulation of the Maxwell equations. These are bicompact conservative schemes. They are two-point and layer boundaries are taken as mesh nodes. The scheme explicitly accounts for physically correct interface conditions at media interfaces. We propose an essentially new technique which accounts for medium dispersion. All these features provide the second order of accuracy even on discontinuous solutions. Calculation examples, which illustrate these results, are given. The proposed method is verified by comparison with a previously performed experiment on propagation of normally incident plane wave on one-dimensional photonic crystal. Calculated spectrum agrees well with the measured one within experimental error of 2-5%.},

We consider a cost-efficient management problem of the SDEs to achieve the objectives whose resolution reduces to solving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. We also consider a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation governing the probability density function of the controlled dynamics. The HJB equation has a discontinuous solution, while the FP equation has a Dirac&#39;s delta along boundaries. We show that the value function, the optimized objective function, is governed by the HJB equation in the simplified case and further that a threshold-type control is optimal.

  abstract     = {We propose a new second-order accurate finite volume (FV) scheme for diffusion equations with discontinuous coefficients on unstructured meshes. This scheme is based on a novel least squares reconstruction with a compact neighbourhood that computes the cell-centered diffusion fluxes from the normal diffusion flux at cell faces. We propose two variants of the scheme rooted in the concept of “alpha damping” (AD), which are both linearly exact on arbitrary mesh topologies even when the tangential diffusive fluxes are discontinuous. The first variant, referred to as AD-G (Alpha Damping-Gradient), effects the discretisation of the normal derivative while the second, referred to as AD-F (Alpha Damping-Flux), involves discretisation of the normal fluxes. It is shown that harmonic averaging for diffusion coefficient at the faces is essential for the accuracy of the solution with the AD-G scheme but this condition is not necessary for the AD-F scheme. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed FV schemes estimate the solution and fluxes to second and first order accuracy respectively for discontinuous diffusion problems on generic polygonal meshes. Studies also show that these schemes are discrete extremum preserving (DEP) and can be implemented with relative ease for diffusion problems in existing legacy codes.},

  abstract     = {The motivation of this study is twofold. First, a recursive mathematical formulation of the discrete-velocity Boltzmann equation (DVBE) under the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) approximation is introduced. This formulation allows us to formally express the solution of the DVBE as an infinite sum over successive particle derivatives of the distributions associated with local equilibrium. A Chapman-Enskog multiple-scales expansion shows that this sum can be safely truncated beyond the second order if the Navier-Stokes level of description is requested. Therefore, the distribution functions depend only on the first and second-order derivatives of the related equilibrium distributions . This alternative equation to the DVBE defines a basis to design kinetic schemes for the evolution of the distribution functions based solely on flow variables that are sufficient to define local equilibrium. Second, a family of mass-conserving numerical schemes is introduced from this kinetic equation by discretizing the particle derivatives by backward finite differences. Interestingly, a so-called “simplified Lattice Boltzmann method” introduced by Chen et al. in 2017 can be recast in this family. Numerical simulations highlight a level of numerical dissipation that is generally higher than the level obtained with a standard Lattice Boltzmann scheme, as expected by approximating derivatives by finite differences. Nevertheless, we show by using a von Neumann analysis that it is possible to parametrize our scheme, according to the relaxation coefficient of the DVBE, to reduce significantly its numerical dissipation and improve its spectral properties . We believe that this modeling can also be of interest to connect macroscopic and kinetic representations, e.g. when dealing with initial and boundary conditions or in hybrid simulations matching Navier-Stokes and Lattice Boltzmann schemes.},

Unlike the existing GMG methods, the present method does not require the generation of a sequence of coarse grids so that all the problems related to coarse-grid generation can be eliminated. Instead, only the sets of nodes in coarse levels are constructed for multigrid computation from the finest grid by using the node-coarsening algorithm that can be employed for any kind of a 2D/3D unstructured grid as well as a hybrid grid on the finest level. The implementation of the present coarsening algorithm is simple in the sense that the boundary information of the finest grid is not required. A searching algorithm to calculate the area/volume-shape function of the finite element method is also proposed to derive an operator for linear interpolation of multigrid computation. We have successfully validated the proposed method for various 2D/3D benchmark problems by showing that the elapsed time of the present GMG method is linearly proportional to the number of unknowns of a linear system of equations. We have also confirmed that the proposed method is nearly as efficient as the grid-based MG method based on a sequence of coarse grids in terms of CPU time. Lastly, we have successfully validated the meshless GMG method by solving an elliptic equation formulated by the finite volume method on a complicated 3D geometry filled with a hybrid unstructured mesh.},

  abstract     = {Since proposed, the genuinely multidimensional Riemann solvers have been attracting more attentions because it considers the waves normal and parallel to the cell interfaces at the same time. However, all these methods are built upon the hyperbolic property of the compressible Euler equations. Therefore, they can not be applied to solve the Euler equations in steady subsonic cases which are with the elliptic property. In this study, a novel multidimensional Riemann solver called MULE-AUSMPWM (Multidimensional E-AUSMPW Modified) is proposed. It is built upon the Zha–Bilgen splitting procedure and adopts the Balsara&#39;s multidimensional wave model as the ME-AUSMPW scheme. In addition, it improves the ME-AUSMPW scheme&#39;s accuracy at subsonic speeds by avoiding simulating the convective fluxes in fully upwind manners. Extensive numerical tests, such as the two dimensional Euler problem, the one dimensional moving contact discontinuity case, the two-dimensional double Mach reflection case, the two-dimensional Riemann problem, and the turbulent flow past a 2d NACA0012 airfoil case, are conducted. Results illustrate that the MULE-AUSMPWM scheme proposed is capable of simulating compressible complex flows and improving the existing multidimensional Riemann solvers&#39; accuracy at subsonic speeds remarkably.},

  abstract     = {This work aims to build a bridge between probability methods and finite element methods . It starts with considering probability distributions supported in an interval [ a , b ] [a,b] , which incorporate the traditional probability distributions defined on the whole real space as limit cases on the one hand, lead to a type of spherical probability models with wide potential applications on the other hand. This type of probability has scaling and symmetry feature, and sufficient conditions under which a density function can be generated through discrete polynomial spectrum are given in this work followed by concrete examples. The density function ρ ρ obtained in this way has the advantage of being positive definite . Computer based numerical simulation shows that the theoretically verified criteria for probability distribution are almost optimal with respect to our testing examples. After the establishment of an approximation theorem in L 1 L1 space, we propose a probabilistic Galerkin scheme that can be either continuous or discontinuous, which is potentially useful to asymptotically solve some PDEs on the sphere locally and globally.},

Research on DPG for transient problems has mainly focused on spacetime discretizations , which has theoretical advantages, but practical costs for computations and software implementations. The sole examination of time-stepping DPG formulations was performed by Führer, Heuer, and Gupta, who applied Rothe’s method to an ultraweak formulation of the heat equation to develop an implicit time-stepping scheme; their work emphasized theoretical results, including error estimates in time and space. In the present work, we follow Führer, Heuer, and Gupta in examining the heat equation; our focus is on numerical experiments, examining the stability and accuracy of several formulations, including primal as well as ultraweak, and explicit as well as implicit and Crank–Nicolson time-stepping schemes. We are additionally interested in communication-avoiding algorithms, and we therefore include a highly experimental formulation that places all the trace terms on the right-hand side of the equation.},

Our method employs a technique developed by Guermond and Minev (2011), which consists of singular perturbation plus a splitting scheme. While the time-integration schemes are implicit, we use finite elements to discretize the spatial counterparts. At each time-step, we solve a PDE having weak-derivatives in one direction only (which allows for the linear computational cost), at the expense of handling strong second-order derivatives of the previous time step solution, on the right-hand side of these PDEs. This motivates the use of smooth functions such as B-splines. For high Reynolds numbers, some of these PDEs become unstable. To deal robustly with these instabilities, we propose to use a residual minimization technique. We test our method on problems having manufactured solutions, as well as on the cavity flow problem.},

The methods are obtained within a machine-learning framework during which the parameters defining the method are tuned against available training data . In particular, we use a provably stable parametric Petrov–Galerkin method that is equivalent to a minimal-residual formulation using a weighted norm. While the trial space is a standard finite element space, the test space has parameters that are tuned in an off-line stage. Finding the optimal test space therefore amounts to obtaining a goal-oriented discretization that is completely tailored towards the quantity of interest. We use an artificial neural network to define the parametric family of test spaces. Using numerical examples for the Laplacian and advection equation in one and two dimensions , we demonstrate that the ML-MRes finite element method has superior approximation of quantities of interest even on very coarse meshes.},

For inviscid flows, LS-MDG-ICE detects and fits a priori unknown interfaces, including shocks. For convection-dominated diffusion, LS-MDG-ICE resolves internal layers, e.g., viscous shocks, and boundary layers using anisotropic curvilinear r r -adaptivity in which high-order shape representations are anisotropically adapted to accurately resolve the flow field. As such, LS-MDG-ICE solutions are oscillation-free, regardless of the grid resolution and polynomial degree. Finally, for both linear and nonlinear problems in one dimension, LS-MDG-ICE is shown to achieve optimal-order convergence of the L 2 L2 solution error with respect to the exact solution when the discrete geometry is fixed and super-optimal convergence when the discrete geometry is treated as a variable.},

The dual representations also need to satisfy the de Rham sequence on the domain boundary. The matrix which converts primal representations to dual representations – the Hodge matrix – is the mass or Gram matrix. It will be shown that a bilinear form of a primal and a dual representation is equal to the vector inner product of the expansion coefficients (degrees of freedom) of both representations. This leads to very sparse system matrices, even for high order methods. The differential operators for dual representations will be defined. Vector operations, grad, curl and div, for primal and dual representations are both topological and do not depend on the metric, i.e. the size and shape of the mesh or the order of the numerical method. Derivatives are evaluated by applying sparse incidence and inclusion matrices to the expansion coefficients of the representations. As illustration of the use of dual representations, the method will be applied to (i) a mixed formulation for the Poisson problem in 3D, (ii) it will be shown that this approach allows one to preserve the equivalence between Dirichlet and Neumann problems in the finite dimensional setting and, (iii) the method will be applied to the approximation of grad–div eigenvalue problem on affine and non-affine meshes.},

Unfortunately, the finite element discretization for these problems suffers from significant numerical pollution errors that increase with the wavenumber. It is critical to control these errors to obtain a stable and accurate method. We study the effect of pollution for very long waveguide problems in the context of robust discontinuous Petrov–Galerkin (DPG) finite element discretizations. Our numerical experiments show that the pollution primarily has a diffusive effect causing energy loss in the DPG method while phase errors appear less significant. We report results for 3D vectorial time-harmonic Maxwell problems in waveguides with more than 8000 wavelengths. Our results corroborate previous analysis for the Galerkin discretization of the Helmholtz operator by Melenk and Sauter (2011). Additionally, we discuss adaptive refinement strategies for multi-mode fiber waveguides where the propagating transverse modes must be resolved sufficiently. Our study shows the applicability of the DPG error indicator to this class of problems. Finally, we illustrate the importance of load balancing in these simulations for distributed-memory parallel computing .},

  abstract     = {We present the application of the Discontinuous Petrov–Galerkin (DPG) methodology for the mixed Multiscale Finite Element Method (MsFEM). The MsFEM upscaling technique relies on incorporating fine-scale features through special, in a sense optimized for approximability , trial functions while the DPG methodology allows for the selection of the optimal test functions to provide stability of the FEM approximation . The special trial functions are computed online by the solution of local boundary value problems . We improved this process using the static condensation that restricted the construction of the functions to the coarse mesh skeleton (element interfaces) only. We have verified by numerical tests that the proposed improvement of MsFEM reduced both the approximation error and computational cost. Moreover, it simplified the algorithm significantly. The key component of this prolongation construction is our novel method for prolongation of both traction and displacement vectors on element edges of arbitrary shape . The proposed prolongation operator may be also used in the multigrid solver for direct analysis of composites with varying material parameters, using an arbitrary well-posed functional setting with or without the DPG methodology.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, being based on the idea of dispersion-relation-preserving optimization, a class of high-order high-resolution upwind compact schemes with a free parameter and their consistent boundary scheme are proposed for the solution of the governing equations of the 2D double-diffusive convection. The first derivative and the second derivative, in the vorticity equation , the temperature equation and the concentration equation, are discretized by using the optimal upwind compact scheme on a uniform mesh and the fourth-order symmetrical Padé compact scheme, respectively. The pressure Poisson equation is approximated using a fourth-order compact difference scheme constructed currently on the nine-point two dimensional stencil. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is utilized for the temporal discretization . To assess numerical capability of the proposed algorithm, particularly its spatial behavior , the problems about the convection diffusion equation , the nonlinear Burgers equation and the nature convection flows in the square cavity with adiabatic horizontal walls and differentially heated vertical walls are computed by using the newly proposed algorithm. The numerical results are in excellent agreement with the benchmark solutions and some of the accurate results available in the literature, and show that effectiveness, accuracy and the advantage of better resolution of the present method. After that, steady and unsteady solutions for the double-diffusive convection in a rectangular cavity are also used to assess the efficiency of the present algorithm. The period of oscillation and flow field profiles are in great agreement with the data in the literature for buoyancy ratio, λ = 1 λ=1 . The typical separation and secondary vortices at the bottom corner of the cavity as well as the top corner can be captured well for various buoyancy ratio. These indicate that the present method is suitable for simulating effectively the unsteady double-diffusive convection.},

We prove that the spectrums of the preconditioned matrices in both cases are clustered around 1, such that the proposed numerical methods with preconditioners converge very quickly.

The SSE method has demonstrated improved convergence behaviors compared to other strain smoothing methods through various numerical examples; however, there has been no theoretical evidence for the convergence behavior. A unique feature of the SSE method is the construction of smoothed strain fields within elements by fully unifying the strains of adjacent elements. Owing to this feature, convergence analysis is required, which is different from other existing strain smoothing methods. In this paper, we first propose a novel mixed variational principle wherein the SSE method can be interpreted as a Galerkin approximation of that. The proposed variational principle is a generalization of the well-known Hu–Washizu variational principle; thus, various existing strain smoothing methods can be expressed in terms of the proposed variational principle. With a unified view of the SSE method and other existing methods through the proposed variational principle, we analyze the convergence behavior of the SSE method and explain the reason for the improved performance compared to other methods. We also present numerical experiments that support our theoretical results.},

Since the shape parameter of RBFs is problem dependent, several known procedures on how to determine a good shape parameter are introduced for solving various types of problems. The proposed method is not only highly accurate but also fairly stable due to the use of the particular solutions and fundamental solutions.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop a partitioned scheme with multiple-time-step technique for the nonstationary dual-porosity-Stokes model. The proposed partitioned scheme allows different time steps in the different subdomains of the dual-porosity-Stokes model: conduits/macrofractures, microfractures , and matrix. Under a time step restriction which depends on the physical parameters of the model, we derived the stability of the partitioned scheme. The error estimates of this scheme are also provided. The numerical experiments confirm the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the proposed scheme is reliable, applicable, and consumes less CPU time.},

The solution and free boundary of the HJBVI are constructed from a sequence of penalized equations, for which the penalization error is estimated. The penalized equation is then discretized by a class of semi-implicit monotone approximations. We present a novel analysis technique for the well-posedness of the discrete equation, and demonstrate the convergence of the scheme, which subsequently gives a constructive proof for the existence of a solution to the penalized equation and variational inequality. We further propose an efficient iterative algorithm with local superlinear convergence for solving the discrete equation.

  abstract     = {With the objective of studying fluid-structure interaction (FSI) applications with sophisticated structural behavior , this work studies an approach that makes room for the use of complex structural models without penalizing the global computational time . The proposed approach is based on an algorithm that, simultaneously solving two subdomains , allows an asynchronous update of the boundary conditions at the interface according to the computational time spent by each of the solvers. The implementation of this algorithm revealed the appearance of numerical instabilities related to the parallel operation, and the independent evolution of the local solution in each subdomain. To overcome these stability problems, this work proposes a two-part stabilization strategy, both based on the use of a modal approach, as well as the adjustment of the formulation of the Jacobian of the fluid at the interface. The first part consists of a predictor-corrector method for the parallel operation and the second in an auxiliary coupling to assist the solution of the fluid domain. The impact of parameters such as the amount of correction, the number of modes and under-relaxation are studied. The use of the proposed asynchronous algorithm shows a positive impact when used for the solution of weakly coupled FSI applications (mass ratio m F / m S = 0.001 mF/mS=0.001 ). However, for applications with a larger or equivalent mass ratio, m F / m S = 0.1 mF/mS=0.1 or m F / m S = 1 mF/mS=1 , greater difficulty in stabilizing remain. Even though it is found that the proposed approach requires to be improved to ensure a robust solution , the encountered results represent an advance towards the use of an innovative algorithm in the FSI domain, one that could naturally offer an intermediary algorithm between the implicit external algorithm and the implicit internal algorithm.},

The main objective of this comprehensive study is the enhancement of heat transportation. The governing equations in three dimensional form are transmuted in to dimensionless two-dimensional form with implementation of suitable scaling transformations. The variational finite element procedure is harnessed and coded in Matlab script to obtain numerical solution of the coupled non-linear partial differential problem. It is observed that higher inputs of the parameters for magnetic force and rotational fluid cause to slow the primary as well as secondary velocities, but the thermophoresis and Brownian motion raise the temperature. However, thermal relaxation parameter reduces the nanofluid temperature. The velocities for viscosity constant case are faster than that for the variable viscosity, but temperature and species concentration depict opposite behavior.},

We prove stability and sharp a priori error estimates for a linear advection equation by using a specially tailored projection and conducting some parts of a standard convergence analysis for both meshes. By allowing an arbitrary degree of enrichment on both, the coarse and the fine mesh (also including the case of no enrichment), our analysis technique is very general in the sense that our results cover the range from the standard continuous finite element method to the standard discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with (or without) local subcell enrichment.

When the pressure penalty parameter γ γ tends to 0 ( γ &gt; 0 γ&amp;gt;0 ), the velocity approximation tends to be H(div)-conforming and exactly divergence-free, and the velocity error bound tends to be pressure-robust. However, taking the value of γ γ too small will cause the over-stabilization of the pressure. Then, we can provide a post-processing procedure to obtain a stable pressure approximation.},

An existing near-wall modeling based on the reconstruction of distribution functions is further developed to calculate high Reynolds number wall-bounded turbulent flow on a non-body-fitted Cartesian grid. The following three ideas are introduced into the existing reconstruction model: (1) the introduction of an image-point, (2) blending of sub-grid scale and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes eddy viscosity considering the Reynolds shear stress resolved on a computational grid, and (3) modifications of velocity and eddy viscosity profiles near a wall. For the validation of the proposed model, numerical simulations of a turbulent channel flow on a non-body-fitted Cartesian grid are performed. Three different cases of the angles between the Cartesian grid line and the wall boundary are calculated, and the calculation results are compared with the results of direct numerical simulation or a semi-analytical profile in terms of streamwise velocity, resolved Reynolds shear, and normal stress profiles. The proposed model is robust and accurate, yielding highly satisfactory results regardless of the angles between the Cartesian grid line and the wall boundary.},

In this article, we develop and analyze an efficient finite difference/generalized Hermite spectral method for the distributed-order time-fractional reaction-diffusion equation on one-, two-, and three-dimensional unbounded domains . Considering the Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule for the distributed integral term in temporal direction, we first approximate the original distributed-order time-fractional problem by the multi-term time-fractional differential equation. Then, we apply the L 2- 1 σ 1σ formula for the discretization of the multi-term Caputo fractional derivatives . Moreover, we employ the generalized Hermite functions with scaling factor for the spectral approximation in space. The detailed implementations of the method are presented for one-, two-, and three-dimensional cases of the fractional problem. The stability and convergence of the method are strictly established, which shows that the proposed method is unconditionally stable and convergent with second-order accuracy in time. In addition, the optimal error estimate is derived for the space approximation. Finally, we perform numerical examples to support the theoretical claims.},

An interface method based on alternating direction implicit scheme is used to solve the microscale models. FV-HMM is used to study the tissue penetration efficacy of drug nanoparticles. Numerical experiments are performed with different parameters, and it is concluded that partition phenomenon and particle size are the important factors on tissue penetration efficacy of nanoparticles in drug delivery.

The governing equations are solved using the IMPES (IMplicit Pressure and Explicit Saturation) procedure, where the face fluxes from the pressure equation are approximated by a non-linear two-point flux approximation (NL-TPFA) that guarantees monotone solutions for the absolute pressure field. The scheme is based on the construction of one-sided fluxes on each adjacent cell independently and then, the unique edge flux is built as a linear combination of the one-sided fluxes. In our NL-TPFA finite volume scheme, we use auxiliary variables that are located on the vertices of the primal mesh. The nodal auxiliary unknowns are written as linear combinations of the neighboring cell-centered unknowns reducing our scheme to a fully cell-centered one. To solve the non-linear system of equations and to guarantee monotone solutions for arbitrarily anisotropic permeability tensors, we use the Picard iteration method with the Anderson acceleration technique to improve the computational efficiency. On the other hand, to solve the hyperbolic saturation equation , we propose a modified second-order finite volume method . The basic idea of our method is that the reconstructed saturation on the edge that violates the local Discrete Maximum Principle (DMP) is limited, otherwise, the reconstructed saturation is expressed as a convex combination of its unlimited and limited reconstructed values.},

Here, we propose a recovery type error measure based on a moving least squares fitting of the finite element stress field. The quality of the recovered field is improved by imposing equilibrium conditions and, for singular problems, splitting the stress field into smooth and singular parts . We assess the performance of the error indicator using three problems with exact solution, and we also compared the results with those obtained with standard finite element meshes based on simplexes.

These fluxes have an essential role in specifying the Debye layer and computing the electric current. The WG-MFEM considered here uses discontinuous functions to construct the approximation space. Also, a linearization scheme is employed to treat nonlinear terms. In the proposed method, the important physical laws of mass conservation and free energy dissipation are preserved without any restriction on the time step.

In this paper, a modified multiple-relaxation-time pseudopotential multiphase lattice Boltzmann model is proposed to investigate binary droplet collision with different collision angles. The surface tension can be adjusted independently under the condition of high Reynolds number and large density ratio using this model. Then the model validation is performed by simulating three benchmark cases including stationary droplet, oscillating droplet, and capillary wave instability, respectively. Finally, different regimes of binary droplet collision are presented, and collision features such as liquid filament and satellite droplet are investigated at collision angles of 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, and 150°. The results show that there is no liquid filament or satellite droplet at the collision angle of 30°, yet both of them appear as the angle increases. When the collision angle is 60°, the percentage of satellite droplet to liquid phase reaches 30%, while the proportions are less than 10% at collision angles of 90°, 120°, and 150°. Besides, two break-up mechanisms of “end-pinching” and capillary wave instability are inspected. It is found out that the back-flow phenomena at the joints of droplets and the liquid filament are caused by the “end-pinching” mechanism, which further leads to the capillary wave instability of the liquid filament.},

To solve the arising nonlinear problem , we employ a semismooth Newton method and we prove local convergence properties . The abstract framework is then applied to the discretization of the unilateral contact between two membranes. We propose to discretize this problem with a finite element (FEM), a discontinuous Galerkin (dG), and a hybrid high-order (HHO) methods.

This essentially leads to a bilinear optimal control problem. A rigorous proof of the existence of an optimal control is presented and the first order optimality conditions are derived for solving the control using a variational inequality. Moreover, the second order sufficient conditions are established to characterize the local minimizer. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted utilizing finite elements methods together with nonlinear iterative schemes, to demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of our control design.},

In particular, we address here a linearized version of the model, based on the assumption of small displacements. We consider the mathematical analysis and the numerical approximation of the problem. More precisely, we carry out firstly the well-posedness analysis of the model. Then, we propose a numerical discretization scheme based on finite differences in time and finite elements for the spatial approximation; stability and numerical error estimates are proved. Particular attention is dedicated to the study of the saddle-point structure of the problem, that turns out to be interesting because velocities of the fluid phase and of the solid phase are combined into a single quasi-incompressibility constraint. Our analysis provides guidelines to select the componentwise polynomial degree of approximation of fluid velocity, solid displacement and pressure, to obtain a stable and robust discretization based on Taylor–Hood type finite element spaces. Interestingly, we show how this choice depends on the porosity of the mixture, i.e. the volume fraction of the fluid phase.},

The model aims at capturing increase in stiffness induced by fracture closure during fluid withdrawal. The nonlinear hydro-mechanical formulation is constructed within the framework of the Discrete Fracture Model, with flow and geomechanical sub-systems coupled through a sequential iterative algorithm. The internal contact constraint arising from non-overlapping between opposite fracture faces is enforced through the weak fulfillment of the BB-law. Such a constraint is captured within the framework of the Augmented Lagrangian formulation, where the non-linear mechanical interaction is enforced adopting successive approximations of the Lagrange multiplier, interpreted as the contact pressure in the joint, supplemented by a penalty component associated with the rock stiffness. Furthermore, adopting a traditional flow based upscaling method, macroscopic permeabilities are numerically reconstructed with magnitude strongly dependent on the local stress state. Such a mechanical dependence of the homogenized properties is represented in a discrete manner through pseudo-coupling tables, with enormous potential to be explored within a preprocessing stage in reservoir simulators to compute multipliers relative to a chosen pre-stressed reference state, where input data is available. Numerical simulations are performed for some fracture arrangements illustrating the potential of the formulation proposed herein in bridging hydromechanical coupling at different scales in jointed rocks.},

We employ the operator preconditioning framework and utilize a fractional solver at the interface between the problems to obtain order optimal schemes that are robust with respect to the material parameters, i.e. the permeability, viscosity and Beavers–Joseph–Saffman condition. Our approach is similar to that of Holter et al. (2020), but since the Darcy problem is in primal form, expressing mass conservation at the interface involves the normal derivative, which introduces some mathematical challenges. These challenges will be specifically addressed in this paper, in particular we will employ fractional Laplacians at the interface. Numerical experiments illustrating the performance are provided. The preconditioner is posed in non-standard Sobolev spaces which may be perceived as an obstacle for its use in applications. However, we detail the implementational aspects and show that the preconditioner is quite feasible to realize in practice.},

Key ingredients are the arbitrary degree discontinuous Galerkin time discretization of the primal and dual problems for the Dual Weighted Residual (DWR) approach, an a posteriori error estimation for the transport problem coupled with flow and its implementation in an advanced software architecture. The error estimate allows the separation of the temporal and spatial discretization error contributions which facilitates the simultaneous adjustment of the time and space mesh.

  abstract     = {A posteriori error estimates are constructed for the three-field variational formulation of the Biot problem involving the displacements, the total pressure and the fluid pressure. The discretization under focus is the H 1 ( Ω ) H1(Ω) -conforming Taylor–Hood finite element combination, consisting of polynomial degrees k + 1 k+1 for the displacements and the fluid pressure and k k for the total pressure. An a posteriori error estimator is derived on the basis of H ( div ) H(div) -conforming reconstructions of the stress and flux approximations . The symmetry of the reconstructed stress is allowed to be satisfied only weakly. The reconstructions can be performed locally on a set of vertex patches and lead to a guaranteed upper bound for the error with a constant that depends only on local constants associated with the patches and thus on the shape regularity of the triangulation. Particular emphasis is given to nearly incompressible materials and the error estimates hold uniformly in the incompressible limit . Numerical results on the L-shaped domain confirm the theory and the suitable use of the error estimator in adaptive strategies.},

In the method, the penalty technique is used to facilitate the satisfaction of boundary conditions, and the stabilized moving least squares approximation is used to enhance the stability and performance. The linearized EFG method is a meshless method and possesses high precision and convergence rate in both space and time. Theoretical error and convergence of the linearized EFG method are analyzed.

Nevertheless, when the stress components cross the corners, the principal stresses, which are smoothly dependent on the components of stress tensor , can be smoothly tracked through subspace tracking method. Thus, all the six auxiliary yield functions based on Koiter’s rule will be smooth functions of components of stress. Finally, the corner problems are eliminated. As an application, three boundary–value​ problems (a 3D one-element, a 2D slope with a soft band, and a 3D soil slope) are analyzed to investigate the performance of the proposed method in a non-linear finite element simulation.},

Mass densities of mixture components are used as order parameters. The total Helmholtz free energy incorporates wall free energy providing wetting effects. The model under consideration is preliminary regularized, which allows one to increase time step in explicit time-marching methods. A finite-difference semi-discrete method is proposed and a discrete counterpart of the dissipativity theorem is proven. All the statements remain valid in the absence of regularization as well. 3D simulations of two-phase two-component and three-phase three-component fluids using explicit Euler method are performed.

  abstract     = {The empirical observations show that the constant elasticity of variance (CEV) model is a practical approach to capture the implied volatility smile phenomenon. Also, due to the appearance of long-range dependence (or long memory effect) in stock returns or volatility, the fractional Black–Scholes models became particularly important in finance. We will generalize the CEV model to a fractional-CEV model with Jumarie’s fractional model (Jumarie, 2008) to capture the long memory effect in addition to show the negative relationship between stock price and its return volatility. The asset price dynamics of this model follows from a fractional stochastic differential equation, and its volatility is a function of the underlying asset price. We derive the fractional Black–Scholes equation by using the It o ˆ oˆ Lemma and fractional Taylor’s series. Previously, Jumarie’s model was used to determine the value of European and American options . In this study, given the importance of the barrier option, we use the proposed model for pricing a European double barrier option. Since most fractional PDEs do not have closed-form analytical solutions, we solve the option pricing problem numerically. Then, we investigate the stability and convergence of the proposed scheme by applying the Fourier analysis . Finally, some numerical results are given in the last section by computing the European double barrier option.},

To be specific, first, transformation of the undamped sine–Gordon system into an equivalent new system is made by introducing an improved scalar auxiliary variable (SAV), and generalization of the conservative Crank–Nicolson scheme is made by applying a non-negative family parameter ϑ ϑ to discretize time-dependent variables at the time step ( n + ϑ ) (n+ϑ) instead of just ( n + 1 ∕ 2 ) (n+1∕2) , thereby to establish a family of second-order conservative semi-discrete schemes. Further, based on the advantages of the improved SAV method, not only does the newly introduced scalar auxiliary variable be uncoupled with the original variables at the discrete level, it also requires the family of approximations , at each time step, no more efforts than the solution of a second-order linear differential equation of elliptic type with constant coefficients , making the computational cost of this method only half of the original one, which thus is particularly effective. Finally, several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency, stability, accuracy and energy conservation of the family of schemes developed herein.},

This scheme is proved to be stable conditionally in energy norm. It is confirmed that the error convergent rate is O ( τ 2 + h r ) O(τ2+hr) by splitting the proof into three parts, where τ τ is the time step, h h is the mesh size and r r is the maximum total degree of polynomials in finite element spaces.

  abstract     = {The eigenvalue buckling responses of smart carbon nanotube-reinforced hybrid composite shell structure are analyzed under the influence of uniform thermal loading using a multiscale material model. The hybrid nanotube shell structural model is formulated mathematically via a cubic-order shear deformation theory introducing the material nonlinearity due to the shape memory alloy fiber. Additionally, the nanotube-reinforced composite properties are evaluated via two material modeling techniques (Mori–Tanaka technique and rule of mixture) considering the variable scale effect due to hybridization. The final form of the eigenvalue buckling equation is obtained via Hamilton’s principle (a dynamic version of the variational technique) including the temperature-dependent properties and thermal loading. The structural model is derived considering the distortion due to the in-plane thermal loading via the generic type of strain kinematics, i.e. Green–Lagrange nonlinearity . The thermal load values are predicted further by solving the derived eigenvalue equation using a nine-node isoparametric quadrilateral element from the finite element technique . The novelty of this research is that first time the shape memory alloy type functional material has been introduced with nanotube-reinforced composite shell structure to highlight the shape memory effect on the improvement of thermal buckling temperature . The derived numerical model is engaged further to solve varieties of examples for comprehensive testing (accuracy and reliability). Finally, a series of parametric analyzes has been performed for different design considerations associated with geometry as well as the material to show the model applicability.},

For that, we determine the projected linearized system onto an invariant subspace (including the unstable subspace), and we determine a feedback control law stabilizing this projected system, by solving a Riccati equation , of small dimension, associated with this system. The degrees of stabilizability of the different real generalized eigenspaces of the control system are used to determine the invariant subspace on which the linearized system is projected.

The linear equations on coarse grid are recursively solved by a two-level grid. The single sparse matrix having higher filling rate is decomposed into a set of sparse matrices with much lower filling rate. Subsequent theoretical analysis and examples demonstrate that the total storage space of sparse matrices is significantly reduced, yet efficiency of the algorithm is almost unaffected. The fast multipole method is applied to expedite the matrix–vector multiplications. Complexity analysis demonstrates the algorithm has O ( N ) operation efficiency and storage complexity for three-dimensional potential model. A potential example with 10 million degrees of freedom is accurately computed via a single laptop with 16GB RAM .

Desired modifications can be stably derived using a one-dimensional reconstruction scheme along grid line directions. Eligible grid points and corresponding stencils for reconstruction are determined as grid-IB relationship is described using a grid line-based algorithm. The present method is globally second-order accurate in space and time. For the laminar flow around a circular cylinder, perfect agreement with benchmark numerical studies conducted on body conformal grids is achieved. A strictly linear relationship between the separation bubble length and the Reynolds number within the steady flow regime is reported.

The set of double splittings used in each ADS scheme induces a preconditioned system which helps in showing the convergence of the ADS schemes. We also show that the classes of matrices for which one ADS scheme is better than the other, are mutually exclusive. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed ADS schemes have several computational advantages over the existing methods.

This involves a Petrov–Galerkin formulation by which the mass flux test functions are evaluated at downstream locations along velocity characteristics . As for the original mixed mimetic spectral element advection operator, the upwinded mass flux advection operator is conservative, however unlike the original advection operator, which is purely hyperbolic, the upwinded advection operator adds dissipation which is biased towards high wave numbers. The upwinded advection operator also removes the spectral gaps present in the dispersion relation for the original advection operator. As for the original advection operator, a material form advection operator may be constructed by similarly downwinding the trial functions of the tracer gradients. Both methods allow for the recovery of exact energy conservation for an incompressible flow field via skew-symmetric formulations. However these skew-symmetric formulations are once again purely hyperbolic operators which do not suppress oscillations. The scheme is implemented within a shallow water code on the sphere in order to diagnose and interpolate the potential vorticity. In the absence of other dissipation terms , it is shown to yield more coherent results for a standard test case of barotropic instability.},

To understand the still challenging multidimensional separation mechanism, we develop a novel method to simulate magnetic nanoparticles’ behavior in a magnetized chromatographic column based on a lattice Boltzmann method. In contrast to conventional numerical studies, the Euler–Euler approach is applied by utilizing the advection–diffusion equation to describe the particle component. As a result, the consideration of the magnetic force, the drag force, and a realistic diffusion are possible. Also, enormous computational costs are saved. We show that the column can be modeled from a combination of two unit cells, and a separation effect can be detected even with small magnetic fields. Furthermore, we compare the numerical results to practical experiments. Both results are in good accordance. We additionally determine potential improvements. Besides improving the setup by using stronger magnetic fields, the structure of the column’s matrix plays an important role. Thus, we find that higher porosity leads to higher retention times.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a mathematical model for the invasion of host tissue by tumor cells in a d d -dimensional bounded domain, d ≤ 3 d≤3 . This model consists of a system of differential equations describing the evolution of cancer cell density, the extracellular matrix protein density and the matrix degrading enzyme concentration. We develop two fully discrete schemes for approximating the solutions based on a semi-implicit Euler discretization in time and Finite Element (FE) discretization on space (restricted to triangularization made up of right-angled simplices) of two equivalent systems. For the first numerical scheme, we use a splitting technique to deal with the haptotaxis term, leading to introduce an equivalent system with a new variable given by the gradient of extracellular matrix. This scheme is well-posed and preserves the non-negativity of extracellular matrix and the degrading enzyme. We analyze error estimates and convergence towards regular solutions. The second numerical scheme is based on an equivalent formulation in which the cancer cell density equation is expressed in divergence form through a suitable change of variables. This second numerical scheme preserves the non-negativity of all the discrete variables. Finally, we present some numerical simulations in agreement with the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the localized Trefftz method (LTM) is proposed to accurately and efficiently solve two-dimensional boundary value problems , governed by Laplace and biharmonic equations , in complex domains. The LTM is formed by combining the classical indirect Trefftz method and the localization approach, so the LTM, free from mesh and numerical quadrature, has great potential for solving large-scale problems. For problems in multiply-connected domains, the solutions expressions in the proposed LTM is much simpler and more compact than that in the conventional indirect Trefftz method due to the localization concept and the overlapping subdomains . In the proposed LTM, both of the interior nodes and boundary nodes are required and the algebraic equation at each node, represents the satisfaction of governing equation or boundary condition, can be derived by implementing the Trefftz method at every subdomain. By enforcing the satisfaction of governing equations at every interior node and of boundary conditions at every boundary node, a sparse system of linear algebraic equations can be yielded. Then, the numerical solution of the proposed LTM can be efficiently obtained by solving the sparse system. Several numerical examples in simply-connected and multiply-connected domains are provided to demonstrate the accuracy and simplicity of the proposed LTM. Besides, the extremely-accurate solutions of the LTM are simultaneously demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes the development of the Method of Regularized Sources for potential flow problems. It is based on the modification of the fundamental solution near the source point by replacing the singularity with a blob in form of a steep rational function. This allows to solve the problems in the same way as with Method of Fundamental Solutions , however without an artificial boundary. Method of Regularized Sources gives excellent results for Dirichlet boundary conditions , however it fails for Neumann boundary conditions . To overcome this problem are the source point positions on the segments of the boundary with Neumann boundary positions placed close to the collocation points . This approach somehow represents a blending of the Method of Regularized Sources and the classical Method of Fundamental Solutions. The novel approach is characterized by two free parameters; the blob thickness and the artificial boundary displacement position. A two-dimensional numerical example of potential flow around circle is analyzed in detail regarding these two free parameters. The modified Method of Regularized Sources gives even more accurate results for potential and derivatives than the Method of Fundamental Solutions. The source point can be placed 2–25 times closer to the boundary collocation points than with the classical Method of Fundamental Solutions and thus reduces the problem of the placement of the artificial boundary.},

The program is written in Python. A simple method for tracking fully non-linear free surface is implemented, and the physical boundaries are updated with time. The numerical results agree very well with existing results in both resonance and off-resonance cases.

Because of that, the placement of the source points differs from the classical distribution of the source points for boundary values problems.

The use of fundamental solutions with different frequencies allowed the extension of the MFS to non-homogeneous PDEs, in particular, for Poisson or Helmholtz equations and for elastostatic or elastodynamic problems. This method has been called method of fundamental solutions for domains (MFS-D), but it faces an approximation problem when the non-homogeneous term presents discontinuities, because the fundamental solutions are analytic functions outside the source point set. In this paper we analyze two domain decomposition techniques for overcoming this approximation problem. The problem is set in the context of the modified Helmholtz equation, and we also establish the missing density results that justify both the MFS and the MFS-D approximations.

Using micro-stream with gases such as argon or nitrogen allows the cooling of the coating immediately after spraying, and thereby reducing the time of transition during the injection of each layer. As a result of the process, the fine dispersive structure of coatings is obtained in a shorter amount of time when compared with the classical high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) process. The parameters of the process and the type of stream equipment determine the quality of the obtained structure and thermal stress in the coating. The relationship between the selected parameters of the HM method and the properties of coatings are presented. The parameters were confirmed by the Fundamental Methods of Solutions . The presented technology should be adapted to the actual production of the protective coating for machines and construction working in condition of wear. A computer simulation , made by using MFS, has been performed for heat transfer in layers of coatings. During the numerical experiment it was found the distance between micro-jet device and the sprayed surface for the HM spraying method allowing to obtain the 0.4 s time of cooling process. The experimental investigation showed that, the cooling faster than 0.2 s could provoke the cracks in the obtained structure and the time above 0.5 sec is not effective enough.},

Our methodology for limiting volume terms is similar to recently proposed methods for continuous Galerkin approximations , while DG flux terms require novel stabilization techniques. Piecewise Bernstein polynomials are employed as shape functions for the DG spaces, thus facilitating the use of very high order spatial approximations. We discuss the design of a new, provably invariant domain preserving DG scheme that is then extended by state-of-the-art subcell flux limiters to obtain a high-order bound preserving approximation. The limiting procedures can be formulated in the semi-discrete setting. Thus convergence to steady state solutions is not inhibited by the algorithm. We present numerical results for a variety of benchmark problems. Conservation laws considered in this study are linear and nonlinear scalar problems, as well as the Euler equations of gas dynamics and the shallow water system.},

By relying on the Cauchy formula, the Cauchy-Goursat theorem, and on-curve Taylor interpolations of the input density, the proposed methodology allows to recast the Cauchy and associated integral operators as smooth contour integrals. As such, they can be accurately evaluated everywhere in the complex plane—including at problematic points near and on the contour—by means of elementary quadrature rules. Applications of the technique to the evaluation of the Laplace layer potentials and related integral operators, as well as to the computation conformal mappings, are examined in detail. The former application, in particular, amounts to a significant improvement over the recently introduced harmonic density interpolation method. Spectrally accurate discretization approaches for smooth and piecewise smooth contours are presented. A variety of numerical examples, including the solution of weakly singular and hypersingular Laplace boundary integral equations, and the evaluation of challenging conformal mappings, demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the density interpolation method in this context.},

  abstract     = {Splitter plates attached to a cylinder looking like hair (SPCH) is one of the self-adaptive devices used to control actual flow conditions, which in turn interact with Aeolian tones constituting a typical case of study in engineering industries. The direct numerical simulation of the sound waves stimulated by such devices is a complicated task due to the small levels of sound pressure and the time-consuming existing solvers. However, the Cumulant Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) provides stability and robustness at high Reynolds numbers and carries out these simulations satisfactorily. First, the fundamental acoustical properties of the Cumulant LBM are studied in this paper. Propagation of point and planar acoustic waves is considered including the temporal decay of a standing plane wave, the spatial decay of a planar acoustic pulse, and the propagation of spherical waves. Then, the Cumulant LBM as a fluid flow solver is coupled with a Finite Element structural mechanics solver to predict the effects of SPCH on the noise generated by cylinders at high Reynolds numbers as a practical fluid structure interaction (FSI) application. The spectral modification and possible acoustic damping impact of such flaps, plus the sound propagation from one and two circular cylinders are studied. A comparison of the theoretical and numerical results shows a reasonable capability of the Cumulant LBM to predict acoustical events with small errors in dissipation and dispersion. Furthermore, the results show that SPCH alter the phase of the vortex shedding cycle and decrease the transversal distance from the center line of the shed vortices. Flaps, thus, control the wake generated past a cylinder and have an effective impact on decreasing sound generation.},

  abstract     = {A novel fast multipole boundary element method (FM-BEM) is proposed to analyze 2-D potential problems by using linear and three-node quadratic elements . In FM-BEM, fast multipole expansions are used for the integrals on elements which are far away from the source point , whereas direct evaluations are used for the integrals on elements which are close to the source point. The use of higher-order elements results in more complex forms of the integrands , which increases the burden in direct evaluations, especially for singular and nearly singular integrals . Herein, the complex notation is introduced to simplify the computational formulations in boundary integral equations for 2-D potential problems. The singular and nearly singular integrals on linear elements are calculated by the analytic formulas, and those on three-node quadratic elements are evaluated by a robust semi-analytical algorithm. Numerical examples show that the proposed FM-BEM possesses higher accuracy than the conventional FM-BEM. Besides, the present method can analyze thin structures and evaluate accurately the physical quantities at interior points much closer to the boundary.},

  abstract     = {We propose a non-intrusive reduced-order modeling method for space–time-dependent parameterized problems in the context of uncertainty quantification . In the offline stage, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to extract the spatial modes based on a set of high-fidelity time-parameter-dependent snapshots and then to extract the temporal modes of the projection coefficients of the spatial modes. Finally, parameter-dependent combination coefficients are approximated using polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs). Cubic spline interpolation is used to evaluate the temporal modes at any other given time. In the online stage, a fast evaluation is provided at any given time and parameter by simply estimating the values of the polynomials and temporal modes. To validate the numerical performance of the proposed method, three time-dependent parameterized problems are tested: a one-dimensional (1-D) forced Burger’s equation with a random force term, a 1-D diffusion–reaction equation with a random field force term, and a two-dimensional incompressible fluid flow over a cylinder with a random inflow boundary condition. The results indicate that the proposed method is able to approximate the full-order model very inexpensively with a reasonable loss of accuracy for problems with uncorrelated or correlated input parameters. Furthermore, the proposed method is effective in estimating low-order moments, indicating that it has great potential for use in uncertainty quantification analysis of space–time-dependent problems.},

The efficacy of the solution technique is showcased with numerous examples of linear acoustics and electromagnetic simulations, including simulations in the high-frequency regime, problems which otherwise would be intractable. Finally, we analyze the one-level preconditioner (smoother) for uniform meshes and we demonstrate that theoretical estimates of the condition number of the preconditioned linear system can be derived based on well established theory for self-adjoint positive definite operators.},

The effect of indoor heating system location has been considered on both particle deposition and convective heat transfer so six different positions have been selected for the heating system. Results are shown for two Rayleigh numbers (10 4 and 10 5 ) and different particle sizes (1 μ μ m and 10 μ μ m). To study the particle motion, after the flow reaches steady state, 50 000 particles are randomly injected to the room and the number of deposited particles on the walls has been reported for 100 s. Considering the present results, when the heating system is in the middle of the wall, the maximum heat transfer rate is seen for both Rayleigh numbers . Also, the number of deposited 1 μ μ m particles on the walls for all locations of the heating system is zero for R a Ra = = 10 4 , so the number of suspended particles is the maximum. For both Rayleigh numbers and 10 μ μ m particles, the number of deposited particles is maximum when the heating system is fixed on the top of the wall.

To examine various inlets and their relation to the axis-switching flow, an inflow generator is newly devised, wherein jet flows from an orifice plate and a long pipe nozzle can be realized. Depending on the inlet conditions, the 45° and 90° axis-switching phenomena for the rectangular jet are observed to appear differently. As the aspect ratio increases and jet temperature decreases, the axis-switching positions are delayed downstream. It is observed that the strong and weak states of the axis-switching flows can be interpreted by the crossover locations of the jet half-widths and the saddle-shaped velocity profile is not the only main factor for axis-switching flow. As the jet temperature increases, a well-mixed state is quickly obtained, and the mixing performance of the square jet is better than that of the rectangular jet. For both isothermal and heated jets, the flow mixing is improved by the axis-switching flow. Various analyses are attempted to find the specific inlet structure for the axis-switching flow. From the results, the special features for inflow criterion producing axis-switching flow can be explained by factors such as the deformation parameter, interrelations between shear strain and normal rates, turbulence-driven and geometry-driven streamwise vortices, and normal Reynolds stresses.},

In this paper, we present and test two preconditioning approaches for the discrete problem resulting from the second order finite-difference discretization of this equation. The first approach combines shifted-Laplacian preconditioner with inversion of a separable matrix, corresponding to the horizontally-layered velocity model, using fast Fourier based transforms. The second approach is novel and involves a special transformation resulting in a preconditioner with a contraction operator (CO preconditioner). The two approaches have near the same arithmetical complexity; however, the second approach, developed in this paper, provides a faster convergence of an iterative solver as illustrated by numerical experiments and analysis of the spectral properties of the preconditioned matrices. Our numerical experiments involve parallel modeling of highly heterogeneous lossy and lossless media at different frequencies. We show that the CO-based solver can tackle problems with hundreds of millions of unknowns on a conventional cluster node. The CO preconditioned solver demonstrates a very moderate increase of iteration count with the frequency. We have conducted a comparison of the performance of the developed method versus open-source parallel sweeping preconditioner. The results indicate that, the CO solver is several times faster with respect to the wall-clock time and consumes substantially less memory than the code based on the sweeping preconditioner at least in the example we tested.},

We firstly present a fully discrete IPDGFE formulation based on the modified Crank–Nicolson scheme and a mid-point approximation of the potential term f ( u ) f(u) . We then derive the energy-stability and the second-order-in-time error estimates for the proposed IPDGFE method under some regularity assumptions on the initial function u 0 u0 . There are two key works in our paper. One is to establish a second-order-in-time and energy-stable IPDGFE scheme. The other is to use a discrete spectrum estimate to handle the midpoint of the discrete solutions u m um and u m + 1 um+1 in the nonlinear term , instead of using the standard Gronwall inequality technique, so we obtain that all our error bounds depend on the reciprocal of the perturbation parameter ϵ ϵ only in some lower polynomial order , instead of exponential order . As a nontrivial byproduct of our paper, we also analyze the convergence of the zero-level sets of fully discrete IPDGFE solutions to the curvature-driven geometric flow . Finally, numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the good performance of our presented IPDGFE method, including the time and space error estimates of the discrete solutions, discrete energy-stability, and the convergence of numerical interfaces governed by the curvature-driven geometric flow in the classical motion and generalized motion.},

Some numerical experiments are given as demonstrations of the ability of numerical implementation of our regularization.},

Classically, boundary conditions (BC) are enforced strongly in RBF methods. By now it is well-known that this can lead to stability problems, however. Here, we follow a different path and propose two novel RBF approaches which are based on a weak enforcement of BCs. By using the concept of flux reconstruction and simultaneous approximation terms (SATs), respectively, we are able to prove that both new RBF schemes are strongly (energy) stable.

It consists of a system of nonlinear parabolic equations , where the unknowns are the average density of cells (or organisms), which is a conserved variable, and the average density of chemoattractant. The numerical proposal is made up of a crude finite element method together with a mass lumping technique and a semi-implicit Euler time integration. The resulting scheme turns out to be linear and decouples the computation of variables. The approximate solutions keep lower bounds – positivity for the cell density and nonnegativity for the chemoattractant density–, are bounded in the L 1 ( Ω ) L1(Ω) -norm, satisfy a discrete energy law, and have a priori energy estimates. The latter is achieved by means of a discrete Moser–Trudinger inequality. As far as we know, our numerical method is the first one that can be encountered in the literature dealing with all of the previously mentioned properties at the same time. Furthermore, some numerical examples are carried out to support and complement the theoretical results.},

We study the two-scale homogenized mixed problems which are obtained in the limit where the microscopic scale tends to zero. These limiting problems are posed in a high dimensional tensorized product domain. Using sparse tensor product finite elements, we solve these problems with essentially optimal complexity to obtain an approximation for the solution within a prescribed accuracy. This is achieved when the solutions of the high dimensional two-scale homogenized mixed problems possess sufficient regularity with respect to both the slow and the fast variable at the same time. We show that this regularity requirement holds when the two-scale coefficient and the forcing satisfy mild smoothness conditions. From the finite element solutions for the two-scale homogenized mixed problems, we construct numerical correctors for the solutions of the original two-scale mixed problems. We prove an error estimate for these correctors in terms of both the homogenization error and the finite element error. Numerical examples confirm the theoretical results.},

Our model is based on the time-harmonic Maxwell equations, and it incorporates both amplification via an active dopant and thermal effects via coupling with the heat equation. As a full vectorial finite element simulation, this model distinguishes itself from other fiber amplifier models that are typically posed as an initial value problem and make significantly more approximations. Our model supports co-, counter-, and bi-directional pumping configurations, as well as inhomogeneous and anisotropic material properties. The long-term goal of this modeling effort is to study nonlinear phenomena that prohibit achieving unprecedented power levels in fiber amplifiers, along with validating typical approximations used in lower-fidelity models. The high-fidelity simulation comes at the cost of a high-order finite element discretization with many degrees of freedom per wavelength. This is necessary to counter the effect of numerical pollution due to the high-frequency nature of the wave simulation. To make the computation more feasible, we have developed a novel longitudinal model rescaling, using artificial material parameters with the goal of preserving certain quantities of interest. Our numerical tests demonstrate the applicability and utility of this scaled model in the simulation of an ytterbium-doped, step-index fiber amplifier that experiences laser amplification and heating. We present numerical results for the nonlinear coupled Maxwell/heat model with up to 240 wavelengths.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {In this paper we propose and analyze a fully-mixed finite element method for the steady-state model of fluidized beds . This numerical technique , which arises from the use of a dual-mixed approach in each phase, is motivated by a methodology previously applied to the stationary Navier–Stokes equations and related models. More precisely, we modify the stress tensors of the fluid and solid phases by defining pseudostresses as phasic stresses that include shear, pressure, and convective effects . Next, we eliminate the pressures from the equations and derive constitutive relations depending only on the aforementioned pseudostresses and the velocities of the fluid and the particles. In this way, these variables, together with the skew-symmetric parts of the velocity gradients , also named vorticities, become the only unknowns of our variational formulation . As usual, the latter is obtained by testing against suitable functions, and then integrating and integrating by parts, respectively, the equilibrium and the constitutive equations. The particle pressure, a known function of the concentration, is given as a datum, and the fluid pressure is computed afterwards via a postprocessing formula. The continuous setting, lying in a Banach spaces framework rather than in a Hilbertian one, is rewritten as an equivalent fixed-point equation, and hence the well-posedness analysis is carried out by combining the Babu s ˇ sˇ ka–Brezzi theory, the Banach–Ne c ˇ cˇ as–Babu s ˇ sˇ ka Theorem, and the classical Banach fixed-point Theorem. Thus, existence of a unique solution in a closed ball is guaranteed for sufficiently small data. In turn, the associated Galerkin scheme is introduced and analyzed analogously, so that, under suitable assumptions on generic finite element subspaces, and for sufficiently small data as well, the Brouwer and Banach fixed-point Theorems allow to conclude existence and uniqueness of solution, respectively. Specific finite element subspaces satisfying the required hypotheses are described, and optimal a priori error estimates are derived. Finally, several numerical examples illustrating the performance of the method and confirming the theoretical rates of convergence , are reported.},

A locally increased density of receptors at the time of contact between the cell and the virus is necessary in this case. The virus is considered as a substrate with fixed receptors on its surface, whereas the receptors of the host cell are free to move over its membrane, allowing a local change in their concentration. In the contact zone the membrane inflects and forms an envelope around the virus. The created vesicle imports its cargo into the cell. This paper assumes the diffusion equation accompanied by boundary conditions requiring the conservation of binders to describe the process. Moreover, it introduces a condition defining the energy balance at the front of the adhesion zone. The latter yields the upper limit for the size of virus which can be engulfed by the cell membrane. The described moving boundary problem in terms of the binder density and the velocity of the adhesion front is well posed and numerically solved by using the finite difference method . The illustrative examples have been chosen to show the influence of the process parameters on the initiation and the duration of the process.},

  abstract     = {We propose a non-iterative monolithic projection-based method to examine the nonlinear dynamics of time-dependent chemotaxis-driven bioconvection problems. In the proposed method, all the terms are advanced using the Crank–Nicolson scheme in time along with the second-order central difference in space. Linearizations, approximate block lower–upper decompositions, and an approximate factorization technique are adopted to improve the computational efficiency while preserving the second-order temporal accuracy. We perform numerical simulations of quasi-homogeneous bioconvection, two-dimensional forced chemotaxis bioconvection, and two-dimensional chemotaxis-driven bioconvection to test the numerical performance of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method provides predictions that are in good agreement with those in previous works. Moreover, it preserves the second-order accuracy in time, significantly reduces the time-step limitation, and improves the computational efficiency. Finally, the proposed method is employed to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of chemotaxis-driven bioconvection problems with varying characteristic bacterial concentration and chamber depth. Four regimes were classified based on the fluid and bacterial motions: stable shallow-chamber, unstable shallow-chamber, unstable deep-chamber, and chaotic deep-chamber flows. We show the formation and merging of falling plumes and their surrounding fluid motion under random initial conditions as well as their convergence toward stationary or chaotic bacterial plumes. To track the dynamical regimes over the entire considered domain, we designed normalized variance and kurtosis, which reflect formation and merging of plumes and intermittency in chaotic cases, respectively. A posterior classification, which provides a rough outline of the characteristic features of the different regimes, was also carried out.},

Firstly, a series of subdomains corresponding to every nodes can be searched based on the Euclidean distance between nodes. To each subdomain, a small linear system can be yielded by using the non-singular general solutions of Helmholtz-type equations. Secondly, the unknown variables at every nodes can be explicitly expressed by the function values at their corresponding supporting nodes. Finally, a large sparse system of linear equations is formed and solved to obtain the numerical solutions of physical quantities at every nodes. The proposed LNKM is mathematically simple, numerically accurate, and more applicable to the large-scale computation. Four numerical examples conform its effectiveness and accuracy for the large-scale computation of Helmholtz-type equations in complicated geometries.},

The domain decomposition approach allows straightforward implementation for the parallel computation of adaptive meshes which helps to reduce computational time significantly. Results are presented to show the numerical convergence of the domain decomposition solution to the single domain solution.

Enthalpy methods formulate this convection-coupled phase-change problem on a single computational domain. The governing equations can be solved accurately with a monolithic approach using mixed finite elements and Newton’s method. Previously, the monolithic approach has relied on adaptive mesh refinement to regularize local nonlinearities at phase interfaces. This contribution instead separates mesh refinement from nonlinear problem regularization and provides a continuation procedure which robustly obtains accurate solutions on the tested 2D uniform meshes. A flexible and extensible open source implementation is provided. The code is formally verified to accurately solve the governing equations in time and in 2D space, and convergence rates are shown. Two benchmark simulations are presented in detail with comparison to experimental data sets and corresponding results from the literature, one for the melting of octadecane and another for the freezing of water. Sensitivities to key numerical parameters are presented. For the case of freezing water, effective reduction of numerical errors from these key parameters is successfully demonstrated. Two more simulations are briefly presented, one for melting at a higher Rayleigh number and one for melting gallium.},

The proposed scaling parameters are used to limit artificial diffusion operators incorporated into the residual of a high order target scheme to produce accurate and bound-preserving finite element approximations to hyperbolic problems. Due to this stabilization procedure, the occurring system becomes highly nonlinear and the efficient computation of corresponding solutions is a challenging task. The presented regularization approach makes the AFC residual twice continuously differentiable so that Newton’s method converges quadratically for sufficiently good initial guesses . Furthermore, the performance of each nonlinear iteration is improved by expressing the Jacobian as the sum and product of matrices having the same sparsity pattern as the Galerkin system matrix . Eventually, the AFC methodology constructed is validated numerically by applying it to several numerical benchmarks.},

Based on the Scalar Auxiliary Variable (SAV) approach, we construct these schemes by splitting the FCH free energy in a novel and ingenious way. Utilizing the Crank–Nicolson formula, we firstly construct two semi-discrete second-order numerical schemes , which we denote by CN-SAV and CN-SAV-A, respectively. To be more specific, the CN-SAV scheme is constructed based on the fixed time step, while the CN-SAV-A scheme is a variable time step scheme. The BDF2-SAV scheme is another second-order scheme in which the fixed time step should be used. It is designed by applying the second-order backward difference (BDF2) formula. All the constructed schemes are proved to be unconditionally energy stable and uniquely solvable in theory. To the best of our knowledge, the CN-SAV-A scheme is the first unconditionally energy stable, second-order scheme with variable time steps for the FCH gradient flow equation. In addition, an effective adaptive time selection strategy introduced in Christlieb et al., (2014) is slightly modified and then adopted to select the time step for the CN-SAV-A scheme. Finally, several numerical experiments based on the Fourier pseudo-spectral method are carried out in two and three dimensions , respectively, to confirm the numerical accuracy and efficiency of the constructed schemes.},

The formulation is based on higher-order shear deformation theory (HSDT), which is guaranteed by p p -order nonuniform rational B-splines (NURBS) resulting in C p − 1 Cp−1 continuity in the domain. The governing equations of motion are derived from Hamilton’s principle. The generalized multi-axial Maxwell model is used to express the viscoelastic constitutive equations in global coordinates . The performance of developed approach is demonstrated through several numerical examples . We show that our approach yields more realistic solutions than conventional FEA , especially for coarse discretizations . We find that C 3 C3 -NURBS provide higher accuracy concerning the nonlinear vibration amplitude than C 2 C2 -NURBS. Viscoelastic plates have several active vibration modes adjacent to the fundamental oscillation mode due to the combination of long-time creep and short-time shear moduli . Furthermore, the resultant creep strain leads to large deformations of viscoelastic plates and intensifies the dynamic stress concentration factors . The creep deflection of the plates rapidly increases with damping under sustained loads when the support restrains are released. We observe that the long-time stress-to-thickness ratio is constant for various slenderness ratios , which is relevant during creep.},

For comparison, simulations with the Euler equations are also performed. The numerical setup aims to mimic an array of laminar flames ignited at different spark times, artificially inducing chemical activity to stimulate the coupling between the gas dynamics and the chemical energy release for the deflagration-to-detonation transition. The interaction of the weak shock with the first cylindrical flame demonstrates a very good agreement with the results in the literature and that a single weak shock–flame interaction is insufficient to cause a prompt DDT. However, a high degree of Richtmyer–Meshkov instabilities induced by repetitive shock–flame and shock–boundary interactions generate turbulence that accelerates the flame surface, referred to as the flame brush, until eventually a hot spot ignition in the unreacted material develops into a multi-headed detonation wave. In the absence of physical diffusion in the Euler simulation, the enhanced burning rate of the turbulent flame brush is suppressed. Nevertheless, the intense flow fluctuations generated by the interactions of shocks, boundary and flames create the conditions under which a deflagration-to-detonation transition can potentially occur at later times. A parametric study is also reported in this paper to assess the influence of various physical parameters on the transition event and to explore scaling relationships among these parameters.},

A liquid mean velocity difference of 8.45% is found between the experimental and numerical results, thus validating the CFD model. Shadowgraphy is applied successfully to validate the biogas phase velocity and bubble size. Based on the hydrodynamic analysis results, the reactor can be divided into four regions, according to its mixing conditions. For the flow rates studied, minimal solids washout is observed. In the present research, only 0.02% of the volume are dead zones within the reactor, which indicates good mixing conditions. The reactor shows a recirculation stream at the centre that has an important role in relation to the mixing conditions. The validated model can be used for further studies on the optimisation of UASB reactors.},

The governing boundary layer equations are made dimensionless and then transformed into suitable form by introducing the non-similarity transformations. The reduced system of parabolic partial differential equations is integrated numerically along the vertical plate by using an implicit finite difference Keller-box method. The features of fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics for various values of micropolar or material parameter, K , conjugate parameter, B , and thermal radiation parameter, Rd , are analyzed and presented graphically. Results are presented for the local skin friction coefficient, heat transfer rate and couple stress coefficient for high Prandtl number. It is found that skin friction coefficient and couple stress coefficient reduces whereas heat transfer rate enhances when the micro-inertia parameter increases. All the physical quantities get augmented with thermal radiation.},

In order to treat the motion of the domain the system of equations are written in the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian. The structure motion is governed by a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations, where two degrees of freedom for the rotation and the vertical translation are used.

  abstract     = {This study presents a robust, sharp interface immersed boundary (IBM) framework for moving body problems. The in-house solver makes use of a density-based finite volume framework for solving unsteady, 3D Favre averaged Navier Stokes equation in a generalized curvilinear coordinate system. The immersed boundary formulation is capable of handling arbitrarily complex three-dimensional bodies. The sharp interface approach allows for the exact imposition of boundary conditions at the immersed surface by reconstructing the flow field along its local normal. The implemented reconstruction schemes maintain second-order accuracy. The study focuses on issues of mass conservation and spurious temporal oscillations (pressure as well as force) that the sharp interface IBM approach typically faces when encountering moving body problems. A ghost node-based field extension technique provides an efficient way to improve mass conservation and as a result, reduces not only spurious oscillations but also increases temporal accuracy. Flow past both bluff body (triangular, circular and spherical), as well as streamlined body (airfoil), is presented here as validation studies. The ability of the present formulation to deal with moving body problems in the laminar incompressible flow regime is demonstrated by presenting cases that involve motions such as pitching and in-line oscillation. The predictions are found to be in good agreement with the published results and measurements as well.},

The biofilm around the anode is a mixed culture dominated by Geobacter sulfurreducens and is treated as a conductive material. Besides the stationary 3D Navier–Stokes equation for fluid flow and the species balance equation for acetate in the water and in the biofilm, the model includes a model for the species mass fraction of acetate at the boundary between water and biofilm. Furthermore, we added a sink for acetate as well as a source for electrons and a stationary electric potential equation in the biofilm. Using this extended commercial CFD code and a 128 core compute cluster allowed us to explore the impact of different textile carbon fibre based anode configurations on the electrical performance of the anode in a MFC. The results show that the size of the outer surface of the biofilm determines the quantity of the electrical power delivered by the biofilm.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, several active set methods based on classical problems arising in Contact Mechanics are analyzed, namely unilateral/bilateral contact associated with  Tresca’s/Coulomb’s law of friction in small and large deformation . The purpose of this work is to extend an Inexact Primal–Dual Active Set (IPDAS) method already used in Hueber et al. (2008) to the formalism of dynamics and hyper-elasticity. This method permits to solve the unilateral problem with Coulomb’s law of friction by taking into account an alternative for the latter based on the approximation of the Coulomb’s law by a succession of states of Tresca friction in which the friction threshold is fixed at each fixed point iteration. The mechanical formulation in the hyper-elasticity framework is first presented, next, we establish weak formulations of the different cases of frictional contact problems and we give the finite element approximation of the problems. Then, we detail the numerical treatment within the framework of the primal–dual active set strategy for different frictional contact conditions. We finally provide some numerical experiments to bring into light the efficiency of the IPDAS method and to carry out a comparison with the augmented Lagrangian method by considering representative contact problems in both small and large deformation cases.},

The model used the enthalpy-based method and double distribution functions for the velocity and temperature fields to solve the ice melting problem. The average road surface temperatures and melting conditions (melting ratio and mass) as affected by ice thickness (3 ∼ ∼ 20 mm), pipe spacing (80 ∼ ∼ 240 mm), and air temperature (252 ∼ ∼ 268 K) were detailed, and the parameters were analyzed by the orthogonal test method. The results show that for the ice thickness increasing from 3 mm to 20 mm, the heating rate was slightly increased from 6.3 K/h to 6.45 K/h in the preheating and initial melting stages, and from 1.32 K/h to 2.06 K/h in the rapid melting stage, the melting mass was increased from 360 g/m to 762.06 g/m whereas the melting ratio was decreased from 1.00 to 0.32. The pipe spacing of 120 mm was suitable for the road heating whereas ≥ ≥ 160 mm was not feasible in the severely cold regions. For the air temperature was increased from 252 K to 268 K, the preheating time was decreased from 3.02 h to 0.82 h, the heating rate in the melting stages was increased from 0.68 K/h to 2.94 K/h and the melting ratio was linearly increased. The parameter analysis reveals that the air temperature had the most important influence on the melting ratio whereas the pipe spacing had the most significant impact on the average road surface temperature, and the ice thickness had a slight influence on the melting ratio and average road surface temperature.},

The first objective of the study is to apply different subgrid models to predict the structure of Lambda form shocks system, while the ultimate aim is to obtain further control of the shock behavior. To achieve these goals, the dynamic grid adaption and hybrid initialization techniques are applied under the 3D investigation to reduce numerical errors and computational costs. The results are compared to the existing experimental data and it is found that the WMLES subgrid model results in more accurate predictions when compared to the other subgrid models. Subsequently, the influences of the divergent section length with the constant ratio of the outlet to throat area and, the effects of discontinuity of the wall temperature on the flow physics are investigated. The results indicate that the structure of compressible flow in the duct is affected by varying these parameters. This is then further discussed to provide a deeper physical understanding of the mechanism of Pseudo shock motion.},

In order to solve the numerical model of a micro heat sink , a volume of fluid (VOF) method using open package Gerris Flow Solver (GFS) is employed. Pressure drop, flow velocity, as well as void fraction for all cases are presented and discussed. Based on the results, transient nature of flow is observed even after the first transition phase. Flow mixing as an essential phenomenon in heat transfer is thoroughly discussed. Our study proves that with an increase of pin diameter the flow mixing near micropins is hindered. Moreover, bridge formation in staggered conformation was observed which may reduce the heat transfer. Additionally higher surfaces tension ratio yielded a better flow mixing.},

  abstract     = {The transport of heat and mass from the surface of a cylinder coated with a catalyst and subject to an impinging flow of a Casson rheological fluid is investigated. The cylinder features circumferentially non-uniform transpiration and is embedded inside a homogeneous porous medium. The non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the problem, including Soret and Dufour effects and local thermal non-equilibrium in the porous medium, are considered. Through the introduction of similarity variables, the governing equations are reduced to a set of non-linear ordinary differential equations which are subsequently solved numerically. This results in the prediction of hydrodynamic, temperature, concentration and entropy generation fields, as well as local and average Nusselt, Sherwood and Bejan numbers. It is shown that, for low values of the Casson parameter and thus strong non-Newtonian behaviour, the porous system has a significant tendency towards maintaining local thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, the results show a major reduction in the average Nusselt number during the transition from Newtonian to non-Newtonian fluid, while the reduction in the Sherwood number is less pronounced. It is also demonstrated that flow, thermal and mass transfer irreversibilities are significantly affected by the fluid’s strengthened non-Newtonian characteristics. The physical reasons for these behaviours are discussed by exploring the influence of the Casson parameter and other pertinent factors upon the thickness of thermal and concentration boundary layers. It is noted that this study is the first systematic investigation of the stagnation-point flow of Casson fluid in cylindrical porous media.},

The activation energy has a huge difference between two regions. Diffusion coefficient has a negative power relation with density of water through logarithmic plot. Viscosity of water has effects on diffusion coefficient by a combination with temperature that term 1/T η η has a quadratic relation with diffusion coefficient.

  abstract     = {During a tropical cyclone, windshear can occur at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) owing to interactions between strong winds and the complex topography of the neighboring Lantau Island. For aviation safety, it is crucial to understand how such interactions arise under realistic but controlled meteorological conditions. In this study, we numerically simulate the turbulent airflow over Lantau Island and HKIA using OpenFOAM, an open-source platform for computational fluid dynamics. We use the platform to solve the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations via the finite volume method of discretization. We impose a neutrally stratified atmospheric boundary layer as the upwind condition, which is initialized with a logarithmic velocity profile in three different wind directions: southerly, southeasterly and easterly. For all three directions, we find multiple high-speed ∨ ∨ -shaped jets emanating from the mountain gaps of Lantau Island, giving rise to headwind and crosswind variations along the glide paths of HKIA. However, we find that it is primarily the southerly and southeasterly winds that are the most conducive to windshear. For these two wind directions, we find that windshear is most likely to occur along the glide paths of the two existing runways because these are the closest to Lantau Island itself. The third runway, which is currently under construction, is the least likely to suffer from windshear. By showing how airflow disturbances arise from the complex topography of Lantau Island, this study contributes to safer and more efficient flight operations at HKIA.},

  abstract     = {When gas flows at a high speed in a channel with a variable cross sectional area and high-intensity energy supply, it experiences complicated physical and chemical processes producing high-temperature gas effects. High-temperature gas effects are a key issue related to design and optimization of nozzles of plasmatron of alternating current. The finite volume method is applied to solve unsteady compressible Euler equations with high-temperature gas effects. Solutions of some benchmark test cases are reported, and comparison between computational results of chemically equilibrium and perfect air flowfields is performed. The results of numerical simulation of one-dimensional and two-dimensional under- and over-expanded nozzle flows with a moving region of energy supply are presented. Output nozzle parameters are calculated as functions of a number and time of burning of plasmatron arcs. The results obtained show a qualitative pattern of gas dynamics and thermal processes in the nozzle with unsteady energy supply demonstrating the displacement of the nozzle shock wave towards the nozzle outlet in the over-expanded nozzle flow in comparison to perfect gas flow.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, molecular dynamics (MD) using force fields has become an effective tool for physical and chemical problems. In the MD method, the classical Electronegativity Equalization Method (EEM) is widely accepted for atom charge computing, which may result in unreasonable predictions for large scale non-uniform systems. In order to improve the accuracy of charge computing in MD simulations , two versions of improved EEM for charge distribution calculation are proposed in the present work, without introducing new empirical parameters, namely the locally equilibrated EEM and the sub-zone EEM. The aim of the proposed methods is to eliminate the unreasonable interaction of the long-range charge in large scale non-uniform systems. Comparison between the two improved EEMs and the original EEM in both uniform and non-uniform systems shows that both the improved EEMs successfully eliminate the effect of the unreasonable long-range charge interaction which is inevitably encountered in the original EEM.},

  abstract     = {Studying the effects of trees on airflow and pollutant dispersion in urban street canyons is of considerable significance to clarify the laws of urban micro-scale airflow and pollutant dispersion. To characterize the trees in street canyons, different from the traditional vegetation resistance source method, in this paper, a fine tree model is used for numerical simulations of the airflow and pollutant dispersion in street canyons at varying inflow wind velocities . It is found during the study that the presence of trees physically blocks the airflow in street canyons. The airflow is sheared by the trunk, canopy, or branches, and then circumvents them, especially at a high inflow wind velocity. The low-velocity area in the street canyon distributes to the leeward side of the tree trunk as well as in the canopy area, and a discrete low-velocity distribution exists mainly in the canopy area. The average wind velocity in a street canyon with trees is approximately 39.5% lower at an inflow wind velocity of 1.7 m/s than that in a canyon without trees. In the presence of trees, the pollutant concentration in street canyons increases significantly, and the pollutants significantly accumulate between the tree trunk and the leeward side. With increasing inflow velocity, the pollutant concentration in a street canyon constantly changes but is much higher than that in the absence of trees. At a wind velocity of 5.7 m/s, the average pollutant concentration is 18.6% higher in street canyons with trees than in those without trees.},

  abstract     = {A numerical study about a droplet impacting onto a deep pool is presented here by employing the Volume of Fluid method to track the interface. In this investigation, two open source solvers, named Gerris and Basilisk , are used to solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with free surface . The results are compared to provide some reference for the researchers involved in this research community. Firstly, the capabilities of the two solvers in simulating the droplet impacting problems are validated against available experimental results. And the adaptive mesh refinement techniques used in the two solvers are also found to be applicable. When simulating the drop impacting problems in an axisymmetric coordinate system , it is found that less meshes are produced in Gerris than that in Basilisk when similar adaptive criterion is adopted in both solvers. However, Basilisk still shows much higher computational efficiency due to its great superiority at parallelization , and thus less CPU time is required for such unsteady problems. When simulating moderate Reynolds number impacting problems, the two numerical solvers show perfect agreement ( R e ≤ 5000 Re≤5000 ), however, since higher Reynolds numbers ( R e ≥ 5000 Re≥5000 ) require smaller size of mesh in vicinity of the thin impacting region and the concentrated vortex region, it is hard for Gerris to obtain satisfactory results because of its poor computational efficiency. Thus, with such a high parallel capability and computational efficiency, Basilisk is introduced to solve a large number of cases. It is summarized that the flow pattern of the drop impacting problem can be classified to three categories. They are smooth ejecta sheet, main vortex shedding and Von Kármán vortex street . Each flow pattern relates to the vortex evolution inside the liquid closely. Basililsk also shows its potential in solving much more complicated three-dimensional problems. They cannot be completed by Gerris owing to its poor computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {To investigate the fluid-rigid body interaction issues with free surfaces, a numerical approach has been developed. This algorithm is in an arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian description and Volume of Fluid (VOF) framework, using dynamic unstructured mesh to solve the coupled system. The fluid–solid interface uses partitioned Dirichlet–Neumann iterations with Aitken’s relaxation. For the two-phase fluids part, an interface geometric reconstruction approach has been applied to accurately capture the free surfaces. This piecewise linear interface calculation (PLIC) based method uses Newton’s iteration to efficiently reconstruct interfaces on an unstructured mesh, and applies an un-split scheme to transport variables. The algorithm has been successfully implemented in open source code OpenFOAM®, and was compared with the latter’s built-in solver using interface compression method to deal with free surfaces. Numerical results suggest that our solver has better accuracy on multiphase flow problems, while the previous solver fails to obtain correct interfaces. Moreover, the capacity of accurately solving fluid-rigid body interaction problems with free surfaces has been achieved. Validation cases are provided for fluid–structure interaction problems with and without free surfaces, and results are in accordance with analytical and experimental data from the literature. The algorithm and solver in this paper, can be applied on fluid–structure interaction cases with free surfaces in the future, such as sloshing and water entry problems.},

  abstract     = {We recently developed the open-source library tIGAr, which extends the FEniCS finite element automation framework to isogeometric analysis. The present contribution demonstrates the utility of tIGAr in complex problems by applying it to immersogeometric fluid–structure interaction (FSI) analysis. This application is implemented as the new open-source library CouDALFISh (Coupling, via Dynamic Augmented Lagrangian , of Fluids with Immersed Shells, pronounced “cuttlefish”), which uses the dynamic augmented Lagrangian (DAL) method to couple fluid and shell structure subproblems . The DAL method was introduced previously, over a series of papers largely focused on heart valve FSI, but an open-source implementation making extensive use of automation to compile numerical routines from high-level mathematical descriptions brings newfound transparency and reproducibility to these earlier developments on immersogeometric FSI analysis. The portions of CouDALFISh that do not use code generation also illustrate how a framework like FEniCS remains useful even when some functionality is outside the scope of its standard workflow. This paper summarizes the workings of CouDALFISh and documents a variety of benchmarks demonstrating its accuracy. Although the implementation emphasizes transparency and extensibility over performance, it is nonetheless demonstrated to be sufficient to simulate 3D FSI of an idealized aortic heart valve. Source code will be maintained at https://github.com/david-kamensky/CouDALFISh .},

In this paper, a detailed mathematical analysis is performed to detect the threshold of thermal-diffusive instability in planar counter-flow non-premixed flames using an asymptotic concept. Uniformly-scattered micron-sized lycopodium particles and air are applied as organic fuel and oxidizer, respectively. In order to suggest a basic combustion structure, preheat, vaporization, flame and oxidizer zones are considered. In the first phase of this investigation, time-dependent forms of mass and energy conservation equations are derived considering appropriate boundary and jump conditions. In each of the considered zones, governing equations are solved by Matlab and Mathematica software using perturbation method. To predict the onset of instability, critical values of frequency of the wrinkled flame front, Zeldovich and Lewis numbers are calculated. Eventually, the effects of wave number on the critical Zeldovich and Lewis number are explained. For validation purposes, results of this analysis obtained for critical flow strain rate (corresponding to extinction of the counter-flow non-premixed flame) are compared to those reported in prior studies. Based on the comparisons, proper compatibility is observed between the mathematical results of current study and the data reported in the literature.},

Two types of segregation take place. Initially, radial segregation appears, and then axial segregation occurs. The radial segregation occurs quickly due to percolation, with large particles moving towards the outer layer and forming a shell, while smaller particles remaining in the center and forming a core. Axial segregation is a slow process in which particles segregate into two different patterns and both with three bands. Smaller particles are at the equator and larger particles at two poles (Large–Small–Large, LSL), or vice versa (Small–Large–Small, SLS), depending upon the particles filling level inside the tumbler and/or the rotation speed of the tumbler. The total tangential force between the tumbler wall and the granular particles decreases rapidly as radial segregation occurs and then becomes almost constant as axial segregation occurs. The circulation frequency of the particles is analyzed, and the results show that the average circulation frequency of the smaller particles along the rotation axis is higher than the circulation frequency of the larger particles. Also, the distribution of the average circulation frequency is uneven. The simulations match up well with existing experimental and simulation results. The results are of common interest in applications like process engineering , where polydispersed granular materials are ubiquitous, and drums and tumblers are universally applied.},

The simulation results show that as roughness increases, the separation bubbles generated in the dimple enhance the flow separation but has no significant effect on the drag coefficient. Particle surface-average Nusselt number decreases with an increase of roughness and surface enlargement coefficient due to the isolation effect at low Re and local separation bubbles in the dimple at high Re. Furthermore, the effect of surface enlargement coefficient on heat transfer efficiency factor for supercritical water near the critical point is greater than that under constant property condition and has a higher dependence on Re.},

The black and white photos are transformed into the matrix of 0 and 1, written in the form of the lattice Boltzmann code for solving the momentum, energy, and concentration equations. The results show that the porous media made by grains with sharp corners provide the highest reverse flow. The porous media with grain shapes of rectangular and triangular provide the highest and least pressure drop, respectively. The length of the flame decreases by using the porous media and the star shape has the largest length of the flame, while the rectangular one has the smallest flame length. The shapes of flames obtained for the elliptical and triangular grains are very similar to each other, while, the shape of flame for the star grain is close to the non-porous medium case. In general, using the porous media increases the heat transfer rate from the walls and also creates the fluctuations in the heat transfer along the wall.},

  abstract     = {Due to the complexity of detailed nuclear reactor numerical simulation, especially the complicated geometry and multi-physics coupling properties of the advanced reactor, a nuclear reactor kinetics solver for nuclear reactor engineering and design needs to be developed. Based on the open source C++ software OpenFOAM, this work establishes a neutron transport kinetics solver, namely ntkFoam, for the nuclear reactor kinetics simulation, from the governing equations to the detailed implementations. The coupling between multi-group neutron transport equations and the delayed neutron precursor balance equations are considered with using the finite volume method . By introducing the inverse power method to the OpenFOAM, the k -eigenvalue problems are calculated, and by coupling the neutron transport and delayed neutron precursor calculations using the Euler implicit scheme, the transient kinetics problems are simulated. Numerical results show that the proposed ntkFoam can simulate the multi-group neutron transport kinetics problem accurately and flexibility, and both the regular and irregular mesh configurations can be adopted. This work can provide some new perspectives and foundations to nuclear reactor coupling calculations.},

  abstract     = {This work presents the GPU acceleration of the open-source code CaNS for very fast massively-parallel simulations of canonical fluid flows. The distinct feature of the many-CPU Navier–Stokes solver in CaNS is its fast direct solver for the second-order finite-difference Poisson equation , based on the method of eigenfunction expansions . The solver implements all the boundary conditions valid for this type of problems in a unified framework. Here, we extend the solver for GPU-accelerated clusters using CUDA Fortran . The porting makes extensive use of CUF kernels and has been greatly simplified by the unified memory feature of CUDA Fortran, which handles the data migration between host (CPU) and device (GPU) without defining new arrays in the source code . The overall implementation has been validated against benchmark data for turbulent channel flow and its performance assessed on a NVIDIA DGX-2 system (16 T V100 32Gb, connected with NVLink via NVSwitch). The wall-clock time per time step of the GPU-accelerated implementation is impressively small when compared to its CPU implementation on state-of-the-art many-CPU clusters, as long as the domain partitioning is sufficiently small that the data resides mostly on the GPUs. The implementation has been made freely available and open source under the terms of an MIT license.},

  abstract     = {The Smoothed Finite Element Method (S-FEM) proposed by Liu G.R. can achieve more accurate results than the conventional FEM. Currently, much commercial software and many open-source packages have been developed to analyze various science and engineering problems using the FEM. However, there is little work focusing on designing and developing software or packages for the S-FEM. In this paper, we design and implement an open-source package of the parallel S-FEM for elastic problems by utilizing the Julia language on multi-core CPU. The Julia language is a fast, easy-to-use, and open-source programming language that was originally designed for high-performance computing. We term our package as juSFEM. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, juSFEM is the first package of parallel S-FEM developed with the Julia language. To verify the correctness and evaluate the efficiency of juSFEM, two groups of benchmark tests are conducted. The benchmark results show that (1) juSFEM can achieve accurate results when compared to commercial FEM software ABAQUS, and (2) juSFEM only requires 543 s to calculate the displacements of a 3D elastic cantilever beam model which is composed of approximately 2 million tetrahedral elements , while in contrast the commercial FEM software needs 930 s for the same calculation model; (3) the parallel juSFEM executed on the 24-core CPU is approximately 20 × × faster than the corresponding serial version . Moreover, the structure and function of juSFEM are easily modularized, and the code in juSFEM is clear and readable, which is convenient for further development.},

  abstract     = {At high Reynolds numbers the use of explicit in time compressible flow simulations with spectral/ h p hp element discretization can become significantly limited by time step. To alleviate this limitation we extend the capability of the spectral/ h p hp element open-source software framework, Nektar++, to include an implicit discontinuous Galerkin compressible flow solver . The integration in time is carried out by a singly diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta method. The non-linear system arising from the implicit time integration is iteratively solved by the Jacobian-free Newton Krylov (JFNK) method. A favorable feature of the JFNK approach is its extensive use of the explicit operators available from the previous explicit in time implementation. The functionalities of different building blocks of the implicit solver are analyzed from the point of view of software design and placed in appropriate hierarchical levels in the C++ libraries. In the detailed implementation, the contributions of different parts of the solver to computational cost, memory consumption and programming complexity are also analyzed. A combination of analytical and numerical methods is adopted to simplify the programming complexity in forming the preconditioning matrix . The solver is verified and tested using cases such as manufactured compressible Poiseuille flow , Taylor–Green vortex, turbulent flow over a circular cylinder at Re = 3900 Re=3900 and shock wave boundary-layer interaction. The results show that the implicit solver can speed-up the simulations while maintaining good simulation accuracy.},

Applications traditionally focused on shock-dominated, magnetized plasma dynamics described by either Newtonian or special relativistic (magneto)hydrodynamics, but its versatile design easily extends to different PDE systems . Here, we demonstrate applications covering any-dimensional scalar to system PDEs, with e.g. Korteweg–de Vries solutions generalizing early findings on soliton behavior, shallow water applications in round or square pools, hydrodynamic convergence tests as well as challenging computational fluid and plasma dynamics applications. The recent addition of a parallel multigrid solver opens up new avenues where also elliptic constraints or stiff source terms play a central role. This is illustrated here by solving several multi-dimensional reaction–diffusion-type equations. We document the minimal requirements for adding a new physics module governed by any nonlinear PDE system, such that it can directly benefit from the code flexibility in combining various temporal and spatial discretization schemes . Distributed through GitHub , MPI-AMRVAC can be used to perform 1D, 1.5D, 2D, 2.5D or 3D simulations in Cartesian, cylindrical or spherical coordinate systems , using parallel domain-decomposition, or exploiting fully dynamic block quadtree-octree grids.},

In addition, LE o P art comes with several projection operators for exchanging information between the scattered particles and the mesh and vice versa . These projection operators are based on a variational framework, which allows extension to high-order accuracy. In particular, by implementing a dedicated PDE-constrained particle–mesh projection operator, LE o P art provides all the tools for diffusion-free advection, while simultaneously achieving optimal convergence and ensuring conservation of the projected particle quantities on the underlying mesh. A range of numerical examples that are prototypical to passive and active tracer methods highlight the properties and the parallel performance of the different tools in LE o P art .

The utilization of MPI as well as OpenMP parallelism enables the user to perform those simulations on large-scale computing clusters. It requires a minimal amount of dependencies and includes several benchmark cases and examples. The package presented here aims at providing an open access platform for both, applicants and developers, from academia as well as industry, which facilitates the extension of previous implementations and results to novel fields of application for lattice Boltzmann methods. OpenLB was tested and validated over several code reviews and publications. This paper summarizes the findings and gives a brief introduction to the underlying concepts as well as the design of the parallel data structure.},

This work consists of two major parts: First, the XDG method is introduced and a formal notation is developed, which captures important numerical details such as cell-agglomeration and a multigrid framework. In the second part, iterative solvers for extended DG systems are presented and their performance is evaluated.},

The model is carefully benchmarked through a few revealing test cases that consist of a theoretical nonlinear inundation case and a field application to San Francisco Bay. Through these tests, we seek to answer a critical science question, i.e. whether a structured grid with the help from a subgrid representation of underlying bathymetry can produce comparable results to an unstructured grid . Results suggest that comparable results for surface elevation can be achieved provided that the resolution of the base cell is sufficient fine; on the other hand, use of subgrid does not significantly improve the velocity results. The latter is attributed to the assumption that the surface elevation is assumed to be constant at the base cell. Future research priorities for this type of models should focus on improving the subgrid representations of the elevation and velocity.},

  abstract     = {High order (HO) schemes are attractive candidates for the numerical solution of multiscale problems occurring in fluid dynamics and related disciplines. Among the HO discretization variants, discontinuous Galerkin schemes offer a collection of advantageous features which have lead to a strong increase in interest in them and related formulations in the last decade. The methods have matured sufficiently to be of practical use for a range of problems, for example in direct numerical and large eddy simulation of turbulence. However, in order to take full advantage of the potential benefits of these methods, all steps in the simulation chain must be designed and executed with HO in mind. Especially in this area, many commercially available closed-source solutions fall short. In this work, we therefore present the FLEXI framework, a HO consistent, open-source simulation tool chain for solving the compressible Navier–Stokes equations on CPU clusters. We describe the numerical algorithms and implementation details and give an overview of the features and capabilities of all parts of the framework. Beyond these technical details, we also discuss the important but often overlooked issues of code stability, reproducibility and user-friendliness. The benefits gained by developing an open-source framework are discussed, with a particular focus on usability for the open-source community. We close with sample applications that demonstrate the wide range of use cases and the expandability of FLEXI and an overview of current and future developments.},

It is written in C/C++ and relies on OpenMP/OpenCL and MPI for parallel execution on multi-/many-core devices and clusters of computers, respectively. The library provides the Extended Cellular Automata paradigm as a high-level formalism for modeling complex systems on structured computational grids . As a consequence, it can be used as a parallel explicit solver of ordinary and partial differential equations through classical methods, including finite-difference and finite-volume. Here the latest version of the library is described, introducing the MPI infrastructure over the 3D OpenCL and 2D/3D OpenMP components. The implementation of a three-dimensional unsaturated flow model based on a direct discrete formulation of the Richards’ equation is also shown, corresponding to a finite-difference scheme. Computational performances have been assessed on both a scientific workstation equipped with a dual Intel Xeon socket and three Nvidia GPUs , and a 16 nodes cluster with a fast interconnection network . The OpenCAL embedded quantization optimization is also discussed and exploited to drastically reduce computing time.},

  abstract     = {Mesh-based numerical methods such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Difference Method (FDM) are widely used in various fields of science and engineering. However, the shortcomings of mesh-based methods are becoming increasingly obvious mainly due to the distorted or broken elements when analyzing the problems of large deformation or crack propagation . To overcome the above problems, meshfree methods such as the Meshless Local Petrov–Galerkin (MLPG) and Radial Point Interpolation Method (RPIM) were proposed, which can eliminate or partially eliminate the difficulties triggered by mesh-dependence. In geotechnics , the numerical modeling of deformations and failures of soil and rock masses is one of the most important approaches to understand and prevent geohazards, such as landslides and ground subsidence . In this paper, a local RPIM-based meshfree software package GeoMFree 3D 3D is specifically developed for analyzing the deformations and failures of soil and rock masses. To enhance the computing capability of GeoMFree 3D 3D , (1) effective memory storage strategies are adopted to solve the memory requirement bottleneck; and (2) parallel computing strategies are utilized and heterogeneously implemented on multi-core CPU and many-core GPU to improve the computational efficiency. To demonstrate the performance of GeoMFree 3D 3D , three simple verification examples and one application case are presented in this paper. The verification examples indicate that the computational accuracy and efficiency of the package GeoMFree 3D 3D is acceptable. Furthermore, the application case indicates that GeoMFree 3D 3D is capable of analyzing the displacements of complex rock slopes. GeoMFree 3D 3D is currently under intensive development, plans for future work on the development of GeoMFree 3D 3D are also introduced.},

Since the release of its first version, FESTUNG has been actively used for research and teaching purposes such as the design of novel algorithms and discretization schemes, benchmark studies, or just providing students with an easy-to-learn software package to study advanced numerical techniques and good programming practices. For spatial discretization, the package employs various discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, while different explicit, implicit, or semi-implicit Runge–Kutta schemes can be used for time stepping. The current publication discusses the most important aspects of our toolbox such as the code design concepts and various discretization procedures illustrated in some detail using a standard advection–diffusion–reaction equation. Moreover, we present selected applications already supported in FESTUNG including solvers for the two-dimensional shallow-water equations, the Cahn–Hilliard equation, and a coupled multi-physics model of free surface / subsurface flow.},
