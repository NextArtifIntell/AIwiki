  abstract     = {Influence of welding process parameters on stress corrosion cracking (SCC) sensitivity through thickness of 12 mm thick AA7085-T7452 joints by single-sided and double-sided friction stir welding (FSW) was investigated via the slow strain rate tensile (SSRT). The corrosion morphology of joint indicates that the coarse precipitates distributed on the grain boundary acts as corrosion cathode, causing the dissolution of the surrounding matrix which acts as anode and forming a corrosion crack initiation site under tensile stress. Different weld zones exhibit diversity in corrosion resistance and the heat affected zone (HAZ) has the largest SCC sensitivity compared with other microstructural zones. The reduction of Cu content in FSW joints increases the SCC sensitivity. The decrease spacing of grain boundary precipitates (GBPs) for the SS-60 joint and in HAZ from the top to bottom with the higher thermal cycle enhance the SCC sensitivity of FSW joints. Combined actions of the above three factors lead to the characteristic of SCC sensitivity for FSW high strength AA7085 joint.},

  abstract     = {Advancements in thermo-mechanical processing of Ni-based superalloys enable manufacturing of engineering parts with superior mechanical properties. Forged aeroengine disks exhibit radial microstructural heterogeneities from both pre-materials and prior processing. Here we correlate microstructural variations in an industrially forged alloy 718 aeroengine disks to their processing history via finite element simulations. We examine a disk intentionally manufactured to exhibit hardness variations. Several radial positions are characterized to reveal twin boundaries and δ phase fractions prior to ageing and grain size, geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) densities, chemical compositions, γ′ and γ′′ precipitates in both as-forged and direct aged conditions. We find that localized meta -dynamic recrystallization causes accelerated grain growth in low hardness regions, while highly strained areas accelerate precipitation of strengthening phases. In these areas, the direct ageing effect is weakened by the presence of non-shearable coarsened γ′′ precipitates. Overall, direct ageing is shown to successfully mitigate radial property heterogeneities. We underpin this by a strengthening model elucidating the direct ageing effect on the reduction of hardness heterogeneity. Variations in grain boundary strengthening, work hardening, and solid solution strengthening after direct ageing have low impact on hardness variations, where precipitation strengthening provides as much as 44\% of the strength after direct ageing.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel experimental and computational methodology to characterize the fracture behavior of the intermetallic bonding layer particularly for the bimetallic forming applications. The proposed methodology was applied to Al-Sn bearing alloy/mild steel bimetallic composite. Tensile-shear bimetal samples were fabricated to test the metallurgical bonding layer under shear conditions. Based on the macroscopic behavior, the coupled elasto-plasticity and damage constitutive equations for the bond material were formulated and implemented. The used damage model is written within the framework of the thermodynamic of irreversible processes with the concept of internal state variables and the framework of continuum damage mechanics (CDM). The characterization of the shear fracture behavior of the bond has included FE numerical simulation of tensile-shear tests of the bimetallic composite using ABAQUS/Explicit® FE code with the specially developed VUMAT subroutine. Accordingly, a calibration approach has been proposed to identify the fracture parameters of the bond based on the correspondence between the numerically predicted and experimental global shear force–displacement responses. These parameters have been applied to FE model of the U-bending testing of Al-Sn /mild steel bimetallic composite. A qualitative correspondence between numerically predicted results and U-bending experiment of the bimetal conducted under high-speed camera is deemed extremely satisfactory.},

Z-pins with diameters as small as 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm were prepared by using carbon fiber tows with different mechanical properties. The effect of the mechanical property of carbon fiber pin on the interlaminar fracture toughness of composite laminate was investigated to reveal the enhancement mechanism. The results show that fine z-pins significantly improve the interlaminar fracture toughness and simultaneously are favorable for maintaining high retentions of in-plane mechanical properties of composite laminate. Compared with control sample, the propagation G IC values of CFRPs implanted with 0.2 mm and 0.1 mm CCF800 z-pins increase by 276\% and 541\% respectively at a low pin volume fraction of 0.16 vol\%. Both z-pin pull-out and z-pin fracture failure behaviors can be observed for these fine z-pin reinforced composites. The higher tensile properties of z-pins and better transverse shear resistance tend to result in the failure of z-pin pull-out. With the decrease of z-pin diameter, the probability of z-pin fracture failure becomes greater, and correspondingly stronger pinning effect and larger failure load are achieved.},

A nanometer-scale interlayer of amorphous Al 2 O 3 dotted with nanocrystalline γ-Al 2 O 3 was observed and identified at the Al/Sn interface by reactive air soldering. The shear strength of the joints (∼40 MPa) by reactive air soldering was higher than that (∼20 MPa) by vacuum diffusion bonding. The reaction and diffusion behaviors of oxygen dopants at the Al/Sn interface were studied through geometry optimization and a transition state search, respectively. The work of separation values of these two interfaces between Al/O-terminated or Sn/O-terminated was 6.46 and 2.83 J/m 2 , respectively, which were both larger than that of a Al/Sn interface (1.06 J/m 2 ). The results indicated that oxygen atoms could strengthen the interfacial adhesion of Al/Sn. In addition, the interfacial reaction of Al and O and the formation process of Al 2 O 3 were discussed.

However, it is difficult to manufacture or retain the perfect auxetic systems in practical applications. In this paper, three types of disordered perforated auxetic systems including orientated disordered system, dimensional disordered system and complete-disordered system are explored thoroughly. The perforations of interest are oval holes which are advantageous in ensuring auxeticity, reducing stress level and improving material distribution. The designed disordered systems are fabricated by 3D printing technology and then are tested by the uniaxial tension to reveal their mechanical properties and verify the related finite element models. Thereafter, the evolution of mechanical properties of these disordered systems is investigated numerically for the varied perturbed geometric parameters such as the orientation and dimension of oval hole. The results reveal that the disordered systems still show great robustness in auxetic behavior, although the disorder in orientation and dimension exists. A high degree of symmetry in microstructure is not necessary for designing perforated auxetic systems. This provides a great convenience for the flexible and practicable design and application of perforated auxetic metamaterials.},

The study focused on assessing the differences between DED and DC-cast AA3104 alloy after homogenization and hot rolling. The fast cooling and repeated in situ thermal cycles during DED AM resulted in different phase transformation behavior compared to conventional DC-cast alloys. DED alloys exhibited a higher fraction of α-Al (Fe,Mn)-Si particles, more uniform particle distribution, and stronger cube texture in the as-fabricated condition. Homogenization promoted Al 6 (Fe,Mn) to α-Al (Fe,Mn)-Si phase transformation in both DED and DC-cast alloys. After homogenization, DED alloys exhibited two times as many coarse α particles in area fraction as DC-cast alloys but fewer nanoscale dispersoids. These unique material characteristics in DED alloys were responsible for easier recrystallization after hot rolling and annealing. While the differences existed, DED and DC-cast AA3104 alloys demonstrated a similar trend in phase transformation and recrystallization, strongly reinforcing that DED AM can support high-throughput Al alloy development.},

The corrosion properties of newly developed biodegradable Zn–Cu–Li alloys in simulated body fluid was studied. Results indicated that the cold-rolled alloys presented a relatively uniform corrosion mode, although early corrosion occurred preferentially at phase boundaries. Galvanic corrosion and corrosion product films jointly determined the later corrosion process. Cu improved the corrosion potential and film properties in its solid solution state, induced galvanic corrosion, and provided a physical barrier to corrosion by forming CuZn 4 phase. Rolling accelerated the initial corrosion rate by enhancing the matrix electrochemical activity, while it contributed to uniform corrosion by improving the CuZn 4 phase shape. Finally, cold-rolled Zn–4Cu–0.02Li possessed the best corrosion resistance and mechanical properties combination among the prepared alloys, with a yield strength of 256 MPa, an ultimate strength of 342 MPa, a fracture elongation of 39.8\%, and a corrosion rate of nearly 55 μm/year.},

The study was performed on glass wool containing sugar or phenolic resin, comparing it with glass wool that did not contain resin, as a reference. The results showed that the organic resin could be qualitatively identified using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermo gravimetry-mass spectrometer (TG-MS), with gradual decomposition occurring between 200 °C and 550 °C. The presence of organic resin reduced the milling efficiency of glass wool, modified the rheology by increasing the liquid demand, and slowed the strength development at room temperature. However, interestingly, the effect of the resin on the strength of the paste was less obvious at an age of 28 days. Curing for 24 h at 40 °C was beneficial for one-day strength development, in comparison to 20 °C and 60 °C, independent of the presence of the resin. All the cured paste samples, with and without resin, achieved a compressive strength of more than 40 MPa at 28 days, satisfying the requirement for many structural applications. Nevertheless, water immersion affected the materials’ strength, suggesting their suitability for dry environments or the need for suitable co-binders to increase their durability and water resistance.},

With the increase in EST time, the average hardness of specimen decreased from 426 HV to 316 HV, and the fracture strain increased significantly, which was attributed to the uniform dispersion of α phase along grain boundaries and inside the β grains. After EST, the texture intensity decreased in terms of the orientation distribution function (ODF), which was ascribed to the redistribution of α phase. Moreover, more atomic vacancies and lattice distortion were formed near the α/β interfaces, which were verified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation and ascribed to the migration of atoms near the interface under EST. External loadings facilitated the dislocation motion and lattice distortions near the interfaces, which resulted in the reduction in hardness and the improvement in ductility. The above results indicated that EST can quickly alter the microstructure and mechanical properties of DED titanium alloys as a simple and energy-saving method.},

Hydrogen segregation was found to be favourable in the Σ Σ 5 and Σ Σ 11 grain boundaries, but not in the Σ Σ 3. Hydrogen accumulation studied via a comprehensive site-permutation analysis revealed the mechanisms for how H accumulation capacity varies as a function of grain boundary character. We show that the interfacial cohesion of boundaries can diminish by between 6.7–37.5\% at varying levels of H-accumulation. The cohesion of the grain boundaries was analysed using a novel chemical bond-order based approach, enabling a quantitative atomistic determination of the fracture paths arising from hydrogen embrittlement. These simulations explain the details of why grain boundary character is the principal determinant of the likelihood of hydrogen segregation and accumulation, and hence their vulnerability to hydrogen-enhanced decohesion. This knowledge can be used in the design of thermomechanical processes to achieve grain boundary engineering for resistance to hydrogen embrittlement.},

  abstract     = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of creep generally face the problem that the creep most often evolves on time scales hard to capture with MD due to their typically short time step size. Consequently, MD studies of creep often use unrealistically high temperatures and stresses and simplified atomistic models to make creep-like processes happen on computationally accessible time scales. Apparently, this compromises the physical reliability of such studies. To alleviate this problem, we designed an MD model of titanium aluminide (TiAl) with a microstructure matching at least many of the key parameters of experimentally observed microstructures. We applied this MD model with stresses much lower than the ones used in most previous creep studies (well below yield stress) and in the temperature range 0.55 T M - 0.7 T M 0.55TM-0.7TM , with melting temperature T M TM . Compared to typical previous MD studies, this much more realistic setup produces creep rates more than three orders of magnitude smaller and thus much closer to reality.

  abstract     = {Due to good density specific mechanical properties and low carbon footprint, natural fibre-reinforced plastic composites made from fleeces and felts are frequently used as automotive interior parts. The industry targets further mass reduction. Following a biomimetic technology-pull approach, natural fibre-reinforced polypropylene plates with improved lightweight potential were produced using compression moulding. Best results were obtained for a sandwich structure with thin, unidirectional flax fibre layers surrounding a needle felt based core. It was inspired by the carapace structure of the red-eared slider Trachemys scripta elegans . The lay-up performed well, not only with a high density specific flexural stiffness of 2.33 GPa 1/3 cm 3 /g, strength of 9.46 MPa 1/2 cm 3 /g, and energy dissipation but also through less abrupt failure due to an asymmetric orientation of unidirectional fibres in the two face sheets. Combined with a mass-reduced needle felt as a core, this concept displays a promising and unconventional approach for further mass reduced, sustainable interior panels used as non-visible and visible design elements in the vehicle.},

A 3D finite element model was developed with computational hardware and software resources to simulate the shape evolution process of cup manufactured by gradual-increasing-shot laser shocking along a specified path. A series of intermediate cups were fabricated correspondingly to verify the predicted results. The effect of key processes, such as impact order, imposed pressure of shock wave and the covering ratio of laser shocking spot, on the final geometric shape of formed cup was also investigated and analyzed. The results of numerical simulation and experiment show that small deformation induced by each single-spot shocking is gradually accumulated to larger deformation , and multiple-spot laser shocking can form the large conic cup well. The sheet forming precision is not affected by the order of laser shocking, but is seriously decreased by the improper pressure of imposed shock wave. When the covering ratio of laser shocking exceeds threshold value, sheet forming precision is not changed any more even if the covering ratio increases. In general, the multiple-spot laser shocking forming is a technology of sheet incremental forming , and it can enlarge greatly the scope of sheet forming with laser shocking.},

The overall bimetallic structures exhibited total elongation of 25–35\%, and was dominated by plastic deformation in the Cu region. Tensile failures were typically observed in the Cu portion of the bimetallic bodies demonstrating that the interface was not the source of mechanical failure. The interface region of the bimetallics contained areas of liquid phase separated Cu and Iron (Fe) + Chromium (Cr) rich regions resulting from a metastable miscibility gap in the Cu and Fe phase diagram.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel design and fabrication strategy to produce architected structures for use as the core in composite sandwich structures. A traditional foam core or honeycomb structure is lightweight and stiff, but susceptible to permanent deformation when subjected to excessive loading. Here we propose the use of an architected structure composed of arrays of hollow truncated cone unit cells that dissipate energy and exhibit structural recovery. These structures, printed with a viscoelastic material, rely on buckling of their sidewalls to dissipate energy and snap-back to prevent permanent deformation. We explore the mechanical response of these conical unit cells in terms of their buckling strength and post-buckling stability condition and develop design maps for the same by relating them to non-dimensional geometric parameters α , β , γ α,β,γ where α α represents the slenderness of the curved sidewalls, β β is the angle of the sidewall to the base, and γ γ represents the curvature of the sidewall. A validated finite element model is developed and used to investigate the effect of these parameters. We show that the volume normalized peak buckling load is directly proportional to both α α &amp; β β , but is independent of γ γ . The post-buckling stability is influenced by γ γ as a large radius of curvature makes the structure less likely to exhibit structural bistability. Due to viscoelastic dissipation, for certain geometric parameters, the structures exhibit pseudo-bistability which allows them to recover to their original configurations without the need for external stimuli or energy.},

High chromium white cast iron (WCI) further reinforced with niobium carbide (NbC) shows promise to increase component wear lives. This work investigates the effect of niobium macro-additions on microstructure, hardness and high-stress abrasive wear behaviour of Nb-containing high-Cr WCIs. Eight alloys with Nb between 0 and 10.7 wt\% were produced by sand casting. Increasing niobium carbide volume fraction (Nb-CVF) increased hardness from 724 to 812 HV (7.3 HV per 1\% Nb-CVF). Abrasive wear resistance, assessed using the ball mill abrasion test in basalt (less competent) and quartzite (competent rock), showed clear beneficial effect of NbC macro-addition up to 11.4 and 7 vol\% in basalt and quartzite, respectively. These correspond to life improvements of 37\% and 7\% per 1\% Nb-CVF in the optimum range of Nb macro-addition, in basalt and quartzite respectively. Micro-mechanistic observations of worn surfaces showed that NbC particles not only protrude from the matrix but do so more than Cr-rich M 7 C 3 carbides. In deep wear grooves created by quartzite, M 7 C 3 particles were cut flush with the matrix, whereas NbC protruded, visibly impeding the progress of the abrasion event.},

  abstract     = {Binder-Jetting is a fairly new sinter-based additive manufacturing technology for metals. Due to sintering, small particle size distributions are favorable, yet they are limiting the printing process due to bad flowability and compaction. This paper aims to resolve this contradiction by adding flow aids to powders used in Binder-Jetting. Therefore 5 different powders with successively decreasing particle size distributions ranging from 32 µm (D90) to 5 µm (D90) are combined with 2 different fumed silica (aerosil) flow aids. Improvements are measured by the use of apparent and tap density as well as hausner ratio. Results show that the mixing process for flow aids and powders has significant influence on the improvements. Moreover, the amount of aerosil is a key criterion for optimized flow behavior. Improvements up to 42\% for apparent and 11\% for tap density are achieved. Hausner ratio can be improved up to 34\%. Preliminary printing results indicate that increased flowability and packing behavior also increases powder bed density and green density. The results are in line with existing theories regarding the use of flow aids in powders used in other industries and can be now be adopted for metal powders as well.},

The present study shows that by coupling buckling-driven elastomeric auxetic modules actuated by a negative air-pressure, a novel metamaterial-based caterpillar can be designed—the Metarpillar. Following a detailed analysis of the caterpillar’s locomotion, we were able to mimic both its crawling movement and locomotion by using the unique isometric compression of the modules and properly programing the anterograde modular peristaltic contractions. The bioinspired locomotion of the Metarpillar uses the bending triggered by the buckling-driven module contraction to control the friction through a dynamic anchoring between the soft robot and the surface, which is the main mechanism for locomotion in caterpillars and other crawling organisms. Thus, the Metarpillar not only mimics the locomotion of the caterpillar but also displays dynamic similarity and equivalent, or even faster, speeds. Our approach based on metamaterial buckling actuator units opens up a novel strategy for biomimetic soft robotic locomotion that can be extended beyond caterpillars.},

The second test case deals with globularized α grains after multi-axial hot compression. Obvious β recrystallization happens inside the large prior β grain during deformation, which can facilitate the homogeneous globularization process. The mean orientation reconstruction of recrystallized β grain by smoothing spline is performed and further compared with the orientation calculated from one α colony by orientation-trace method. The maximum 20° misorientation exists due to the local orientation deviation inside both α and β grains during globularization processing. In addition, the globularization mechanism under multi-axial hot compression is analyzed. Despite the appearance of local heterogeneity between different α colonies, high globularized efficiency around 71.2\% can be easily achieved by the multi-directional deformation.},

The first-principles calculation based on the density functional theory was employed to calculate the characteristics of materials. The results showed that the uniformly distributed Cu could stabilize the face-centered cubic phase structure, hinder the transfer of point defects, and activate the cathode. The synergistic effect of Mo and other HEA elements was beneficial in reducing the point defect density of the passive film, and an appropriate amount of Mo was contributed to grain refinement, solid solution strengthening, and precipitation strengthening of the coating. When the ratio of Cu to Mo is 1:3, a small number of nanoscales second sigma phase (Fe-Cr-Mo) appeared between ordered and disordered, which balanced the coating&#39;s corrosion and slurry erosion wear performances. Compared with DSS, the corrosion current density of CoCrFeNiCu 0.25 Mo 0.75 coating was reduced by nearly an order of magnitude, the impedance was increased by 2.5 times, and the erosion wear resistance was increased by 4 to 5 times.},

This resin is a competitive solution against traditional epoxy-based composites. In this work, novel non-crimp (NC) glass fabric/MMA resin composites were manufactured using a vacuum infusion process. Cellulose microcrystals (CMCs) were dispersed in the resin to improve the fibre/matrix interface and the composite properties. CMCs were first dispersed in the resin using an ultrasonication process and then the CMC/MMA resin suspension, mixed with a peroxide initiator, was infused into the reinforcing fabric. The amounts of CMCs dispersed in the resin were 0.5\%, 1\% and 2\% (of the weight of the resin). The influence of CMCs on the interlaminar shear strength (interface), flexural properties, abrasive wear and dynamic-mechanical behaviour was thoroughly investigated. From the mechanical characterisation, it was observed that the addition of 1\% CMC to the NC glass/MMA resin composites improved the flexural strength, interlaminar shear strength and wear performance by 30.77\%, 38.04\% and 22.27\%, respectively as compared to the neat glass/MMA resin composite. Above this amount of CMC (i.e., 1 wt\%), the properties started to degrade as a result of CMC agglomeration.},

  abstract     = {A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the molten pool in laser keyhole welding was utilized to acquire temperature data for further metallurgical and mechanical calculations. For the CFD simulation, the governing equations were solved, and the scattering and absorption of the laser beam in the plume were modeled at both the standard atmospheric condition (101,325 Pa) and a vacuum condition (3,000 Pa). A stochastic ray-tracing algorithm was adopted to effectively implement the transmission and scattering of laser bundles of rays. The temperature data from the CFD simulation were then imported to a finite element method (FEM)-based heat conduction analysis to simulate the thermal-metallurgical-mechanical behavior during the cooling phase of the weldment. The strain, residual stress, and distortion were calculated using an elastoplastic model based on the phase transformation-dependent material properties. An element deactivation scheme was used to take care of the zero-strength condition of the elements in the molten pool and keyhole region. The Vickers hardness and the residual stress were measured to verify the simulation model, and the experimental and simulation results had a similar tendency.},

  abstract     = {The composite tube has been widely used in various fields of piping systems, because of saving precious metals and combining physical and chemical properties of bi-material. There are important correlations between the bending forming accuracy and cross-section deformation mechanism of the composite tube, and its own size factors, that is the size effect. However, the correlations are not clear, and the effects of size factors are coupled or superimposed. Therefore, a brand-new research method of size effect is established. Two dimensionless variables of section hollow coefficient λ and bending degree w are introduced to describe the sectional dimensional characteristics. The mathematical model of size effect is established as well as the relationships between cross-section deformation Δ δ and λ , w and λ-w . Finally, the distribution of Δ δ in λ-w space has been developed based on the above research. The results are shown as follows. (1) All the relationships of Δ δ and λ - w can be described by the product of the double Boltzmann function, which is also the mathematical model of the size effect. (2) There are “un-formable zone”, “bendable forming zone” and “best forming zone” of the composite tube in λ - w space. The “best forming zone” is Z b = { λ , w |0.2 ≤ λ ≤ 0.58, 0.23 ≤ w ≤ 0.90}.},

However, for this purpose, enhancing piezoelectric properties and adopting an industrial fabrication method are of great importance. In this study, 5–9 µm thick PVDF films were fabricated by a nozzle-less ultrasonic spray coating (USC) system, followed by an annealing process at 100 °C. By applying proper spraying parameters, we could obtain highly uniform films with large d 33 values (48 pm/V) and 56\% crystallinity. Results show that the uniformity of the films plays an important role in the final piezoelectric properties. Thus, ultrasonic spray coating method can be used for fabrication of large-scale piezoelectric films with no need for poling or stretching processes.},

Fracture morphology of the specimens was studied by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to examine particle–particle interface bonding. The results revealed that there exists a strong microstructural and mechanical anisotropy in the CSAMed deposits. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) gradually decreased as the tensile direction changed from X/Y to Z direction. Further, crack propagation behavior was uniform in XY plane but a strong anisotropy was resulted in the planes that were perpendicular to XY plane.

The fabricated 3D woven textile-reinforced epoxy-resin composites undergo quasi-static three-point bending tests to study the influence of the woven structure on the flexural performance and failure modes along the textile warp and weft directions. The composites along the weft direction (weft-direction beams) have a larger flexural modulus but smaller failure strain compared with the warp direction (warp-direction beams) for all woven-structure types. Among the designed 3D textile composites, the angle-interlock woven structures have a larger flexural strength (50\%), modulus (40\%), and failure resistance than have the orthogonal-woven structures. Overall, the through-thickness angle-interlock woven structure has the best flexural-failure resistance among all textile structures, and is the optimal structural design based on this modified weaving technology.},

The method consists of three steps; at Step 1, developing a simulator to predict a spectrum of microwave from a conductive layer of absorber as an image input, at Step 2, designing an autoencoder network to take the patterns as input and outputs the same pattern, at Step 3, making an inverse design method for a new pattern under a given goal (spectrum). The proposed method was verified by comparing with the reflectance spectrum calculated by FDTD on the designed absorber with an optimal conductive pattern layer. For the effective training of a general random-like pixel patterns, the variational autoencoder (VAE) that uses a new adaptive annealing loss and a symmetricity layer block in VAE decoder is suggested to improve the training performance. The covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) which searches the optimal pattern in the VAE latent space is used for suggesting the candidates of the optimal pattern. The proposed method can find an optimal absorber with minimum −16 dB reflectance in X-band that exceed the best absorption among all the training samples obtained by FDTD.},

It was found that the SLMed samples were mainly composed by lots of fine martensite (including cellular structure, cellular dendritic grains and blocky grains), and trace austenite. During SLM forming process, a large number of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) and high-density dislocations were formed in the matrix. Meanwhile, the samples showed weak texture and no obvious preference orientation. Moreover, the relative density of all SLMed samples reached above 90\%, and the relative density was above 97\% when the laser energy density was 54.13–78.19 J·mm −3 . Under the optimal process parameters of P = 190 W, V = 1.1 m·s −1 , the relative density of sample reached above 99.52 ± 0.09\%, while the sample exhibited the best mechanical properties, including the highest microhardness (374.2 ± 6.5HV), yield strength (YS = 946 ± 7.3 MPa), ultimate tensile strength (UTS = 1084 ± 3 MPa) and elongation (EL = 17.64 ± 0.18\%). Moreover, the strengthening mechanisms of SLMed samples mainly included grain boundary strengthening, dislocation strengthening and precipitation strengthening, while dislocation strengthening played a dominant role. Besides that, the fracture mechanisms of SLMed samples belonged to ductile fracture, except for the samples prepared with laser energy density below 54.13 J·mm −3 .},

  abstract     = {Due to the high efficiency and low cost, gas atomization (GA) has been widely applied to produce metal powders. In this paper, the GA process is first modeled by combining the volume of fluid (VOF) model with dynamic adaptive mesh and the discrete phase model (DPM) to simulate the formation of the powders and the evolution of the defects. Simulation results show that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the primary atomization and the membranous droplet breakup and closure in secondary atomization can form the hollow powder. While the presence of the satellite powder is caused by the collisions between the large and small droplets with different velocities. Moreover, the irregular powder is produced when the drag force is not enough to separate the droplets but deforms them. The estimated morphology and size distribution of the particles have a good agreement with the experimental ones. Finally, the possible measures to reduce the defects of the powders have been put forward based on the revealed mechanism of defect evolution. This work provides a deep simulation insight into the GA process, towards producing high-quality metal powders for additive manufacturing on a large scale.},

Through careful analysis and observation in this paper, new nano-scale dendrites (with dendritic arm spacing about 500 nm) were revealed within the conventional dendritic arm (with dendritic arm spacing about 70 μm). The conventional dendrites should be recognized as macrosegregation patterns arisen in a subtle porous media . Accordingly, the research entity for microsegregation should change from the conventional dendritic arm to a more subtle entity. During solidification, temperature fluctuations with different directions, periods and intensities will superimpose to induce a dendritic temperature field on multi-scales. Because of differentiated solid fractions and liquid compositions, a dendritic macrosegregation field on multi-scales will be induced by the mass transfer. Verified by the in situ and real time observation, the subtle dendrites emerge at the later solidification stage much lower than the equilibrium eutectic temperature . Because nano-scale dendrites were recognized, new solutions were proposed for controlling macrosegregation within the conventional dendritic arm. In a more significant view, the nano-scale dendrites provide the basis for unifying the non-equilibrium solidification and the equilibrium solidification.},

Primary Nbss phases were coarsened and spheroidized after ultrasound treatment, and fracture toughness improved by 69.16\%. Simulation results show that the strong acoustic active zone is at the height of 15 mm in the ingot, with maximum sound pressure of 36.3 MPa. The high sound pressure can break dendrites. Maximum fluid velocity reaches 0.03 m/s in the longitudinal section and 0.02 m/s in the transversal section with several circulations.

In this work, three different glass–ceramic sealants (Na-containing, Ba-containing, Sr-containing compositions) and Fe22Cr stainless steel powders (raw and pre-oxidised) are considered in order to test their chemical reactivity at 750 °C and 850 °C for 500 h in static air. The novelty of this approach is related to the use of powder mixtures instead of studying the reactivity on planar interfaces, which allows a better evaluation the materials’ reactivity. Oxidation tests indicate that the Sr-containing glass–ceramic/steel couple is the least reactive among the aged samples. For the Ba-containing samples, the formation of an undesirable phase of BaCrO 4 is observed by diffractometry and photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The present research explores, for the first time, the effects of exposing the high surface area of the alloy powder and glass–ceramic sealant interface, assessed by oxidation testing and microstructural analysis. The results show that by using mixed powders with large interface surface areas, degradation of the materials can be observed after relatively short times, allowing accelerated screening of the reactivity of materials, and thus their further development.},

Samples of varying composition with 20, 30, 47 and 58 wt\% Bi are solidified in a copper mould and the pore fraction is measured through scanning electron microscopy. Finite element models are derived from X-ray micro computed tomography data and a material model is implemented to capture the effect of liquid pressure and volumetric swelling. The experimental assessment of solidification porosity shows a strong dependency on alloy composition. The round morphology of porosity found in the Sn-20 wt\% Bi alloy indicates its formation in the terminal stage of solidification. Microporosity formation is computed by means of Finite Element simulations and the results correlate with experimental findings. The analysis confirms volumetric shrinkage in the liquid state of confined eutectic domains as the mechanism for pore formation and determines the composition dependency of Sn-Bi alloys.},

  abstract     = {A tradeoff between lightweight and ballistic resistance is common when designing ballistic protection systems for the transportation market. Steel is one of the most affordable and widely used armor materials due to its cost and manufacturing advantages. However, its high density compared to ceramics and composites reduces its eligibility. Therefore, a weight reduction of steel plates is achieved here by inserting holes distributed throughout the plate thickness. Two approaches are proposed. The first creates cylindrical hole patterns parametrically based on the functionally graded concept found in biological structures subjected to impact loads . The second approach uses the topology optimization method to design the free-shaped hole pattern through thickness. The designed plates are manufactured and evaluated numerically and experimentally. Ballistic impact tests are performed according to the NIJ 0108.01 standard, and the results are analyzed using design of experiments . Several nondestructive tests are applied to measure the damage on the impacted plates. Results show that the performance of the topology optimized designs and the solid plates is statistically equivalent, while the parametric plates are partially penetrated. This is an important result to establish a new design methodology in a complex field where topology optimization has been little explored.},

  abstract     = {Laser Powder Bed fusion is capable of rapid production of parts, from conception, compared with traditional manufacturing methods. This said, the time taken to fabricate a single part can still be significant – typically many hours. Processing thicker layers, and hence fewer total layers, in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion process, is an effective way to reduce build times. However, mechanical performance can suffer as a result of this strategy. This study proposes and demonstrates a method to enable the interlacing of multiple layer thicknesses within one part, allowing for finer layers within regions where they are specifically required, whilst maintaining overall component integrity for specific load cases. Thicker layers are used within regions with lower property requirements in order to optimise an overall part for improved production rate. The design of interfaces between two disparate layer thickness regions could also be tailored for control of material properties and such will be investigated in an independent study. Ti6Al4V LPBF samples are fabricated, characterised by way of tensile testing, porosity analysis and microstructural analysis. The study demonstrate parts can be additively built using multiple layer thickness regions with consistent ultimate tensile strength (1110–1135 MPa) and varying penalties to ductility, depending on layer thickness and interface design (elongation to failure reductions up to 40\% in the most extreme case).},

  abstract     = {Laser cladding deposition (LCD) is widely used to remanufacture/repair workpieces because of its high design freedom to rebuild areas of damage. However, the process often introduces a columnar grain structure in the cladding layer, resulting in a large variation of microstructure and hardness across the cladding layer, welding interface, and base metal. Under fatigue and tensile loading, fractures can initiate in the lower hardness cladding layer. This study explores the feasibility of a new hybrid remanufacturing method integrating the LCD with a subsequent hot deformation process to refine grain structures, reduce hardness variations, and enhance mechanical properties. The effects of deformation temperatures and imposed plastic strains were studied by examining the microstructural and stress–strain behaviour of laser cladded 316L stainless steel. After LCD, compressive deformation was imposed at temperatures of 900 and 1100 °C, with engineering strain levels of 0.1 and 0.5. A high-quality metallurgical joint was achieved, with the optimal ultimate tensile strength and yield strength under process conditions of an engineering strain level of 0.5 imposed at 900 °C (35\% improvement compared to the directly laser cladding remanufacturing process). Dynamic recrystallization process was observed by the electron back scatter diffraction technique to reveal the underlying mechanism.},

The dynamic fracture behaviors and damage mechanism of the BWC were characterized using in situ scanning electron microscopy. X-ray micro- computed tomography imaging was employed to verify the off-axis tensile mechanical properties. The results showed that the maximum tensile strength and modulus of the BWC under off-axis loadings were 232.25 MPa and 17.47 GPa, respectively. Meanwhile, the maximum specific strength and specific modulus of the BWC were 290.31 MPa·cm 3 ·g −1 and 23.84 GPa·cm 3 ·g −1 , respectively, which are higher than both natural wood (95.26 MPa·cm 3 ·g −1 , 10.82 GPa·cm 3 ·g −1 ), bamboo (208.56 MPa·cm 3 ·g −1 , 15.74 GPa·cm 3 ·g −1 ) and even steel alloy (237.86 MPa·cm 3 ·g −1 , 21.98 GPa·cm 3 ·g −1 ). Compared to reorganized bamboo (RB), the porosity of the BWC was 61.1\% lower. The BWC was strengthened via internal toughening mechanisms ( i.e. fiber bridging) and external toughening mechanisms ( i.e. multiregional distribution of micro-cracks).

The precise localization of OCCs at a scalable manner will bring about a revolution into next generation optoelectronics, which, however, remains a great challenge till now. Here, a scalable, low cost and universal photo-patterning strategy is developed to implant OCCs at desired locations on (6,5)-chirality SWCNT films by combining optically active diazonium chemistry and micro-contact printing methods. Notably, the patterns can be tunable by changing the solvents used for the patterning chemistry, affording control over the weight of diazonium salts at different regions. A systematic investigation reveals that the solvent properties (polarity and vapor pressure), the volume and concentration of ink used, the patterning methods, and the concentration of MeODz all contribute to the tunable patterning. This spatial accurate and solvent tunable photo-patterning technique is simple, scalable, and amenable to the integration of other color center chemistries and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides for the next-generation chip-integrated nanoelectronics and optoelectronics with high device uniformity and manipulability at molecular level.},

Then this study analyzed the elastoplastic behavior and adhesion behavior of the Si/Cu interface and the effect of IMC on the fracture properties. The simulation results demonstrate that the Si/Cu interface fails in a quasi-brittle fracture mode. The crack propagates along the interface between Si and the IMC layer. An apparent dislocation emission and large plastic deformation are found exclusively in the Cu layer. The thickness of the IMC layer increased from 2 to 10 Å, and the critical strain energy release rate increased from 14.48 J/m 2 to 19.76 J/m 2 , while the equivalent modulus is not increase monotonically.

However, fabrication of thick tungsten coatings on copper or steel is challenged by the significant difference in the melting points and the thermal expansion coefficients of the materials, which leads to severe thermal expansion mismatch strains during manufacture and in service. This challenge is investigated using a new processing approach — field assisted sintering of tungsten nanopowders directly onto pre-sculptured steel component surfaces to induce controlled, vertical segmentation cracks that provide strain relief. Tungsten coatings up to 2 mm thick were fabricated with uniform density and with a microstructure consisting of ultrafine grains of ∼ ∼ 200 nm. The coatings showed outstanding thermal cycling durability and survived for at least 50 cycles under pulsed temperature cycles between 300 to 800 ° C °C . Microscopy and in situ thermal imaging revealed that a previously unachievable thermal expansion mismatch strain tolerance was provided by a combination of enhanced tungsten coating adhesion and deliberate coating segmentation by vertical cracking. The approach should be readily adaptable to other dissimilar materials systems to facilitate a range of durable, ultra-thick low ductility coatings on metallic substrates.},

Triethanolamine (TEA) surfactant addition and an appropriate calcination process are innovatively introduced into this wet chemical method. The results show that ultrafine composite powders with nano-sized Y 2 O 3 dispersions in the tungsten matrix can be obtained through the improved wet chemical method. Using the SPS, the average sizes of Y 2 O 3 particles within tungsten grains and at grain boundaries are identified to be 13.5 and 50 nm, respectively. It is found that the phase interface between W and Y 2 O 3 is a typical semicoherent interface. We observe that the W-Y 2 O 3 composites possess superior mechanical properties compared with the pure tungsten counterparts. The results inferred from atomistic simulations reveal that the added Y 2 O 3 particles can effectively pin the dislocation and impede the dislocation movement, thus enhancing the mechanical performances of W-Y 2 O 3 composites. In addition, the addition of Y 2 O 3 particles is also able to improve the helium ion irradiation resistance of tungsten-based composites.

Based on the design concept of low difference in elemental melting points, equiaxed grains with slight segregation were obtained. The HENP was characterized as a disordered near-coherent structure with a composition significantly similar to the matrix that differed from traditional coherent intermetallics. The heterogeneous nucleation was attributed to the aggregation of the largest Hf atoms and interstitial complexes in the locally distorted matrix. Moreover, the refractory nanoparticle was inferred to be hafnium nitride, possessing high thermal stability and establishing a semicoherent interface with the matrix. Notably, the interface was lined with a Ti film of one or two atomic layers. Furthermore, owing to the high melting point and precipitation strengthening, a highest yield strength (851 MPa) was obtained at 1200 °C compared with those reported cast RHEAs. At room temperature, a high yield strength (1713 MPa) was revealed mainly due to the combined effect of solid-solution strengthening and precipitation strengthening.

To get superior strength, 4 wt\% of Cu was added to AlSi10Mg composition to benefit from the additional solid solution and precipitation strengthening mechanisms induced by Cu atoms. Microstructure, chemical composition, hardness, and tensile properties of as-built samples were firstly determined. The microstructure showed a dual eutectic formed by Si precipitates intermixed with θ θ -Al 2 Cu phase. The average Cu concentration was 3.96 ± 0.26 wt\% in line with the theoretical one. Hardness and yield strength of AlSi10Mg + 4Cu alloy showed an increase of respectively 8.8\% and 35.6\% compared to the as-built AlSi10Mg, owing to the highly super-saturated solid solution of Si and Cu atoms upon rapid solidification. After that, a direct aging heat-treatment strategy was pursued to fully exploit the potential alloy precipitation by heating as-built samples at temperatures between 160 and 190 °C. A maximum hardness response was achieved after 1 h at 175 °C. The high hardening was primarily attributed to a mix of θ &#39; &#39; / θ &#39; + θ θ&#39;&#39;/θ&#39;+θ -Al 2 Cu and Si phases coupled with a still high solid solution content. Nevertheless, direct aging slightly decreased the alloy ductility due to the prominent precipitation of brittle Si particles during aging and the presence of Cu inhomogeneities formed after in-situ alloying.},

  abstract     = {A new approach to modelling the microstructure evolution and yield strength in laser powder bed fusion components is introduced. Restoration mechanisms such as discontinuous dynamic recrystallization , continuous dynamic recrystallization, and dynamic recovery were found to be activated during laser powder bed fusion of austenitic stainless steels; these are modelled both via classical Zener-Hollomon and thermostatistical approaches. A mechanism is suggested for the formation of dislocation cells from solidification cells and dendrites, and their further transformation to low-angle grain boundaries to form subgrains. This occurs due to dynamic recovery during laser powder bed fusion. The yield strength is successfully modelled via a Hall–Petch-type relationship in terms of the subgrain size, instead of the actual grain size or the dislocation cell size. The validated Hall–Petch-type equation for austenitic stainless steels provides a guideline for the strengthening of laser powder bed fusion alloys with subgrain refinement, via increasing the low-angle grain boundary fraction (grain boundary engineering). To obtain higher strength, dynamic recovery should be promoted as the main mechanism to induce low-angle grain boundaries. The dependency of yield stress on process parameters and alloy composition is quantitatively described.},

  abstract     = {Precise detection of Fe 3+ ions in vitro is important for diagnosis of disease and bone health. Covalent organic polymers (COPs) are chosen as the precision probes, due to their light-weight, stable-bonds, and fast-response. In this work, a new fluorescent COP, pyrene-2,7-diboronic-COP(PD-COP), was designed and its feasibility in detection of iron concentration in cells was tested. PD-COP showed good performance in selective detection of Fe 3+ , among other metal ions. Its high anti-interference property and recyclability provide the theoretical basis for practical applications. PD-COP could selectively detect Fe 3+ ions with low limit of detection (LOD) at a concentration of about 0.68 µM. The quenching mechanism could be due to the transfer of electron. The in vitro experiments using cells also showed that the PD-COP had good biocompatibility, and the ability to detect Fe 3+ ions in cells. In conclusion, we successfully synthesized a novel COP, with high sensitivity that could selectively detect Fe 3+ ions. The COP had the ability to enter the cell membrane and combine with iron ions, which provided a new method of monitoring bone health.},

Recently, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and its pathway have been shown as the new target for wound repair. However, using PTH in clinical wound treatment can be a question. This study is to develop a novel PTHrP-2 loaded cellulose acetate nanofiber mat (CAP) via electrospinning to benefit wound repair. By observing the effects of prepared CAP on cell proliferation, migration, tube formation, and wound healing in the rat models, we have evaluated the safety and effectiveness of CAP. With the extract of CAP, the viability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and fibroblasts was enhanced. It also could significantly increase the movement rate of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and promote tube formation. The wound closure speed of CAP treatment was significantly faster than the cellulose acetate group. In conclusion, CAP has a promoting effect in angiogenesis, collagen formation and re-epithelialization, thereby it can accelerate wound healing. CAP is a promising translational nanocomposite material, which might be transferred into a new type of wound dressing.},

However, the current scaffolds have some limitations in terms of poor osteogenic bioactivities. In this study, citrate-stabilized gold-nanoparticles (GNPs) were encapsulated into polyvinylpyrrolidone/ethylcellulose scaffolds fabricated by coaxial electrospinning technique. Three types of GNPs-loaded electrospun scaffolds (P/E-0.5, P/E-1, and P/E-1.5) were prepared by changing the feeding GNPs. The morphological and physicochemical properties of these GNPs-incorporated electrospun scaffolds were comprehensively characterized. The results demonstrated that GNPs were successfully encapsulated into electrospun scaffolds, and their addition barely affected the morphology but improved the porosity and mechanical properties. In vitro studies revealed that GNPs-incorporated electrospun scaffolds showed excellent biocompatibility and osteogenic bioactivities, wherein the alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralized nodule formation, and the osteogenic-related genes expression were enhanced in GNPs-incorporated electrospun scaffolds compared to the neat P/E electrospun nanofibers. Then, the GNPs-incorporated electrospun scaffolds were surgically implanted into the defect area of the rat skull bone to test their in vivo bone repairing effect. It was observed that GNPs-incorporated scaffolds rapidly accelerated bone regeneration in vivo . Taken together, GNPs-incorporated coaxial electrospun nanofibers might be considered as promising scaffolds in the field of bone tissue regeneration.},

However, the conventional cold expansion technology inevitably extends the processing cycle of fastening hole. Therefore, this study proposes a strengthening and machining integrated ultrasonic peening drilling (UPD) to solve this problem by introducing ultrasonic vibration perpendicular to the hole surface during drilling. Both the strengthening principle and dimension accuracy improvement mechanism in UPD were analyzed to better understand the cutting mechanism. The feasibility experiments of UPD of Ti-6Al-4V were conducted to evaluate surface integrity and machining accuracy. The results show that compared to conventional drilling (CD), smoother machined surface and narrower dimensional tolerance were obtained with UPD. Moreover, the subsurface plastic deformation was increased by as high as 4 times with severer deformation degree. Accordingly, the surface residual stress and the depth of circumferential residual stress in the subsurface was increased by 115.7\% and 125\% respectively. In addition, surface micro-hardness and subsurface hardening layer depth were also significantly increased. The results demonstrated that UPD achieved the integration of strengthening and precision-machining and could be a promising method for finish drilling of aircraft fastening holes.},

Epoxy resins are versatile and among the most important class of polymers, due to their multiple crosslinking capacity endowed by the oxirane ring, their applications ranging from adhesives to aeronautics. This study investigates the comparative effect of three hardeners (aromatic, cycloaliphatic, aliphatic) and the addition of an oligophosphonate on the thermal behavior and fire performance of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether semi–interpenetrating polymer networks. Networks with epoxy resin and 2\% phosphorus loading were prepared. Evolved gases analyses, thermal and fire experiments were used to propose the action mode of the hardeners and oligophosphonate in the fire performance enhancement of the epoxy resin. Non–isothermal decomposition kinetics studies were conducted. The oligophosphonate in the epoxy resins promoted a significant reduction in the peak of heat release rate values (33 to 55\%) in microscale combustion calorimeter experiments. A UL 94–V0 classification was achieved for the network with oligophosphonate and aromatic curing agent. The obtained results recommend the semi–interpenetrating network cured with aromatic hardener as a potential matrix for flame retardant composites or coatings.},

Therefore, in order to decrease the number of design variables in VD design, this paper proposed a modelling approach for VD lattice structures manufactured using SLM. The stress values provided by finite element analysis (FEA) were grouped according to k-means clustering, where the sizes of lattice cells in the same group remain identical. Then the relative densities of cells’ in all groups are obtained and the VD model is generated. By taking the design of a VD lattice beam as an example, the feasibility of the proposed method was verified by conducting FEA and three-point bending tests on SLM-produced Ti6Al4V samples, as well as using morphological observation measures. The results show that the number of design variables for reconstructing the beam was decreased from 125 to 8, and the VD samples reached the designed carrying capacity and also presented superior lightweight performance compared with their isovolumetric homogenous counterparts.},

The topic paves a way to understand the stabilization and dissipation mechanisms of long-range magnetic order in the 2D limit, which is crucial for both fundamental condensed matter physics research and technological applications. However, limited by the sample size, conventional experimental techniques such as neutron diffraction spectrum and magnetization measurements are difficult to be applied to these atomically thin materials. At the same time, electronic tunneling transport measurements have been proved to be a powerful technique in the study of 2D magnetism. Here we review the electronic tunneling transports in magnetic 2D crystals, especially the detection of the phase boundaries of 2D magnets, focusing on two-material systems, i.e. chromium halides and manganese phosphorus trisulfides. In addition, the magnetic van der Waals Josephson junctions and the spin valve devices based on the 2D magnetic metals are applied to probe 2D magnetism as well. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and perspectives of potential applications of 2D van der Waals magnetic materials.},

  abstract     = {Multi-stable metastructures composed of curved beams can switch to a series of stable configurations via elastic snap-through transitions. The elastic deformations allow metastructures to function as reusable energy absorbers. However, conventional metastructure designs based on solid beams often result in relatively low energy dissipation. In this work, it is found that by increasing the beam unit’s bending stiffness while keeping the volume/mass constant, energy dissipation of the metastructure can be largely improved. Based on this observation, we propose two types of structural designs (lattice and hollow cross-section design) as building blocks for multi-stable metastructures. The lattice design is realized by incorporating lattice structures into pre-shaped beams while for the hollow cross-section design, a box-shaped cross section is adopted. The proposed structures are experimentally characterized under cyclic loading and are shown to exhibit sequential snap-through transitions with relatively large energy dissipation. Results show the snap-through behavior can be further tailored through tuning structural in-plane thickness. Effects of geometric parameters on snap-through, local buckling and bi-stability are investigated, and the feasible design domains for selecting proper lattice and cross-section geometries are identified. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed design is not restricted to beams, and can be extended to shell structures.},

Here, by separating a few-layered GaS (∼15 nm) with its substrate to prepare a device with the typical suspended architecture, we trade off its responsivity with speed for the first time. A responsivity of ∼ 10 3 A/W and a switch time of ∼ μs are achieved simultaneously in a wide UV–vis range (300–628 nm), which exceeds that of the most current 2D material-based photodetectors. The excellent mechanical stiffness of layered GaS avoids the interface scattering and trap caused by the contacting with substrate or its own deformation. This is beneficial to the significant improvement of carrier mobility and fully activating the intrinsic properties of GaS. Combined with the comparative experiments and band theory analysis, this assertion is confirmed and the photoconductance effect is determined to play a dominant role. These results show a promising strategy for improving the performance of GaS photodetector, especially providing references for its future integrated devices.},

To date, research has rarely met the demand for controlled VEGF quick release. Herein, a novel wheel spinning technique was introduced to fabricate alginate (Alg)/silk fibroin (SF) composite fiber for loading VEGF and achieving controllable release. In turn, it was demonstrated that the parameter of wheel spinning and Alg/SF material morphological combination significantly influence VEGF release behavior and fiber degradation speed, which could be controlled by adjusting spinning solution concentration and modifying SF morphology. The loading concentration and SF structural features interacted with each other to affect the VEGF release behavior, indicating that growth factors such as VEGF could be released in a controllable fashion. It could therefore be developed as a novel approach to control the wound healing process.},

  abstract     = {Bile duct injury is a common complication of hepatobiliary surgeries in clinical practice with poorly satisfactory treatment outcomes. Implanting a tissue-engineered tubular scaffold for supporting and replacing defected native bile duct is an important treatment option for bile duct injury. Here a dual-layer tubular scaffold with poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) inner layer and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA)/poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) outer layer was fabricated using a two-stage molding method for bile duct regeneration. Further, induced mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)-derived cholangiocyte-like cells were embedded in the outer layer during fabrication. The inner layer of PLGA offered adequate mechanical strength for the scaffold, and the outer layer of GelMA/PEGDA provided excellent biocompatibility and conditions for the MSCs and their induced differentiation. Moreover, cholic acid and its derivates are believed to induce MSC-cholangiocyte differentiation in two-dimensional culture and could affect the MSCs transforming to cholangiocyte-like cells in the hydrogel. Induced-MSC-laden GelMA/PEGDA-PLGA dual-layer tubular scaffold and PLGA single-layer scaffold were transplanted into animal models for assessing the repair effect on bile duct injury. After 12 wk, induced-MSC-laden dual-layer tubular scaffold promoted bile duct repairing and enhanced more intact biliary epithelium regenerating compared to PLGA single-layer scaffold. Therefore, the induced-MSC-laden dual-layer tubular scaffold with superior biocompatibility and distinct function of inducing differentiation exerted a satisfactory effect on bile duct regeneration and could provide an ideal option for the clinical treatment of bile duct injury in the future.},

  abstract     = {Abalone shells, which contain both organic and inorganic matter, can facilitate bone remodeling and have been used to fabricate three-dimensional (3D)-printed scaffolds for bone regeneration. Herein, polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds were fabricated using 3D printing with abalone shell particles (ASPs) used in high-temperature processing. ASPs were heated to approximately the melting point of PCL and thermally embedded in 3D-printed PCL using a relatively simple process. The morphology and roughness of the composite scaffold changed according to the weight of ASPs used. The scaffolds were grouped as follows: ASP25 (25 mg), ASP50 (50 mg), and ASP100 (100 mg). The ASP25 group exhibited optimum cell viability and proliferation because of the direct influence of roughness and rapid pH changes. The ASP25 and ASP100 groups showed the highest alkaline phosphatase activity. This could be attributed to the effect of the alkaline environment, dissolution of calcium ions, and presence of bioactive molecules in the ASPs that could support bone regeneration. Therefore, the ASP25 group was the most suitable for fabricating bone scaffolds. This study revealed the potential applicability of ASP-embedded scaffolds in bone tissue engineering involving natural bio-organisms that self-mineralize in a process similar to human bone formation.},

In this study, nanofiber containing composite meshes with three PP substrates were produced by integrating the NFM barrier compositing poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) and polycaprolactone (PLGA/PCL) into each PP mesh. Tensile mechanical test results revealed that the PP component played a dominant role in the mechanical support, and this structure has not deteriorated in any case during the process. In vitro cell studies showed that the PP mesh with a higher density was significantly beneficial for cell proliferation within 3 days of seeding, while the one with lower density exhibited notable cell proliferation after a culture of 5 days. All the meshes had excellent biocompatibility. Moreover, an intraperitoneal implantation rabbit model was used to assess the anti-adhesion effects and tissue compatibility. The results revealed that the NFM barrier could be incorporated into the lightweight PP mesh to yield the composite mesh with superior anti-adhesion property and tissue compatibility.},

A vast majority of such resists are formulated in water and suffer from swelling-related inhomogeneities during microfabrication. Hence formulation HPRs in non-aqueous media are being studied as an alternative. This approach enables controlled swelling of fabricated structures. In this work, we demonstrate that controlled swelling of hydrogel microstructures fabricated by two-photon lithography (TPL) can be used to drive 2D to 2.5D transitions in flat microstructures. Through fabrication experiments, mechanical analysis and finite element method (FEM) simulations we have shown that swelling delamination leads to bend microstructures, and the height of the resulting bend structure depends on the designed thickness of the structure.},

Fused filament fabrication (FFF) was explored as the method of fabrication and prototypes were printed in commercial grade Polylactic Acid (PLA). The subsequent in-silico morphology assessment revealed that the pore sizes ranged from 4.0 to 11.8 mm with a total porosity of 71\%. The morphological maps capture the distinct geometry shift between as-designed and as-manufactured scaffolds with an average agreement of 76\% where most of the deviations were caused by complications innate to 3D printing. Finite element method models were developed to evaluate mechanical properties and the failure locations of the scaffold were accurately predicted, which was validated by the subsequent quasi-static compression test. This study revealed the potential of the Voronoi tessellation to design patient specific bone scaffolds with macro pore sizes that mimic trabecular bone geometry and concluded that FFF is a suitable method of fabrication for it.},

However, the weak connection between panel and lattice is the bottleneck problem restricting their application. To solve this problem, this work demonstrates a novel circular scanning connection method based on pulse hot-wire arc additive manufacturing (PHWAAM) to connect the centimeter-scale and meter-scale panel. This method exhibits great connection quality (without unmelted holes) and high efficiency (about 60 s for each connection). The optimized process is studied, based on systematical analysis of the microstructure, the macro defects, and the compression testing results. By comparing and analyzing three different connection modes, the optimized circular scanning process has the advantages of low heat input and high deposition efficiency. It can be observed from the microstructure that there are equiaxed crystals and short columnar crystals in the connection area. The width of acicular α phase is finer than that of other processes, which is conducive to improving the mechanical properties. The connection area of the circular scanning process has a better matching of strength and plasticity through the compression test. Finally, the proposed connection method is also applicable to fabricate multi-cell lattice sandwich structure.},

In terms of structural design, besides geometric configurations, we propose a theoretical model to qualitatively analyze the relationship between geometric parameters and structural properties. For actual mechanical properties, an approximate method is presented to decouple the structural deformation based on marks’ displacements. With the assistance of quasi-static compression tests and finite element simulation, the relationship between geometric parameters and elastic mechanical properties is studied. The experimental results are in good agreement with the simulation results. Meanwhile, the special coupled compression-torsion deformation mode is also discussed. Finally, we briefly study the extension effect of the structure in a larger space through numerical simulations. These results are helpful to further optimize the geometric design for customized structural performance to a certain degree.},

  abstract     = {This work deals with the elastic and plastic properties of two-dimensional periodic metamaterials. Design maps are developed to ensure their isotropic elastic response while attaining the theoretical stiffness limits. Numerical simulations of two different topologies - triangular and round hole staggered patterns - are performed to analyze their large deformation response for relative densities ranging from 0.1 to 0.9. The investigations show that the strength of triangular perforated plates is profoundly dependent on the unit cells’ direction concerning the axial loading; 0 and 30 degrees have the lowest and highest yield strength over the entire range of volume fractions. In contrast, the round hole staggered patterns exhibit an almost uniform yield strength in all directions. The yield strength of the circular patterns is significantly lower at low- and intermediate-density ranges; whereas they outperform the triangular ones at relative densities higher than 0.6. Additionally, validation experiments are performed on specimens of 0.3 relative density that have been extracted from DP980 steel sheets using micro waterjet cutting, showing good agreement in terms of force-displacement response and surface strain fields. A foam-like structure is built from periodic sheets and the scaling of the elastic properties of the resulting hierarchical 3D metamaterial are discussed.},

  abstract     = {For unidirectional loaded specimens consisting of isotropic-homogeneous ductile materials, an analytical elastoplastic model for the equivalent stress and strain of the representative volume element at the median point were derived based on energy density equivalence and dimensional analysis. Then, a data processing method for various specimen types was proposed to obtain the equivalent stress–strain in real time without presetting the constitutive parameters. Finite element analyses of six specimen types and experiments with four selected specimen types were conducted to verify the method. The results show that the stress–strain curves obtained using this method were consistent with the preset stress–strain curves in the finite element analysis and with the standard tensile results. Using the proposed model and relevant data processing method to obtain the stress–strain curves is effective and, with the theoretical basis, could promote the application of non-tradition and small specimens for obtaining the material mechanical properties.},

  abstract     = {Anisotropy of mechanical properties has limited the further application of Al–Cu–Li alloys. Previous research efforts were mostly focused on the anisotropic tensile properties. In the present study, significant hardness anisotropy evolution, measured during artificial aging, was also established when loading in different directions. It was found that different amounts of inclined/face-on would be encountered when loading along different directions, resulting from the fiber texture and inhomogeneous distribution of T 1 (Al 2 CuLi) variants along different directions for the samples without pre-stretching. The resistance to hardness loading is different between the face-on/inclined T 1 and edge-on T 1 due to its high aspect ratio, so the measured anisotropic hardness is obtained. Moreover, the characteristics of precipitates also play an important role in the anisotropic hardness evolution, the strong anisotropy of hardness only appears in the alloys that contained large diameters and a low density of T 1 phase or θ&#39; (Al 2 Cu) phase. After applying pre-stretching, the predominant T 1 phase precipitates with small diameters and a high density, which helps to facilitate the isotropic hardness evolution during artificial aging. These findings provide a necessary supplement for the hardness evaluation where a high aspect ratio of precipitate is involved.},

However, susceptibility towards cracking limits the formability performance of these coatings. In this study, we focus on the effect of the underlying steel substrate on cracking behavior in these coatings. In order to elucidate this, a high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) steel substrate and an interstitial-free (IF) steel substrate are coated with two different ZnAlMg coatings with and without binary eutectic microstructures. Meticulous in-situ tensile and bending tests are conducted in a scanning electron microscope. To quantify the strain distribution and damage incidents, micro and macro digital image correlation techniques are utilized in order to illuminate the associated cracking causes across length scales. Furthermore, electron backscatter diffraction method is applied to study the role of crystallographic orientation on the cracking tendency. Crack opening and crack area fractions are correlated with the applied strain and bending angles. The findings denote that the discontinuous yielding (Lüders banding) of the HSLA steel substrate generates substantial surface roughening and heterogeneous deformation in the coatings that facilitates cracking. In contrast, the IF steel induces a more uniform deformation within the coatings leading to much reduced crack size and crack area fraction. This study has resulted in a key element of a guideline towards crack-resistant and formable Mg-alloyed zinc coatings.},

Therefore, a design and manufacturing optimization procedure for fiber-reinforced structural adhesives and multiaxial testing was developed. It incorporated a finite element parametric study to minimize stress concentrations in the specimen geometry. Vacuum speed mixing was combined with 3D printed mold inserts to enable the manufacture of homogeneous specimens with negligible porosity. The method was demonstrated by means of a structural adhesive used to manufacture wind turbine rotor blades, while the manufacturing quality was verified with high-resolution X-ray microscopy ( μ μ CT scanning), enabling detailed detection of pores and geometrical imperfections. The results of uniaxial and biaxial static tests show maximized strength and stiffness properties, while the scatter was minimized in comparison to that stated in international literature. A comparison of the mechanical properties and associated manufacturing techniques is given.

Applying a continuum micromechanics multiscale approach, we herein aim at upscaling of microstructural features to quantify the bricks’ macroscopic properties. Microstructural features such as assemblage and morphometry of mineral phases (quartz, feldspar, and micas), of pores, and of the binding matrix phase, respectively, as well as thermoelastic phase properties are provided by recently published results from extensive microscopic testing including electron microscopy imaging, mercury intrusion porosimetry, nanoindentation, and scanning thermal microscopy. These results are incorporated into the micromechanics model by introducing spheroidal phases with characteristic orientation distribution at two observation scales. The homogenized macroscopic stiffness and conductivity agree very well with independent results from novel macroscopic tests for all seven studied brick compositions. This corroborates the microstructure-informed multiscale model approach and its assumptions: the linear increase of the binding matrix properties with the material’s carbonate content, and the inability of large quartz with interface cracks to take over any mechanical loads.},

In the experiment, some important three-dimensional crack initiation and propagation evolution phenomena were observed, such as the multi-point bursting, progressive propagation and spatial network arrangement of cracks and the reverse ‘C’-shaped cracks, which may have great contribution to the load-bearing capacity and toughness of the shell. According to the mechanical analysis of the visualized evolutionary information of the deformation and fracture of hierarchical microstructures, a strengthening and toughening regulation mechanisms that driven by the local stress concentration, and guided by the hierarchical structure and weak interface was proposed.

Based on the BBC2008 yield criterion, the uniaxial yield stresses, r θ rθ -values, yield loci on the normal plane, and shear yield loci on the diagonal plane, predicted using six parameter identification strategies, were quantitatively evaluated for MP980, DP490, 6016-T4, and 5182-O. Results show the constraining and regulation ability of the equi-biaxial tensile data for yield loci to be better than that of near-plane strain state data. The parameter identification strategy considering the non-integer exponent was observed to significantly improved the ability of the yield criterion to describe the anisotropic yield behavior. For a simplified evaluation system that considers only the prediction accuracy of the yield locus under the principal stress state, neglecting the prediction accuracy for the shear yield locus may lead to incorrect judgments regarding the best identification strategy.},

  abstract     = {Abrasive waterjet peening (AWJP) is a new mechanical surface treatment where particles are delivered by a waterjet to induce plastic deformation and achieve surface strengthening effects on a workpiece. Although fatigue strength can be improved by inducing compressive residual stress, the prediction of residual stress distribution remains challenging because particle–workpiece interaction occurs with randomicity, superposition, and overlapping. In this paper, a theoretical model is proposed for predicting workpiece plastic deformation and compressive residual stress by analysing i) the non-uniform energy distribution of the AWJP beam caused by the non-uniformity of the abrasive size, spatial distribution, and impact velocity; ii) material hardening among multiple impacts by abrasive particles; and iii) overlapping traces induced by the changing position of the AWJP beam. The AWJP experiments were conducted in single-pass/multiple-pass/multiple-overlapping footprints with different pump pressures, traverse speeds, and jet centre distances of the adjacent traces to validate the model. The results showed good agreement with the predicted surface roughness and compressive residual stress. Compressive residual stress increased with the pump pressure, whereas the effect of pump pressure change rate decreased when the pump pressure was increased; further, residual stress is nearly constant with the variation in traverse speed and jet centre distance of the adjacent traces when it decreases to a certain value. These results can act as references for the control of residual stress and the prediction model can aid industrial manufacturing in AWJP parameter optimisation (e.g. pump pressure, traverse speed, surface roughness, compressive residual stress, and centre distance between two adjacent traces).},

Herein, we report a novel polyurethane (PU)/epoxy (EP) interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) damping material by using 21-hydroxyl β-cyclodextrins (β-CDs) as PU chain extenders. At a high ratio of hydroxyls to isocyanate groups, every β-CD underwent a different degree of chain expansion. Then these β-CDs grafting different numbers of PU chains generated different-size hard segments, thus increasing the species of motion units and widening the damping temperature range. The unreacted hydroxyls on β-CDs provided a large quantity of hydrogen bonding protons, which could form hydrogen bonds with urethane groups, thus facilitating an increase in the tanδ value. Therefore, PU/EP IPNs with a broad high-damping temperature range were successfully prepared. The results showed that PU/EP IPNs cured by β-CDs underwent a damping temperature range of 93.1 K (tanδ &gt; 0.5), 82.4 K (tanδ &gt; 0.7) and even 74.1 K (tanδ &gt; 0.8), much better than the corresponding 32.9 K, 23.9 K and 20.5 K for traditional PU/EP IPNs cured by trihydroxyl trimethylolpropane (TMP).},

Driven by the trend towards miniaturization, micro metal forming techniques with characteristic forming dimensions approaching a few microns have developed rapidly over the past two decades. In contrast, the assessment of microscale friction is lagging. Here, we present a novel test, compression molding and demolding test (CMDT), to assess stiction and friction at the microscale. CMDT was conducted via in-situ instrumented molding and demolding of an Al specimen with cylindrical tool steel and Ti alloy punches. High-rate data acquisition enabled direct measurements, for the first time, of microscale stiction and friction forces during disengagement between the punches and the molded Al under dry contact conditions. Stiction and friction stresses were then deduced and analyzed. The average friction coefficient was estimated by combining the cavity expansion model and finite element method analysis. Examinations suggest that punch geometry and surface finish, together with the accuracy of estimating the sidewall contact pressure, influence the obtained friction coefficient values. CMDT exhibits merits such as high operation simplicity and measurement accuracy and offers an alternative approach to providing new experimental evidence for a range of microscale friction problems.},

The investigation with a coaxial high-speed camera to capture thermal radiation of spatters and an off-axis high-speed camera for a qualitative observation of the melt pool led to a better understanding of spatter generation. The results showed dependency of power and scan velocity on the number of spatters. Furthermore, we showed that the application of multi-beams preserves the number of spatters per track at higher applied power. Due to the wide melt pools and fewer required hatches, the total number of spatters in a generated part was significantly reduced. In addition, by means of high-speed recordings, it was shown that melt pools with high volume have a higher stability against impurities of the powder bed and spatters.

  abstract     = {Composite material development via laser-based additive manufacturing offers many exciting advantages to manufacturers; however, a significant challenge exists in our understanding of process-property relationships for these novel materials. Herein we investigate the effect of input processing parameters towards designing an oxidation-resistant titanium matrix composite. By adjusting the linear input energy density, a composite feedstock of titanium-boron carbide-boron nitride (5 wt\% overall reinforcement) resulted in a highly reinforced microstructure composed of borides and carbides and nitrides, with variable properties depending on the overall input energy. Crack-free titanium-matrix composites with hardness as high as 700 ± 17 HV 0.2/15 and 99.1\% relative density were achieved, with as high as a 33\% decrease in oxidation mass gain in the air relative to commercially pure titanium at 700 °C for 50 h. Single-tracks and bulk samples were fabricated to understand the processing characteristics and in situ reactions during processing. Our results indicate that input processing parameters can play a significant role in the oxidation resistance of titanium matrix composites and can be exploited by manufacturers for improving component performance and high temperature designs.},

The evolving microstructures and properties were measured using optical microcopy, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and nano-indentation up to and beyond when layer instabilities are observed. The evolution of layer morphology, grain size, bulk texture, layer dependent texture, and layer dependent hardness is found to be both material dependent and layer location dependent. Ultimately, the evolving difference in layer hardness between Fe and the fcc metal resulting from the microstructure evolution causes the formation of layer instabilities with the Fe Al exhibiting layer pinch-off at a total strain of 2.2, the Fe Ag developing shear band instabilities at a strain of 3.2, and the Fe Cu developing shear band instabilities at a strain of 4.5. These finding indicate that once the evolving strength ratio approaches two, processing changes, such as annealing or warm rolling, that improve the strength ratio or materials’ capacity for work hardening are necessary for further processing without layer instabilities.},

  abstract     = {Origami-based metamaterial has shown remarkable mechanical properties rarely found in natural materials, but achieving tailored multistage stiffness is still challenging. We propose a novel zigzag-base stacked-origami (ZBSO) metamaterial with tailored multistage stiffness based on crease customization and stacking strategies. A high precision finite element (FE) model to identify the stiffness characteristics of the ZBSO metamaterial has been established, and its accuracy is validated by quasi-static compression experiments. Using the verified FE model, we demonstrate that the multistage stiffness of the ZBSO metamaterial can be effectively tailored through two manners, i.e. varying the microstructures (through introducing new creases to the classical Miura origami unit cell) and altering the stacking way. Three strategies are utilized to vary the microstructure, i.e. adding new creases to the right, left, or both sides of the unit cell. We demonstrate that the multistage stiffness is caused by both the self-locking and asymmetrical stiffness distribution of the ZBSO metamaterial. We further reveal that the proposed ZBSO metamaterial has several outstanding advantages compared with traditional mechanical metamaterials, e.g. material independent, scale-invariant, lightweight, and excellent energy absorption capacity. The unraveled superior mechanical properties of the ZBSO metamaterials pave the way for designing the next-generation cellular metamaterials with tailored stiffness properties.},

In this work, expanded polycarbonate (EPC) with microcellullar structure and low density have been produced for the first time using the autoclave bead foaming technique. The effect of the processing parameters, such as the saturation temperature and time, on the characteristics of the EPC bead foams, is analyzed. Contrary to the total amorphous structure of the solid material, the obtained EPC foams present a crystalline phase characterized by a melting peak around 235 °C. The crystallization process might be taking place during the saturation of the samples with CO 2 . Results show that the saturation temperature allows controlling density, whereas foaming time can be used as a tool to control crystallinity degree in the range from 7.5 to 45 min, without a clear influence on the cellular structure. EPC with densities between 116 and 592 kg/m 3 , cell sizes of approximately 4–5 µm, and crystallinities ranging 0–11\% were produced by a proper modification of the foaming parameters. Then, the use of different saturation parameters allows controlling the density and thermal properties of the EPC, thanks to the autoclave bead foaming process.},

The ablation behaviour was studied in-situ with thermography, and the post-ablation morphologies investigated optically and with elemental analysis. Significantly lower surface temperatures were observed at oblique angles of attack leading to less damage in terms of both oxidation extent and material removal. Rudimentary modelling of a gas stream impinging on a perfect surface showed that the angular variation also led to a significant drop in pressure at more oblique angles of attack, with a commensurate increase in shear stress. The surface oxide formed during testing seemed mainly to correspond to the temperature distribution and was apparently more susceptible to damage from higher impinging pressure than shear stress. This study elucidated some interesting aspects of a modified ablation test and showed some new parameter ranges which may be useful in targeted material screening.},

The feasibility of such an in-situ alloy-hardening strategy is theoretically designed according to the Fe/Al intermetallic compound formation chemical reaction using the Gibbs free energy principle and the TG-DSC testing, and thus the experimental thermodynamics temperature and time ranges of such chemical reactions are proposed. Experimental results shown that a densely zigzag-like uniform alloy-hardening layer with a thickness of about 11 μm, which are composed of Fe 3 Al, FeAl, and Fe 2 Al 5 intermetallic compounds, was in-situ chemically synthesized on the surface of the spherical carbonyl Fe powders.

Tumor acidity also represents a tumor-specific stimulus that has been harnessed for the design and development of pH-responsive drug delivery systems. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) functions as an oncoprotein in tumorigenesis, and its overexpression in many tumors promotes metabolic rewiring towards aerobic glycolysis. Herein, a pH low insertion peptide (pHLIP)-functionalized copolymer of polyethylenimine and polylactide (pHLIP-PEI-PLA) was synthesized and self-assembled into a pH-responsive nanovehicle for delivery of siRNA to specifically target PKM2, a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis. The delivery of siPKM2 by pHLIP-decorated polymeric nanovehicle sufficiently downregulated the expression of PKM2 and exhibited potent inhibition on HepG2 cell migration. We believe that this strategy of targeting glycolysis-associated PKM2 gene by tumor acidity-responsive RNAi nanovehicle may offer a potential means for anticancer therapy.},

Here, we develop a novel heparanase degradable heparin-based microcarrier, HBMA, for specific staining, targeting, and inhibiting tumor cells with high metastatic potential. HBMA is fabricated through self-assembling of three components, positively charged fluorescent gold nanoclusters (KG-AuNCs), heparin polymers (HP), and antisense miRNA-21 oligonucleotides (AM-21), with each component playing multiple roles. Results of confocal microscopy and flow cytometry show that this agent has an excellent capability to label metastatic tumor cells with high selectivity. On the therapeutic side, the results of cell viability assay, wound healing assay, and plate colony formation assay verify that HBMA induces a significant inhibition effect towards the proliferation and migration of the selectively target tumor cells. The heparanase responsive AM-21 delivery, the specific staining, and the efficient tumor cell activity suppression highlight HBMA as a promising cancer theranostic agent to prevent tumor metastasis.},

OM, EBSD, and TEM analysis revealed the three typical regions in SCS. Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) preferred to occur in the slot region due to the strain concentration, where the Mises equivalent strain was about 4–6 times higher than the pre-set ones. Mixed grains were observed in the transition region because of insufficient deformation. In contrast, equiaxial grains were preserved in the cylindrical region with negligible deformation. Experimental stress decreased with the increase of temperature and decrease of strain rate. The maximum stress was 180 MPa, which was only 30\% of that under single compression deformation. Furthermore, four DRX mechanisms were observed in GH4169. Discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) and continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) were the dominant and auxiliary mechanisms, respectively. Twinning dynamic recrystallization (TDRX) occurred in the annealing twins with a fast nucleation rate, and the intersected nano-twins provided favorable nucleation sites for DRX. Lastly, secondary dynamic recrystallization (SDRX) with unique nucleation mechanism of triangularly intersecting subgrain boundaries emerged in SCS, which nucleated in the DRX grains and further refined the microstructure of GH4169.},

A two-step phase separation synthesis protocol is designed based on a ternary solution of PDMS that contains both a nonsolvent and solvent. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and Toluene with various mixing ratios are utilized as a solvent phase for inducing two-step phase separation. Two distinct pore size distributions are observed in the cast PDMS sheets. The large pores with an average of 509 µm are formed during the first-step phase separation due to evaporation of THF. The second-step phase separation occurs later at higher temperatures due to evaporation of Toluene, resulting in much smaller pores with an average size of 28 µm. The experimental results reveal that increasing the THF/solvent ratio increases the concentration of large pores and decreases small pore density. Tensile testing of dog bone-shaped porous PDMS sheets shows that the modulus varies between 0.64 and 0.95 MPa, indicating that the synthesis protocol can control the porous structure with a wide range of flexibility while keeping the density constant. An empirical relationship between elastic modulus and pore size is developed, promising in designing the PDMS porous structures for various engineering applications.},

However, it is inevitable to bring about mechanical deviation and local yield for MMs infilled lightweight structures. In the current work, MMs mapped structures, named as MMs-TO-PSLs, are proposed. The design domain is divided into core-region, intermediate-region, and solid-region. Core-regions derived from topology optimization (TO) are mapped with MMs, of which the [1 0 0] orientations are aligned with the normal directions of principal stress lines (PSLs). The intermediate-regions are infilled with ribbons according to PSLs. The solid regions are allocated to stress concentrated areas. Finally, near isotropic mechanical response is achieved in core-region from anisotropic MMs, and the serious local deformation is eased. To validate such approach, the mapping strategy is carried out on a beam subjected to three-point bending. Metallic MMs-TO-PSLs and MMs infilled uniform lightweight structure are fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). Elastoplastic simulations with ductile failure model are proposed to investigate the strengthen mechanism of MMs-TO-PSLs. Experimental and numerical results confirmed the ultimate strength of MMs-TO-PSLs can be 40\% larger than conventional MMs infilled uniform structures.},

In this theoretical work, a new discrete (combinatorial) strategy is proposed that allows for capturing all sub-structures, employing elements of algebraic topology and modern graph theory. It is demonstrated how this strategy can be applied to the flexible design of nano-structured ceramics with a superior balance between conductivity and resistance to fracture.},

  abstract     = {Thermally conductive polymer composites with high glass transition temperatures ( T g ) are of interest for electronic devices in aerospace applications. Here, epoxy/boron nitride (BN) composites were fabricated using a highly heat-resistant epoxy as a polymer matrix and epoxysilane functionalized BN as thermally conductive filler. These composites exhibited excellent processability and high T g of up to 275 °C. Moreover, the linear expansion coefficient ( α ) of the composite with a BN content of 30 wt\% (48.89 × 10 −6 °C −1 ) was 15\% smaller than that of the pristine epoxy. The use of epoxysilane functionalized BN provided improved dispersibility in the epoxy matrix, thus reducing the interface thermal resistance and increasing the thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of the composite containing 30 wt\% BN was 142\% higher than that of the epoxy alone at 25 °C, and this excellent thermal conductivity was maintained at temperatures up to 150 °C. Furthermore, the single-lap shear strength at 150 °C reached 11.66 MPa. Notably, the prepared thermally conductive composite with outstanding thermal management characteristics exhibited excellent performance when used as a thermal interface material for electronic devices.},

While thermoplastic based systems are considered to be tougher, toughness levels can be dependent on processing parameters. In this study, Polyether imide (PEI) film layers were added to carbon fibre-reinforced Polyether ether ketone (CF/PEEK) laminate layups prior to consolidation to enhance the interlaminar toughness at key ply interfaces. It was found that the addition of the PEI film improves the Mode I and Mode II interlaminar toughness of the laminate. Low-velocity impact tests were performed on the PEI toughened CF/PEEK laminates, as well as a baseline CF/PEEK laminate and a CF/PEEK laminate with PEEK film inserts, for direct laminate thickness comparison. For low energy impacts (10 J), associated with tool drop events, it was found that the PEI toughened panel performed best. However, the performance difference decreased as the impact energy increased. Ultrasonic scans indicated that PEI toughened CF/PEEK laminates exhibited a smaller damage footprint. Compression after impact (CAI) and Combined Loading Compression (CLC) tests revealed that although the PEI inserts reduce the laminate undamaged compressive strength, they exhibited higher relative residual strengths compared to the other laminates tested.},

Nevertheless, where locally melting the powder by an electron beam, there is a risk that Al evaporates due to its high vapor pressure, causing compositional and microstructural variations. This work investigates the impact of different process parameters on the total and local Al-content as well as the resulting as-built and heat-treated microstructure in a complex multiphase Ti-44.8Al-4.1Nb-0.7W-1.1Zr-0.4Si-0.5C-0.1B (at.\%) alloy. The examinations applied are complementary, employing electron microscopy, X-ray spectroscopy and diffraction experiments with synchrotron X-ray radiation, supported by numerical simulations. The mechanical anisotropy of the heat-treated microstructure was analyzed by micro-hardness measurements. The results demonstrate that the amount of γ γ -TiAl phase decreases with increasing energy input of the electron beam in the as-built and heat-treated microstructure owing to the total and local loss of Al. Besides, the investigations of the crystal orientations within the multiphase alloy reveal a preferred orientation of the γ γ phase at high energy inputs. This follows from the fact that the preferred γ γ orientation is inherited through directional solidification of the β β phase. The obtained process-microstructure-property relationships show that tailor-made material properties of additively manufactured γ γ -TiAl components are achievable.},

Samples with TBA amounts of 100, 90, 80 and 0 wt\% were stable during preparation at −20 °C. Using TBA or CH creates prismatic or dendritic pore structures, respectively, while a mixture of these solvents generates honeycomb-like pore structures. A constant freezing rate produces homogeneous pore window sizes while freezing with velocity gradients produces inhomogeneous pore window sizes. Variations in the amount of TBA led to pore sizes between 11 and 57 µm and consequently to water permeabilities of 4.4 × 10 - 13 to 1.4 × 10 - 11 m 2 . The dendritic pore structure has the highest compressive strength (39 MPa) due to its smallest pore sizes (16–20 µm) and secondary dendrites. In wicking experiments, these structural properties and the lowest permeability resulted in the slowest wicking rate in contrast to prismatic pore structures with the biggest pore sizes (31–57 µm) and highest permeability. Honeycomb-like pore structures allow medium wicking rates with the pore size being the main influencing factor. The adjustment of the solvent allows tailoring the mass transport and mechanical properties as key elements in capillary transport applications.},

  abstract     = {Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, which is estimated to affect approximately 112 million people by 2040. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most important risk factor for glaucoma, as well as the primary target for the treatment. Current therapies aim at IOP reduction to prevent the disease progression. The accurate and real-time measurement of IOP is therefore critical to evaluate treatment response and guide medical decisions. However, IOP fluctuates throughout the 24-hour cycle with different patterns from day to day in the same individual and also different patterns among individuals. The current clinical practice typically captures a single IOP measurement during “in-office hours”, and this is insufficient for disease monitoring. With the development of wearable electronic devices, a variety of IOP monitoring devices provide a unique potential for continuous IOP monitoring. In addition to IOP monitoring for glaucoma management, this mini-review also summarizes novel drug delivery devices for treating glaucoma. Because certain types of glaucoma do not show elevated IOP, we also discuss the potential to incorporate biomarker detection with IOP measurement for more accurate and reliable glaucoma diagnostics and therapies.},

The FTIR and TGA results confirm the absolute content of MAPE grafted on WF was 4.5\% and 0.9\% for the UH-WPCs with 80 wt\% WF using MAPE as matrix and compatibilizer, respectively. The UH-WPCs using MAPE as matrix or compatibilizer exhibited considerable higher mechanical properties, better creep resistance, and lower water absorption compared to the uncompatibilized ones.

These results reveal that the mechanical properties of the UH-WPCs with MAPE were not positively correlated with the absolute content of MAPE grafted on WF. The above findings confirmed that the esterification was not the key determinant for interfacial adhesion mechanisms using MAPE as compatibilizer in UH-WPCs, and some other more important factors may exist.},

However, it’s difficult to accurately forecast the mechanical properties of these braided-textile composites based on theoretical method, which is a big obstacle to the precise design of the energy-absorbing structure. In this research, carbon fiber reinforced composite (CFRC) tubular structures were fabricated by two-dimensional braided textiles, and 160 groups of orthogonal axial compression experiments were carried out. Axial compression behaviors of CFRC tubular structures, including peak force, mean crushing force, energy absorption, specific energy absorption, elastic modulus and other relevant parameters, were tested and collected in a database. The feed forward back propagation (FFBP) algorithm based on artificial neural network (ANN), as an algorithm with high convergence accuracy in machine learning (ML), was adapted to build a prediction model to forecast the overall axial compression properties of those CFRC tubular structures uncollected in the database. By a series of error analyses, the ML method was proven to have high accuracy in predicting the relevant mechanical properties within the range of orthogonal design groups. Although the relative error of marginal sample data (especially single-layer tubes) is large, the mean absolute error ( MAE ) of training set and test set is only about 5\% and 10\%, respectively. Our work demonstrates the potential of machine learning methods in predicting the overall mechanical properties and guiding the design of composite materials.},

The experiments reveal that process parameters qualified for the virgin powder are not working offhand for the reused powder, as an increase of porosity from less than 1\% up to 3\% and a decline of tensile strength as well as yield strength of about 15\% are observed. The results indicate that powder degradation, which is based on the formation of hydroxides and oxides, has a significant impact on as-built microstructure as well as mechanical properties of additively manufactured parts.

Here reversible colour change of Disperse Red 1/polyvinylpyrrolidone films resulting from humidity annealing and subsequent stretching is reported. Due to the humidity-induced blue shift of the absorbance peak related to exciton coupling of the chromophores, the tone of films abruptly changes from red to orange. Upon stretching, the gradual disaggregation of the chromophores takes place and therefore the colour switches back to red in a stepless manner. Using either red–green–blue analysis of time lapse photography or UV–Visible measurements, this transformation, which is also well visible by the naked eye, can be followed with high accuracy. This work offers the opportunity to apply the strain sensor in humid environments to prevent the mechanical failures by showing a colour change in areas subjected to undesired stress. Moreover, dip-coating yarns with mechanochromic coating allows fabrication of functional yarns that change their colour based on their stretching state – thus enabling preparation of colour-changing stretchable textiles was demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Chromium (Cr)-coated zirconium alloys have been considered as a promising candidate material for accident-tolerant fuel (ATF) cladding for nuclear reactors because of their superior oxidation resistance under accident conditions. However, the oxidation and diffusion behaviours that occur in the Cr coating–Zr substrate system at high temperatures significantly affect the microstructure and mechanical properties of the coating, leading to cracking modes that are distinct from those of the as-deposited coating. To understand the effects of oxidation and inter-diffusion on the fracture mechanisms of Cr-coated Zry-4 alloys, in situ three-point bending tests were conducted in this study. Crack initiation and propagation in the oxidised and vacuum-annealed coatings were observed in real time. The results showed that high-temperature exposure led to recrystallisation of the Cr coating (columnar grains transformed into equiaxed grains), which greatly enhanced the crack resistance of the Cr coating. However, a diffusion-induced intermetallic ZrCr 2 layer and an α-Zr(O) layer (which transformed from β-Zr owing to oxygen transportation) formed simultaneously at the coating/substrate interface. The micro-cracks formed in these brittle layers rapidly penetrated all the layers under external load, leading to premature failure of the coated sample.},

  abstract     = {Airborne sound absorption coefficient is the premise for investigating the sound absorption performance or mechanism of metaporous materials. The common numerical evaluation approach is FEM which is relatively computationally costly particularly when processing complex structures or a large batch of data. Rapidly developing deep learning algorithms, on the other hand, show a promising trend in the data-driven manner to learn and predict material parameters efficiently and precisely. We propose SAP-net based on deep convolutional neural network to predict the sound absorption coefficient at a specific frequency of an input image representing the topological structure of metaporous materials. Trained with FEM-prepared data for six frequency points, SAP-net demonstrates outstanding evaluation speed of 0.007 s/image and brilliant prediction accuracy with mean absolute errors all smaller than 0.019 (the smallest 0.008 at f = 1000 Hz). Meanwhile, the fact that SAP-net remains accurate when predicting for images that are essentially different from those in the training data shows its capability of learning and capturing the underlying physical mechanism linking the topological structure to the sound absorption performance. In conclusion, SAP-net provides an extraordinarily fast and accurate approach for the investigation of sound absorption performance, which is expected to accelerate the examination and design process of materials.},

Here, TIM systems based on irregular quadrilateral square tessellations are considered. The mechanical properties of such TIM assemblies are investigated and compared to those of the periodic reference TIM system. Finite element computations are performed to obtain force - deflection curves and to extract stiffness, strength, and toughness. We discover that a significant fraction (about 30\%) of all randomly generated architectures possess properties exceeding those of the TIM with an underlying regular tessellation. We validate this finding by experiments on 3D printed physical realizations. Design parameters to represent the mechanical properties are studied by the use of Pearson correlation coefficients. In this process, dominant variables are determined and regression models for the properties are defined from the underlying design variables. By considering the dominant variables, network patterns in the assembly are discovered, which are strongly associated with each of the mechanical properties. The findings of this study enable the design of architectured material systems with exceptional stiffness-strength-toughness combinations.},

The surface particles experienced different thermal effects that significantly changed their microstructure with each other and with respect to the main surface, which remarkably affected the corrosion properties. The densities, hardness, and tensile properties of the samples were also presented and interpreted their relations with corrosion.

The realization of the geometric arrangement required to achieve a negative Poisson’s ratio relies considerably on the experience of designers and trial-and-error approaches. This report proposes an inverse design method for auxetic metamaterials using deep learning, in which a batch of auxetic metamaterials with a user-defined Poisson’s ratio and Young’s modulus can be generated by a conditional generative adversarial network without prior knowledge. The network was trained based on supervised learning using a large number of geometrical patterns generated by Voronoi tessellation. The performance of the network was demonstrated by verifying the mechanical properties of the generated patterns using finite element method simulations and uniaxial compression tests. The successful realization of user-desired properties can potentially accelerate the inverse design and development of mechanical metamaterials.},

The ML-SSH model is built by considering critical factors in SSH theories and parameters associated with the atomic environment and interactions in HEAs as input features, and is demonstrated to be superior to physical SSH models in terms of hardness prediction. The effects of charge transfer and short range order (SRO) and local composition fluctuations on SSH in HEAs are confirmed using feature engineering approaches. Furthermore, two physical models are modified by introducing charge transfer to enhance their accuracy. Finally, an alloy design system is built by combining the ML-SSH model and ML models for single solid solution phase prediction, achieving good agreement with the experimental results of FeNiCuCo and CrMoNbTi families. The non-equiatomic counterparts with 28.3\%\% and 8.8\%\% hardness values higher than their equiatomic counterparts of FeNiCuCo and CrMoNbTi families respectively are discovered.},

Owing to these modifications, the brittle η phase, which is stable in C-263 below 900 °C is no longer observed in C-264. Besides, the solvus temperature and volume fraction of the γ′ phase in the peak-aged state are larger in C-264 (∼935 °C, 13.5\%) compared to C-263 (∼890 °C, 12.8\%), resulting in superior tensile and creep properties. The stress and temperature dependencies of the creep rates were described by power-law and Arrhenius relationships. The stress exponents were between 4 and 5, while the apparent activation energies were 550 and 400 kJ/mol for C-264 and C-263, respectively. During creep at 880 °C in air, internal nitridation in both MESAs resulted in the formation of TiN precipitates, with C-264 being slightly more affected due to its higher nitrogen solubility. Due to its superior creep resistance, good malleability and machinability, the C-264 MESA is currently commercially available from VDM Metals International.},

It is a graded metamaterial composed of multiple Miura-ori layers with different acute angles. The effects of different gradients on structural deformation and energy absorption were investigated by experiment and numerical simulation. The results show that the graded metamaterials have higher specific energy absorption (SEA) than the uniform ones. In addition, the graded metamaterials effectively reduce the decreasing amplitude of the compression loading after the peak force and improve the SEA compared with the uniform metamaterials. When the volume of the metamaterials remains the same, the energy absorption increases with the gradient interval size. The metamaterial with a negative gradient from the top and bottom to the middle layer has better energy absorption capacity.},

  abstract     = {The goal of this research is the in-situ detection of flaw formation in metal parts made using the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process. This is an important area of research, because, despite the considerable cost and time savings achieved, precision-driven industries, such as aerospace and biomedical, are reticent in using LPBF to make safety–critical parts due to tendency of the process to create flaws. Another emerging concern in LPBF, and additive manufacturing in general, is related to cyber security – malicious actors may tamper with the process or plant flaws inside a part to compromise its performance. Accordingly, the objective of this work is to develop and apply a physics and data integrated strategy for online monitoring and detection of flaw formation in LPBF parts. The approach used to realize this objective is based on combining (twinning) in-situ meltpool temperature measurements with a graph theory-based thermal simulation model that rapidly predicts the temperature distribution in the part (thermal history). The novelty of the approach is that the temperature distribution predictions provided by the computational thermal model were updated layer-by-layer with in-situ meltpool temperature measurements. This digital twin approach is applied to detect flaw formation in stainless steel (316L) impeller-shaped parts made using a commercial LPBF system. Four such impellers are produced emulating three pathways of flaw formation in LPBF parts, these are: changes in the processing parameters (process drifts); machine-related malfunctions (lens delamination), and deliberate tampering with the process to plant flaws inside the part (cyber intrusions). The severity and nature of the resulting flaws, such as porosity and microstructure heterogeneity, are characterized ex-situ using X-ray computed tomography, optical and scanning electron microscopy, and electron backscatter diffraction. The digital twin approach is shown to be effective for detection of the three types of flaw formation causes studied in this work.},

  abstract     = {Self-setting injectable composite hydrogels are promising materials in tissue engineering. In this study a facile synthetic approach was designed based on traditional sol–gel method to produce particulate calcium aluminosilicate-type glasses, which were then formulated with potassium alginate to form a self-setting injectable hydrogel. In order to control the setting-time and mechanical properties of the composite materials, a series of samples were produced with different starting chemical composition. The change in chemical composition and morphology of the glass particles in response to varying initial Ca 2+ content were further elucidated by a combination of EM, XRF and NMR spectroscopy, revealing that the binary aluminosilicate glass was preferably formed when low Ca content (30\%), calcium aluminosilicates were predominantly formed due to the change in the type of zeolite precursor formed during the low temperature nucleation process in the sol–gel approach. It was also found the hardening times of the alginate gels was positively correlated to the mole ratio of Ca/Al due to high acid resistance of high coordination number Al species. For hydrogels made with glass particle additions, the mechanical strengths were also positively correlated with the Ca/Al ratio for all formulations.},

  abstract     = {As the star material among nonprecious electrocatalysts, molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) has received much attention. However, the catalytic inertness of the basal plane, low conductivity of its steady state (2H phase), and the agglomeration of lamellar structures have seriously hindered its catalytic performance. It is very essential to design and modulate the morphology and phase of MoS 2 to improve the above issues by synergistic regulation of electrical structure and defect engineering. Herein, MoS 2 was delicately composited on CoP nanoframe derived from a typical metal–organic frame nanostructure (ZIF-67), forming the hollow CoP@MoS 2 hetero-nanoframe. This exquisite externally layered and internally hollow CoP@MoS 2 electrocatalyst demonstrated excellent catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low overpotential of 119 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec −1 , a large electric double-layer capacitance of 10.28 mF cm −2 , and prominent long-term stability. The remarkable catalytic performance of hollow CoP@MoS 2 hetero-nanoframe can be attributed to the unique architecture of the hetero-nanostructures, appropriate component ratios, strong interaction between CoP and MoS 2 , and large-scale defects and disorder. First-principles density-functional theory calculations can prove the above arguments adequately, the hydrogen adsorption free energy of CoP@MoS 2 is close to zero.},

Flexible, stretchable, wearable and breathable high-sensitivity sensors that monitor signals from subtle changes in the environment provide solutions for personalized medical healthcare. In this article, we review the fundamental mechanisms, theoretical research, sensor fabrication methodologies, and applications of flexible piezoelectric materials. We focus on the flexibility and stretchability of inorganic, polymer, and bio-piezoelectric materials, explain their properties for physiological signal monitoring, motion detection, and force sensing. We provide an overview of the latest progress in piezoelectronics and piezoelectric photonics, the structures of devices, and self-powering technologies. We compared 10 types of polymers and composites with human skin in terms of elastic modulus and found that PLLA/PDMS, electro-spun PVDF, and ZnO/PVDF possess higher elastic modulus (50, 500, and 27900 MPa respectively) than human skin (18.8 MPa), thus being more suitable for wearable devices. In terms of electrical outputs of piezoelectric materials, polarized cast film has stronger piezoelectric property with output of 14–45.6 V than electro-spun filaments material (output 0.4–9 V). Future research and development should focus on increasing electrical performance while maintaining the required flexibility and durability.},

To obtain maximum performance in terms of mechanical strength, experimental studies were conducted considering the thermal process parameters such as nozzle and chamber temperatures. These optimal process settings and carefully controlled heating conditions, incorporated with post-processing of additional heat treatment, could provide a high degree of crystallinity and high tensile strength (i.e., more than 90\% compared to original material properties). To demonstrate the feasibility of industrial applications, we fabricated and tested several product prototypes, such as a wafer jig, a lathe chuck part, and plastic injection molds, all of which confirmed the excellent performance of PEEK for chemical resistance, high strength, and heat resistance, respectively.},

To fully exploit this useful method, in the present study, we combine the experimental and modeling/simulation studies to elucidate the unique photothermal and thermomechanical processes and to reveal the processing-structure relationship of this novel technique. The processing conditions that allow for the sealing of the carbon dot created by IR-DLWc were identified; and the empirical relation between the size of the carbon dots and the laser processing conditions were established. Moreover, it was found that the thermal–mechanical stress induced by the trapped pyrolysis gas is able to deform the PI matrix surrounding a carbon dot and to cause polymer chain reorientation. This phenomenon was further utilized to tailor the shape of carbon features for readily fabricating highly-sensitive piezoresistive sensors, which has been successfully demonstrated for the underwater use in mapping the ultrasound field.},

  abstract     = {The growing demand for advanced metallic materials with optimum mechanical properties has led to the creation of next-generation materials based on the alloying of multiple-principal elements in high concentrations. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have a high potential for industrial applications due to their extraordinary properties under elevated, ambient, and cryogenic conditions. Due to several limitations of conventional manufacturing methods, to develop HEAs of the maximum capability, a novel metal additive manufacturing (MAM) technique has been developed to produce defect-free HEA components with the desirable performance. The unique microstructures of MAMed HEAs provide an optimum strength-ductility relationship, even in extreme environments, by the simultaneous activation of several strengthening mechanisms. In particular, applying post-printing heat-treatment can significantly enhance the strength-ductility relationship of HEAs. Herein, a comprehensive review based on the process-microstructure-properties relationship in precipitation-hardenable HEAs fabricated by 3D printing is provided. Different kinds of precipitates formed in the microstructures of MAM-processed HEAs after applying a proper post-MAM heat treatment are presented. Moreover, the corresponding mechanical properties of these components are discussed in detail. Also, the improvement in the mechanical properties of precipitation-hardened MAM-processed HEAs due to the interaction between dislocations and precipitates is introduced, resulting in precipitate shearing and creation of Orowan/Hirsch loops.},

To address this obstacle, herein, a photothermal-triggered nitric oxide (NO) gas releasing nanosystem was designed for reversing drug resistance in MDR cells based on mesoporous core–shell structured nanocomposites (MCSN) of Cu 2-x Se@SiO 2 . The mesoporous shell provided the modification and encapsulation capacity for the NO donor— S -nitrosothiol (SNO) and doxorubicin (DOX) loading. Besides, the heat generated from the photothermal conversion of Cu 2-x Se could trigger NO gas generation and enhance DOX release in the acid microenvironment of cancer cells. The released NO gas in the cytoplasm could induce mitochondrial dysfunction to block adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis and ATP-dependent drug efflux, thereby overcoming MDR. Therefore, this novel gas/chemo/photothermal triple-combination therapeutic nanoplatform is expected to be a potentially effective strategy against MDR and may reveal new insights for other NO gas-relevant medical applications.},

The present work evaluates the potential of tailoring 4D printing to Hygromorph BioComposite (HBC), which paves the way for the construction of a new generation of sustainable shape-changing metamaterials with a sequential response. HBCs are made of continuous flax fibres that have been proven to be relevant for actuation and thus 4D printing due to their hygromorphism function. The morphing performance of HBCs can be boosted by selecting an appropriate matrix. The soft Poly Buthylene Succinate (PBS) matrix showed a 92\% increase in responsiveness and 500\% increase in reactivity compared to the Poly Lactic Acid (PLA)/Flax HBC. 4D printing with Layer Height (LH) control within layers allows for complex actuation potential with a local control of the thickness and stiffness ratio. The Interfilament Distance of the 0° oriented passive layer (IDp) offers the opportunity to achieve non-uniform reactivity and responsiveness for autonomous smart surfaces. Finally, the programming of the spatial distribution of the flax yarn can be combined with heterogeneities. As an illustration, simple compliant mechanism via localized microstructure changes is proposed.},

DSC, XRD, SEM, AFM, as well as O-PTIR analysis were conducted to elucidate the fibrosis mechanism of PTFE. The main reason for the in-situ fibrillation of PTFE-3800 could be ascribed to the chain-extended crystal structure. Furthermore, the acrylate layer of PTFE-3800 can also help PTFE to develop into fibrils. Shear rate was the key parameter in affecting the morphology evolution of PTFE, while processing time could also affect the morphology of PTFE to a certain extent. Interestingly, the SEM analysis showed that reticular crystals are generated in the presence of PTFE fibrils, while spherulites were generated in the presence of PTFE particles. Simultaneous enhancements in the strength, modulus and rigidity were achieved for in-situ fibrillary PTFE reinforced PP composites.},

  abstract     = {Atmospheric plasma sprayed metallic coatings always contain oxides because of the entrainment of ambient air into plasma jet, which significantly limits their performances and applications. This paper presents an approach to deposit highly dense Ni-based alloy coatings with oxide-free particles achieved by introducing boron as deoxidizer element through plasma spraying to generate ultrahigh temperature Ni20Cr4B droplets. During spraying, boron is preferentially oxidized and the formed B 2 O 3 is completely removed due to rapid evaporation. Thus, the in-flight oxidation of metal can be suppressed to achieve oxide-free particles. The oxygen content of plasma sprayed Ni20Cr4B coating is lower than 0.18 wt.\% and presents little change over a wide spray distance range from 60 mm to 140 mm. With such a low oxygen content, the Ni20Cr4B coating presents a highly dense microstructure (porosity of 0.21 ± 0.11\%) and well-bonded inter-splat interfaces. The hot-corrosion test at 600 °C for 200 h shows that the highly dense Ni20Cr4B coating can effectively block the penetration of the corrosion media and the corrosion only takes place at the coating surface, while severe inner corrosion was observed for the traditional Ni20Cr coating with poor inter-splat bonding.},

Thus, the stability of lotus leaves and petiole is guaranteed by the synergy effect between the curve section and MC on the surface. In this study, a polymethyl methacrylate -based bionic fabricated curved bar with MC arrays is fabricated by 3D printing technology. Compared with the straight bar, this designed bar shows good performance in anti-bending, anti-twisting and anti-stretching. Further, this bar is mounted on a stool to achieve a stable mechanical function. In the application, this design not only improves the comfort of the experience, but also improves the safety factor. This research has potential applications in the biomimetic field, ski pole, and construction.},

  abstract     = {Cubic specimens of the intermetallic Ni 3 Sn compound were built using selective laser melting of elemental powder blends. A specimen built at a laser power of 200 W and a scanning speed of 0.5 m/s was determined to have a homogeneous distribution of Ni and Sn on a mesoscopic scale in spite of a 2 at.\% Sn deficiency. Characterization of the microstructure using the HAADF-STEM technique reveals a dispersion of ultrafine Ni particles, nanoscale chemical inhomogeneity and the formation of antiphase nanodomains in the matrix of equiaxed Ni 3 Sn grains. While a mesoscopic homogeneity of the specimen demonstrates a prospect of additive manufacturing of a bulk intermetallic material using selective laser melting, the nanoscale chemical inhomogeneity indicates a need for a better balance between the melting time and the liquid mixing time of melt pools, perhaps by the use of a scanning speed below 0.5 m/s. The formation of the antiphase nanodomains indicates that melt pools attain a liquid undercooling of 165 K leading to disorder trapping during rapid solidification followed by a disorder-order transition. This progress can be helpful to an understanding of metastable microstructure formation in the selective laser melting technology of other intermetallics.},

The method has garnered interest in the scientific community because of its ability to produce extremely refined and homogeneous microstructures, off-axis texture development, and improved material properties. This manuscript presents an investigation of Cu and Ni material mixing via evaluation of morphological evolution, grain boundary characterization, and compositional analysis to provide insights on the operational alloying mechanisms occurring under high shear and elevated temperature. Using correlative microscopy techniques, we show alloying progresses via a combination of grain boundary diffusion and interfacial roughening at heterophase boundaries. Evidence supporting Cu infiltration along Ni-Ni grain boundaries along with asymmetric diffusion of Cu into Ni grains is highlighted. The resultant, consolidated microstructure was produced directly from a powder compact in ∼30 s and exhibited a submicrometer, equiaxed grain size.},

The ideal scaffolds should have high porosity and sufficient mechanical properties. In this comparative study, two models with cylindrical and spherical pore structures have been designed in the Abaqus software based on the pore opening size ( L ) to strut length ( D ) ratio ( L / D ). Structural analyses including compression, shear, and torsion simulation were performed using finite element analysis (FEA). Compression experiments on the PPF scaffolds fabricated using projection micro-stereolithography (PμSL) were conducted with digital image correlation (DIC). Fluid simulation was further performed to investigate the fluid permeability of the scaffolds. The porosity and surface area ( S p ) to volume ( V t ) ratio ( S p / V t ) are found to be generally larger in the spherical pore unit cells than in the cylindrical ones. At the same L / D or porosity, the cylindrical pore unit cells have higher compression/shear modulus with better stress distribution, higher torsional rigidity, and higher hydraulic permeability than the spherical ones. This research provides guidance to the design of bone tissue engineering scaffolds as the bulk properties and fluid permeability of the scaffolds could be adjusted by using different pore structures with varied microstructure parameters.},

We show that the reaction kinetics of γ-Al 2 O 3 – nMgO are substantially faster and occur at significantly lower temperatures compared to previous kinetic studies of α-Al 2 O 3 – μMgO, revealing that they are not controlled by the same mechanism. We propose that the enhanced reaction rates are caused by short diffusion distances, faster diffusion through defected γ-Al 2 O 3 as well as similarities in crystal structure between products and reactants. Lastly, we show that understanding the reaction and densification kinetics of this reactant combination can be leveraged to produce a wide range of microstructures leading to nanoporous high temperature energy absorbing materials and highly dense optically transparent spinel.},

  abstract     = {Solidification cracking (SC) is highly related to the grain coalescence behavior during welding of aluminum alloys. In this study, the grain coalescence behavior and its effects on solidification cracking susceptibility (SCS) were investigated using the multiphase-field approach. Why SCS is high at a certain value of Cu concentration and why SC often occurs at high misorientation angles are revealed. Firstly, nominal compositions of Cu affect the morphology of microstructure during solidification. The crystals morphology is cellular at the low concentration, while the crystals are dendritic at the high concentration in the columnar grain region. The SCS of cellular grains is higher than dendrites due to the high volume fraction of solid when the grains/subgrains bridge. Under the action of tensile stress, the scarce residual liquid phase cannot backfill in time. Secondly, high misorientation angles make grain boundary energy in the solid–solid interface ( σ SS ) is high. It is found that σ SS suppresses the grain coalescence and increases the SCS of alloys. This leads the emergence of SC at high misorientation angles during welding. In this study, the coalescence behavior of grains during solidification is visually presented by simulation and the coherency point at the last-stage solidification is achieved accurately.},

In this work, a super-robust self-healing superhydrophobic coating containing cyclic olefin copolymer (COC), fluorinated alkyl silane (FAS) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nanoparticles, is prepared by a convenient one-step wet-chemical coating method. The treated fabric has water contact angle of 168˚and sliding angle of 3˚. The coating demonstrates excellent endurance to various severe damages, e.g., repeated washing, abrasion, boiling water, strong UV irradiation, extremely high and low temperature. It also shows self-healing capability from physical/chemcial damages. Benefitting from the triboelectric negative features of COC and PTFE, this coating shows triboelectrification induced water self-repellence after rubbing with a polyamide (Nylon) fabric, water droplets can jump/move off the tribo-charged area. Moreover, this self-repelling feature works with many different aqueous liquids, such as NaCl, strong acid and alkali. Such a robust superhydrophobic coating can be applied onto many other substrates, such as cotton fabric, glass and cotton, and the treated substrates also exhibited liquid self-repellent properties after rubbing with a Nylon fabric. This triboelectrification enhanced superhydrophobic coating might shed light on developing energy-efficient liquid self-removing surfaces for various applications.},

This study proposed a new stent-graft (SG) design with slits that can positively improve the sealing effect between the aorta and SG while maintaining blood flow to supra-aortic branches. Firstly, a new SG was designed by changing the geometrical parameters (strut height, strut radius, strut diameter, etc.) based on previous research. The main mechanical performances of the SG were evaluated. Results showed that the new design improved the sealing effect and decreased the Type-Ι endoleak risk. The new design also had the comparable radial force, compression strength and fatigue life. Secondly, a fluid dynamic analysis was carried out in an ideal normal aortic arch model to evaluate the slit SG design. Satisfactory flow perfusion in branches was obtained, and no undesirable vortexes were found. Therefore, the hemodynamic environment in the aortic arch after the SG implantation was not significantly changed. The present study indicates that the design thought has a potential to deal with the technical difficulties of TEVAR at the aortic arch. This study provides the basis for potential optimization to obtain a more applicable SG design.},

Typically, such structure is exhibited by suitably treated steels with high carbon and high silicon content. Regardless, the common application of this steel grade in the industry is limited by some in-used properties that have not yet been explained. This mainly concerns the possibility of joining, long-term operationing at elevated temperatures and ensuring corrosion resistance. The feature promoting the provision of these properties is the sufficiently high thermal stability of the retained austenite. Enhancing thermal stability would allow for the application of these steels in the automotive, energy and marine industries. In contrast to the well-known control of the mechanical stability of the retained austenite, thermal stability requires a different approach in the context of chemical composition design and heat treatment parameters. This work presents the concept of increasing the thermal stability of the retained austenite and its influence on the improvement of the in-used properties of nanostructured bainitic steels. Mechanisms ensuring higher stability of the microstructure at elevated temperatures were reviewed, such as controlling the morphology and carbon content of retained austenite, solution strengthening, precipitation of intermetallic phases, and the prospect of secondary hardening.},

  abstract     = {Technically optimizing the processing cleanliness of Metal-Injection-Molded titanium alloys (Ti-MIM) is not economically feasible. This problem is common in the materials processing field. In the search for an alternative approach, the work tries to achieve superior high-cycle fatigue (HCF) performance while tolerating very high impurity levels. The concept arose from the large tolerance of β-class Ti-alloys for oxygen-solutes and the feasibility to mitigate detrimental effects of carbide-inclusions, under monotonous loading. In this paper, MIM β Ti-Nb-Zr biomaterials for fatigue-critical applications were deliberately produced with very high O-level and normal/very high C-levels. The impurity-resistant Ti-biomaterials exhibit superior HCF endurance limits beyond 600 MPa irrespective of processing cleanliness, being significantly higher than those of the α-β Ti-reference alloys produced with tight restrictions on impurity levels. This superior fatigue performance while tolerating amounts of impurities stems from the “weak”-microstructural features insensitive to impurities and increased resistance of the Ti-matrix against fatigue small-cracks. Furthermore, a conditional fatigue duality triggered by two competing mechanisms of crack initiation in certain cases, initiating at microscale pore α-platelets and at large pore TiC-inclusions can occur. The success of the present alloy-process development might greatly relax the processing demands for active metals.},

However, the most common and critical issue is the excessively high stress concentration at the struts’ nodes when the lattice structure is loaded. Thus, a curving lattice design strategy is proposed, maintaining a light structure, through which either a circular or elliptical arc is used in the lattice struts to obtain new forms of curving lattice structures. By establishing theoretical models and preparing samples by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), quasi-static uniaxial compressive experiments, finite element analysis (FEA), and Gibson-Ashby models, excellent results were obtained. The stress distribution of the original under the loads was altered in the curving lattice structure and the stress concentration at the nodes of the struts was effectively relieved, dramatically improving its mechanical properties. Compared with the original structure, the specific elastic modulus and specific compressive strength of curving lattice structures were maximally increased by 213.7\% and 126.2\%, respectively. Meanwhile, the curving lattice structure had a superior energy absorption capacity, with a significant increase of 92.9\%.},

  abstract     = {Successful integration of perovskite cell with silicon cell to form a tandem solar device has shown tremendous potential for outperforming the state-of-the-art single junction silicon devices. This tandem approach has enabled high efficiencies up to 29\% within a short period of time and one can find sufficient work and various strategies being applied to enhance the efficiency in these devices. At this point in time, a compilation of all these studies, with a critical review and perspectives is extremely relevant and essential. With this motivation the present review has been brought out, with all achievements attained so far by optimizing various components namely the electron/hole transport layer and absorber layer, functional layers in bottom cell, transparent contacts, deposition techniques and the innovative light management tactics used. The review also outlines the solutions proposed by various researchers to overcome the challenges that restrict the efficiency of tandem strategy in three distinct configurations, namely, monolithic (2T), four terminal (4T) and three terminal (3T) configurations. Finally, the perspectives provide real insights into choosing suitable materials, techniques and methods and achieve efficiencies near and beyond Shockley Queisser limit, thus spiking high hopes that this device would be the dominant energy conversion device in future.},

From this perspective, a self-sustaining nanoplatform (SSN) was prepared to reverse the downregulation of death receptors and remove blockage of XIAPs and survivin as a source-broadening and expenditure-reducing strategy to coactivate extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant pancreatic cancer. After administration, efficient tumor accumulation and cellular uptake of SSN would be achieved by elongated circulation time of PEG shell and active targeting ability of novel multifunctional R6ST protein equipped with cell-penetrating peptide R6 and active targeting of soluble TRAIL fragment, and further enhanced through interaction with the death receptors upregulated by the encapsulated celecoxib in SSN, which could be served as a positive feedback loop. This positive feedback loop not only broadened the source of death receptors but also reduced the expenditure of caspases by counteracting the inhibition of XIAPs and survivin via tetrapeptides AVPI in R6ST and celecoxib respectively, to synchronously relieve and promote exogenous and endogenous apoptotic pathway. Consequently, SSN exhibited synergistic effect to overcome TRAIL-resistance of pancreatic cancer through this source-broadening and expenditure-reducing strategy.},

  abstract     = {The influence of the non-metal species on the oxidation resistance of transition metal ceramic based thin films is still unclear. For this purpose, we thoroughly investigated the oxide scale formation of a metal (Hf), carbide (HfC 0.96 ), nitride (HfN 1.5 ), and boride (HfB 2.3 ) coating grown by physical vapor deposition. The non-metal species decisively affect the onset temperature of oxidation, ranging between 550 °C for HfC 0.96 to 840 °C for HfN 1.5 . HfB 2.3 and HfN 1.5 obtain the slowest oxide scale kinetic following a parabolic law with k p values of 4.97∙10 -10 and 5.66∙10 -11 kg 2 m -4 s −1 at 840 °C, respectively. A characteristic feature for the oxide scale on Hf coatings, is a columnar morphology and a substantial oxygen inward diffusion. HfC 0.96 reveals an ineffective oxycarbide based scale, whereas HfN 1.5 features a scale with globular HfO 2 grains. HfB 2.3 exhibits a layered scale with a porous boron rich region on top, followed by a highly dense and crystalline HfO 2 beneath. Furthermore, HfB 2.3 presents a hardness of 47.7 ± 2.7 GPa next to an exceptional low inward diffusion of oxygen during oxidation. This study showcases the strong influence of the non-metallic bonding partner despite the same metallic basis, as well as the huge potential for HfB 2 based coatings also for oxidative environments.},

  abstract     = {The alloy silicon carbon (Si 1-y C y ) has various strain engineering applications. It is often implemented as a dopant diffusion barrier and has been identified as a potential buffer layer for cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) heteroepitaxy. While suspended membranes formed from thin films of semiconductor (Ge and 3C-SiC) and dielectric (Si 3 N 4 ) materials have been well studied, pseudomorphic, defect-free epilayers under high levels of tensile strain have received little attention. Often, tensile strain is a desired quality of semiconductors and enhancing this property can lead to various benefits of subsequent device applications. The strain state and crystalline tilt of suspended Si 1-y C y epilayers have been investigated through micro-X-ray diffraction techniques. The in-plane tensile strain of the alloy was found to increase from 0.67\% to 0.82\%. This strain increase could reduce the C content required to achieve suitable levels of strain in such alloys and further strain enhancement could be externally induced. The source of this strain increase was found to stem from slight tilts at the edges of the membranes, however, the bulk of the suspended films remained flat. The novel process utilised to fabricate suspended Si 1-y C y thin-films is applicable to many other materials that are typically not resistant to anisotropic Si wet etchants.},

  abstract     = {Thermally conductive composites have emerged as a promising lead towards a more suitable and efficient alternative for thermal management. Their advantage lies in the coupling of different but complementary properties such as thermal conductivity for heat dissipation and flexibility for fitting surface irregularities. However, such materials consisting of ceramic fillers dispersed in a polymeric matrix generally suffer from particle sedimentation that ultimately affects their performance. Therefore, the overall properties of these composites can be further enhanced through structural improvements. Dielectrophoretic alignment has proven to be an effective and practical method to reach better structures that eventually improve the composites’ properties. This paper focuses on the enhancement of thermal and dielectric properties of Al 2 O 3 /PDMS composites through dielectrophoretic alignment. A novel method for measuring sedimentation effects is presented with a particular emphasis on the role of dielectrophoresis in counteracting those undesired effects. The influence of the relevant parameters such as the amplitude and frequency of the applied electric field is analyzed in order to draw the best structuring conditions. The thermal conductivity as well as the dielectric response are then compared between structured and unstructured composites. This comparison revealed a significant structural improvement that led to enhanced thermal conductivities while keeping the insulating properties unchanged.},

Here, the hardness and wear rate of the hypereutectic Fe Cr C and Fe Cr C Ti hardfacing coatings were measured. The crystal structure and orientation relationship of primary M 7 C 3 carbide and eutectic austenite matrix were confirmed. Then, the interface properties of γ-Fe//M 7 C 3 (Ti) interface were calculated by first principles. The results show that the micro-Vickers and macroscopic Rockwell hardness of the Fe Cr C Ti hardfacing coating are increased, and its wear rate is decreased from (4.33 ± 0.333) × 10 −6 mm 3 /Nm to (3.64 ± 0.366) × 10 −6 mm 3 /Nm. The Ti-doping can effectively inhibit the initiation and propagation of cracks and improve the peeling resistance of M 7 C 3 carbide. Meanwhile, the orientation relationship of eutectic austenite/primary M 7 C 3 carbide is γ-Fe(1 1 1)//(Cr, Fe) 7 C 3 (10 1 ¯ 1¯ 0). Among C Fe1, Cr Fe1 and Fe Fe1 interfaces, interface energy of Fe Fe1 model is the smallest (1.954 J/m 2 ), and its adhesion work ( W ad ) is the largest (0.756 J/m 2 ). Moreover, W ad of Ti-doped interface (4.123 J/m 2 ) is larger than that of Fe Fe1 one (3.045 J/m 2 ) after relaxed, which indicates Ti-doping is beneficial to enhance adhesive strength between γ-Fe//M 7 C 3 interfaces, which improves the peeling resistance of M 7 C 3 carbide.},

  abstract     = {The processing of conventional alloys by laser-based additive manufacturing can be challenging, particularly for alloys prone to hot cracking. However, additive manufacturing offers the possibility to produce novel alloys with improved properties, which cannot be achieved by other processing methods. Although several studies have demonstrated the positive influence of Zr addition on crack prevention of Al alloys tailored to additive manufacturing, its influence on the formation of strengthening precipitates in 2xxx alloys, remains largely unexplored. This work investigates the microstructure of a Zr-modified 2xxx AlCuMgZr alloy fabricated by laser powder bed fusion, with a particular emphasis on the precipitation of phases induced by the post-processing heat treatment, and their effects on mechanical properties. The Zr addition successfully allows the consolidation of crack-free, dense material (&gt;99.5\%). The microstructure is characterized by fine, equiaxed grains (0.5–3 μm) which result from Al 3 Zr-induced grain nucleation, with the grain boundary covered in eutectic S-Al 2 CuMg. After optimized three-step heat treatment, nm-sized L1 2 -Al 3 Zr as well as S-Al 2 CuMg rods strengthen the alloy, and lead to microhardness, young&#39;s modulus and yield strength of ∼1410 MPa, ∼82 GPa and ∼340 MPa, respectively. The results provide a basis for the understanding and further development of 2xxx alloys tailored to additive manufacturing.},

Unfortunately, current products exhibit shortcomings such as inadequate sizing or excessive material strength both of which hamper the recovery of fractures. Selective laser melting (SLM), as a manufacturing method, is highly suited for optimizing the geometry and topology of products. However, SLM however, seems to restrict the manufacturing precision to mostly horizontal printing which is inefficient when considering the build envelope. Additionally, certain elongated geometries are subject to warpage when printed horizontally. To address these issues, our study investigated the feasibility of vertically oriented porous structures using SLM. It will report on two specific deficiencies, namely slanting and cluttering, that were revealed through X-ray computer tomography. To facilitate the manufacturing of slender, porous structures, the paper will offer and examine heuristics that minimize the defects. The preliminary results indicate that structures such as shell reinforcements and bio-inspired unit cells reduce the occurrence of slanting and cluttering and might serve as interim solutions for the printing of large filigree structures. The general findings suggest that more dedicated research is necessary to understand the relationship between geometrical features and manufacturing precision in SLM.},

  abstract     = {Powder bed fusion (PBF) methods offer the best material properties among metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Yet, alloy development for PBF is only at its infancy and has a great untapped potential. This originates from the high solidification rate within the melt pool and to exploit the full potential of materials produced by PBF methods, a diligent work lies ahead. This paper presents a high-throughput method to rapidly screen large compositional alloy intervals experimentally for their PBF feasibility, which can drastically reduce the time needed for alloy development and provide valuable data for modelling. Our method consists of two steps; co-sputtering and electron beam re-melting. First step produces an alloy gradient film on a sheet substrate. The film is then re-molted to produce a PBF mimicked microstructure. The method is successfully demonstrated on binary systems; Al -Ti, -Zr and -Nb and produced gradients in compositional ranges of 3–50 wt\%Ti, 1–15 wt\%Zr and 2–15 wt\%Nb over a length of 200 mm. From the produced materials, the alloying efficiency could be investigated and determined regarding hardness and grain refinement. Zr shows the highest strength contribution per at\% and the best grain refinement at low levels. However, at higher levels grain refinement efficiency decreases for Zr.},

Compressive experiments were conducted by universal testing machine and Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) system to assess energy absorption and collapse behaviour of bio-inspired structures subjected to static and dynamic load. Each deformation evolution was captured and the digital image correlation (DIC) method was adopted to analyze the strain distribution in the compressive process. The observations reveal that the bio-inspired structure possesses a steady deformation mode under static and dynamic loading, which exhibits a promising prospect for impact resistant applications. Furthermore, energy absorption of this bio-inspired structure displayed some sensitiveness to the rate of strain. Finally, finite element analysis based on Johnson-Cook constitutive model was performed as well to simulate the static and dynamic response of the bio-inspired structure.

Experimental results show that dense co-sintered base materials were obtained with good tensile properties (870 MPa for 90 W-4.2Ni-1.8Fe-4Cu alloy and 1350 MPa for 30CrMnSiNi2A steel). The co-sintered joint contains five regions: the W alloy matrix, the diffusion-affected zone of the W alloy (η-carbides contain Fe 3 W 3 C and Fe 6 W 6 C), the reaction interlayer, the diffusion-affected zone of the steel ((Ni, Fe, Cu) solid solution), and the steel matrix. The interlayer shows solidification structure, which is composed of Fe 0.64 Ni 0.36 , Cu 0.81 Ni 0.19 , Fe 3 W 3 C and Fe 2 W Laves phases. The η-carbides transitional belt with thickness of 4–6 μm formed along the W grain boundaries at the interfacial region between W alloy and interlayer, which is the weakest area of the interface according to the TEM and nanoindentation test results. Furthermore, the formation mechanism of the interfacial structure is deeply discussed. The interfacial shear and tensile strengths of the co-sintered specimen is 310 MPa and 148 MPa, respectively. This technique provides a reliable method of efficient preparation of tungsten alloy/steel composite structure.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting properties of steels containing martensite by using models based on traditional strengthening mechanisms remains a challenge. In this study, a smart machine learning model possessing two-dimensional microstructure input terminals was developed using high-throughput experiments and machine learning on steels for low-temperature service. An algorithm based on a convolutional neural network enriched with the two-dimensional input terminals increased the prediction accuracy, achieving an average microhardness error of as low as 14.37 HV for the validation set. The improved prediction accuracy is ascribed to the comprehensive strengthening mechanism and coupling of strengthening effects contained in the multifarious input terminals. The information acquisition and cross-correlation of substructures related to strengthening mechanism played an important role. The reported strategy can deepen the cognition of the strengthening mechanism of tempered martensite. It is promising for application to different steels containing tempered martensite.},

Although the fabrication of anatomical models with high dimensional accuracy has been demonstrated, 3D printed anatomical models with tissue-mimicking properties have not been realized. In this study, a composite layering design was used to tune the shore hardness and compressive modulus of the Polyjet-printed parts in an attempt to mimic the properties of human tissues. 216 specimens (with 72 combinations of design parameters) were printed and tested to develop the material library for the anatomical models. An analytical model was developed to estimate the effective compressive modulus and shore hardness of the composite laminate. A neural network was used to learn the multi-dimensional relationship between the design parameters and mechanical properties. The 5-33-2 network size is found to be the optimum neural network structure with a mean square error of 0.98\% for the compressive modulus, lower than the traditional response surface method model. A genetic algorithm was used to search the design space for the most optimum design parameters for the targeted effective shore hardness.},

It is particularly prone to microcracking when processed by direct laser deposition (DLD). In this work, multiple single walls were manufactured by DLD in CM247LC using two different laser modes: continuous wave and pulse wave (PW). The manufactured walls were studied during processing and post-processing, and characterised by scanning electron microscopy, electron backscattered diffraction, thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction. The results indicate that crack-free conditions during the deposition process and the subsequent thermal processing can be achieved using the PW laser mode and that this can also lead to outstanding mechanical properties.},

Partition of three independent functional zones is microscopically realized in the tricolor flag-shaped nanobelt to avoid harmful mutual influences among three functions via confining luminescent, conductive and magnetic substances into their own domains, and thus achieving superior fluorescent-conductive-magnetic trifunction. Tricolor flag-shaped nanobelt used as building unit ensures excellent fluorescence, anisotropic conduction and magnetism of FCM-TNA. FCM-TNA emits blue fluorescence upon 980-nm laser excitation. Conductance ratio of conductive direction to insulating direction in FCM-TNA reaches 2.54 × 10 8 when the mass percentage of PANI to PMMA is settled at 70\%, achieving high conductive anisotropy. By adjusting the contents of NaYF 4 :Yb 3+ ,Tm 3+ NPs, PANI and CoFe 2 O 4 NPs, FCM-TNA exhibits tunable up-conversion fluorescence intensity, conductive anisotropy and magnetism.

The resultant composite paper exhibits high thermal conductivity (9.91 Wm −1 K −1 ), low dielectric loss (&lt;0.01), and ultrahigh electrical breakdown strength (∼334 kV/mm) with an exceptional heat resistance performance. Three-dimensional hydrogen bonding networks were constructed between the ANF framework, PEI, and BNNTs, endowing the composite paper with a superior tensile strength (up to 317 MPa) and Young’s modulus (∼7.7 GPa), which are significantly higher than those of the commercial Nomex T410 paper.

Deposition pattern can significantly impact the temperature distribution during manufacturing process and thus the overall quality and residual stress formation of the manufactured components. In order to explore the intricate relationship, three different deposition patterns in DED-Arc additive manufacturing, the meander pattern, the spiral pattern and the newly developed S pattern, were experimentally and numerically scrutinized in terms of the resulting temperature distribution, grain size, porosity as well as residual stress formation. The study reveals that the variation of the deposition paths results in characteristic temperature fields and gradients with distinct local peak temperatures that determine the deposition quality, and simultaneously offers great degrees of freedom for optimal pattern design. Comparing the results with different deposition patterns, the S pattern leads to a more homogeneous temperature distribution, showing beneficial effects on the microstructure, porosity and residual stress formation in the deposited Al-4046 material, and is thus regarded as a promising alternative for improving additively manufactured parts quality.},

The interfacial energy was lowest when the MDN was located in the Cr layer adjacent to the chemical interface, which also had the largest dislocation core widths. This was consistent with generalized stacking fault energies, which had lower energy barriers between the first and second Cr layers next to the chemical interface. As the MDN moved away from the interface, dislocation core widths consistently decreased along with the interfacial energy. For all positions of MDNs, shear failure occurred in the ceramic, between the first and second TiN layers next to the chemical interface. The lowest shear strength was found for the system with the MDN in the first Cr layer with respect to the chemical interface.

The quasi-static compression behavior of our proposed lattice is thoroughly investigated by finite element simulation, theoretical modeling and experimental testing. The experimental specimens made from 316L steel are additively manufactured using the selected laser melting technique. Satisfactory agreement is achieved between the theoretically, numerically and experimentally obtained SEA. It indicates that the proposed lattices have better energy absorption than the conventional FCC lattice. Parametric studies are carried out to investigate the influence of various geometric parameters and indicate that the specific energy absorption and the crushing force efficiency can be simultaneously enhanced by the proposed hierarchical design with proper number of higher-level circular beams. In addition, the auxetic effect is exhibited by the new lattice structures, in accordance with the enhanced energy absorption properties.},

One of the biggest challenges in this type of multi-material structures is to be able to confirm the structural health in service. The present work deals with the use, as matrix, of an epoxy resin reinforced with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) for manufacturing of Ti-CFRP joints by co-bonding. The aim is the structural health monitoring (SHM) of these hybrid structures, enhancing their mechanical properties. The obtained results show an improvement of more than 140\% in fracture resistance of the multi-material joints with optimal surface preparation, by incorporating CNT. Furthermore, electrical monitoring makes it possible to discern the quality of the manufactured joints, increasing their reliability and performance. Besides, the ability to localize crack propagation and stresses prior to joint failure has been confirmed, so CNT addition results in a powerful tool for SHM multi-material joints.},

The deformation ultrafine grain zone and un-deformation martensitic laths zone at the bonding interface between Ti6Al4V particles were observed. The EBSD results show that the grain orientation signal was only detected at the edge of the particles deformation area and the 23\% of grain sizes detected by EBSD are less than 500 nm, which indicates that the nanocrystallization induced by dynamic recrystallization occurs at the inter-particle boundaries between cold-sprayed Ti6Al4V particles.

  abstract     = {Despite increasing interest in the use of alternative fuel, conventional diesel or gasoline powered vehicles still dominate road transportation; removal of their emitted pollutants is a challenge to sustainable transportation. The automotive industry has employed catalytic converters (CCs) to effectively modify or eliminate toxic pollutants emitted by combustion engines. The efficiency of a CC greatly depends on its geometry and is hindered by limitations in fabrication techniques. To go beyond these limits and further enhance the performance of CCs, one can use state-of-the-art ceramic stereolithography (CSL) technology, which enables fabrication of complex-shaped structures. In this work, a novel photocurable ceramic resin made of γ γ - Al 2 O 3 Al2O3 and CeO 2 CeO2 (the commonly used washcoat materials in CCs) is shaped into the honeycomb and twisted honeycomb structures using CSL. Measurements reveal that upon the addition of CeO 2 CeO2 to the plain γ γ - Al 2 O 3 Al2O3 resin, the penetration depth of light is significantly decreased from 408.06 μ m μm to 75.19 μ m μm . This research also focuses on the balance between having a high surface area and achieving good physical stability in the printed structures. Accordingly, the appropriately debinded structures are sintered at two different temperatures: 900 ° ° C and 1100 ° C °C . It is found that the structure sintered at 900 ° ° C has a higher surface area, and thus, it is a better candidate for catalytic applications. Furthermore, investigation of the stabilizing effect of CeO 2 CeO2 on printed γ γ - Al 2 O 3 Al2O3 finds that CeO 2 CeO2 is effective in stabilizing the printed γ γ - Al 2 O 3 Al2O3 at1100 ° ° C but not 900 ° ° C. Targeting the realization of green and sustainable transportation, the applied CSL technique in this study enables flexible control in the design and fabrication of self-supporting structures that are expected to open promising ways for the optimization of CCs.},

  abstract     = {Due to their chemical inertness and high-temperature stability, atomic layer deposited (ALD) oxide thin films emerged as an attractive copper encapsulation, passivation , and protection technology. Several types of high-k dielectrics , which are robust insulators, can be deposited by ALD. Hence, a successful encapsulation process electrically isolates the underlying film and active elements from the environment, as a side effect. To electrically interface such encapsulated structures, a reliable method that selectively and locally removes the encapsulation film is required. Here, the study focused on the effectiveness of laser drilling and plasma etching of Al 2 O 3 thin films deposited via ALD, both in silico and experimentally. Results have shown that the CO 2 laser drilling alone is insufficient to remove the Al 2 O 3 thin films. However, plasma etching successfully removes the encapsulation layer, providing a clean interface for conductive vias. Results are essential for future ALD layer applications in the encapsulation of copper and other critical components in semiconductor fabrication processes.},

For such heterogeneous microstructures, the mechanical response and co-deformation of both phases under external load are not yet fully understood. We therefore used nano- and microindentation in combination with electron microscopy to study the deformation behaviour of an Mg-3.68Al-3.8Ca alloy. We found that the hardness of the Mg 2 Ca phase was significantly larger than the α-Mg phase and stays constant within the measured temperature range. The strain rate sensitivity of the softer α-Mg phase and of the interfaces increased while activation volume decreased with temperature. The creep deformation of the Mg 2 Ca Laves phase was significantly lower than the α-Mg phase at 170 °C. Moreover, the deformation zone around and below microindents was dependant on the matrix orientation and was influenced by the presence of Laves phases. Most importantly, slip transfer from the α-Mg phase to the (Mg,Al) 2 Ca Laves phase occurred, carried by the basal planes. Based on the observed orientation relationship and active slip systems, a slip transfer mechanism from the soft α-Mg phase to the hard Laves phase is proposed. Further, we present implications for future alloy design strategies.},

  abstract     = {Fe-based metallic glasses (MG) have become the subject of extensive research in recent years due to their favorable mechanical and magnetic properties. In particular, the production of this type of materials in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), also known as Selective Laser Melting (SLM) technology, is a kind of breakthrough, as it has become possible to produce elements of any shape. An important factor influencing the properties of the manufactured parts is their microstructure. For metallic glass Fe 79 Zr 6 Si 14 Cu 1 with low glass-forming ability, produced in SLM technology, tests were carried out in the field of structural X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Transmission Electron Microscopy. In addition, porosity analysis was compared with process parameters such as laser power and scanning speed. The paper shows that the fusion line comprises a solid solution α-Fe(Si) and low fraction of intermetallic Fe 23 Zr 6 and FeZr 2 phases. Furthermore, in the melt pool area, a nanometric α-Fe(Si) phase and an amorphous matrix was observed. The presented research results of the Fe 79 Zr 6 Si 14 Cu 1 alloy produced for the first time in SLM technology will undoubtendly contribute to further optimization of parameters for elements produced in Additive Manufacturing technology using Fe-based MG.},

The strengthening mechanism was clarified, and the effects of Si 3 N 4 p on microstructure, mechanical properties and anisotropy were investigated. The results showed that Si 3 N 4 p, Mg 2 Si phase, and lots of micropores distributed in as-sintered ingots, and hot extrusion effectively reduced the number of micropores. The Si 3 N 4 p was well boned with Al matrix, and no defect or reaction product existed on the interface. Both dynamic recovery and dynamic recrystallization took place during hot extrusion, and the addition of Si 3 N 4 p refined the grain structure by promoting the particle stimulated nucleation effect. The main texture of as-extruded composites was brass, while its intensity was gradually weakened with the increase of Si 3 N 4 p content. The tensile strength and wear resistance were enhanced by the addition of Si 3 N 4 p due to the strengthening mechanisms of load transfer, grain refining, and dislocation strengthening. The extruded composite without Si 3 N 4 p exhibited the strong anisotropy of tensile properties and planar anisotropy. Since the addition of Si 3 N 4 p was beneficial to refine the grain structure and weaken the intensity of brass, both the tensile properties anisotropy and planar anisotropy were significantly reduced.},

Based on the size-graded lattice structure, laser powder bed fusion is utilized to manufacture the corresponding Ti-6Al-4 V lattice samples. Then, the quasi-static compression experiment is conducted and a predictive model for its mechanical properties is established accordingly. Also, its dynamic fatigue behavior is studied, and the influence of sandblasting and gradient direction on its mechanical response is evaluated. The results show that excellent mechanical properties and energy absorption capacity is exhibited in the vertical graded (VG) structure. Compared to the uniform structure, its elastic modulus and energy absorption are increased by 17.53\% and 59.43\%, respectively. The compression response of the radial graded (RG) structure is similar to that of the uniform structure, with minor changes on the mechanical properties and energy absorption capacity. However, the fatigue performance of the RG structure is better than that of the VG structure. With appropriate mechanical properties and changes in pores, this graded structure can simulate the changing physical and chemical properties of natural bone. Therefore, it has great potentiality in the application of bone implants.},

The morphology and physicochemical properties of the AGC were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Flourier Transform Infrared Spectrum (FTIR), Gravimetric thermal analyzer (TGA). The mRNA levels of osteogenetic gene markers were measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The result of a 9.6\% weight loss after a 7-day soaking indicates that the AGC exhibited excellent stability. The encapsulated MG-63 cells formed clusters alongside the core of AGC and obtained 200\% cell viability after 21-day long-term cultivation. Compared to traditional 2D cell culture, the 3D cultured MG-63 cells performed higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a 9.3-fold increase of calcium mineralization activity, and enhanced osteogenic gene expression of BGLAP , COL1A1, and Runx2 .

By adding HEA particles as the second phase, the strength and plasticity of the Zr-based metallic glass composites improved concomitantly. After fracture, high-density dislocations and nanocrystals were formed in the HEA particles due to local severe plastic deformation, which consumed massive strain energy to enable the resistance to crack formation. Substantial lattice distortion imparted a remarkable work-hardening capacity to the HEAs and enhanced crack-tip dislocation trapping, and thus led to an extreme refinement of the grain size. Finite-element analyses indicated that the strain hardening behavior of HEA particles reduced the magnitude of strain localization, promoted generation of multiple shear bands, and stabilized shear band propagation. We attribute the enhanced strength-ductility synergy in the current composites to high-density dislocations and nanocrystal formation in the HEA particles, and stable propagation of multiple shear bands.},

  abstract     = {Accumulated spatters not only deteriorate the quality of the built parts in terms of surface roughness and/or density but also sabotage the whole fabrication process via damaging the powder re-coater. A cross-flow of inert gas inside the processing chamber is by far the only effective mean of removing the spouted spatters from the build platform. Despite the essential role, there are few efforts to investigate the interactions between the cross-flow dynamics and the spouted spatters, and hence, to optimize the design and settings of the cross-flow. Therefore, in this study, a coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) – discreate element method (DEM) simulation framework is proposed to study the interactions between the flow field and the spouted spatters during the single scan process. The simulation results for the maximum ejection distance and maximum ejection height of the spatters were shown to deviate from the numerical results reported in the literature by no more than 15\%. Moreover, the simulation results for the distribution of the landing sites of the spatters were consistent with the experimental observations, which showed that a large number of large spatters landed near the scan track, while a small number of large spatters landed at a greater distance from the scan track. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study represents the first reported attempt to use a coupled CFD-DEM simulation framework to investigate the spatter dynamics within an LPBF chamber and to validate the results with experimental observations and published data. The proposed model is an important tool to optimize and calibrate the cross-flow inside the L-PBF processing chamber.},

  abstract     = {Leather is among the most ancient, widely used materials worldwide. Industrial-scale leather production produces large quantities of organic waste attained during shaving and buffing steps during processing. In this study, leather wastes (LW) are used as fillers in flame retarded polymer composites. LW is investigated as a multifunctional bio-filler that enhances the fire performance of flame retarded poly(ethylene–vinyl acetate) (EVA) containing phosphorus flame retardants (P-FRs) ammonium polyphosphate (APP) or a melamine-encapsulated APP (eAPP). Using LW from tanneries as adjuvants to enhance P-FRs in EVA reduces industrial wastes that otherwise require costly waste management solutions. Materials are characterized multi-methodically via mechanical tests, electron microscopy, rheology, thermogravimetric analysis, evolved gas analysis, and condensed phase FTIR, also reaction-to-small-flames and cone calorimeter tests. EVA containing 10 wt-\% LW and 20 wt-\% P-FRs achieve 20\% reductions in fire loads versus EVA, and up to 10\% reduction in effective heats of combustion versus EVA with equal (30 wt-\%) P-FR loadings. Enhanced char stabilization of EVA composites with LW and P-FRs lowered peaks of heat release rates up to 53\% compared to EVA, and up to 40\% compared to equal P-FRs loadings. Synergisms between LW and P-FRs in EVA are quantified. A chemical decomposition mechanism is proposed.},

Small Tafel slope of 43 mV dec –1 for 1250 nm thick coating on 2 µm diameter pores with 4.2 µm interspacing electrocatalyst with comparable hydrogen overpotentials to the literature suggests its use for standard fuel cells. The largest hydrogen sorption has been attained for the 250 nm thick electrocatalyst on 5 µm pore diameter with 12 µm interspacing (2189 µC cm −2 per CV cycle), making it possible for rapid storage systems. Moreover, the charge transfer resistance described by an equivalent circuit model has an excellent correlation with Tafel slopes. Along with its very low Tafel slope of 42 mV dec –1 10 nm thick electrocatalyst on 2 µm diameter pores with 4.2 µm interspacing has the highest capacitive response of ∼ 0.001 S s n cm −2 and is promising to be used as a nano-charger and hydrogen sensor. The findings of Si/SiO 2 supported mesoporous Pd-based metallic glass (MG) assemblies suggest a similar design applicability for crystalline systems and other MG types.},

  abstract     = {This study develops a new multi-material topology optimisation framework for design of periodic micro-composites with optimal functional performance and reduced stress concentration. First, multi-material topology optimisation is developed based on the alternating active phase algorithm and inverse homogenisation method with the sensitivity analysis derived for specific property objective i.e., negative Poisson&#39;s ratio (NPR) or maximum effective bulk modulus (EBM) and ( p -norm macroscopic) stress objective. Then, the effects of initial material distribution and weight ratio ( w 1 , w 2 assigned to the property and stress objectives, respectively) are investigated, and the evaluation indices are also developed to obtain the optimal solution. Further, two cases related to the design of micro-composites for maximised either NPR or EBM with reduced maximum stress are performed. The results show that when designing the multi-material NPR micro-composites, the decrease of w 1 / w 2 contributes to a general decease of both NPR and maximum stress. While in designing the maximum EBM, decreasing w 1 / w 2 leads to the reduced maximum stress and simultaneously reduced EBM; hereby, a decision-making method as well as the proposed evaluation index are both applied and compared for acquiring the optimal result. This study provides new methods and solutions to multi-material micro-composites design for future industrial applications.},

This work aims to provide a fundamental study of oxide inclusion characteristics in the duplex fcc + hcp Co-based entropic alloys. It is found that the Co 85−x Cr x Fe 7.5 Ni 7.5 (x = 15, 30 at.\%) alloys hold the highest liquidus ( T liq ) and solidus ( T sol ) temperatures, compare with the Co 85−x Cr x Mn 7.5 Ni 7.5 (x = 15, 30 at.\%) and Co 77.5−x Cr x Fe 7.5 Mn 7.5 Ni 7.5 (x = 15, 30 at.\%) alloys. For each grade, the increasing Cr content leads to a decrease of T sol and T liq temperatures. It is also noted that there is an approximate 100 °C of undercooling exists in each grade during the solidification. The stable oxide inclusion in the Co 85−x Cr x Mn 7.5 Ni 7.5 and Co 77.5−x Cr x Fe 7.5 Mn 7.5 Ni 7.5 alloys is the MnCr 2 O 4 type, while Cr 2 O 3 is the main stable inclusion in the Co 85−x Cr x Fe 7.5 Ni 7.5 alloy. Furthermore, the size range of the MnCr 2 O 4 particles is larger than that of Cr 2 O 3 . The theoretical calculation shows that MnCr 2 O 4 has a higher coagulation coefficient than Cr 2 O 3 does. This is due to the influence of the thermo-physical parameters, i.e. the interfacial energy between the oxide and the alloy and the viscosity of liquid alloy . The theoretical calculation fits well with the experimental findings.},

The study revealed that the frequency of alternating spinning affects the surface energy value. Thus, by changing the alternating spinning frequency, it is possible to change the wettability of the produced fibre layers. The study concluded that it is possible to predict the contact angle via the application of the Kwok-Neumann model, as well as the use of the surface tension values of the gelatin hydrogel and the surface energies of the fibre layers produced.},

Combining our innovative work and over two hundred extant publications, we overview the fabrication, structure, properties, and orthopedic applications of porous tantalum bone scaffolds. Additive manufacturing has become a powerful and versatile technique for fabricating patient-specific and anatomy-matching porous tantalum bone implants with well-designed architectures. Additively manufactured tantalum scaffolds are deemed as new biomaterials for bone repair, as their microstructures and mechanical properties differ from those of bioimplants fabricated by traditional technologies. To understand the safety and effectiveness of these scaffolds for orthopedic applications, we must undertake basic scientific investigations, in vitro studies, pre-clinical studies, and clinical research.

Here, we address this problem via a simple fabrication method of assembling highly ordered and aligned arrays of BGC nanoneedle-like structures (@) on the outer surface of various polyamide 6 (PA6) substrates (casted film, 3D printing filaments, electrospun fibre mats) by ion dissociation. The staggered-like nanoneedles of BGC@PA6 substrates with excellent uniform dispersion showed favourable cell viability, proliferation, and spreading of MC3T3 osteoblast-like cells. Moreover, the immobilized BGC nanoneedles induced osteogenic differentiation and accelerated the expression of late osteoblast marker genes, compared to the control group. Furthermore, the BGC@PA6 composite showed high affinity for bone-like apatite formation when incubated in physiological body fluids. These findings suggest that the unique dispersion of BGCs@PA6 substrates with nanostructure features make them attractive candidates for bone tissue regeneration and open avenues for future investigation into exploiting these properties for bone tissue engineering. Importantly, this work provides a novel concept for in-situ immobilization of BGC with distinctive topographical features onto polymer substrates simulating natural bone structure.},

  abstract     = {With the attention of biomineralization, calcium phosphate precursor phases regulated by different organic templates are synthesized and used as mineral sources for biomimetic mineralization. However, most of the organic templates have limited ability to stabilize calcium and phosphorus ions, or the selected templates have poor biocompatibility and irremovability, which make them difficult to co-exist in long-term stability and crystal transformation, and to achieve convenient and harmless clinical application. Herein, we propose a calcium phosphate prenucleation clusters (CaP-PNCs)/starch complex, which includes uniform-sized, separate, and homogeneously distributed amorphous calcium phosphate nanoclusters of about 1 nm. By means of freeze-drying and redissolution, the CaP-PNCs/starch complex can be converted between liquid and spongy solid without changing their morphology and amorphous phase, and the freeze-dried CaP-PNCs/starch complex can be stored at room temperature for at least 5 months. Imitating the mechanism of protein-protease controlled biomineralization in organisms, the CaP-PNCs/starch complex is mixed with α-amylase during application. Starch templates are removed by enzymolysis and CaP-PNCs can be released, thus triggering on-site biomimetic mineralization with enamel-like structures to repair tooth tissue defects (including enamel and dentin). CaP-PNCs/starch complex provides a smart mineral source supply for biomimetic mineralization and a new pathway for the design of biomimetic materials.},

In this work, the layer-by-layer laser remelting (LR) method is applied to LPBF AlSi10Mg to improve the surface quality and mechanical performance. To account for the physical mechanism of the laser remelting, a three-dimension multi-physics coupled transient model is established. The numerical results indicate that the molten pool during the LR process is significantly expanded. The larger molten pool plays a great role in removing the defects. Moreover, the temperature gradient and cooling rate are simultaneously increased during the LR process, which has a considerable impact on the microstructure transformation. The densification, surface quality, including roughness, wettability, and residual stress, microstructure, and mechanical property are investigated after LR treatment based on experiments. The experimental results show that after LR treatment, the densification can be up to 99.4\%. The surface hydrophilicity is limited due to roughness reduction. The average grain size of top and side surface can be decreased by 6.74\% and 28.79\% due to the increasement of cooling rate. The average microhardness and ductility can be improved due to grain refinement and defect elimination.},

In this work, we reported a novel method for dramatically improving HE resistance by Ta microalloying, and the significant effect of Ta on the HE susceptibility of lath martensitic steel was elucidated from the perspectives of hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) and hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP). As the Ta content increased, numerous dispersed nano-sized TaC precipitates were generated and the effective areas of martensite/prior austenite grain boundaries also increased, which increased both the irreversible/reversible H trap densities, impeded localized H aggregation at defects and weakened HEDE. A quantitative analysis regarding each type of H trap revealed that, compared with reversible traps provided by microstructural refinement, TaC precipitate-induced irreversible traps exhibited a dominant role in weakening the HEDE process. Additionally, in Ta-bearing steels, the resistance to hydrogen-assisted crack propagation was enhanced through the increased Σ11 boundary, increased low-angle grain boundary fraction and the reduced Σ3 boundary fraction, which combined with the suppressing role of TaC precipitates on H-dislocation interaction, impeded the HELP process. This study provided new, deep insights into the impact of Ta on HE, which has important implications for developing steels with high HE resistance.},

The framework can evaluate a large number of boundary properties from typical observations of grain growth without requiring specifically designed experiments or calculations. In this method, by optimizing the multi-phase-field model parameters such that the simulation results are in good agreement with the observation data, the energies and mobilities of multiple individual boundaries are directly and simultaneously estimated. To validate the method, numerical tests on boundary property estimation were performed using synthetic microstructure dataset generated from grain growth simulations with a priori assumed property values. Systematic tests on simple tricrystal systems confirmed that the proposed method accurately estimates each boundary energy and mobility within an error of only several\% of their assumed true values even for conditions with strong property anisotropy and grain rotation. Further numerical tests were conducted on a more general multi-grain system, showing that our method can be successfully applied to complicated polycrystalline grain growth. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method in extracting a large dataset of grain boundary properties for arbitrary boundaries from actual grain growth observations.},

By testing the degradation properties, mechanical properties, thermal stability, biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, and cell adhesion in vitro and in vivo, a suitable ratio of PPDO/PLA was selected as the material for the pancreaticojejunostomy device. The results show that the pancreaticojejunostomy device can be fabricated by PPDO/PLA blends using fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing. As the proportion of PPDO increases, its degradation rate gradually increases, and its hydrophilicity improves, which is more conducive to cell adhesion and proliferation, while its mechanical properties gradually decrease. However, compared with soft tissues, it can still provide longer-term support strength to avoid early anastomotic stenosis. The mass loss rate in vivo was significantly faster than that in vitro, and the degradation rate of 50\% PPDO/PLA at 3 months was 46.04 ± 5.79\%. With the absorption and metabolism of the degradation products, there is no obvious toxic to the important organs in the body. Therefore, 50\% PPDO/PLA has a suitable degradation time, mechanical properties, and good biocompatibility and has great application potential in manufacturing 3D pancreaticojejunostomy devices.},

  abstract     = {Chemoresistance remains a huge challenge for the treatment of osteosarcoma (OS). Multiple mechanisms are involved in chemoresistance of cisplatin. In our research, we found that Nrf2/xCT pathway contributes to the occurrence of chemoresistance of cisplatin in OS by enhancing the ability of antioxidative stress. Recently, oxidative stress defense and ferroptosis have attracted wildly attention in overcoming chemoresistance. Different from apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy, ferroptosis is a new programmed cell death pathway with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Synergistic treatment of ferroptosis and photothermal therapy (PTT) can perfectly overcome chemoresistance, and immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by PTT can initiate effective anti-tumor immunity to suppress tumor growth and recurrence. Thus, we designed a cancer cell membrane coated gold nanocages loaded with RSL3 (C-R-AuNC) for the treatment of chemoresistance of OS. RSL3 induces ferroptotic cell death by the inhibition of glutathione peroxidase (GPX4). Gold nanocages coated with the cell membrane, as a nanocarrier, can achieve targeted drug delivery, controlled drug release, PTT, and induced ICD. In our researches, excellent outcomes for the treatment of chemoresistance of OS were achieved by C-R-AuNC, which is believed to serve as a promising strategy for clinic treatment of drug-resistant OS in future.},

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common chronic diseases, causing degenerative changes in articular cartilage and subchondral bones. To date, there is no effective drug to delay the progression of OA in clinical practice. In this study, we synthesized and prepared a new thermosensitive hydrogel called PHA hydrogel, a mixture of normal poloxamer 407 and hyaluronic acid-modified poloxamer 407, and we investigated the effects of the PHA hydrogel loaded with keratinocyte growth factor 2 (KGF-2) on rats with papain-induced OA. First, we evaluated the safety of the PHA hydrogel in vitro and in vivo . The results showed that the PHA hydrogel had suitable osmotic pressure and no obvious cytotoxicity or adverse reactions after intra-articular injection. In addition, the PHA hydrogel improved the stability of KGF-2. Next, we studied the effects of the PHA hydrogel loaded with KGF-2 (PHA-KGF-2) on OA in rats. PHA-KGF-2 significantly improved the morphology and inflammation of the articular cartilage, reduced the loss of proteoglycan, and balanced collagen metabolism compared with KGF-2 alone. These data demonstrated that the PHA hydrogel is a safe biomaterial that can protect KGF-2, and thus is a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with OA.},

  abstract     = {In the current investigation, a comparison between two type 4130 low-alloy steel powders produced by both gas and water atomization, and later processed by Laser-powder bed fusion was carried out. Samples fabricated from the water atomized powder showed relative density levels exceeding 99\%, slightly lower than those achieved with the gas atomized powder. Both steels exhibited similar metallurgical features after solidification, showing a microstructure that is mainly composed of partially tempered martensite, bainite, and retained austenite. Additionally, micro-segregation of alloying elements was detected in the as-built microstructure, which contribute to a local increase in microhardness. The excess of oxygen found in the water atomized powder tended to combine with silicon and form nano-sized SiO 2 inclusions. During the laser processing, the complex heating and cooling effects generated by adjacent laser tracks and by overlapping layers led to an in-situ tempering of the fresh martensite. Accordingly, the hardness values of steels in as-built condition were equivalent to those of conventionally quenched samples tempered at 350 °C and 450 °C, for gas atomized and water atomized steels, respectively. Finally, a comparison in terms of mechanical properties of the investigated steels showed that the powder atomization process resulted in limited changes in steel performance.},

  abstract     = {Numerous efforts have been devoted to produce reliable additive manufactured (AM) materials for structural applications. However, the critical fatigue issue poses a significant hurdle in relation to the nature of this production method. Despite the relative flexibility of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AM process, there exists a limitation in the possibility of tailoring parameters to obtain a satisfactory combination of porosity and surface roughness for adequate fatigue resistance. This quandary arises interest for post-treatments that could help overcome this limitation. Friction stir processing was proved to be a viable solution to improve fatigue behaviour of LPBF AlSi10Mg in the present work. Indeed, thanks to this post-process that reduces overall porosity and eliminates critical defects while keeping a satisfactory fine microstructure and static mechanical behaviour, fatigue resistance of the material was significantly enhanced. In contrast, the other studied post-process, stress relieve heat treatment, did not reduce porosity, which remained the main factor behind fatigue crack nucleation, cyclic life of the material being thus little affected with respect to the as built state. Furthermore, both post-treatments decreased fatigue crack growth rate by an order of magnitude. This is interpreted as being due to plasticity induced crack closure and crack branching.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new framework for optimising three-dimensional hierarchical structures with tailored relative densities and anisotropy of lattice metamaterials. The effective properties of the lattice metamaterials are characterised with numerical homogenisation. Artificial neural network based surrogate models are developed to quantitatively relate lattice struts radii with the effective properties of the lattice metamaterials to improve the computational efficiency of the framework. A new platform integrating user-defined functions with multiple robust and efficient commercial software is developed to implement the proposed optimisation framework. The framework and its implementation are tested using three case studies featuring multiple lattice types and configurations. Case study results show that, compared with results from classical topology optimisation and optimising quasi-isotropic lattice metamaterials, optimised structures composed of tailored anisotropic lattice metamaterials achieved superior structural efficiency. This is attributed to the concurrent optimisation of the intermediate relative densities and anisotropy in the lattice metamaterials. The optimised struts radii distributions approximately align with the paths of the principal stresses. It is also found that the orthogonal struts and diagonal struts especially contribute to the bending and torsion resistance of beams, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The influence of tempering at 400 and 500 °C on two bainitic ferrite microstructures obtained via pure isothermal transformation and ausforming followed by the isothermal transformation was studied in a medium C-Si rich bainitic steel. To understand the dilatometric behaviour and mechanisms of carbide-free bainite decomposition, extensive microstructural characterization using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and microhardness measurements were conducted. The softening due to tempering at 400 °C was negligible for both microstructures. Tempering at 500 °C led to a remarkable contraction in dilatometric signal in an ausformed sample, while a pure isothermal sample showed slight contraction. The main mechanism governing microstructural changes during tempering at 500 °C was the decomposition of as-ausformed highly dislocated bainitic ferrite plates and/or film-like retained austenite into cementite and ferrite as a result of enhanced carbon diffusion. While tempering at 400 °C did not result in changes in the size of the bainitic plates, the higher tempering temperature of 500 °C led to a thickening of the bainitic ferrite plates for both testing conditions. However, the thickening was restricted in the ausformed bainite, which was related to the pinning effect of very small cementite precipitates, which moderate the tempering effects on hardness reduction.},

Furthermore, tensile properties, shape recovery ratio, and functional fatigue evaluation have also been carried out for the wire samples. The investigation shows that the addition of the minor amount of boron and secondary processes involved during the specimen preparation induced excellent grain refinement. The addition of boron decreased transformation temperatures; however, there was not a considerable change observed due to the secondary process. It was observed that tensile properties increases with the boron addition, and complete shape recovery was observed for all the selected alloys. Finally, functional fatigue tests were conducted under constant stress condition and observed that the number of cycles until the failure has increased and more distance recovery was achieved with an increase in boron doping.},

However, little is known about the atomic-scale mechanisms leading to the generic synthesis of fully exposed metals, the feasibility of tailoring metal’s coordination environments and the thermal robustness. Here we demonstrate the strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) as one of the key factors to universally construct a series of atomically dispersed single metals and synergetic bimetals for high-performance catalysts. The SMSI is realized through the anchoring effects of hybrid sp 2 - and sp 3 -carbons on the surface of nanodiamond@graphene (ND@G) support. Such SMSI assures the effective tuning of metal’s coordination numbers by means of either controlling mass loading or introducing complementary species. Furthermore, the impressive thermal stability of ND@G-supported Pt-Sn catalyst as well as the failure route are revealed by atomic-resolution in-situ observations. This work not only paves the way towards a library of highly tunable and stable ADCs, but also sheds light on the fundamental regulating principles for their industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Computerized structural optimization methods are often used to design the shape of structures to achieve a desired function, such as a specific compliance. In the simplest case of a structure built from a material with small deformations obeying Cauchy elasticity, the compliance is constant and the relationship between the forces applied on the structure and its deformation is linear. This linearity severely limits the types of functions which can be achieved by such materials. Here we study mechanical metamaterials made of repeating unit cells, each with specific dimensional parameters and with one-sided contact non-linearities. We show that the force and displacement equilibrium configurations of these metamaterials are mathematically equivalent to the fixed points of a recurrent artificial neural network . By exploiting this equivalence, we demonstrate mechanical metamaterials that can be designed (trained) to implement complex non-linear functions, using a gradient descent algorithm as in artificial neural networks. One of our metamaterial structures has a higher compliance when it is pressed against a pattern of raised bumps corresponding to the vowels in the Braille alphabet, than when it is pressed against patterns for six consonants. As artificial neural networks are known to be efficient models for numerous problems in machine learning, our results reveal that beneficial features of neural networks can be transferred to physical objects (mechanical structures). These features include the design of systems with complex input–output relationships by using generic methods that only rely on the repetitive processing of pairs of inputs and desired outputs, as well as remarkable generalization capabilities. We anticipate our methodology to be a starting point for the transfer of some of the breakthroughs in the rapidly advancing field of machine learning to highly functional physical devices in applications that are constrained by energy, volume, data processing or response time.},

  abstract     = {Rapid and contactless on-demand debonding and rebonding of high-strength joints is a promising solution for quick attachment, repairs, disassembly, and recycling of structural systems. Herein we show that rapid and contactless on-demand debonding and rebonding can be achieved by incorporating ferrimagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4 ) into poly(ethylene-methacrylic acid) (EMAA). When subjected to an external alternating magnetic field, the ferrimagnetic nanoparticles generate localized heat which melt the EMMAA, resulting in quick (&lt;1 min) debonding and rebonding. The strength of the adhesive bond matches that achieved by conventional oven heating, exceeding the highest value reported for reversible adhesives in the literature. The results also show that, for the first time, the ferrimagnetic nanoparticles are effective in retaining 100\% of the original bond strength for up to five cycles of repeated debonding and rebonding. Analytical and computational models have been developed to characterize the effects of key design parameters, such as Fe 3 O 4 mass loading and magnetic flux on the heating performance and bond strength. The model correlates well with experimental results and reveals that magnetic hysteresis loss is more efficient than eddy current generated by conductive fillers for heating the adhesive. The high-strength EMAA/Fe 3 O 4 adhesive is a very promising solution for contactless, on-demand, repeated adhesion applications to complex geometries and in hard-to-access locations.},

  abstract     = {Zinc-coated ultra-high-strength steel (UHSS) sheets are highly susceptible to liquid metal embrittlement (LME) during resistance spot welding. However, systematic understanding on LME cracks in the pullout fracture of UHSS welds is still lacking. This study employs artificially created pre-cracks on bare DP980 steel welds to simulate the LME cracks, allowing accurate control of the crack shape and location. To investigate the fracture initiation and propagation behavior of welds with various pre-crack characteristics, a combined experimental and computational approach, which incorporated tensile tests on newly designed miniature specimens for detailed mechanical property measurement and fracture parameter calibration of different weld zones, was proposed. Results indicate that external pre-cracks in a highly strained region accelerated damage accumulation at the fracture onset region and deflected the fracture propagation path to pass through the pre-crack, causing a 12.1\% loss of tensile-shear peak load. Conversely, internal pre-cracks vary the fracture initiation site and exhibit a more detrimental influence, with 24.1\% loss of tensile-shear strength. The effects of the pre-crack length, orientation, and depth on the tensile-shear performance were quantified. Results show that the negative effect of the LME crack on the weld performance can be mitigated or avoided by controlling the crack location and geometry.},

  abstract     = {Unlike random cellular materials, in TPMS structures the ligament size and orientation distribution are constant, leading to a directional dependency of the mechanical properties. In this work, the directional dependency of elastic properties of seven TPMS-based structures has been studied in a wide range of the solid phase volume fractions (i.e., 10–90\%). Our study indicates that the strong and weak directions in IWP, Gyroid, FRD, FKS, and Diamond are diagonal and axial, respectively. In contrast, Schwarz-P and Neovius structure show a reversed order. Then, the idea of designing hybrid structures consisting from Schwarz-P/Neovius and each of the other five structures in laminated or matrix-spherical inclusion form has been employed to obtain structures with a more uniform directional elastic modulus. First, the mathematical functions of the hybrid structures are presented. The functions are carefully parameterized to ensure a smooth transition between two structures. Then the effect of the combination ratio of the parent structures on the universal anisotropy index of the hybrid structures is investigated. Our study indicates that hybrid structures have more uniform directional elastic modulus compared to their parent structures, and an appropriate selection of the combination ratio of the parent structures can lead to the least universal anisotropy.},

However, limited research is reported to demonstrate how to identify the boundary of each region in DIC results. Accordingly, it is difficult to determine the adequate gauge length for measuring the strain of each region and establishing a stress–strain curve for Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of structural problems. In this paper, a method for identifying the region&#39;s boundary is proposed based on coupon tests using three steel grades, S355, S500, and S700, corresponding to three weld matching types, match, overmatch, and undermatch, respectively. First, the hardness and the microstructure investigation were conducted to determine the region&#39;s boundary. Then, the boundary was identified based on the DIC result using the proposed method. Finally, the identified HAZ regions were verified against hardness results. Using the proposed method, the gauge length for measuring the strain of a single region, such as HAZ and WM, are determined based on the DIC results. The primary purpose is to establish the stress–strain relationship for FEA of welded joints.},

In this study, in situ alloying and concurrent microstructure evolution during SLM are investigated by performing SLM on a BE Ti-185 powder while tracking the surface temperatures via Infra-red imaging and phase transforma- tion via synchrotron X-ray Diffraction. We then performed post-mortem electron microscopy (Backscatter Electron imaging, Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy and Electron Backscatter Diffraction) to further gain insight into microstructure development. We show that although exothermic mixing aids the melting process, laser melting results only in a mixture of alloyed and unmixed regions. Full alloying and thus a consistent microstructure is only achieved through further thermal cycling in the heat-affected zone .},

Here, milling media and cryogenic fluid were systematically varied and studied to quantify differences in impurity concentrations, microstructural evolution , and microhardness . Four derivatives of a Mo 25 Nb 25 Ta 25 W 25 high entropy alloy were mechanically alloyed using tool steel or tungsten carbide milling media with either liquid N 2 or Ar. Alloys were annealed for 100 h at 1000 °C or 1200 °C. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was primarily used to characterize as-milled and annealed specimens, and Vicker’s microindentation was used to compare hardness. Depending on the milling parameters, total impurity concentrations varied between 12 and 44 at.\%, different impurity nitrides or carbides were identified in annealed specimens, and differences in hardness of up to 5 GPa were measured amongst the alloys. Overall, milling with LN 2 led to the precipitation of ultrahard nitride phases that when combined with optimized heat treatments, improved the hardness beyond 17 GPa.},

  abstract     = {Being one of the hardest materials known in nature, boron carbide (B 4 C) suffers from severe degradation of mechanical properties when subjected to external pressure or shear stress, which hinders its application in metal forming and machining industries. Herein, based on the phase diagrams, a new strengthening strategy consisting of constructing three-dimensional hafnium diboride (HfB 2 ) networks was proposed to reinforce B 4 C using the molten-salts method followed by spark plasma sintering (SPS). It was found that the surface amorphization and subsequent decarburization were the main wear regime of pure B 4 C. Incorporating hard HfB 2 networks in B 4 C resulted in enhanced mechanical properties and reduced wear rates, as the deformation and decarburization of B 4 C grains were effectively restrained. The excessively high Hf contents, however, made the composites prone to severe adhesive wear following the material transfer from mating materials during the inception of sliding contact, which led to deteriorated wear performances. Thus, the optimal molar ratio of Hf to B 4 C was determined with the underlying wear mechanisms delineated. The presented results not only show the feasibility of B 4 C-HfB 2 composites as tool materials but also provide a novel designing strategy employing hard networks rather than conventional compliant binders to fabricate wear-resistant composite materials.},

Electrochemical tests were performed to measure the corrosion resistance of the passive film. The parameters of the passive films were calculated using the Mott-Schottky and the point defect model. TEM analysis was used to explain the high hardness and superior corrosion resistance on the base of the composition and boundary characteristics between different phases. Combining the results of wear and corrosion assessment, we deduce that a critical content of 2–3 at.\% exists for B 4 C at which the best wear-corrosion tradeoff of the coating can be achieved.

  abstract     = {Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) form bridging cross-bands that maintain structural integrity of collagen in the organic matrix of dentine. In dentine caries, proteolytic enzymes appeared to trigger GAGs bridge degradation, followed by breakdown of the collagen network, imposing critical limitations on dentine remineralization via biomimetic mineralization of collagen. While contemporary mechanisms of collagen modification through immobilizing functional groups have been established to improve collagen mineralization, this effort remains a challenge due to lack of consideration in preserving the spatial stability of collagen. In our study, proanthocyanidins (PA) was applied to simulate the bioactivities of GAGs. Detailed analyses showed that PA reconstructed interfibrillar bridges of collapsed collagen network and reduced interfacial energy between mineral-organic phases to enhance collagen hydrophilicity, subsequently facilitating infiltration of calcium phosphate precursors and hence promoting collagen mineralization. With this strategy, mechanical behaviors of demineralized dentine were significantly improved. PA exhibited satisfactory inhibitory effects on the activity of cariogenic bacteria (comparable to that of chlorhexidine). Moreover, ex vivo study indicated that remineralization and antibacterial effects were evident in the rat oral cavity. This strategy highlights the importance of maintaining structural integrity of the collagen network in dentine remineralization and offers great clinical potential for the effective treatment of dentine caries.},

We determined that the synergistic effect of BMSCs and costal chondrocytes was sufficient to induce chondrogenesis, but cartilage regeneration was better under TGF-β3 supplement. Memorably, when implanted in a rat osteochondral defect model for 12 weeks, the PCL/GelMA biphasic scaffolds with cells co-culture showed excellent cartilage regenerative capability, and enabled the Young’s modulus of engineered cartilage comparable to that of native cartilage. Furthermore, the implantation of biphasic scaffold resulted in less mechanical pain than cartilage defects by gait analysis. Together, both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that the PCL/GelMA biphasic scaffold with co-culture of BMSCs and chondrocytes is a promising scaffold for cartilage regeneration, which pave a new way to solve the key issues of clinical cartilage repair.},

The geometrical continuity problem of complex transition boundary of Multi-TPMS lattice is solved, and correlation mapping between principal stress direction and lattice type is established. In mesoscopic view, density model is used to represent the effective properties of lattice structure. Macroscopically, the design domain is divided into Stretch- and shear-dominated region according to the principal stress direction. By mapping specific lattice cells in different stress regions, the unique properties of different lattice cells are fully utilized to improve the mechanical properties.

  abstract     = {Catalytic reduction has been regarded as one of the most efficient strategy for organic pollutants removal from aqueous solution. However, lack of efficient catalyst prevents its practical application. Herein, we design a simple and environmental friendly fabrication strategy for the 3D Ag nanoparticles/Ti 3 C 2 T x /polyacrylamide (Ag/MX/PAM) composite hydrogel as high efficient catalyst. In this composite hydrogel, the Ag nanoparticles , Ti 3 C 2 T x (MXene) and polyacrylamide (PAM) act as active species, efficient electron transfer medium and high-capacity adsorbent respectively. Due to these synergistic effects for the composite hydrogel catalyst, the electron-transferring ability as well as the adsorption capacity are boosted and thus high catalytic activity achieves towards both methylene blue (MB) and 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) reduction. The superior rate constant k of 8.333 min −1 and turnover frequency (TOF) up to 25.17 min −1 for 4-NP reduction are realized over the 12\%-Ag/MX/PAM hydrogel. Impressively, this composite hydrogel with a foam-like bulk structure can be reused easily after catalytic reaction, making it a potential catalyst for reduction of organic pollutants in industrialization.},

However, the polysulfides shuttling with slow redox kinetics has seriously hindered their practical applications. Herein, sulfur-deficient zinc sulfide (ZnS 1 −x ) hollow polyhedrons are synthesized as the multifunctional sulfur host material via the sulfurization and high-temperature annealing method. The unique hollow structure could supply adequate void spaces for sulfur loading and alleviate volumetric expansion of sulfur upon the cycling process. Besides, ZnS 1 −x hollow polyhedrons with abundant sulfur vacancies can provide effective adsorption sites to chemically immobilize polysulfides and enhance polysulfides redox conversion as confirmed by theoretical calculation results and electrocatalytical experiments. Thus, the S/ZnS 1− x cathode delivers the remarkable initial capacity (1206 mAh g −1 at 0.2 C) and excellent cycling stability (592 mAh g −1 after 500 cycles at 1 C). The study points out the idea of functional cathode material for Li-S batteries based on a simple yet efficient vacancy engineering method.},

Structural analysis revealed that this material exceeded the typical substitutional solubility limit, even with a significant atomic size difference, where the conventional determination rule was defied. YYHEO exhibited a lower glass-like thermal conductivity due to its highly disordered crystal structure and the specific design strategy. The coefficient of thermal expansion and mechanical properties (e.g. elastic modulus and hardness) were comparable to conventional materials, suggesting that YYHEO is a promising candidate for application as a new thermal insulating material.},

For each foam layer, the optimal geometrical parameters of the perforated panel and the cavity depth maximizing sound absorption under normal incidence are determined, together with the corresponding sensitivity indices. The simulation results are found in good agreement with interpretations and experimental data provided elsewhere.

  abstract     = {The defect of mixed-grain structure with millimeter-grade coarse grains (MCGs) is frequently found in heavy forgings, such as nuclear main pipes manufactured from 316LN steel. Renovation of such kind forgings can only be conducted through recrystallization. However, the allowed deformation is limited because the geometric size of forgings should be maintained during the renovation. For this purpose, the deformation heterogeneity of 316LN steel with mixed-grain structures were studied experimentally, which demonstrated that the MCGs were more inclined to deform than fine grains even if MCGs are with hard orientations. Therefore, a two-stage method was studied to refine MCGs, which takes the advantage of this deformation heterogeneity. The first stage was to impose a limited deformation to the steel at room temperature, suppressing the dynamic recovery and leading the preferentially deformed MCGs to accumulate enough deformation energy storage. The second stage was rapidly heating the deformed materials to realize static recrystallization (SRX). The results showed that the MCGs were completely refined by SRX even if the reduction rate is only 8\%. The SRX mechanisms and refining assessments of MCGs under different deformation conditions were discussed. This work, thus, provides an effective method to salvage the heavy structures in engineering.},

We propose an approach to design architectured ceramics using machine learning (ML), trained by finite element analysis data and together with a self-learning algorithm, to discover high-performance architectured ceramics in thermomechanical environments. First, topologically interlocked panels are parametrically generated. Then, a limited number of designed architectured ceramics subjected to a thermal load is studied. Finally, the multilinear perceptron is employed to train the ML model in order to predict the thermomechanical performance of architectured panels with varied interlocking angles and number of blocks. The developed feed-forward artificial neural network framework can boost the architectured ceramic design efficiency and open up new avenues for controllability of the functionality for various high-temperature applications. This study demonstrates that the architectured ceramic panels with the ML-assisted engineered patterns show improvement up to 30\% in frictional energy dissipation and 7\% in the sliding distance of the tiles and 80\% reduction in the strain energy, leading to a higher safety factor and the structural failure delay compared to the plain ceramics.},

Atom probe tomography showed that hot-rolled SDSS, experiencing significant metal working, had faster kinetics of phase separations compared to the SDSS and HDSS welds after 5 min aging at 475 °C. The surface of the 33-mm SDSS plate had faster Fe and Cr phase separation and larger toughness drop. A higher density of dislocations next to the austenite phase boundary in ferrite, detected by electron channeling contrast, can promote the phase separation at the surface of the plate with lower austenite spacing. The toughness dropped in HDSS welds after aging, but SDSS welds maintained their toughness. An inverse simulation method considering an initial sinusoidal nanometric Cr and Fe fluctuation showed that Ni increases the interdiffusion of Cr in the system, resulting a higher degree of phase separation in SDSS welds than the HDSS weld. Within the composition range of the studied SDSS and HDSS materials, the processing influences the Fe and Cr phase separation more than the variation in composition during short aging or typical fabrication times.},

Unfortunately, current studies fail to comprehensively consider indispensable microstructure information, and lack the consideration regarding part geometry. Therefore, this paper proposes and implements a geometry-considered 3D pseudorandom grain-scale modelling method, which takes into account the necessary actual microstructure information, part geometry and their mutual relations to generate accurate and efficient microstructure-dependent crystal plasticity finite element (M−CPFE) models. Firstly, the 3D actual grain-scale microstructure was acquired efficiently by combining 2D actual microstructures. Then the geometry-considered grain-scale microstructure was created pseudorandomly based on the actual 3D grain size, orientation and misorientation distributions. On this basis, the M−CPFE model was constructed accurately. The proposed method has been proved to have higher accuracy and robustness than the Voronoi random method on macroscopic response prediction, microstructure generation and microstructure evolution prediction. Furthermore, the applicability in micro-manufacturing and service has been demonstrated by micro sheet bending and micro impeller rotation simulations. There is a great potential for the full lifecycle tracking of crystalline material miniature parts with the help of the proposed method.},

A continuous distribution of strain fields in a nickel-based superalloy, evaluated periodically during R = 0 cyclic loading, exposes the fundamental heterogeneity in polycrystalline response which creates locations of high stress gradients and potential sites of failure. Incompatibility is shown to be an effective measure driving the spatial concentration of stress with loading, particularly at twin and high angle grain boundaries. Furthermore, incompatible deformation is shown, through both specific examples and statistically, to be predominantly preserved upon elastic recovery improving our understanding of the history dependence of residual stresses. Positive correlation between residual stress &amp; incompatible deformation and saturation of material response or shakedown in response to cyclic loading is revealed. The scalability of the framework with experiments at multiple length scales are discussed.},

In parallel, a multi-domain microstructure associated with strain and tilt affect the silicon crystallinity due to smaller cracks and defects which originate at the bonding interface and travel to the outer part of the crystal. The effectiveness of the bonding is also assessed by our approach and further enforced by means of SEM observation of the sample cross-section.

To achieve high machine efficiencies, it is desirable for these NOES laminations to be able to achieve a high saturation magnetisation whilst incurring minimal core losses. It is known that inappropriate machining of these laminations could cause significant deterioration in their magnetic properties. However, the mechanisms by which machining influences this deterioration are less understood. This study investigates the magnetic deterioration after four nonconventional machining methods: Abrasive Waterjet, Wire Electric Discharge Machining, Pulsed Laser, and Continuous Wave Laser. An in-depth investigation of surface integrity through a range of methods, i.e., surface topography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nanoindentation, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and magnetic domain imaging, were conducted to study the mechanisms causing magnetic deterioration. The surface integrity after machining using conventional methods (e.g., microstructure and texture), was found to not be of high relevance unless this is combined with analysis on how machining affects the micro-magnetic domain structure. This paper, for the first time, highlights this aspect and attempts to make initial quantitative evaluations on how the magnetic domains are affected in the superficial layer that is the result of non-conventional machining.},

Yet, most of the current work only focuses on controlling the elastic modulus by the relative density. For special engineering applications, such as porous bone implants or energy absorbers, the generated porous TPMS may still be broken due to anisotropy. In this work, two strategies are proposed to design isotropic TPMS structures. The numerical homogenization theory and finite element analysis methods are utilized to study the relationship between TPMS parameters and the elastic modulus or anisotropy properties. Based on that, a Curvature-Wall thickness (CW) adjustment method is proposed for sheet TPMS structures whose performances are close to isotropy properties. In virtue of the constructed design map, both elastic modulus and anisotropy properties can be controlled. For sheet TPMS structures whose performances are far from the isotropy properties, the TPMS units can be combined to generate composite TPMS, which can be further designed by the proposed Curvature-Wall thickness adjustment method. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approaches. Appropriate elastic modulus and ideal isotropy properties can be acquired at the same time.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using biomimetic materials for bone tissue engineering. However, the high immunogenicity and low mechanical properties of biomimetic materials limit their applications in vivo. As an essential component of the extracellular matrix in bone tissue, collagen is ideal because it easily degrades and has strong plasticity and low immunogenicity. However, pure collagen alone does not yield satisfactory experimental results. Therefore, biomimetic bone tissue engineering scaffolds are often prepared together with other bioactive materials to better replicate the bone tissue’s biological microenvironment. To better understand the engineered scaffolds, we have summarized and analyzed current research in collagen-based biomimetic bone tissue engineering. This review focuses on the acquisition and processing of collagen, the mechanisms involved in collagen-induced osteogenesis, the biomimetic materials composed of collagen and different materials, and the application of collagen-based bioactive materials in bone tissue engineering.},

  abstract     = {Laser based additive manufacturing of UHMWPE offers new opportunities for realizing complex components for medical implants. Conventionally, laser powder bed fusion of UHMWPE is achieved by CO 2 lasers but up to now the mechanical properties of the produced specimen are still relatively poor. The aim of the presented work is to extend the processing window for this material to improve the physical properties by using ultrashort laser pulses at a wavelength of 1030 nm. The linear absorption of UHMWPE at 1030 nm is extremely low, which prevents the use of common continuous solid-state lasers. By contrast, the 500 fs laser pulses used result in peak intensities of several hundred GW/cm 2 leading to multi-photon absorption processes. We show that the absorption can be locally increased up to 20\%. Hence, it was possible to deposit and accumulate enough heat to fuse the polymer particles by controlling pulse energy and repetition rate. A suitable processing regime for sintering and complete melting has been investigated and correlated with the crystallinity and micro-hardness, reaching values similar to molded UHMWPE. Finally, preliminary tensile tests on produced specimens reveal an ultimate tensile strength of 4 MPa, surpassing the values obtained using a CO 2 laser.},

In this paper, a novel hybrid bi-layer scaffold was fabricated using electrospun polycaprolactone/gelatine (PCL/Gel) nanofibre membranes combined with 3D printed PCL/Gel/nano-hydroxyapatite (n-HA) scaffolds. Their manipulation parameters and microstructures were investigated, and biological studies of in vitro and in vivo bone regeneration were carried out. The heparin-conjugated PCL/Gel fibrous membrane could significantly promote L929 fibroblast adhesion and proliferation. The PCL/Gel/n-HA (PGH) scaffold could promote attachment, growth and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. After 20 weeks, the defect sites in the hybrid bi-layer scaffold group showed a higher degree of new bone formation than that in the control group, indicating that this is a promising material combination for GBR.},

Although the development of multi-material additive manufacturing (AM) combined with biomimetic design provide new opportunities for the realization of ASDs with complex behavior, the influence of different biomimetic designs on the kinematics of ASD in conjunction with AM is not yet explored. Therefore, this study proposes and fabricates four types of biomimetic, multi-material ASD designs based on mimicking either the material stiffness gradient or the structure found in a natural IVD. The results show that all the designs exhibit a desired viscoelastic behavior , while the ASD design based on a chainmail-like structure exhibits a nature-mimicking nonlinear rotational load response. In terms of restoring the natural trend of an IVD’s anisotropic behavior, the ASD design that mimics the structure found in an IVD outperforms the design that solely mimics an IVD’s material stiffness gradient. Additionally, all the designs proposed in this study show comparable instant helical axis (IHA) and instant center of rotation (ICOR) to an IVD&#39;s regarding their location and moving direction.},

In this work, the surface and tensile behavior of microstruts of 500 μm 500μm nominal diameter micromachined with Gaussian laser pulses of &amp;lt;100fs duration are characterized. Roughness parameters such as R a = 0.9 ± 0.2 μm Ra=0.9±0.2μm and R z = 3.4 ± 1.3 μm Rz=3.4±1.3μm are achieved on the micromachined faces. Surface-associated grains are successfully ablated with negligible microstructural damage to the microstruts. As a result, the average uniform strain under quasi-static tensile loading is measured as 0 . 54 ± 0 . 02 0.54±0.02 compared to 0 . 42 ± 0 . 01 0.42±0.01 for the as-built microstruts. Uniform and non-uniform deformation strain portions are separated analytically and characterized primarily via in-situ imaging. Progressive degradation of the surface and dimensional variance is observed on the micromachined test specimens. Post necking initiation, ablation-associated asperities on the micromachined surfaces evolve into notches, leading to tensile failure.},

A key challenge for superhydrophobic materials is insufficient stability under harsh conditions. Recently, ceramic materials have been used to prepare superhydrophobic materials due to their intrinsic chemical inertness, high mechanical properties and stability. Here, a stable nonfluorinated superhydrophobic mullite fabric modified by in situ growth of silicon carbide (SiC) nanowires, dopamine and octadecylamine (ODA), was successfully prepared through a simple in situ growth and polymerization method. The modified mullite fabric exhibited repellency to water with a water contact angle (WCA) of more than 150° and a sliding angle (SA) of less than 10°. The modified mullite fabric showed excellent durability against mechanical abrasion while retaining the three-dimensional rough structure due to the SiC nanowires and dopamine anchoring of the ODA tightly onto the surface of SiC nanowires, thus sustaining superhydrophobicity. Moreover, the obtained mullite fabric maintained stable superhydrophobicity under severe environments, such as in corrosive solutions or in organic solvents. We believe that a facile, inexpensive and environmentally friendly approach and a high-performance superhydrophobic material could be applied for many important industrial applications.},

The results show that the AGG area almost contained no low angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) while the fine extrusion fibers in the matrix area contained numerous LAGBs. The AGG structure at weld seam leads to precipitated phases coarsening, PFZ widening and a sharp decrease of elongation in profiles. During aging process, the AGG area precipitated more coarse S′/S and T 2 phases and exhibited a faster age hardening rate than the matrix area, while the numerous LAGBs in the matrix area promoted the precipitation of strengthening phases (T 1 , δ′/β′) and suppressed the formation of coarse phases. The phases formed along the grain boundaries are mainly coarse quasi-crystal T 2 phases while abundant fine T 1 phases formed along the LAGBs of the matrix area, and the PFZ of AGG area is far wider than that in matrix area. During the pre-stretching process, the fine grains and LAGBs of the matrix area conduced to form and store more dislocations, which provided more nucleation sites for T 1 phases.},

Interfacial microstructures of these composites were systematically characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy to investigate the interfacial microstructure evolution and reaction dynamics. The effects of interfacial microstructures on interfacial mechanical properties were also investigated using thin-slice fiber push-out tests. The results show that the brittle interfacial reaction layer of TiC in the C-coated SiC f /Ti-6Al-4V composites was obviously thickened and some microvoids even formed near the matrix with increasing heat treatment durations, whereas the matrix adjacent to Mo coating in the C/Mo-coated SiC f /Ti-6Al-4V composites gradually transformed into a ductile β-Ti layer. Interfacial shear strengths of the C/Mo-coated composites were slightly increased with increasing the heat treatment time, while those of the C-coated composites were remarkably improved.

The present work investigates both the mechanical and chemical properties of a porcupine quill. An axial compression test is conducted on the natural material in three states: the entire composite quill structure and the response of shell and foam phases individually. These mechanical responses are reported, and compressive failure modes are quantified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and micro-computed tomography (µCT). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is conducted and a slight compositional variation is found between the shell and foam phases of the porcupine quill. The design of a porcupine quill inspired structure is achieved through fabrication by stereolithography (SLA) additive manufacturing (AM) technology. Based on these design workflows, the properties of the structures, including struts length and relative density are analysed. Random workflow has a higher number of short struts while longer struts dominate reflected workflow. Relative density increases with the increasing number of seeds. However, it decreases with a growing number of sectors. Qualitative analysis of the numerical simulation presented shows the importance of struts connectivity for efficient stress distribution.},

First, surface modification of T-ZnO w was conducted using a pyrolysis method based on self-assembly to deposit NiO nanoparticles densely and evenly on the whisker surface. The interfacial relationship between T-ZnO w (1 0 0) and NiO (1 0 1) planes was semi-coherent with a misfit of 0.145. In-situ transmission electron microscopy was used to explore the surface modification mechanism. Next, a composite solder of 0.3mass\% NiO/T-ZnO w reinforced Sn1.0Ag0.5Cu was prepared with ultrasonic agitation, and the introduced reinforcement was uniformly distributed in the solder matrix. A thin NiO transition layer existed between the reinforcement and matrix, indicating the formation of the Sn1.0Ag0.5Cu/NiO/T-ZnO w sandwich structure interface. No gaps, pores, or new phases were formed at the interface, and atomic interdiffusion occurred at the interface to form effective bonding. The composite solder shows improved wettability compared with plain solder. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation of the composite solder were 32.5 MPa and 28.1\%, respectively, being 19.0\% and 35.1\% higher than those of the plain Sn1.0Ag0.5Cu solder.

The empirical formula based on traditional statistics is a key reference for composition design. Due to the lack of experimental data, a large deviation may exist among the prediction results from the empirical formulas obtained by different data sources. In present work, we proposed an augmentation strategy of empirical formula based on a machine learning method to build the relationship between martensite transformation start temperature (Ms) and compositions in Cu-Al-based SMA system. A series of ML models were established by physical and chemical features and a Gaussian radial basis kernel function support vector machine (SVR.rbf) model was screened out based on mathematical and domain knowledge criteria. An augmented empirical formula of Ms as the function of compositions was fitted based on the abundant augmented dataset combined experimental data with predicted data by the SVR.rbf model. Compared with previous empirical formula fitted by small experimental dataset, the accuracy and robustness of the augmented empirical formula was significantly improved without additional experimental cost. This strategy offers a recipe to build empirical formula based on a small experimental dataset.},

  abstract     = {This paper compares three distinctive sensors for laser powder bed fusion metal additive manufacturing process monitoring. A microphone for airborne acoustic emissions, an on-axis two-colour pyrometer for melt pool temperature measurement and an off-axis thermographic camera are simultaneously applied. They are challenged with a large build area to investigate their robustness and sensitivity. This paper does not assess the sensors’ ability to detect specific process flaws, but instead gives a common ground comparison of general sensor characteristics. The camera provides a descriptive result in form of a heat-map, while it exhibits a lack of sensitivity. In contrast, the microphone presents a sensitivity up to 40 times higher than the camera and is still 15 times more sensitive than the pyrometer. However, with this comes increased susceptibility; its signal strength is strongly dependent on the distance to the melt pool as a result of frequency dependent dissipation. The pyrometer’s signal is sensitive enough for relevant process deviations to be uncovered, while being robust towards different sensing distances. Recommendations are given for successful implementation of the sensors. Additionally, novel process phenomena were uncovered: an interaction of the scanning direction with the shielding gas is discussed, plus insights regarding overhang scanning are acquired.},

  abstract     = {Powder bed defects usually inevitably appear in the process of powder spreading during laser powder bed fusion owing to the characteristics of the powder material and the performance of the spreading equipment. This may lead to instability with regard to subsequent processes and the quality of the final part. Defect detection based on the imaging process is an effective way to achieve non-contact, efficient, and accurate online monitoring, and it has received widespread attention. In this paper, an imaging method for online collection of powder bed is proposed based on the experiments of various lighting strategies, whose influences on defect analysis are evaluated. Subsequently, an adaptive segmentation algorithm for defect extraction is proposed that automatically searches for the best threshold by evaluating the gray histogram of the powder bed image. Finally, different convolution neural networks were applied to implement the classification of the defects, and their performances were evaluated and compared. The results of the on-site experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has good accuracy and efficiency in the multi-defect detection of a powder bed.},

The as-built cemented carbide samples had different microstructures from those of the cemented carbides fabricated by conventional manufacturing methods. The microstructures of the as-fabricated WC-25Co and WC-17Co cemented carbides were characterized by two types of regions. Region 1 consisted of W 2 C and W 3 Co 3 C phases, including numerous pores and defects. Region 2 consisted of WC and Co phases. Post heat-treatment of the LPBF-built WC-25Co sample at 1380 °C led to the formation of a defect-free WC-Co two-phase microstructure. In contrast, the W 3 Co 3 C phase remained in the LPBF-built WC-17Co sample even after heat treatment. The addition of carbon to the WC-17Co powder prevented the formation of the W 3 Co 3 C phase in the cemented carbide processed by LPBF and subsequent heat treatments. The addition of carbon to the WC-17Co powder had a slight effect on the hardness of as-fabricated samples, but reduced the hardness of heat-treated samples. The reduced hardness was attributed to the increased volume fractions of the WC and W 3 Co 3 C phases.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing of ceramics is transforming electromagnetics by providing density-varying lattices and stochastic foams within arbitrary envelopes. Periodic structures can now be fabricated with zirconia which offers the highest permittivity of any 3D printable material possible to be printed with nearly-full-density. By arranging a lattice with variation in the strut and node sizings as well as unit cell dimensions, the effective density of a structure can be spatially-modulated gracefully and with unprecedented freedom. These variations in density directly translate into variations in the effective permittivity of the bulk lattice (estimated locally and globally with a combination of mixing formulas, curve fits, and capacitance models). A lattice had previously been fabricated with a rectangular envelope for evaluation of effective global permittivity of the overall structure using a network analyzer. For this work, the structure was scanned with X-ray computed tomography (CT) to capture the three dimensional density of the structure including both the solid ceramic elements as well as the interstitial space. Software was developed that reads CT scan data and provides a 3D data structure with a pointwise unit cell estimation of the effective permittivity throughout the volume - a model well suited for electromagnetic simulations to optimize advanced microwave devices. The proposed technique serves as a foundation for the non-destructive estimation of space-varying permittivity within 3D printed lattices and foams.},

A type of extremal materials with four zero eigenvalues called quadramode (QM) materials is the subject of this investigation. Wave properties of different QM materials, particularly their capacity on shaping iso -frequency curves, are firstly examined with homogeneous models. A three-dimensional QM material is then designed using a truss lattice model. The designed lattice is validated through comparison between the homogeneous and discrete models on their prediction on iso -frequency curves and polarizations. An out-of-plane shear (SH) wave polarizer is proposed with the designed QM material, it can effectively prevent the mode conversion at interface with fluids. This unique property is further explored for waterborne sound isolation, a prototype of this polarizer is also proposed and demonstrated through numerical simulation. This study paves the way for exploring the exotic wave properties of QM extremal materials, and opens a new route to control low frequency elastic wave.},

To reveal the mechanisms behind the excellent mechanical properties, multi-scale characterizations are carried out to study the microstructure and the micro-strain. The results suggest that IFIHT after cold deformation not only facilitates partial recrystallization and dislocation annihilation, but also restricts grain coarsening. High proportion of high angle grain boundaries improve the dislocation accumulation ability, the defect-free recrystallized grains and the sub-grains with a high degree of dislocation annihilation facilitate dislocations slipping, therefore good ductility is achieved. In addition, the high angle grain boundaries formed through recrystallization and dislocations left after partial recrystallization ensures high strength. The enhancement of dislocation storage capacity of grains leads to the improvement of work hardening ability, which reflects in the form of high uniform elongation in the stress-strain curves.},

Further investigation via the Vickers hardness test and the bending test was performed on the fabricated welds. Tensile test results demonstrated superior tensile properties in the fusion zone, where specimen failure occurred within the base metal region. Microstructure analyses revealed the strengthening of the fusion zone by the formation of the martensite phase and grain refinement at the heat-affected zone (HAZ). No failure or cracks were observed in the samples after the bend test, indicating the high quality of the weld.

The addition of trace amounts of ytterbium (Yb) and precious metal silver significantly improved the ductility of MMGs under bending and tensile loading. The results show that the amorphous alloy with 4 at\% of Yb exhibits optimum specific strength mainly because of high-density coarsening shear bands. Electrochemical experiments, immersion test, and analysis of corrosion products by XPS and EDS after immersion showed that the amorphous alloy with 4 at\% of Yb exhibits the greatest corrosion resistance among the four samples because of rare earth (Yb) oxide film.

The effective stiffnesses and yield stresses of a unit cell are obtained using numerical homogenization and validated experimentally. Due to the orthotropic behavior of the unit cell, the modified Hill’s yield criterion is used to describe the lattice strength. The effective orthotropic properties are implemented via macrostructure topology optimization to further improve the lattice structure stiffness. Homogenization-based optimization is performed using a coarse mesh and the optimized design is projected onto a fine mesh. This reduces the computational cost significantly. Finally, the projected design is post-processed to ensure the fabrication feasibility of the optimized lattice structure. The framework is tested for two cases: an L-shaped bracket and a single-edge notched bend (SENB) problem. A comparison of the compliance-based and stress-constrained designs used in the two cases demonstrates that the changes in the optimal material distribution that occur upon implementing the stress constraint result in higher yield strength. The SENB lattice structures are additively manufactured and the stiffnesses and yield strength of the optimized designs are compared to those obtained numerically.},

However, the relationship between surface cleaning and bonding performance of bonded samples in the additive forging process is unclear. This paper studies the effect of surface cleaning on interface bonding performance for the first time. A new characterization method of surface cleanliness consisting of water contact angles, relative fluorescence units, and optical observation was proposed to characterize the cleaning effect. The micromorphologies and tensile properties were used to evaluate interface bonding performance. Elemental analysis and morphological analysis were used to infer the hindrance mechanism of contaminants. The results show that the new characterization method can effectively characterize the surface cleanliness of substrates. Moreover, the interfacial bonding performance results indicate that surface cleaning had a great influence on the bonding performance for 316H stainless steel joints manufactured by additive forging. Finally, the hindrance mechanisms of particles, chips, and oil contaminants were attributed to the hindrance effect in a radial direction , along the interface direction, and perpendicular to the interface direction respectively. This research builds a relationship between surface cleaning and bonding performance, which helps achieve high-performance manufacturing of heavy forgings.},

This work presents a new segmentation model based on the DeepLab V3 + network for automated probabilistic segmentation of fibers embedded in glass fiber reinforced concrete (GFRC) images obtained from micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT). A total of 2700 sliced images (715 × 715 pixels) are prepared by Micro-CT scanning and data augmentation, of which 2400 are for training with the remaining 300 for validation. It is shown that the proposed model can accurately and effectively segment the fibers in GFRC. The efficiency of the proposed segmentation model is accessed by three metrics of accuracy, intersection over union, and F1-score index, and they are reaching up to 99.3\%, 80.4\% and 67.2\%, respectively. Moreover, the model can achieve a better segmentation than the traditional deep learning models. With good qualitative prediction, the proposed approach shows promise for predicting fiber segmentation based on unlabeled data obtained in the field. Finally, three-dimensional distribution of short fibers in GFRC samples with size of 2.99 × 2.99 × 2.99 mm 3 is developed for reconstruction analysis.},

  abstract     = {At present, the shortage of potable water is still a critical issue. The emerging of solar-driven evaporation technique offers a promising way to solve freshwater scarcity. However, developing highly efficient evaporation system is still a challenge. Herein, this work developed two-dimensional heterostructure nanosheets as the photothermal agent. We used the WSe 2 nanosheets to enhance the absorption of graphene and facilitate the heat localization due to its higher visible light absorption and ultralow thermal conductivity. And graphene provided the low surface reflection and a broad absorption spectrum. Moreover, the enhanced near infrared photothermal conversion of the heterostructure nanosheets is realized to be 41.4\% higher than some previous works by introducing lanthanide ions. A series of experiments are performed to determine its heterostructure. Besides, the interfacial evaporation system has been constructed based on as-prepared nanosheets, exhibiting excellent solar-to-heat efficiency of 91.8\% and water evaporation rate of 1.672 kg m −2 h −1 under stimulated 1 sun irradiation. It is suggested that developed nanosheets have the potential application for highly effective solar-driven evaporation.},

  abstract     = {In the past few years, synaptic device has become a hot topic in material science because of the urgent demand of neuromorphic computing . Ionic liquids gated three-terminal synaptic transistors have drawn extensive attention due to their outstanding energy efficiency, linearity, and symmetry. However, utilization of liquid electrolyte is not appropriate for the requirement of the practical application. Herein, a novel three-terminal synaptic transistor is designed and constructed using a solid-state electrolyte gate and a brownmillerite SrFeO 2.5 thin film channel. Topotactic phase transformation can be induced between insulative brownmillerite SrFeO 2.5 and conductive perovskite SrFeO 3−δ . Nonvolatile conductance switching of the SrFeO x film can be realized by inserting and extracting of oxygen ions with electrolyte gating. The essential synaptic learning functions including excitatory postsynaptic current, and short-term/long-term plasticity, are successfully mimicked in the three-terminal synaptic transistor. This synapse device achieves a large scale adjusted range and multistable plasticity, demonstrating a new way to achieve key component of upcoming neuromorphic circuitry.},

Calcium phosphate cement (CPC) loaded with BMP-9 was coated on the surface and partially filled in the intramedullary cavity of DPOA. A canine femoral condylar defect model was established and implanted with DPOA/CPC/BMP-9 material. DPOA preserved the shape of the femoral condyle and the three-dimensional reticular bone matrix structure. CPC/BMP-9 persistently and slowly released BMP-9. The DPOA/CPC/BMP-9 group was superior to the DPOA/BMP-9 and DPOA groups in the number and maturity of newly formed blood vessels, the number and maturity of bone trabecular structures, and the integrated optical density of the type I collagen-positive area. At 16 weeks after the operation, the newly formed bone trabeculae in the DPOA/CPC/BMP-9 group were well shaped and orderly, forming a lamellar woven bone structure that was tightly connected to the boundary of the host bone, resulting in excellent osteoarticular repair. As a novel compound osteoarticular repair material, DPOA/CPC/BMP-9 has excellent biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, osteoinductivity, and angiogenicity, and it is expected to become an excellent alternative repair material for bone tissue engineering.},

  abstract     = {Traditional photothermal therapy (PTT) usually requires hyperthermia (greater than50 °C) to mediate effective tumor ablation, which could inevitably induce heating damage to the adjacent normal tissues. Therefore, to achieve effective tumor killing at relatively low temperature is crucial to improve the application of PTT. MoS 2 , as an attractive photothermal agents, have attracted much attention in biomedical applications. But the separation of exfoliation and functionalization of MoS 2 nanosheets (NSs) partly complicates the preparation process of MoS 2 NSs-based theranostic nanomaterials. Herein, we formulated a facile one-pot approach for the exfoliation and in situ functionalization of single-layer MoS 2 nanosheets by using bovine serum albumin template gadolinium oxide (BSA-Gd 2 O 3 ) nanoparticles as the exfoliating agent and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T 1 contrast agent. On this basis, hyaluronic acid (HA) was further conjugated to target cancer cells with overexpression of CD44, and then gambogic acid (GA), a natural heat shock protein 90 inhibitor and antitumor drug was loaded, which could reduce the thermo-resistance of tumor cells and achieve effective PTT at a mild temperature (43–45 °C). In this research, both in vitro and in vivo experiments have confirmed that the GA/MoS 2 /BSA-Gd 2 O 3 -HA nanocomposite possesses good biocompatibility and is promising for the application in MRI-guided combined low-temperature PTT and chemotherapy.},

However, it has not been illustrated about the relationship between the structural length scale of 3D scaffolds and their ability to integrating with natural tissues. In this study, using a simple post-operative adhesion model, we evaluated the effects of three kinds of fibrous scaffolds with different thicknesses (50 μm, 120 μm, and 200 μm-thick scaffolds) as an ideal anti-adhesion barrier. Though having the same component, surface porosity and degradation rate , 120 μm and 200 μm-thick scaffolds with smaller mean pore size could prevent adhesion while 50 μm-thick ones couldn’t. The fibrous scaffolds with an insufficient thickness (50 μm) provided a better platform for cell proliferation , which led to its highest adhesion occurrence in all the operation groups, even higher than the negative group without any anti-adhesion membranes. Meanwhile, post-operative intestinal obstruction and inflammation were emphatically discussed after considering the implantation amount, membrane flexibility, and cell toxicity. This study on 3D fibrous scaffolds during post-operative healing might open some new and interesting opportunities for understanding tissue regeneration and organ renovation, and designing multilevel hierarchical structures as implanted templates.},

Probiotic encapsulation is developed as a biotechnological tool to cope with the technological issues derived from the handling and application of probiotics. Encapsulating living probiotics within appropriate biomaterials is a crucial extension of the functions of probiotics and further development. Biomaterials-based probiotic encapsulation not only protects the vitality of the probiotics but also is a better way to make them delivered to their target location. This review summarizes recent advances of biomaterial-based encapsulated probiotics, including encapsulation methods, encapsulation materials, and encapsulation effects. Further, we highlight biomaterial-based encapsulated probiotics in diversified biomedical applications, including the gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, vagina, and skin. In the final section, current challenges faced by biomaterial-based encapsulated probiotics are outlined and future perspectives for advancing this research are proposed.},

The simulation results show that of all the orientations, Goss grain possesses the largest fatigue crack deflection, then followed by Cube orientation. Comparatively, Brass, Copper, S and Random grains have relatively small crack deflection angles. Besides, it is found that Goss grain with the largest fatigue crack deflection possesses the lowest FCP rate as compared with other orientations. The results of simulations are consistent with previous experimental observations. This indicates that this coupled CP XFEM CZM simulation method is capable of well predicting the effect of grain orientation on FCP during fatigue stage ΙΙ of Al-Cu-Mg single crystal.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in methods to fabricate hydrophobic surfaces. Hydrophobic surfaces have been used in multiple applications in microfluidic devices to control fluid flow, as self-cleaning surfaces and also in de-icing or for drag reduction. Conventionally, hydrophobic surfaces were created by laser processing, self-assembly and other chemical processing methods. However, in many of these methods, hydrophobicity of the surface cannot be maintained for an extended time or restricted to limited set of materials. In some applications, creation of anisotropy in the hydrophobic property and the ability to pattern it, is important. Here, a low-cost, high-throughput method to generate highly hydrophobic and anisotropic surface has been developed. This method uses Computer Numerical Control machining employing diamond tools whose tips have been micro-structured using Focused Ion Beam that enables parallelization and achieves at least four times higher machining speed compared with other methods. The versatility of this method has been demonstrated by machining both metal and polymeric materials. Significant anisotropic wetting has been observed on the machined surface with the anisotropy in directional contact angle of up to 71.6°. Highly-hydrophobic surfaces with contact angle of 163.1° on 6061 Aluminum Alloy and 155.7° on polymethyl methacrylate surface were created.},

After fully optimizing their structures using the VASP package, their electronic structure, interatomic bonding, partial charge distribution, and mechanical properties are calculated and compared, revealing the intricate interdependence among them. A novel parameter based on the quantum mechanical metric for internal cohesion, the total bond order density (TBOD), is used to interpret the calculated properties. The highest TBOD is found in Cantor alloy NiFeCoCrMn but lower in NiFeCoCrPd. The atomic radii vary depending on their local chemical environment. The resulting lattice distortions is validated experimentally in NiFeCoCrMn and NiFeCoCrPd. Moreover, modeling of Cu and Pd clustering in the supercell shows they have lower total energy in agreement with the observation of Cu-enhanced nano-participates in NiFeCoCrCu and Pd-induced concentration wave in NiFeCoCrPd HEAs.},

Herein, yielding anisotropy was attained by an α ↔ β cyclic phase transformation (CPT) treatment via pulsed electric current (PEC). After the three-cycle CPT treatment, the CP-Ti perpendicular to the PEC direction exhibited the maximum value of (0002) plane in the X-ray diffraction intensity and of {0001} pole figure for electron backscatter diffraction analysis. The three-cycle-treated CP-Ti presented a significant yielding anisotropy which was the far greater yield strength (297.5 MPa) than that of the other treated specimens. This is attributed to the preferential activation of basal  slip with a higher effective critical resolved shear stress in the three-cycle-treated CP-Ti, compared with the preferential activation of prismatic  slip for the other treated specimens. Fundamentally, the lattice evolution mechanism and orientation relationship ({0001} α // {001} β and α / / β &amp;lt;112¯0&amp;gt;α//&amp;lt;1¯00&amp;gt;β ) responsible for this yielding anisotropy were proposed. Under the PEC, the (0001) plane in HCP structure transformed in parallel to the (001) plane in BCC structure, and followed by the transformation of the (110) plane in the BCC to the (0001) plane in the HCP under cooling when the PEC was switched off.},

No effective therapies have been proposed for ARSACS, even if some evidences suggest that powerful antioxidant agents can be considered as a therapeutic tool. Resveratrol (Res) is a natural polyphenol compound derived from vegetal sources, the application of which in biomedicine is increasing in the latest years owing to its significant therapeutic effects, in particular in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we provide evidences about its potential exploitation in the treatment of ARSACS. Because of the low solubility of Res in physiological media, a nanoplatform based on nanostructured lipid carriers is proposed for its encapsulation and delivery. Resveratrol-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (Res-NLCs) have been synthetized, characterized, and tested on healthy and ARSACS patient fibroblasts. Nanovectors displayed optimal stability and biocompatibility, and excellent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. A comprehensive investigation at gene (with real-time quantitative RT-PCR) and protein (with proteomics) level demonstrated the therapeutic potential of Res-NLCs, encouraging future investigations on pre-clinical models.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to evaluate the potential use of an innovative functionally graded lattice-filled composite beam composed of axial and radial graded three-dimensional lattice cores. Graded lattice filled circular beams with different graded patterns are compared with homogenous lattice filled counterparts. Graded lattice core samples are prepared using 3D printing techniques, inserted into thin-walled tubes and subjected to three-point bending loads. Then numerical models are created in Abaqus and verified against the experiments. Parametric studies find that the novel lattice-filled structure absorbs more energy but yields larger crushing force than the uniform counterpart. In addition, various parameters, like gradient parameter and filling length, thickness and yield stress of column wall, have a considerable impact on the crashworthiness of this novel structure. Finally, multi-objective optimization is performed to maximize specific energy absorption while reducing maximum impact force. Optimization results show that graded lattice-filled structures produce superior Pareto solutions than the ordinary counterparts. Especially, the specific energy absorption can be increased to 173.9\% and increasing graded lattice-filled structure has the best crashworthiness, and the least decreasing graded lattice-filled structure. The functionally graded lattice core of this study provides a novel approach to design new crash-resistant energy absorber with high energy absorption capacity.},

  abstract     = {In order to investigate the feasibility of the electron beam melting (EBM) process for fabricating brittle Mo-Si-B based alloys, the effect of preheating on cracking behavior and microstructure evolution was systematically investigated using two different MoSiBTiC alloys. Single track and multi tracks were scanned on the cast MoSiBTiC alloy substrates with and without preheating. In the single-track scanning, the crack density significantly decreased with increasing preheating temperature; however, only tiny cracks remained even at high preheating temperature of ~1250 °C. In contrast, the application of multi-track scanning with preheating, which more closely resembles the actual EBM building process, enabled complete cracking suppression regardless of the same beam parameter. The surface and cross-sectional microstructure observation revealed that the difference in cracking behavior between single-track and multi-track scanning is due to the decrease in cooling rate by in-situ heating effects through successive track scanning in addition to initial preheating. Moreover, it was confirmed that the cracking could be prevented even in the case of a very brittle intermetallic phase (Mo 5 SiB 2 )-matrix MoSiBTiC alloy. This groundbreaking result expands the possibilities of using EBM for the manufacturing of promising ultrahigh-temperature and high-strength materials, which have been unable to be processed by conventional routes.},

  abstract     = {Polymer matrix composites (PMCs) with high- k and low loss (tan δ ) have aroused extensive research due to their significant applications in energy-storage capacitors and novel printed circuit board. In this work, the single layer structured graphene/polyvinylidene fluoride (GR/PVDF) composites were synthesized by hot pressing process, in which the fascinating permittivity transition from positive to negative was attributed to plasma oscillation. Meanwhile, the alternating current conductivity ( σ a c σac ) and reactance behavior were well consistent with Jonscher’s power law and equivalent circuit model. More importantly, the GR/PVDF composites consisted of negative- k layer that led to high- k and low tan δ performances. When the GR content of the negative- k layer was 10 wt\% and positive- k layer was 2 wt\%, the permittivity reached up to 559 and tan δ was just 0.053 at 100 kHz in bilayer structured composite, respectively. Theoretically, the high- k performance originated from strong interfacial polarization between positive- k and negative- k layers, which is beneficial to the synergistic effect of capacitive and inductive characters. Additionally, the low tan δ was attributed to the effectiveness restriction of electron transfer in capacitive layer. Therefore, the multilayer structured GR/PVDF composites by introducing negative- k layer can achieve high- k and low loss that supply a novel strategy for preparing dielectric materials.},

The substantial growth in this technology is partly driven by its opportunity for commercial and performance benefits in the aerospace industry. The fundamental opportunities for metal additive manufacturing in aerospace applications include: significant cost and lead-time reductions, novel materials and unique design solutions, mass reduction of components through highly efficient and lightweight designs, and consolidation of multiple components for performance enhancement or risk management, e.g. through internal cooling features in thermally loaded components or by eliminating traditional joining processes. These opportunities are being commercially applied in a range of high-profile aerospace applications including liquid-fuel rocket engines, propellant tanks, satellite components, heat exchangers, turbomachinery, valves, and sustainment of legacy systems. This paper provides a comprehensive review of metal additive manufacturing in the aerospace industry (from industrial/popular as well as technical literature).

However, it still remains a great challenge. Herein, a novel ZnIn 2 S 4 /HNb 3 O 8 heterojunction with a strong Nb-S bond connected 2D/2D in-plane interface is successfully fabricated via a two-step synthesis method. Due to the similarity of the chemical property, S precursors for ZnIn 2 S 4 are preferred trapped by the O defects on HNb 3 O 8 , which induce the formation of Nb-S bond in the 2D/2D interface under the hydrothermal process. The unique 2D/2D structure endows the heterojunction with large interfacial area and the Nb-S bond as high-speed channels facilitate the interfacial electrons transfer. Furthermore, Kelvin probe test demonstrates an interfacial electric field oriented from HNb 3 O 8 to ZnIn 2 S 4 is formed as driving force for the interface charge transfer. As a result, the photoexcited electrons may directionally migrate across the interface, thereby promoting the photocatalytic activity. The optimal H 2 evolution amount reaches 95.2 mmol g −1 , corresponding to 10.8 times of ZnIn 2 S 4 . The in-situ construction of chemical bonded heterojunction will provide a reference for designing high-efficiency heterojunction photocatalyst.},

In this work, the catalysis performance of point defects in VS 2 monolayer was evaluated using the density functional theory. The S vacancy in 1H-VS 2 has good activity for electrocatalysis of synthesizing ammonia. For gas phase N 2 , the potential-determining step (PDS) is found to be 0.538 eV at S vacancy. The V adatom defect is more attractive to N 2 molecule with a slightly higher PDS. A water solution environment has minor effect on the PDS for S vacancy. But the N 2 adsorption energy on the V adatom is reduced. Low formation energies and high catalysis activity make the defective VS 2 a very promising catalyst in ammonia production.},

As a class of spintronics, Rashba spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect attracts increasing attention because of its electric tunability. SFETs based on Rashba SOC and two-dimensional materials will make a qualitative leap in future semiconductor devices.

SnS and SnSe ML have a more stable electron spin and stronger Rashba spin splitting than InGaAs/InAlAs heterojunction and Au(1 1 1) surface. For SnS ML, 6\% tensile strain along ZZ direction not only stabilizes the electron spin but also strengthens Rashba spin splitting to a maximum of 0.76 eV Å.

  abstract     = {Rare earth permanent magnets are essential in a plethora of electrical machine and renewable energy. Nd-Fe-B magnets account for half of the market share of permanent magnets due to their excellent room temperature magnetic properties. However, the next generation applications require high coercivity at elevated temperatures. For this purpose, heavy rare earths (HRE) have been used to enhance the anisotropy field of the magnets but it not only increases the cost but also reduces the remanence. Grain boundary diffusion process (GBDP), as an emerging technology appeared in this century, offers the best route to improve the coercivity of Nd-Fe-B magnets with low HRE consumption, and has been well studied and rapidly industrialized. In this review, based on the world-wide progress and the results from the authors’ groups, a comprehensive critical description is given on the fundamentals and development of GBDP. The GBDPs based on various diffusion sources and processes, and those for different types of magnets are compared and summarized. The coercivity enhancement mechanisms are discussed in detail to understand the structure-properties relationships. The cost reduction and high-efficient use of critical elements are analyzed. The challenges and opportunities are also highlighted for future development of GBDP and cost-effective permanent magnets.},

The fully thermoplastic and hybrid composite shells have shown up to 65\% of absorbed energy while the polycarbonate shells have absorbed a maximum of 13\% of the absorbed energy. The usage of composite shells has lead to minimal energy transfer to the foam which is directly attached to the human head and provided improved safety. The high-speed camera has shown clear deformation of the thermoplastic composite shell owing to the ductile behaviour while the catastrophic failure with significant cracks was observed in the Epoxy-based composite shell. Considering the head injury criteria, the PC/EPS helmet showed the highest fatality rate (6\%) when impacted on the flat anvil.

The strain distribution in the NML stacks was varied by combining Cu/W bilayers with different Cu and W thicknesses of either 3 or 10 nm. A recently developed method based on in-plane grazing X-ray diffraction was adopted to extract the strain depth profiles. In addition, the evolution of the average stress in the Cu/W NMLs during growth was monitored by an in-situ wafer curvature technique. The mean residual stresses in Cu and W were found to be independent of the disposition of the different Cu/W bilayer substacks. On the contrary, the strain depth profile of the W nanolayers was found to strongly depend on the disposition of Cu/W bilayer substacks in the Cu/W NML, which resulted in different Cu outflow characteristics upon annealing. Moreover, application of different Cu/W bilayer units within the NML stack also provides an innovative pathway for producing Cu/W nanocomposites with graded thermal and mechanical properties.},

While typically the composition of the colloidal suspension is held constant during deposition, leading to deposits of uniform composition or distinct layers, several researchers have reported forming functionally graded materials via electrophoretic deposition by changing the composition during the deposition. This article explores electrophoretic deposition in a flow cell that allows arbitrary gradients in the deposited material to be formed by actively mixing two colloidal suspensions during deposition. Under certain combinations of flow rate and applied electric field, the morphology of the deposit strongly deviates from the desired uniform thickness to a distinct wedge shape. To understand this phenomenon and leverage it for improved designs, a multiphysics model is developed that describes the spatial-temporal colloidal transport of particles in the suspension and reveals that suspension flow rate is the key factor influencing deposit morphologies observed in the experiment. Crucially, a distinct transition is found in deposit morphology from wedge shaped to flat at a dimensionless electric Froude number of approximately 10.},

Microstructure characterization and electrochemical tests in NaCl aqueous solution (3.5 wt\%), including open circuit potential (OCP), potentiodynamic polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), were conducted to study the influence of scanning strategies on the corrosion behaviour. The microstructure and corrosion on different planes were characterized to reveal the influence of building direction. EBSD analysis shows that the scanning strategy affects the continuity of grain growth through adjacent layers and the growth of grains inside the melt track. Electrochemical tests indicate a clear difference in corrosion resistance perpendicular and parallel to building direction and with different scanning strategies. Pitting corrosion is the main form of corrosion in SLM 316L stainless steel and preferentially initiates on molten pool boundaries.},

The proposed 7 mm × 7 mm MeNTAs were fabricated via sputtering over a contact-hole array template created in photoresist. Extensive analysis revealed many properties typical of nanostructures, including enhanced surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and high hydrophobicity. The proposed nanotubes can be fabricated over a wide range of heights and diameters (from a few hundred nm to 10 µm) in a variety of shapes, including tall cylinders and dishes. MeNTAs could potentially be used as a platform for the development of nanohybrids in conjunction with nanomaterials such as ZnO nanowires.},

  abstract     = {The application of magnesium (Mg) inevitably involves dissimilar welding with steel. A novel solid state spot welding method, refill friction stir spot welding (refill FSSW), was utilized to weld AZ31 Mg alloy to galvanized DP600 steel. Although Mg/Fe is an immiscible alloy system, defect-free welds with high strength were successfully obtained in a wide parameter window. The results of microstructure, interfacial reactions, and mechanical properties are reported to reveal the underlying joining mechanism. Due to the melting of Zn coating and subsequent Mg-Zn reactions, Mg-Zn eutectic and intermetallic compounds were detected within welds. Heterogeneous interfacial reactions occur along Mg/steel interface, and the relationship between interfacial structure and fracture behavior was investigated. The joining mechanism is associated with Zn coating and Fe-Al layer: 1) the presence of Zn coating is beneficial for achieving high-quality welding between Mg and steel, it protects the interface from oxidation and contributes to brazing of the weld; 2) the Al present in Mg alloy reacts with Fe, resulting in the growth of Fe-Al layer, which contributes to the diffusion bonding in the interface. The overall results clearly show that refill FSSW is a competitive welding method for joining Mg and galvanized steel.},

  abstract     = {Laser direct joining of a carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP) and an alloy is prone to thermal defects, thereby reducing the joint performance. This can be avoided by reasonably controlling the joining temperature. To this end, a process optimization method characterized by taking full control of the melting depth and local peak temperature is proposed for representative CFRTP/Al and CFRTP/polymer/Al stacks. For the first time, a temperature simulation model considering the heat transfer during the laser direct joining of heterogeneous CFRTP/alloy stacks is established; the average calculation error of the model is &lt;10\%. Based on the simulation results, regression models of the melting depth and local peak temperature are established. Subsequently, constraints are determined by defect distribution observation and joint fracture surface analysis; thus, the optimized ranges of the process parameters are obtained. Finally, through laser direct joining experiments, the improvement in the joint performance is demonstrated and analyzed. The results suggest an enhancement in the strength of the aforementioned stacks under the optimized process, thus proving the rationality of the proposed method by controlling the melting depth and local peak temperature, particularly for CFRTP/polymer/Al stacks with strength close to 30 MPa.},

However, such large experimental dataset is not readily available. Moreover, the success of the ML approach depends on its ability to abide by the fundamental laws of physics. To address these challenges this paper synergistically integrates a validated finite element analysis (FEA)-based multiscale simulation framework with ML to predict the strain-sensing ability of self-sensing cementitious composites enabled by incorporating nano-engineered interfaces. The multiscale simulation framework is leveraged to develop a balanced, representative, complete, and consistent dataset containing 3000 combinations of strain-dependent electromechanical responses. This large dataset is used to predict the strain-sensing ability of the nanoengineered cementitious composites using a feed-forward multilayer perceptron-based neural network (NN) approach which shows excellent prediction efficacy. This paper also applies a Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) algorithm to interpret the NN predictions in light of the relative importance of different design parameters on the strain-sensing ability of the composite. Overall, the synergistic and comprehensive approach presented here can be used as a starting point toward the development of reliable performance standards to accelerate the acceptance of these self-sensing cementitious composites for large-scale applications.},

The experimental and simulation results demonstrated that the deposit morphology on the adjacent structure, and the enhanced growth rate of the processing structure, could be precisely predicted, with a good estimation of secondary particles contribution. Furthermore, the deposition efficiency on the adjacent structure was improved, and the higher metal content in the deposits was validated by Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS).

The potential of combining Nd-Fe-B as a permanent magnet and the manufacturing capabilities of L-PBF promises new prospects for functional AM in applications such as electric machines. In this study, high density L-PBF Nd-Fe-B samples (91\%) with remanence of 0.65 T and maximum energy product of 62 kJ/m 3 were successfully produced, comparable to the state-of-the-art in this field. A parametric study correlating the integrity of the parts to the process parameters, such as, the scan speed and hatch distance is presented. From a metallurgy perspective, the microstructure of the additively manufactured samples was different from the conventionally-sintered material. Interestingly, similarities to the microstructures of laser spot welded material were observed. The fabricated magnets mainly consisted of Nd 2 Fe 14 B with small fractions of precipitated phases and suffered from the presence of cracks at input energies sufficient for powder fusion. The relative density and integrity was constrained by the intrinsic brittle nature of the intermetallic Nd 2 Fe 14 B phase, the high energy input required to melt some phases, as well as the rapid heating and cooling rates experienced during processing.},

First, the independent continuous mapping (ICM) topology optimisation method was applied to create metamaterial microstructures with negative thermal expansion properties based on the multi-scale asymptotic homogenisation theory. Secondly, the conceptual structure from the topology optimisation was reconstructed and parameterized to achieve the desired phononic bandgap widths under negative thermal expansion, using a surrogate model-based optimisation method. Both the negative coefficient of thermal expansion and phononic bandgaps were verified through numerical simulations. The results reveal that, by selecting appropriate parameters, the designed metamaterials can have both a negative coefficient of thermal expansion and a maximum bandgap width ratio.

Recent advances in additive manufacturing permit bulk-nanostructured materials to be produced through rapid solidification, but like other metastable materials the as-built structures typically coarsen rapidly with even modest thermal exposure. Here, selective laser melting is employed to produce an Al-Ce-based alloy with high mechanical strength arising from the as-built microstructure, which can be controlled by build conditions. In addition, the alloy exhibits extreme resistance to thermal coarsening up to 400 °C and superior strength retention compared to conventional Al alloys after extended thermal exposure. The near-zero solubility of Ce in Al and potent solid solution strengthening of Mg enable this behavior without requiring heat treatment. This result demonstrates that combining insoluble alloying elements with additive manufacturing is a viable method of producing exceptionally stable bulk nanoscale alloys.},

This technique is expected to be a more flexible alternative to Laser Metal Wire Deposition. Laser Droplet Generation experiments were carried out in an attempt to accurately detach steel drops towards a desired position. High-speed imaging was used to observe drop generation and measure the direction of detachment of the drops. Two drop detachment techniques were investigated and the physical phenomena leading to the drop detachment are explained, wherein the drop weight, the surface tension and the recoil pressure play a major role. Optimised parameters for accurate single drop detachment were identified and then used to build multi-drop tracks. Tracks with an even geometry were produced, where the microstructure was influenced by the numerous drop depositions. The tracks showed a considerably higher hardness than the base wire, exhibiting a relatively homogeneous macro-hardness with a localised softening effect at the interfaces between drops.},

Therefore, defects-embedded FE models are essential for accurate mechanical prediction. However, previous studies often focused on the investigation of complete lattice structure models. As a result, the comprehensive investigation of defects in a single strut remained elusive. The present study investigated five different defects on a single strut, namely undersizing/oversizing, diameter variation, offset of the cross section, internal voids, and local mechanical properties. It was found that the undersizing and oversizing were the primary factor affecting the discrepancy between experiments and numerical predictions for most cases. The diameter variation and offset of the cross section were seen to be dominant for small struts, especially those with 45° build orientation. Furthermore, even though the onset of localization could be observed due to the presence of voids, they had a negligible impact on elastic and initial yielding responses, partly because of their low volume fraction. Besides, the effect from geometrical inaccuracies and varied properties were mostly comparable although that of the former was more dominant in smaller samples.

  abstract     = {Pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) is a common gynecological problem that affects millions of women. Current treatment strategies are to restore the normal anatomical structure by non-operative procedures (such as pelvic floor myoelectric stimulation) or surgery (such as vaginal mesh implantation). Although vaginal meshes can provide effective, long-term and minimally invasive treatment for patients, certain life-altering complications may occur. Physical characteristics (such as porosity, mesh weight and mechanical properties), manufacturing process and material type are parameters that can greatly influence cell attachment, tissue proliferation and regeneration. The best clinical effectiveness of surgical meshes could be obtained by optimizing these parameters. Material type has a particularly important influence on the mechanical strength, biodegradation rate and biocompatibility of the implants. Therefore, material type selection is crucial for the development of an ideal pelvic floor repair mesh for use in pelvic floor reconstruction. The materials that are suitable for use in vaginal meshes have been broadly classified into three groups, which are synthetic polymers , natural polymers and polymer blends. This review mainly focuses on the application and biological characteristics of synthetic polymers, natural polymers and polymer blends in pelvic floor tissue engineering.},

  abstract     = {Fatigue cracking of viscoelastic asphalt composite materials is one of the major distresses in asphalt pavements. To quantify the weakening effect of the fatigue cracks on the mechanical properties of the viscoelastic asphalt composite materials, this study takes an asphalt-filler composite system as an example, and micromechanics models are proposed by combining Eshbely’s equivalent inclusion theory and Mori-Tanaka approach. Dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) tests are performed on the viscoelastic asphalt-filler composite systems with two volumetric contents of inclusion (10\% and 27\%) at different frequencies (0.1–100 Hz), temperatures (15℃, 20℃, 25℃) and strain levels (0.01\%-0.1\% for nondestructive DSR tests; 5\%, 6\%, 7\% for destructive DSR tests). Results show that the predicted shear modulus results by a modified viscoelastic strengthening coefficient (VSC) model match with the test results at both low and high filler contents. Then a viscoelastic strengthening coefficient with fatigue cracks (VSC-f) model is proved being capable of accurately predicting the shear modulus for the viscoelastic asphalt-filler composite systems at different strain levels, temperatures, filler contents and damage levels. Both the VSC and the VSC-f model are derived to be dependent of loading frequency, temperature and filler content, but independent of strain level.},

The obtained results show that spider web geometry displays a rich vibration spectrum, which by varying its the geometric characteristics and adding localized masses can be tailored to manipulate wave modes, and the resulting two-dimensional phononic crystals present wide complete band gaps generated by Bragg scattering and local resonances.},

A 2D axisymmetric model coupling heat transfer, fluid flow with phase change was established to simulate the fluid flow variation of alloy droplets during microgravity solidification. The Stokes motion was suppressed and the Marangoni motion was prominent in driving the vortex-shaped flow. The melt flow affected the phase selection, consequently the Ag 2 Al phase nucleated primarily instead of (Al) phase under near-equilibrium solidification, and the flow pattern was preserved during the rapid growth of the metastable Ag 2 Al dendrites. The Marangoni effect was weakened with the decrease of droplet size, and anomalous (Al) + Ag 2 Al and intergranular (Al) + (Ge) eutectics formed owing to the enhanced nucleation and growth competition among phases. In comparison, Al 70 Ag 20 Ge 10 alloy was solidified under gravity condition by DSC and vacuum arc melting methods respectively. No vortex-shaped microstructure formed in DSC sample ascribed to the suppressed natural convection at small cooling rate. During arc melting, the electromagnetic force and enhanced natural convection caused strong turbulent flow, the metastable Ag 2 Al dendrites rapidly formed with increased vortex density.},

The size of shrinkage void increases with increasing reduction amount, which is twice without implementation of SR technology as compared with the high reduction amount of 6 mm.

  abstract     = {A cardiovascular stent design optimization method is proposed with application to a pediatric balloon-expandable prosthetic heart valve. The prosthetic valved conduit may be expanded to a larger permanent diameter in vivo via subsequent transcatheter balloon dilation procedures. While multiple expandable prosthetic heart valves are currently at different stages of development, this work is focused on one particular design in which a stent is situated inside of an expandable polymeric valved conduit. Since the valve and conduit must be joined with a robust manufacturing technique, a polymeric glue layer is inserted between the two, which results in radial retraction of the valved region after expansion. Design of an appropriate stent is proposed to counteract this phenomenon and maintain the desired permanent diameter throughout the device after a single non-compliant balloon dilation procedure. The finite element method is used to compute performance metrics related to the permanent expansion diameter and required radial force. Additionally, failure due not only to high cycle fatigue but also due to ductile fracture is incorporated into the design study through the use of an existing ductile fracture criterion for metals. Surrogate models are constructed with the results of the high fidelity simulations and are subsequently used to numerically obtain a set of Pareto-optimal stent designs. Finally, a single design is identified by optimizing a normalized aggregate objective function with equal weighting of all design objectives.},

Laser-based powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M) becomes a key technology to overcome current restrictions of size and geometry in the manufacturing of BMGs. For industrial application, further knowledge about defect formation, such as porosity and crystallization, is mandatory to develop processing strategies and suitable quality assurance. In this context, the influence of the particle size distribution, oxygen contamination, and applied process parameters during the PBF-LB/M of the glass-forming alloy AMZ4 (in at.\% Zr 59.3 Cu 28.8 Al 10.4 Nb 1.5 ) on the structural and mechanical properties were evaluated. It was found that the addition of SiO 2 flow aid to the feedstock is suitable to increase flowability without impeding fabrication of the amorphous material. Furthermore, the processing of partially crystalline powder particles into amorphous samples is demonstrated. It indicates that today’s high effort producing amorphous powders and thus the production costs can be reduced. Flexural bending tests and high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveal that the powder feedstock’s oxygen content is crucial for the amorphization, embrittlement, and flexural strength of PBF-LB/M processed Zr-based BMGs.},

By combining experimental data with theoretical models, the mechanisms for enhancing the thermoelectric properties were proposed. The outcomes of this review paper suggest that doped bismuth telluride composites (doped with selenium for n-type or antinomy for p-type) offer better thermoelectric properties compared to undoped composites. Moreover, improvements in undoped bismuth telluride composites are exclusive for the n-type only. The figure-of-merit value for bismuth telluride composites is less than two, where the 2D nanofillers show optimum ZT improvements. Nevertheless, the inconsistency of reported data in the thermoelectric area is a problem that must be addressed to have more control over the precision of the reported results for a better understanding of the concepts in this field.},

Therefore, it is crucial to design biodegradable composites considering the degradation effect. Accordingly, to realize a composite material with controlled stiffness at the bone repair stage, this study introduces a novel topological optimization technique for the material layout design in microstructure, considering material degradation. In this approach, two sets of variables are adopted: a density field that defines the material layout, which is also the design variable, and a time field that determines the effect of material degradation on composite material properties. A continuous degradation update formula is proposed by integrating the Heaviside function and the Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser function to guarantee its derivability. The objective of this study was to maximize the material stiffness in some fixed time steps under a specified volume fraction. The sensitivity of the aforementioned objective relative to the design variable was deduced by considering the material degradation over time. The proposed design approach was demonstrated with several design examples, considering different degradable interface boundary conditions. Furthermore, the obtained results were compared with the results obtained without considering material degradation, thereby verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The slurry coating step has significant implications for electrode design and advanced metrology offers opportunities to improve understanding and control at this stage. Here, metrology options for slurry coating are reviewed as well as opportunities for in-line integration, discussing the benefits of combining advanced metrology to provide comprehensive characterisation, improve understanding and feed into predictive design models. There is a comprehensive range of metrology which needs little improvement to provide the relevant quantifiable measures during coating, with one exception of particle sizing, where more precise, in-line measurement would be beneficial. However, there is a lack of studies that bring together the latest advancements in electrode coating metrology which is crucial to understanding the interdependency of myriad processing and product parameters.

  abstract     = {Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have attracted wide interest, but their successful application is hindered by their low ductility at room temperature. Therefore, the use of composites of a BMG matrix with crystalline secondary phases has been proposed to overcome this drawback. In the present work we demonstrate the fabrication of a tailored BMG nanocomposite containing a high density of monodisperse nanocrystals with a size of around 20 nm using a combination of mechanical and thermal treatment of Cu 36 Zr 48 Al 8 Ag 8 well below the crystallization temperature. Direct observations of the interaction of the nanocrystals with a shear band during in situ deformation in a transmission electron microscope demonstrate that the achieved nanocomposite has the potential to inhibit catastrophic fracture in tension. This demonstrates that a sufficient number of nanoscale structural heterogeneities can be a route towards BMG composites with superior mechanical properties.},

Here we demonstrate the design and use of combinatorial samples produced on a commercial laser powder bed fusion system to study 60 distinct process conditions of nickel superalloy 625: five laser powers and four laser scan speeds in three different conditions. Combinatorial samples were characterized using optical and electron microscopy , x-ray diffraction, and indentation to estimate the porosity, grain size, crystallographic texture , secondary phase precipitation , and hardness. Indentation and porosity results were compared against a regular sample. The smaller-sized regions (3 mm × 4 mm) in the combinatorial sample have a lower hardness compared to a larger regular sample (20 mm × 20 mm) with similar porosity (&lt;0.03\%). Despite this difference, meaningful trends were identified with the combinatorial sample for grain size, crystallographic texture, and porosity versus laser power and scan speed as well as trends with hardness versus stress-relief condition.},

  abstract     = {Bioinert polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement is the most conventional approach for quick fixation of the orthopedic implant during hip replacement surgery. However, problems with implant loosening occur frequently and particularly under osteoporosis due to inadequate osteointegration between the cement and host bone. In order to enhance osteointegration ability of the PMMA cement, mineralized collagen (MC) was incorporated into the PMMA (PMMA-MC) in the current study. An improved wettability and dynamic mechanical performance of the PMMA-MC was demonstrated in vitro, compared to pure PMMA. Then, the effect of PMMA and PMMA-MC on osteoporotic bone marrow stromal cells were investigated. The results revealed that the addition of MC could significantly up-regulate osteoblastic gene expressions (Runx2, Osx, and Alp) and down-regulate the expressions of adipogenic markers (C/EBPα, PPARγ-2, and adiponectin). The osteointegration ability of bone cement was evaluated in an osteoporotic rat model with bone defect. After 8 and 12 weeks of implantation, PMMA-MC group had significantly more new bone formation around the implant and a higher push-out force at the bone-cement surface than that of the PMMA group. Moreover, to simulate clinical hip replacement, prosthesis was fixed with either PMMA or PMMA-MC bone cement in osteoporotic cadaveric femurs. Compared to the PMMA group, more torque was required in the PMMA-MC group to achieve the same rotation degree in torsion test. These findings revealed the potential of MC to induce an efficient fixation between the modified cement surface and osteoporotic host bone. PMMA-MC can be a promising candidate biomaterial for clinical hip replacement.},

In this study, resveratrol (RES)- and CellROX-loaded zeolite-based imidazolium salt framework-8 (ZIF-8) nanoparticles (NPs) immobilized with methoxy poly (ethylene glycol) with thioketal grafting (mPEG-TK) were synthesized for OA treatment. Once applied to OA joints, the protective coating of mPEG-TK outside the ZIF-8 NPs was depolymerized in response to the relatively high ROS level. Immediately, ROS turned on the fluorescence of CellROX inside the ZIF-8 NPs to diagnose and monitor the OA process. Meanwhile, RES released from NPs and stimulated the transformation of macrophage polarization from the M1 phenotype (pro-inflammatory) to the M2 phenotype (anti-inflammatory). Our prepared NPs can inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), thus decreasing NO production and increasing H 2 O 2 production. The results indicated that when the modified NPs were used for OA treatment in rats, the improvement of OA could be detected by decreasing fluorescence after 4 weeks of injection. The fluorescence results were consistent with those of the tissue sections. The NPs developed in this study displayed dual functions as fluorescence detection and ROS regulation therapy, which would provide new paths for OA diagnosis and treatment.},

The composite scaffold was composed of a porcine dermal acellular tissue matrix and human bone powder. The bone powder/acellular tissue matrix (Bp/ATM) scaffold was porous with a porosity exceeding 70\%. Bp/ATM provided an osteoinductive scaffold that recruited osteoblasts to the site of injury and promoted their differentiation to bone cells. The 50\% (v/v) bone-scaffold mixture significantly accelerated mineralized matrix production and the expression of osteogenesis-related proteins during osteogenic differentiation in vitro . This mixture also enhanced bone regeneration at the defect site in vivo in a rat cranial defect model. These observations suggest that Bp/ATM forms a highly active osteoinductive and osteoconductive scaffold that is a promising biomaterial for bone regeneration.},

Moreover, the in vitro degradation and drug release results showed that by adjust the PCL fibers amount and size, the degradation of Gel and the release profile of hydrophilic drugs/proteins could be effectively controlled: in the low PCL groups (PCL/Gel-1 &amp; PCL/Gel-4), the Gel nano-fibers dissolved rapidly, resulting in an early explosive release within 1 week; however, with the increase of PCL content, the drug release rate decreased gradually, and the total release period could be extended to over 2 weeks (PCL/Gel-2, PCL/Gel-3 &amp; PCL/Gel-5) or more (PCL/Gel-6).

A small amount of Si atoms was dissolved into the cubic VN lattice, locally reducing the neighboring V-N p-d hybridization near the Si site. The Si content was found to impact the architecture of coating significantly. With increasing Si content, the microstructure evolved through three different architectures: (i) highly textured columnar grains, (ii) refined columnar grains, and (iii) nanocomposite structures where elongated grains were bounded by vein-like boundaries. Enhanced damage tolerance was observed in the nanocomposite structure, where multiple toughening mechanisms become active. Ab initio calculations revealed that the incorporation of Si monolayer in the (1 1 1)-oriented VN resulted in the formation of weaker Si-N bonds compared to V-N bonds, which allowed a selective response to strain and shear deformations by assisting the activation of the slip systems.},

The exact mechanisms of how DBs influence grain nucleation and grain growth remain unclear. In this paper, deformed single and multicrystal pure aluminium samples are annealed to explore the likely effects of DBs on the grain nucleation and the subsequent grain growth. Regarding the prediction of the recrystallized (RXed) texture, it is noticeable that the orientations of nucleated grains nearby DB are originated from the orientation in DB. Regarding the nucleated positions, it is demonstrated that potential nucleation sites are more likely located in DBs in comparison with the initial grain boundary. Regarding the rate of RX, the number of nucleated grains is also predicted to have a strong positive correlation with the area fraction of DBs, which would consequently affect the kinetics of the grain growth in the deformed microstructure. All the above observations imply that the RX process is strongly controlled by the ensemble characteristics of DBs rather than the initial grain boundaries.},

The validity of the current methodology is examined first by predicting the stress field of a single infinitely long screw dislocation using both the analytical solutions based on anisotropic elasticity and the current phase-field framework. The well-known stress singularity associated with the dislocation core in the former method has been effectively avoided in the latter. The framework is then applied to predicting the dislocation network of {0 0 0 1} twisted GB in Mg, which is found to consist of triangular-shaped regions of stacking faults and perfect crystals separated by partial dislocations. This prediction is consistent with some existing atomistic simulations and the underlying formation mechanism is analyzed rigorously using the displacement field predicted by our model, revealing the energy minimization process via the dissociation of a 〈 1 1 2 ¯ 0 〉 / 3 〈112¯0〉/3 screw dislocation into a pair of 〈 1100 〉 / 3 〈1100〉/3 screw dislocations.

The results show that the ABA sandwich-like structure played a dominant role in the interface fusion.

The formation of cavities can be attributed to the SiO 2 layer decomposition and the product, volatile SiO, provides a Si source for the formation of nanoflowers at the early stage. A model is proposed to indicate that SiO gas produced at the Si/SiO 2 interface can diffuse to the surface assisted by the defects in the SiO 2 layer before the decomposed cavities are exposed. Then the exposing of those cavities introduces another volatile SiO from the active oxidation of Si substrate, provoking a change in the direction of the main Si source, which in turn makes the one nanoparticle of the nanoflower split in two and finally form the nanosprout. The model about the escape of SiO further details SiO 2 decomposition process, and the transformation mechanism from nanoflowers to nanosprout sheds light on a feasible nanofabrication method to design tunable size and shape of nanoparticles.},

  abstract     = {Lattices with engineered properties are significant for engineering applications in the energy, aerospace, optics and medical sectors. Current additive manufacturing (AM) combined with computer-aided design (CAD) methods are not flexible enough to create multi-substructure lattices with locally varying geometrical features and mechanical properties. For example, if the struts of one substructure correspond spatially to the void of another substructure in the hybrid region, the resulting structure is disconnected there. When the number of substructures is large, such a problem becomes inevitable and intractable. Here we propose a new AM &amp; CAD method integrating all the processes of designing a complex lattice structure, such as subspace partitioning, substructure rotation, filling in each subspace and connection, and hybrid region stiffness tuning. This method provides a general framework for designing heterogeneous lattice structures with disorder, gradient and hybrid features. Additionally, we numerically and experimentally investigate the effectiveness of our hybrid region stiffness tuning method. Using this new method, the problem of low volume fraction or disconnection in the hybrid region in multi-substructure lattices is overcome, and the resulting structures can be generated for analysis or fabrication by any suitable AM technique.},

Two distinct uni-modal microstructures with fine (20 nm) and coarse (200 nm) γ ′ γ′ particles were investigated. On the macro-scale yield strength increased and ductility decreased with decreasing temperature, although the most significant decrease in ductility occurred between 100 and 20 K. The work hardening differed between the two microstructures, but was independent of temperature for each microstructure. On the micro-scale intergranular elastic interactions mainly lead to a transfer of the load to grains with the 200 200 orientation parallel to the tensile axis. No further load re-distribution between matrix and particles occurred in the microstructure with fine γ ′ γ′ , where shearing of precipitates lead to co-deformation at all temperatures. In the coarse γ ′ γ′ microstructure, the load was transferred intragranularly from matrix to particles, in addition to the intergranular load transfer. The particles initially behaved elastically while the matrix deformed plastically, but at higher stresses a change in load partitioning indicated that also the γ ′ γ′ phase underwent plastic deformation as a result of the stress build-up from the load partitioning. The tendency for, and effect of, plastic deformation of γ ′ γ′ increased with decreasing temperature.},

However, directly adding water-insoluble powders into pre-gel solution makes the mixture susceptible to clogging problems during processing, thus limiting the loading rate. To address this problem, a new way to encapsulate water-insoluble powder ingredients without addition of any organic solvent named bubble-assisted encapsulation method is developed in this study. The powders were firstly encapsulated in hydrogel bubbles and further dispersed by T-shaped microfluidic flow to form the core/shell-structured powder in hydrogel microcapsules (P/H microcapsules). The obtained P/H microcapsules had an exceptionally high loading rate of water-insoluble powders up to 94.76\%. The P/H microcapsules were freeze-dried for long-term storage, and meanwhile, the as-prepared microcapsules were able to swell rapidly to soft state before use. Moreover, with the well-defined core–shell structure, the P/H microcapsules were endowed with dual release capabilities to external stimuli. The bubble-assisted encapsulation method that enables direct dense encapsulation of powder ingredients at a high loading rate appears promising for water-insoluble food or pharmaceutical ingredients delivery.},

In this study, a FeCoNiCr high-entropy alloy was used as the strengthening phase to improve the performance of austenitic stainless steel processed via laser powder bed fusion. The microstructure of the as-printed parts was composed of high-entropy alloy nanoparticles, a solid solution matrix, and high-density dislocations. The strengthening effect caused by the microstructures resulted in a tensile strength of 627 MPa with a maximum elongation of 50\%. The semi-obstructive effect of the interface on the dislocations improved the ductility, as proved through molecular dynamics analysis. The Cr, Ni, and Co elements in the high-entropy alloy melted into the stainless-steel matrix, facilitating the formation of a passive film; this improved the corrosion resistance of the composite. Thus, simultaneous improvements in strength, ductility, and corrosion resistance of the stainless-steel composites were realized. The composites inherited the performance characteristics of high-entropy alloys. This research also provides a new strategy to select the strengthening phase for composite materials. High-performance high-entropy alloy particles with lattice structures and element types similar to the stainless steel matrix have substantial potential to be used as strengthening phases.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal nitrides (TMN) have received widespread consideration as supercapacitor materials for a variety of energy storage applications. An important requirement to such electrode materials is a very high specific surface area, which is typically obtained through a percolating pore-network. Here, we use arc ion plating to prepare CrN-Ni composite coatings with 0, 30.4, 54.2, and 77.6 at.\% Ni. Detailed X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the coatings consist of CrN phases next to metallic Ni. Post-deposition treatments with HCl solutions lead to selective leaching, causing a porous nanostructure for the Ni-containing CrN coatings. From there, the coating with 54.2 at.\% Ni in its as-deposited state provided the highest (electrode-geometric-area)-specific capacitance after the HCl treatment, giving 58.5 mF·cm −2 at 1.0 mA·cm −2 in a 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 aqueous electrolyte. This value is about 80 times higher than for the as-deposited coatings or the Ni-free CrN. Consequently, our strategy to combine TMNs with metallic Ni and its subsequent treatment with HCl is highly effective in enlarging the specific surface area and adsorption sites. It allows to significantly enhance the energy storage performance of TMN thin film supercapacitors.},

The in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies revealed the high-temperature resistance to PdNPs aggregations with aids of carbon-coated low-dimensional nanostructures C&amp;ZnO-NWs and elucidated ripening dynamics of PdNPs and the surface reconstruction of C&amp;ZnO-NWs. The operando analysis of PdNPs/C&amp;ZnO-NWs was executed in real-time under working-temperature situations. The aggregations of PdNPs were not observed until reaching a high working temperature of 300 °C and carbon-coated layers could functionally prevent PdNPs from sintering even when ZnO-NWs experienced melting at 500 °C. The time-lapsed TEM investigation proved that the ripening dynamics and time-dependent revolution of PdNPs size are in accordance with the Ostwald ripening process. The subsequent atomic-scale observation revealed the surface reconstruction of ZnO-NWs in the form of ZnO encapsulation over PdNPs and carbon-coated layers during the thermal process, which showed the microscopic evidence of potential deactivation of ZnO-NW-based nanocatalysts in thermal reactions.},

However, the ability to synergistically affect the resulting 3D-printed structures has been limited by difficulty controlling the nanomaterial ratio in which biological stability is achieved, as well as by the use of noxious solvents applied to the nanomaterials during scaffold fabrication. To address these issues, we demonstrate the use of an ecofriendly mussel-inspired GO coating for 3D-printed scaffolds to enhance the scaffold’s functionality and bioactivity. We used polydopamine for deposition using 1, 3, and 6 mg/mL GO in solution on the surface of the scaffold. By this coating method, we efficiently regulated the degree of GO deposition on the surface of scaffold strands under non-toxic conditions, which revealed by microscope. Furthermore, the surface roughness, hydrophilicity, and functional groups were increased after GO coating process. Especially, we identified that the GO coated scaffold was shown improved properties for promoting osteogenesis compared to a bare scaffold by in vitro analyses. Therefore, we suggest that the GO coated scaffold has the potential as a bone substitute for tissue engineering.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing of hard-to-weld nickel-based superalloys leads to the formation of elongated columnar grain structures and hot cracks along the build direction. Changing the scanning strategy during selective laser melting (SLM) without changing alloy composition is a promising method for the inhibition of hot cracking by grain refinement. In this work, the effect of grain structure on the cracking inhibition behaviour of hard-to-weld Inconel 738 alloy fabricated by SLM with different scanning strategies (rotation of 0°, 90° and 67° between layers, respectively) was investigated. Nearly crack-free, local equiaxed microstructures and an excellent combination of strength and ductility were obtained by rotation of 67° for the SLM-built Inconel 738 alloy due to bimodal grain structure with local equiaxed grains and columnar grains. The local equiaxed grains are attributed to dynamic recrystallization and give rise to thermal stress relaxation. Meanwhile, the aspect ratio of columnar grains is related to thermal gradient variation. In addition, the inhibition of initiation and propagation of cracks is attributed to grain refinement and reduced residual stress. This work demonstrates the feasibility of grain refinement by changing the scanning strategy and improved suppression of cracks in a hard-to-weld superalloy without changing the alloy composition.},

  abstract     = {With the development of electronic technologies, electronic devices become smaller, while their power density increases dramatically. The resulting excessive heat requires excellent heat dissipation to ensure great performance of the devices. A good thermal interface material (TIM), with excellent bulk thermal conductivity and proper elastic modulus, which can fill the gap between contact surfaces, is of great importance to improve overall performance of thermal management in the electronic devices. Carbon-based materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene (Gr), have attracted great attentions, due to their intrinsic high thermal conductivity. In this paper, carbon-based TIMs are reviewed, as well as the thermal conducting mechanisms and techniques to measure thermal properties for materials. The unique three-dimensional network of 3D-Gr provides not only high thermal conductivity, but also excellent mechanical properties, which makes it more competitive as TIM than CNTs and Gr. Furthermore, there is currently no universal characterization techniques, which are suitable to measure thermal properties of all TIMs. Hence, special attention must be paid to select a proper technique based on the measuring principle, in order to obtain accurate results. An outlook of the future challenges of the thermal interface materials is proposed at the end of the paper.},

  abstract     = {Bottom-up design of high-entropy ceramics is a promising approach for realizing materials with unique combination of high hardness and fracture-resistance at elevated temperature. This work offers a simple yet fundamental design criterion – valence electron concentration (VEC) ⪆9.5 e - /formula unit to populate bonding metallic states at the Fermi level – for selecting elemental compositions that may form rocksalt-structure (B1) high-entropy ceramics with enhanced plasticity (reduced brittleness). Single-phase B1 (HfTaTiWZr)C and (MoNbTaVW)C, chosen as representative systems due to their specific VEC values, are here synthesized and tested. Nanoindentation arrays at various loads and depths statistically show that (HfTaTiWZr)C (VEC = 8.6 e - /f.u.) is hard but brittle, whilst (MoNbTaVW)C (VEC = 9.4 e - /f.u.) is hard and considerably more resistant to fracture than (HfTaTiWZr)C. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and electronic-structure analysis reveal that the improved fracture-resistance of (MoNbTaVW)C subject to deformation may originate from the intrinsic material’s ability to undergo local lattice transformations beyond tensile yield points, as well as from relatively facile activation of lattice slip. Additional simulations, carried out to follow the evolution in mechanical properties as a function of temperature, suggest that (MoNbTaVW)C may retain good resistance to fracture up to ≈900-1200 K, whereas (HfTaTiWZr)C is predicted to remain brittle at all investigated temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Lattices with hierarchical architectures exhibit unique geometric and mechanical properties compared with single scale ones. While numerous research efforts have focused on hierarchical strut lattices, hierarchical sheet lattices have yet to be studied in detail. This paper proposes a systemic framework including geometric design, finite element modelling, additive manufacturing, and mechanical testing for hierarchical sheet triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) lattices such that the lattice walls comprise successively smaller scale TPMS architectures. Geometric properties including relative densities and volume-specific surface areas of hierarchical lattices are analytically calculated and verified via numerical calculations. The compressive properties of 2-order sheet Gyroid lattices are investigated with finite element simulations and experimentally validated using micro-selective laser melting fabricated stainless-steel specimens. Geometric analysis shows that hierarchical sheet lattices have great potential to achieve a wide range of controllable geometric properties including hierarchical porosities, ultralow densities, and significantly enlarged surface areas. Simulation results indicate that 2-order lattices have superior buckling strength over single scale lattices at ultralow densities. At moderate densities, 2-order lattices exhibit reduced modulus and strength, but more stable failure behaviour. With these unique combinations of geometric and mechanical properties, hierarchical sheet TPMS designs are shown to be desirable structural configurations for biomedical scaffolds.},

Nevertheless, using the trial and error method to design high-performance copper alloys requires a lot of effort and time. Thus, the material design method based on machine learning is used to accelerate the exploitation of alloys. In this study, a composition-process-property database of Cu-Ni-Co-Si alloys was established, and a new strategy that could simultaneously realize the prediction of properties and the optimization of compositions and process parameters was proposed. Four groups were chosen from 38,880 candidates by the multi-performance screening method; good agreements existed between the prediction and the test. The Cu-2.3Ni-0.7Co-0.7Si alloy had the best performance among the designed alloys, and this alloy was studied in depth. The influence of the dissolution of Co in Ni 2 Si was analyzed from a novel perspective. Interestingly, the trace amount of Co replacing Ni to form (Ni, Co) 2 Si increased the phase dissolution temperature dramatically and shortened the coarsening rate. Affected by Co, the over-aging process was slowed down, which broadened the use range of alloys greatly. Therefore, the developed Cu-2.3Ni-0.7Co-0.7Si alloy can prove to be promising materials that meet different working conditions, and its performance was better than C70350 alloy.},

Transient temperatures during welding were recorded using thermocouple arrays. Residual stresses in the as-welded condition and after post-weld heat treatment were measured using diverse methods: neutron diffraction and the contour method at 30 mm thickness; and deep hole drilling and the contour method at 130 mm. Incremental centre hole drilling measurements were performed at 130 mm thickness to better understand near-surface stresses. Weld and heat-affected zone microstructures and microconstituents were evaluated using a combination of hardness mapping, optical microscopy and electron microscopy. The as-welded residual stresses exhibit the characteristic M-shaped distribution for hardenable steels, reaching 500–600 MPa in tension in both steels at both thicknesses. However, the modest changes to the chemical composition and the change in plate thickness both significantly influenced microstructures, mechanical properties and residual stress distributions. These sensitivities underline the need for physically faithful models. This extensive characterisation study enables the development and validation of models that predict the development of microstructures and residual stresses in EB welds in low alloy pressure vessel steels.},

  abstract     = {The drying shrinkage of different sedimentary rocks used as aggregates for concrete, mainly sandstone, is evaluated on the basis of petrological characterization and water vapor sorption. The drying shrinkage of aggregates is dependent on their alteration and metamorphic types, and is especially influenced by the types and contents of their constituent minerals and pore spaces between the crystals. There was a positive correlation between drying shrinkage of aggregates and water vapor desorption. When the volume of pores 4–20 nm in diameter was reduced, drying shrinkage and water vapor sorption were drastically reduced. In the case of sandstone aggregates, drying shrinkage of the aggregate is large in the early stage of alteration while it decreases with the progress of alteration and metamorphism processes. The presence of secondary type-A muscovite indicates a transitional stage between these processes, which is an important petrological feature in evaluating aggregate shrinkage. These results clearly show that differences in geothermal gradient and compression intensity from the time of deposition to the present manifested as the alteration and metamorphic types, with divergent pore distributions. The drying shrinkage and the water vapor sorption of aggregates reflect these petrological characteristics and resultant pore distributions.},

We evaluate the effect of electron delocalization correction on the predictive power of density functional theory for Ni-Mn-Ga, the prototype magnetic shape memory compound. Using the corrected Hubbard-model-based generalized gradient approximation (GGA+U), we varied the Coulomb repulsion parameter U from 0 eV to 3 eV to reveal the evolution of predicted material parameters. The increasing localization on Mn sites results in the increasing stabilization of 10M modulated structure in stoichiometric Ni 2 MnGa in agreement with experiment whereas uncorrected GGA and meta-GGA functional provide the lowest energy for 4O modulated structure and non-modulated structure, respectively. GGA+U calculations indicate that 10M structure is more stable than other martensitic structures for U &gt; 1.2 eV. The key features of density of states (DOS) responsible for the stabilization or destabilization of particular martensitic phases calculated with GGA+U are found also in DOS calculated with advanced quasi-particle self-consistent GW (QSGW) method. It supports the physical background of Hubbard correction. Moreover, the calculations with U = 1.8 eV provide the best agreement with experimental data for lattice parameters of stoichiometric and off-stoichiometric alloys.},

Compared with human cortical bone, traditional metals may cause stress shielding. In contrast, the elastic modulus of PEEK is slightly lower than that of human bones. In this study, PEEK and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) were electrospun into fibers and mixed with carbon fiber (CF). The mixture was then hot-pressed to prepare PEEK/PMMA/CF ternary composites. Mechanical tests showed that the Young&#39;s moduli of the PEEK/PMMA/CF ternary composites were between 4.67 ± 0.38 and 6.37 ± 0.81 GPa, similar to human bones. In vitro cytotoxicity tests, after 7 days of cell culture, showed that the relative growth rates were 86–97\%, and the corresponding cytotoxicity levels were 0 or 1. In addition, in vivo experiments demonstrated that the ternary composites exhibited good histocompatibilities and displayed no rejection or inflammatory reactions. No artifacts were observed when the material was examined using X-ray, CT (computerized tomography computed tomography), and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning. Thus, the PEEK/PMMA/CF ternary composites fabricated in this study may be used as promising bone implant materials in orthopedic applications.},

This morphogenesis is considered to be triggered by mechanical instabilities between the epithelial sheet and the mesenchyme foundation, similar to that observed in non-living film-on-substrate structures. Here, we report a film-on-substrate cell culture system (FoSS), in which the cells can induce wrinkling and buckling-delamination of the surface layer from the foundation. Ion beam irradiation on polylactic acid (PLA) produced three layers: a crosslinked/carbonized surface, a decomposed middle layer that undergoes solation under the cell culture condition, and a foundation. This system was realized by controlling the three-dimensional (3D) distributions of scission/crosslinking probabilities in PLA. Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells adhered well to the surface layer of FoSS. Cellular forces caused the layer to become wrinkled and subsequently delaminated as a thin film (~165 nm) from the foundation. The cell population then crumpled the peeled films, and within 48 h formed 3D cell sheets with folds and protrusions depending on patterns pre-set on the FoSS. FoSS can be utilized to produce in vitro models of 3D morphogenesis and 3D cell sheets that are currently in demand for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.},

Thus, hydrides are key materials for the hydrogen economy. Here, the hydrogen storage material Al 3 FeH 3.9 has been synthesized from cost-effective earth-abundant metals, Fe and Al. Hydrides consisting of Al and transition metals with low hydrogen affinities are rare because such alloys are unstable. However, it is expected that appropriate mixing of the chemical states of hydrogen atoms would allow synthesis of Al-Fe hydrides. The experimentally determined crystal structure of Al 3 FeD 3.9 suggests realization of the mixing of the chemical state of hydrogen. Al 3 FeH 3.9 is more thermodynamically stable than AlH 3 , and it is likely that the mixing of the chemical state of hydrogen atoms is the source of increased stability. The results of this study confirm that by controlling the chemical states of hydrogen, it is possible to tune the thermodynamic stability of hydrides and thus realize novel functional hydrides.},

  abstract     = {The in-situ formation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) via dopamine-reduction of Ag + has been widely utilized for titanium implants to introduce antibacterial properties. In previous studies, the preparation of AgNPs has focused on controlling the feeding concentrations, while the pH of the reaction solution was ignored. Herein, we systematically determined the influence of various pH (4, 7, 10) and Ag + concentrations (0.01, 0.1 mg/mL) on the AgNPs formation, followed by the evaluation of the antibacterial properties in vitro and in vivo . The results revealed that an alkaline environment was favourable for AgNP formation and resulted in more particles. Although the AgNPs bearing Ti had lower biocompatibilities, it was significantly improved after 7 days of mineralization in simulated body fluid. The outstanding antibacterial property of the AgNPs was well maintained after one day and seven days of implantation. Moreover, 3D micro-CT modelling showed that the pH 10/0.1 group exhibited remarkable osteogenesis, which may be due to their strong antibacterial properties and ability to promote mineralization. Therefore, we have demonstrated that the solution pH was as important as the feeding Ag + concentration in determining AgNP formation, and it has paved the way for developing various AgNP-loaded surfaces that could meet different antibacterial needs.},

  abstract     = {Ultrafiltration is a pressure-driven membrane process which is widely used for water treatment and separations in biotechnology, chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. The study deals with the development of novel smart membranes for ultrafiltration which reversibly change flux and human serum albumin (HSA) rejection as a response to the change of the pH and temperature of the feed solution. Smart membranes were prepared via immobilization of cross-linked dual-responsive chitosan-graft-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM)-co-methacrylic acid) hydrogels on the surface of the microfiltration membrane via filtration in dead-end mode. It was shown that pure water flux (PWF) increases by 1.8–4.7 times upon the temperature increase from 25 °C to 50 °C due to the conformational changes of poly(NIPAM) chains grafted to chitosan at temperature higher than lower critical solution temperature. It was shown that PWF increases by 8.7 times at T = 25 °C and 16.5 times at T = 50 °C when pH of the feed water decreases from 10 to 3. The developed smart membranes demonstrate extremely high cleaning efficiency and can be simply washed by distilled water at T = 50 °C after ultrafiltration of HSA solution (pH = 3). It was shown that PWF of smart membrane is restored by 1154\% compared to 67\% for reference microfiltration membrane.},

  abstract     = {As a new composite material by adding ceramsite into foam concrete, lightweight aggregate foam concrete (LWAFC), mainly composed of cement, water, performed foam, and ceramsite, exhibits excellent compressive performance. To facilitate its application in structure protection where energy absorption is concerned, the responses of ceramsite foam concrete were investigated experimentally and numerically with meso -scale model. First, a compression test (loading rate of 5 mm/min) on cubic LWAFC specimens with side length of 100 mm was conducted, in which two different failure modes, namely foam concrete failure and through-ceramsite failure, were observed. Meanwhile, it was found that the compressive strength of LWAFC specimens increased with increasing foam concrete density. Based on synchrotron radiation CT on foam concrete, a two-dimensional meso -scale numerical model with size of 100 × 100 mm was established. The failure mode, compressive strength, plateau stress, and energy absorption capacity of the LWAFC with an averaged loading rate of 1 m/s were systematically investigated. In particular, the underlying mechanism for the two distinctive failure modes was revealed as the strength match between the foam concrete and ceramsite. Subsequently, the performance of LWAFC was significantly improved by reasonably designing the foam concrete and ceramsite with optimized strength match.},

Inverse machine learning can be a substantial approach in structural design to explore complex and massive numbers of geometrical patterns within short periods of time. Here, an inverse design framework using generative adversarial networks (GANs) is proposed to explore and optimize structural designs such as lightweight lattice unit cells. Lightweight lattice structures are widely accepted to have excellent mechanical properties and have found applications in various engineering structures. Using the proposed framework, different lattice unit cells that are 40–120\% better in load carrying capacity than octet unit cell are discovered. These new lattice unit cells are analyzed numerically and validated experimentally by testing 3D printed lattice unit cells and lattice cored sandwiches. The proposed inverse design framework can be applied to the design and optimization of other types of load bearing structures.},

In this study, we leverage multiple processing pathways with additive manufacturing to design and fabricate SMA components capable of precise, self-guided shape change that could actuate large-scale (up to 25 × 25 × 33 cm 3 ) structures under external thermal stimuli. The dual benefits of minor alloy doping (&lt;2 at\%) and laser processing parameters (laser hatch spacing) were identified to be the most effective method to engineer SMA joints and hinges with locally tailored transformation temperatures over a 90 °C range. Custom-designed plywood-style NiTi hinges with self-regulating features enabled tight bend radii and compact packing sizes. Implementation of these novel SMAs hinges with large deployment structures, mimicking solar panel arrays, demonstrated a 75–90\% reduction in cross-sectional area compared to the fully deployed structure. The fundamental understanding and demonstration of tailored and controlled complex shape-morphing kinematics, without the use of specialized and heavy external motors, lays the groundwork for future SMA-enabled deployable structures in remote environments.},

Although there exist works on the stress-strain response at high temperature, there is a lack of data in the literature on the yield criteria. The present paper presents an efficient experimental methodology to determine significant stress states at high temperature. Both plane strain data and compressive anisotropy values at high temperature allowed obtaining a more complete definition of the mechanical behavior of the Ti6Al4V, being the novel contribution of this research. Yield loci up to 900 °C were built according to different yield criteria that are fitted to the experimental data. Thus, Barlat1989 and CPB2006 were selected as the most suitable yield criteria to predict Ti6Al4V behavior. These criteria were extended to contemplate the anisotropy evolution under a wide range of working conditions. The formulated extended criteria for the entire range of conditions were close to the equivalent traditional ones applied to only a particular condition, which demonstrates the advanced made in the comprehensive modeling of Ti6Al4V alloy for all conditions applied in forming industries.},

While most conventional materials have positive Poisson’s ratios, auxetic metamaterials exhibit negative Poisson’s ratios and will contract laterally under vertical compression and expand laterally under vertical tension. In this study, we develop a new type of mechanical metamaterial, which always undergoes lateral expansion regardless of the sign of the uniaxial load. The unit cell configuration is presented by combining a re-entrant negative Poisson’s ratio structure and a hexagonal structure. A new stiffness- and deformation mode-switching mechanism is realized by exploiting contact nonlinearity in the unit cell configuration design. This novel metamaterial can exhibit positive, negative and zero Poisson’s ratios under different loading directions. Its mechanical properties are verified through numerical simulations and experimental tests. The unit cell configuration is also extended to 3D metamaterials and metastructures. This study demonstrates that certain desired mechanical properties can be achieved by introducing contact nonlinearity and deformation mode switching into metamaterial design.},

  abstract     = {Lightweight ceramic nanolattices exhibiting high stiffness and good recoverability are obtained by leveraging base material size effects in combination with smart structural design. Here, the double-wall tube (DWT) lattice architecture is introduced to increase the stiffness of brittle nanolattices, while maintaining their recoverability. The DWT architecture consists of two nested simple-cubic hollow-truss nanolattices. The superposition of two nanolattices leads to a reduced wall thickness for a given relative density thereby preventing the built-up of large stresses at the cell wall level when crushing the lattices. In this work, DWT alumina nanolattices are fabricated and compressed in situ to demonstrate the improvement in recoverability with decreasing alumina wall thickness. The results from finite element simulations reveal that double-wall architectures are up to two times stiffer than their single wall counterparts of equal mass, suggesting that superior recoverability (thinner ceramic coatings) coupled with enhanced stiffness can be achieved. The DWT lattice is proposed as a new architecture to expand the design space of highly recoverable brittle nanolattices. The new double-wall design concept is expected to provide an efficient tool for improving the mechanical performance of shell-nanolattices in general including triply-periodic minimal surfaces.},

In this approach, a designer utilizes the influence of individual microstructural features on microscopic deformation to yield desirable macroscopic properties. Therefore, the development of advanced experimental capabilities that enable detailed characterization of microscopic deformation of material test specimens is critical to realize this paradigm shift in practice. However, extracting the complex characteristics of microscopic deformation hidden in raw image data is quite challenging. In this article, we propose an automated data extraction and analysis method based on instance segmentation and tracking of microstructural features using deep learning (DL) and image processing algorithms. The method consists of a trained mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (mask R-CNN) DL model combined with a regional instance segmentation approach for the instance segmentation of features, an intersection over union based multi-object tracking method to track segmented instances as they deform, and kinematics models to extract the material characteristics from the geometrical data of the deforming instances. The method is then validated by characterizing the microscopic deformation of an additively manufactured 316L stainless steel coupon specimen under quasi-static tensile loading. Our study presents a general framework for advancing deep learning algorithms to solve complex problems in the field of experimental mechanics.},

For many popular ledeburitic cold-work and high-speed tool steel alloys, there is a generally good understanding of the effects of the HIP temperature, pressure, and holding time on these traits. Nevertheless, there is still no thorough investigation on the influence of powder size distribution on the primary carbide phase. To that end, we employ in this work novel microstructural characterization methods that shed light on the nature and extent of its influence. We show that powder size has an enduring effect on primary carbide geometric features associated with the solidification process during powder atomization.

Sheet Ti-6Al-4V alloy of a single thickness was used as the starting material for the assembly of lattices which were subsequently brazed in vacuum to bond the nodes. Ambient temperature uniaxial compressive responses of the manufactured lattices have been investigated quasi-statically as a function of the lattice relative density, and are shown to be consistent with micromechanics predictions and finite element simulations. Analytical study reveals anisotropic-shaped biaxial failure loci in principal stress space, which expand anisotropically with an increasing relative density, and demonstrate greater structural strengths under tensile-tensile and compressive-compressive loading states. An assessment of structural efficiency has shown that the present snap-fit route is superior to our previously reported methodology in acquiring mechanically robust lattice performance for applications where maximum rigidity of octet-truss structure is sought. The present work has relaxed the plausible assumption that truss-plane-orthogonality relation must be satisfied for a specific topology to realize its snap-fit construction; incremental types of topology are thus feasible for snap-fit production characterized by versatility in material selection, cost-effective, and scale-up production capability.},

The component size is limited by the internal build volume of the employed PBF AM equipment; the fabrication of components larger than this volume therefore requires mechanical joining methods, such as laser welding. There are, however, very limited test data on the mechanical performance of PBF metal with laser welded joints. In this study, the mechanical properties of PBF built 316L stainless steel parts, joined together using laser welding to form larger components, have been investigated; the microstructure of the components has also been examined. 33 PBF 316L stainless steel tensile coupons, with central laser welds, welded using a range of welding parameters, and with coupon half parts built in two different orientations, were tested. The porosity, microhardness and microstructure of the welded coupons, along with the widths of the weld and heat-affected zone (HAZ), were characterised. The PBF base metal exhibited a typical cellular microstructure, while the weld consisted of equiaxed, columnar and cellular dendrite microstructures. Narrow weld regions and HAZs were observed. The PBF base metal was found to have higher proof and ultimate strengths, but a similar fracture strain and a lower Young’s modulus, compared with conventionally manufactured 316L stainless steel. The strengths were dependent on the build direction – the vertically built specimens showed lower proof strengths than the horizontal specimens. The laser welds generally exhibited lower microhardness, proof strengths and fracture strains than the PBF base metal which correlated with the observed structure. This work has demonstrated that PBF built parts can be joined by laser welding to form larger components and provided insight into the resulting strength and ductility.},

  abstract     = {The production of ordinary Portland cement (OPC), the most broadly utilized man-made material, has been scrutinized due to its contributions to global anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. Thus — to mitigate CO 2 emissions — mineral additives have been promulgated as partial replacements for OPC. However, additives — depending on their physiochemical characteristics — can exert varying effects on OPC’s hydration kinetics. Therefore — in regards to more complex systems — it is infeasible for semi-empirical kinetic models to reveal the underlying nonlinear composition-property (i.e., reactivity) relationships. In the past decade or so, machine learning (ML) has arisen as a promising, holistic approach to predict the properties of heterogeneous materials, even without an across-the-board comprehension of the underlying composition-properties correlations. This paper describes the use of a Random Forests (RF) model to enable high-fidelity predictions of time-dependent hydration kinetics of OPC-based systems — more specifically [OPC + mineral additive(s)] systems — using the system’s physiochemical attributes as inputs. Results show that the RF model can also be used to formulate mixture designs that satisfy user-imposed kinetics-related criteria. Lastly, the presented results can be expanded to formulate mixture designs that satisfy target kinetic criteria, even without knowledge of the underlying kinetic mechanisms.},

X-ray CT technology, as a non-destructive testing method, is one of great significance to the study of concrete meso-structure. However, since the traditional CT scanning image segmentation methods cannot effectively identify and segment structural meso-defects autonomously. In order to solve this problem, a new method for meso-crack segmentation and extraction of concrete CT scanning images based on regional convolution neural network (Mask R-CNN) is proposed and applied to segment the images obtained from the real-time CT test under static uniaxial compression. Results showed that the segmentation accuracy of voids and cracks in the CT images is 0.957 and 0.931 respectively, which verifies the effectiveness of the method that can be used to high-precision recognize voids and cracks from CT scanning images of concrete. Additionally, the segmented images of internal voids and cracks in concrete are adopted to accurately 3D reconstruction to investigate the meso-cracks propagation under real-time loading based on CT.},

The corrosive medium (Ca 2+ and Si 4+ ) penetrates the TBCs through the porous structure combined with surface defects. In this study, three different sealed layers (Zr, Al, and Al-Y) were deposited on the traditional TBCs by using magnetron sputtering. The cross-sectional morphologies showed the continuous structure of the sealed layer improved the pore filling effect. When O 2 is adsorbed at the top position of the Al atom, the lowest adsorption energy of the YAl 3 (0001) surface is −5.34 eV which can provide stronger chemical adsorption energies for Al and O. The Al-Y sealed layer was preferred to form an aluminum oxide film. The experimental results of CMAS corrosion showed that Al-Y sealed layer can achieve long-lasting protection because the aluminum yttrium oxide (Al 2 Y 4 O 9 ) reacts with CaO and SiO 2 at the interface and finally formed Ca 3 Y 2 (SiO 4 ) 6 O 2 , resulting in rapid crystallization of CMAS.},

The process parameters of 3D electrospinning have been identified and investigated to better understand the formation mechanism of the 3D build-up for polystyrene (PS), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Different types of electrodes were inserted in the electrospinning chamber to alter the electric field and have better control over the shape of the 3D structure. The upscalability of this technology was investigated by using a standard electrospinner and a nozzle-free electrospinning setup. It was possible to manufacture 3D structures with these devices, highlighting the versatility of this technology. 3D electrospinning opens the pathway for the facile fabrication of macroscopic 3D structure with microfibrous features on a commercial scale.},

  abstract     = {Magnetostriction, known as the ability of magnetic materials to expand or contract in response to magnetic field, is a key property of Fe-Ga alloys exploited in various types of transducers. Usually, thin films of Fe-Ga deposited on rigid substrates suffer from a clamping effect that hinders the propagation of strain. Herein, Fe-Ga films with macroporous, not fully constrained, geometry are prepared by electrodeposition on metallized silicon substrates templated with sub-micrometer-sized polystyrene spheres. For comparison, fully-dense and inherently nanoporous films are prepared by sputtering and electrodeposition, respectively. The electrodeposition mechanism is discussed in terms of electrochemically active species distribution and partial current densities. The composition of the Fe-Ga films has been tuned (2–40 at.\% Ga) by varying the electrodeposition parameters. A complete assessment of the nanomechanical and magnetic properties of the films with variable composition and porosity has been performed for an optimized performance. The magnetostriction has been studied by X-ray diffraction applying an in-situ magnetic field. The results demonstrate a larger magnetic-field-induced crystal deformation in templated (macroporous) films compared to the non-templated and fully-dense counterparts. The observed effects in porous Fe-Ga films are very appealing for the design of various strain-engineered nanomaterials, e.g., energy transducers or magnetoelectric composites.},

The homogeneity of particle distribution within the polymer matrix, together with the chain-like structure of the aligned composites elaborated with various ZnO volume fraction was verified via microscopic investigations. Numerical simulation was also conducted through COMSOL Multiphysics, giving an estimation of field distribution around ZnO phase. Experimental characterization in addition to analytical models was established using varying (sinusoidal) or direct current (DC) tests. The DC test was carried out in order to identify the conduction profile as well as the percolation threshold of ZnO samples. Temperature also has considerable influence on the switching field and the dielectric permittivity of the nonlinear composites. In the sinusoidal test, current discrimination was adopted using bipolar polarization loop, allowed the detailed quantification of conductivity values, while prediction in the capacitive current density enabled to distinguish the relative permittivity. These results demonstrated that the electrical properties of ZnO compound, such as conductivity and permittivity, substantially enhanced with the increasing filler content, especially when the samples were subjected to dielectrophoretic manipulation. Further analysis was carried out on sinusoidal unipolar polarization to predict the dielectric loss factor as function applied field. Finally, by playing on different pertinent parameters, it was possible to efficiently control the electric and mechanical characteristics of ZnO composite. Such properties are highly important in application of microvaristors used as protection devices. By associating with other features of ZnO like piezoelectricity, this material is undoubtedly of high interest in medical use where multifunctional system design becomes mandatory.},

Although the additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4 V functionally graded porous structure (FGPS) has proven to be the most promising material owing to its good mechanical performance, the impact of porosity gradient pattern on their mechanical performance has scarcely been investigated. In this study, FGPSs with varied porosity gradient pattern and same overall porosity were designed by triply periodic minimal surface and fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), and their structural and mechanical properties were analyzed. A semi-empirical equation was derived to predict the mechanical properties of FGPSs. Hence, we discovered that the lattice with solid core exhibited the best mechanical performance among all FGPS designs. X-ray microscopy (XRM) analysis revealed a strong relationship between the internal micro-porosity of the L-PBF-fabricated samples and the dimensions of the manufactured components, further proving the rationale of the lattice with solid core design. In situ compression tests under XRM visualized the different failure mechanisms in the porous and dense portion of the lattice with solid core. The strengthening mechanism of the lattice with solid core was further revealed by finite element analysis.},

The corrosion behaviour in bulk carrier ballast tanks is interpreted through a sensitivity analysis which quantifies the relationships between operational/environmental factors and the corrosion rate.

Optimized indentation parameters are obtained by investigating the effects of surface roughness, flat indenter diameter, indentation depth on P - h curves. This allows to employ conventional spherical indentation (SI) method for property evaluation from DFSI P - h curves.

An empirical model to predict porosity type and growth rates as a function of laser energy density was established, to select the LPBF process parameters to fabricate test pieces under stable conduction and keyhole melting. The size, shape, distribution of macro and keyhole pores in the test pieces obtained for ERET testing were characterised. At high strain rate the number of ring fragments for the highest porosity doubled, accompanied by a reduction in true strain at maximum uniform elongation and fracture strain. The trend for reducing fracture strain with increasing porosity at high strain rate was described by a decaying power law. Overall, there was a significant positive strain rate effect on tensile ductility at lower porosities attributed strain rate hardening (Hart, 1967) [1]. Fracture surfaces containing the highest porosity identified four different void coalescence mechanisms that helped explain the influence of larger pores on the stress state in the alloy.},

  abstract     = {The corrosion behavior of laser powder bed fusion produced (L-PBF-produced) titanium alloys involving flowing body fluid is still unclear. Therefore, this work investigates in vitro corrosion behavior and the characteristics of passive films formed on L-PBF-produced Ti–6Al–4V in both static and dynamic Hank’s solutions. Electrochemical measurements, immersion tests, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were conducted. In comparison to the L-PBF-produced Ti–6Al–4V in static Hank’s solution, the samples showed lower charge transfer resistance and higher passivation current density (anodic current density as well) in dynamic Hank’s solution. Meanwhile, a more apparent deposition of apatite and hydroxyapatite is found on the L-PBF-produced Ti–6Al–4V in dynamic Hank’s solution. Such outcomes mainly result from the enhancement of film/solution interfacial transportation in dynamic Hank’s solution. The dynamic Hank’s solution provides more calcium and phosphate ions to the surface of the passive film and also takes away the dissolved metal ions. Therefore, more salt deposition and a lower-quality passive film are found.},

  abstract     = {Seismic metamaterials (SMs) are expected to assist or replace traditional isolation systems owing to their strong attenuation of seismic waves . In this work, a one-dimensional inverted T-shaped SM (1D ITSM) composed of arrays of inverted T-shaped structures on a half space is proposed, which have an ultra-wide first bandgap (FBG) from 6.7 to 17.2 Hz. We find that the FBG is composed of two parts; part 1 with surface evanescent waves from 6.7 to 11.0 Hz and part 2 with no surface modes from 11.0 to 17.2 Hz by using the complex band structures. The propagation of seismic surface waves in the 1D ITSM is different in these two frequency ranges of the FBG. In part 1, the seismic surface waves are significantly attenuated in the 1D ITSM because of the surface evanescent waves, while in part 2, the surface waves are converted into bulk waves because surface waves cannot exist in the ITSM. Finally, the ultra-wide FBG is verified by using a kind of the two-dimensional ITSM in large-scale field experiments.},

The different performance of the same coating deposited on different substrates has been tentatively attributed to the different alloying elements present in the intermetallic substrate, and that can diffuse towards the protective coating and the growing oxide layer.},

Understanding phase transformation of strengthening intermetallic phases and its influence on mechanical properties is therefore crucial for the alloys’ safe applications and further development. In this work, investigations using an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that the strengthening intermetallic phase, η-Al 3 La, of a die-casting Mg − 3.5Al − 4.2La alloy is metastable, and it will transform to α-Al 11 La 3 via an intermediate phase, ε-Al 2.12 La 0.88 , during annealing at 250 °C. For each transformation step, two orientation relationships are obeyed due to different nucleation sites or temperatures, or because of similar interfacial energy. Furthermore, a new planar fault, namely monolayer twin (MT), was observed, and it not only offer the nucleation site for ε-Al 2.12 La 0.88 and the fast diffusion path for Al atoms, but also provide driving force for overcoming the energy barrier of η → ε → α transformation. Finally, both intermediate and product phases will obstruct the η-Al 3 La phase delivering 〈 c + a 〉 dislocations, and the level of solute Al atoms in Mg matrix will be clearly lowered during phase transformation, which result in deterioration in plasticity and creep resistance, respectively.},

However, the increase of the adsorption capacity together with high strength for long time and repeat using is still a challenge. In this study, a novel silica modification method was proposed to modify graphene aerogels with high strength and ultrahigh adsorption capability. Apart from its high adsorption capacity for liquid toluene, the adsorption capability to benzene, an indoor pollutant gas, was increased to 809.51 mg/g, which is higher than pure graphene aerogel and other carbon-based adsorbents such as graphene, activated carbon and single-wall carbon nanotubes. The enhanced adsorption performance is due to two reasons in addition to the electrostatic interactions. On one hand, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) could help to modify the pore structure of aerogel, reducing its average pore diameter and increasing its BET specific surface area. On the other hand, the addition of TEOS could help to improve the hydrophobicity of aerogel. The selective adsorption character of graphene aerogels to benzene/toluene binary system in the breakthrough experiment confirmed that the prepared graphene aerogels could also be used in the field of separation of multicomponent indoor pollutant gases.},

A reduction of the surface free energy (SFE) has been found to enhance self-cleaning, hydrophobic, and non-fouling properties of surfaces, which are highly desirable in many industrial applications. However, tuning the surface chemistry and topography to achieve tailored low free energy surfaces has been found extremely challenging. In this work, we first show that an accurate refinement of the atmospheric plasma technique guarantees a polymeric coating near to the super-hydrophobic regime. Second, by coupling modelling and experimental measurements we suggest a reliable workflow for the surface characterization and smart design. Specifically, the case study proposed in this contest is capable of quantitatively distinguishing the contribution of a Perfluoro Decyl Acrylate (PFDA) coating, and hence decoupling the role of surface chemistry and roughness, in the reduction of the surface free energy of a bare silicon sample. Beyond the specific case study, our results also emphasize that a synergistic combination of models and experiments can unveil the optimal pathway for designing low-free-energy surfaces.},

However, the preparation of the complex structures still remains challenging. Herein, a complex gradient composite microwave absorbing metastructure is designed and fabricated by the low cost, high-efficiency fused deposition modeling of 3D printing technologies. The metastructure is composed of flaky carbonyl iron particles and Polyether-ether-ketone composite which demands only 50\% loss material mass addition. Structural parameters are investigated and optimized for absorbing bandwidth and reflectivity intensity. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the designed complex gradient metastructure with the thickness of 10 mm can achieve the −10 dB absorbing bandwidth in the frequency range from 5.1 to 40 GHz, and the absorbing bandwidth corresponding to −15 dB in 7.7–14.7 GHz and 22.6–36.3 GHz. Meanwhile, this metastructure also can maintain the broadband and strong microwave absorption with incident angle from 0° to 55° for transverse electric polarization and 0° to 70° for transverse magnetic polarization. Moreover, the proposed metastructure is also demonstrated with good compression strength which shows preferable mechanical stability. This work provides a simple and promising route of broadband and wide-angle microwave strong absorption for practical application.},

At both test temperatures, three-point-bending strengths were ~55–58 MPa for material A and ~94–100 MPa for material B. Damage was associated with three primary types of cracking modes: interfacial delamination, inclined cracks within fibre tows, opening of existing matrix shrinkage cracks. Material A exhibited higher shrinkage cracking, whereas material B displayed more pronounced diagonal matrix microcracking. At 1050 °C, both systems showed less microcracking but more pronounced delamination. Such damage characteristics were rationalised in terms of the corresponding 3D DVC displacement/strain fields. Specifically, global DVC was utilised and maximum principal strain locations prior to failure, which varied from 0.005 to 0.01, correlated well to the fracture initiation sites. Further, abrupt positive to negative transitions of shear strain components were observed and were attributed to the different bonding strengths between 0°/90° fibres and the matrix. The current study demonstrates that in situ high-temperature tomography/DVC is a powerful method for studying the deformation and fracture of oxide-oxide CMCs.},

  abstract     = {The electronic industry is facing pressing needs for cooling system with high-performance in heat transfer and matched coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) with the chips. Metal composite materials (MCMs) with low CTE can be used in cooling chips to overcome the thermal expansion mismatch between the cooling substrate and chips. However, low thermal conductivity of MCMs limits their application in electronic cooling systems. Increasing the percentage of components with high thermal conductivity can enhance the thermal conductivity of MCMs, but it often leads to increase CTE as well. Here, we demonstrate that vapor–liquid phase change can improve the heat transfer performance of tungsten-copper (W-Cu) alloy-based MCMs while maintain their low CTEs. Such strategy reduces the maximum temperature and thermal resistance of MCMs, and also allows for heat spreading from concentrated heat source with high power density. The W-Cu alloy-based vapor chamber (VC) has low thermal resistance of 0.38 K/W at 100 W and high lateral thermal conductivity of ~1727 W/(m·K). The W-Cu alloy-based VC can be readily integrated with the chip and heat sink to serve as cooling substrates for dissipating the heat and simultaneously lowering the thermal expansion mismatch by using its high thermal conductivity and low CTE.},

The practical implications of these geometric effects on structural performance is of critical importance to effective AM design; however, these effects are poorly understood. In response to this uncertainty, this research compares predictive and experimental data for the structural response of LB-PBF lattice strut elements subject to compressive loading; this comparison is made for LB-PBF manufactured Ti-6Al-4V LB-PBF but is generally applicable to all AM systems and materials. This data provides insight into the influence of geometric design parameters, including: node and strut diameter, strut length, and manufacturing inclination angle. The effect of these geometric parameters on the associated critical buckling load, and the accuracy of predictive failure models is quantified. Furthermore, the eccentricity ratio, a classical measure of column efficiency widely used in civil engineering design, is applied for the first-time as a systematic metric to characterise the structural efficiency of as-manufactured AM strut element.},

  abstract     = {A predictive model is developed to assist in the design and manufacture of structures by inkjet based 3D printing (IJ3DP)/additive manufacturing. IJ3DP often exploits photopolymerisation to rapidly convert a photoreactive liquid ink into a solid product. Unfortunately, deviations from the intended design and product performance are often observed and a lack of understanding of the underlying processes and their interactions prevents users from resolving these issues. We develop and validate a predictive model that incorporates the critical processing parameters, including UV source pathway, UV intensity, printing strategy, and interlayer attenuation, such that we are able to predict the degree of ink conversion throughout the product. We show how this model can then be used to guide users by demonstrating the coupling of this description with a cost model and illustrating how printing strategy affects descriptors of both the quality and cost of production.},

The structural performances of UHTC-enriched CMCs are generally investigated through bending test because it requires simple fixture and specimen geometry with small quantity of plate material. However, there are hardly any scientific studies which bring out what bending test conditions are required to determine reliable flexural strength of these composites. In this study, the effect of span length and specimen orientation on the flexural strength of UHTC-enriched SICARBON™ material, produced by Airbus, was comprehensively evaluated and reported. Transition of the failure mode was obtained by tilting the specimens with horizontal build direction instead of lay-up configuration (vertical build direction). The tilted configuration allowed to get a valid flexural strength of 370 MPa even with small specimens of about 30 mm. To assess failure mode in different test configurations, virtual microstructure was generated on the base of cumulative distribution functions of observed microstructural features. Tsai-Wu failure criterion was extended in order to evaluate direction dependent failure indices for different lay-up configurations.},

ADSCs were transfected with Lenti-SDF-1. Cell proliferation , osteogenic gene expression and ALP/ARS staining were investigated. Osteoblast migration was studied. MCPC construct was employed as carrier of Lenti-SDF-1 ADSCs. Osteogenic gene expressions of BMSCs were determined in MCPC + ADSCs medium. MCPC + Lenti-SDF-1 ADSCs scaffolds were implanted into rats and bone regeneration efficacy was evaluated by micro-CT and histological analysis . SDF-1 transduction neither impacted ADSCs&#39; proliferation, nor osteogenic differentiation. Lenti-SDF-1 ADSCs promoted migration of BMSCs/osteoblasts. MCPC facilitated osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Bone formation was significantly increased in MCPC + Lenti-SDF-1 group. Overexpressed SDF-1 gene promotes the homing of endogenous osteoblasts. MCPC + Lenti-SDF-1 facilitated robust in situ bone regeneration via dual mechanisms by recruiting endogenous BMSCs&#39; and enhancing homing cell&#39;s differentiation. This advanced design combines gene therapy and osteoinductive tissue scaffolds, which is proved to be a promising strategy to achieve satisfied clinical bone repair efficacy.},

The surrogate model based on sample points can approximate the real model and thus greatly reduce the computational effort. The selection of sample points has a great influence on the accuracy of the surrogate model. Aiming at the problem of sample point selection in the process of establishing surrogate model, an adaptive sampling method based on distance density and local complexity is proposed. In this method, distance density is used to quantify the sparsity of new sample points, and local complexity is applied to quantify the change complexity of response values near new sample points. The high-quality of new sample point is added to improve the accuracy of the surrogate model. This method is compared with two other classical adaptive sampling methods through nine test functions. The results show that this method can make the new sample point more distributed in the key area of sample space, so that fewer sample points are used to establish a high-precision surrogate model. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified through an optimization of the thermal management system design for liquid-cooled cylindrical batteries.},

In vivo, the rabbit femoral defect model was used to evaluate the effects of the composite on osteointegration and bone ingrowth. The results showed that the composite scaffold had good biocompatibility and provided bioactive growth factors for bone repair.

Biofilms were grown on a set of nanostructured polymeric surfaces, which were thoroughly characterised for their surface chemistry and topography. Surface hydrophobicity, summit density as well as peak and valley structure were found to influence the microbial viability and exopolysaccharide abundance level in the agar plate assay. In the well plate assay, surface chemical parameters had a lesser influence on the viability, but roughness caused by valley structures increased the viability and decreased the exopolysaccharide expression. Surface proteins relating to pathogenicity were affected by the biofilm formation assay. The abundance profile of these proteins correlated clearly with several roughness parameters, especially fine structure parameters in the agar plate assay and lateral roughness in the well plate assay. These results highlight the necessity of describing the material surfaces with a versatile set of different roughness parameters to completely understand what specific features of a surface drive a certain bacterial response.},

Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the bioactivity of PEG-RLS/Fe@CDs as nanozyme for photothermal and chemodynamic synergistic therapy, leading to a noticeable inhibited tumor growth with 80\% survival for at least 50 days in a breast tumor model.

Alginate di-aldehyde- gelatine (ADA-GEL) hydrogel was used as ink to create hierarchically ordered scaffolds. In comparison to previously reported ADA-GEL compositions, we introduce a modified formulation featuring increased amounts of thermally modified gelatine. Gelatine was degraded by hydrolysis which resulted in tailorable printability characteristics further substantiated by rheological analysis. ADA (3.75\%w/v)-GEL (7.5\%w/v) with gelatine modified at 80 °C for 3 h could be printed in hierarchical complex structures reaching scaffold heights of over 1 cm. The hierarchical structure of the scaffolds was confirmed via µCT analysis. To examine mechanical properties as well as the suitability of the hydrogel as a proper matrix for cell seeding and encapsulation, nanoindentation was performed. Elastic moduli in the range of ~ 5 kPa were measured. Gelatine heat pre-treatment resulted in modifiable mechanical and rheological characteristics of ADA-GEL. In summary, this study demonstrates the possibility to enhance the printability of ADA-GEL hydrogels to fabricate hierarchical scaffold structures with shape stability and fidelity, without the necessity to change the initial hydrogel chemistry by the use of additives or crosslinkers, providing a valuable approach for fabrication of designed scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering.},

Here, we present a chemical approach based on the addition of carbon (C) for increased strength via the combination of three strengthening mechanisms in W thin films. W:C thin films with C concentrations up to ~4 at.\% were deposited by magnetron sputtering. All films exhibit a body-centred-cubic structure with strong  texture and columnar growth behaviour. X-ray and electron diffraction measurements suggest the formation of supersaturated W:C solid solution phases. The addition of C reduced the average column width from ~133 nm for W to ~20 nm for the film containing ~4 at.\% C. The column refinement is explained by a mechanism where C acts as re-nucleation sites. The W film is ~13 GPa hard, while the W:C films achieve a peak hardness of ~24 GPa. The W:C films are ~11 GPa harder than the W film, which is explained by a combination of grain refinement strengthening, solid solution strengthening and increased dislocation density. Additional micropillar compression tests showed that the flow stress increased upon C addition, from ~3.8 to ~8.3 GPa and no brittle fracture was observed.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a comprehensive study of the microstructure-property relationships in Ta and stainless or carbon steel composites, fabricated by explosive welding using Cu interlayer. Employing scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy and X-ray synchrotron diffraction, a complex microstructure of interfacial layers was examined. Particular attention was placed on the description of the phase transformation mechanisms in the reaction regions, and the competition between the strain-hardening and softening processes in parent sheets. SEM and TEM analyses showed that Cu and Ta nanoparticles, and small dendrites, dominated the reaction regions near the Ta/Cu interfaces, whereas the nano-grained phases having more complex chemical compositions were identified near the Cu/steel interfaces. SEM orientation mapping revealed that the interfacial layers of the parent sheets underwent severe plastic deformation as a result of dislocation slip, twinning, and shear banding. Such heavily deformed areas can easily undergo recovery and recrystallization already during clad processing. In consistence with these findings, the micro-hardness values of the welded sheets increased as the joining interface approached, except for the layers directly adhering to large reaction regions, where a decrease in micro-hardness was observed. However, the solidified melt regions were essentially softer than the strain-hardened layers of both steels. Based on experimental results a new explanation for the reaction region formation was proposed and a significant modification of the description of the interfacial microstructure of parent sheets was done. Finally, the effect of microstructural changes on the clads properties was discussed.},

  abstract     = {We report the energy absorption and piezoresistive self-sensing performance of 3D printed discontinuous carbon fiber (CF)-reinforced polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cellular composites. Experiments conducted on three different 2D lattices with hexagonal, chiral and re-entrant topologies of the same relative density (33\%) and CF loading (30 wt\%) reveal that the CF/PEEK hexagonal lattice (HL), due its relatively brittle response, shows about 40\% and 9\% decrease in specific energy absorption (SEA) under in-plane and out-of-plane compression, respectively, compared with PEEK HL. While the collapse response of PEEK HL is nearly insensitive to the strain-rate over 43 ≤ ε ̇ ε̇ ≤ 106 s −1 , we observe a twenty-fold increase in peak stress and a five-fold increase in SEA under in-plane impact loading over the same range of strain-rates for the CF/PEEK HL. The CF/PEEK lattices exhibit pronounced piezoresistive response under both in-plane and out-of-plane compression with maximum sensitivity of 3.1 and 5.2, respectively, for the re-entrant lattice, offering insight into the damage-state. Higher damage sensitivity indicates faster percolation of new contacts due to folds forming between the cell walls within the lattice under compression. The energy-absorbing and strain- and damage-sensing nature of 3D printed CF/PEEK lattices demonstrated here offers insight into the design of lightweight, high-performance multifunctional lattices.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we report the morphology and the microstructural properties of thick [1 1 1]-oriented 3C-SiC films epitaxially grown on T-shaped Si micropillars. This compliant substrate was designed to release the stress developed in 3C-SiC grown on Si, due to the lattice mismatch and the different thermal expansion coefficients between 3C-SiC and Si. In this way it was possible to have 3C-SiC films as thick as 10 and 16 μm, with small bowing and no cracks. Our study relies on the use of an Electron Microscopy approach and elucidates the structure of the crystallographic defects across the 3C-SiC film, such as stacking faults (SFs), nano-twins and grain boundaries (GBs). After examination of the morphological and structural characteristics of the Si micropillar array, we analyzed the crystallographic properties of the thin 3C-SiC deposit on the Si micropillar sidewalls, since it may have an impact on the upper film. To assess the crystal quality of the 3C-SiC film, we quantified the SF density at the 3C-SiC surface, even estimating semi-quantitatively the depletion of SFs at much larger thickness. Hence, we analyzed the regions where 3C-SiC microcrystals grown on neighboring Si micropillars coalesce and form a continuous layer. We found that the coalescence between adjacent 3C-SiC microcrystals produces twinned regions, which terminate with the formation of GBs. We noticed that SFs may annihilate at the GBs, leading to the SF reduction across the 3C-SiC film. Finally, we observed the closure of the GBs inside the 3C-SiC film, thus improving the crystal quality of its surface. This work endorses the use of Si micropillars as compliant substrate to grow thick [1 1 1]-oriented 3C-SiC films with good crystal quality and is preliminary to the exploitation of 3C-SiC for high performing microelectronic devices.},

In this work, we use a fully thermomechanical coupled phase-field model to design microarchitectures considering the effects of all the possible non-transforming intermetallics (Ni 4 Ti 3, Ni 3 Ti, and Ti 2 Ni) in NiTi. Our simulations show possibilities of increasing the COP by guiding the type, shape and volume fraction of intermetallics, which are controllable by processing parameters. With 50\% intermetallic fraction arranged in strips of 500 nm width perpendicular to the loading direction, the Ti 2 Ni intermetallic induces higher COP (67.13) than Ni 3 Ti (16.18) and Ni 4 Ti 3 (14.29), all surpassing that of the bulk NiTi without intermetallics (12.92). Additionally, the COP increases to 79.94 for 65\% volume fraction of Ti 2 Ni and decreases to 56.31 for 35\% Ti 2 Ni content. Even nontrivial designs with 50\% of circular or square transforming NiTi domains display high COP of 40.06 and 29.22, respectively. A high COP is achievable by introducing intermetallics having high modulus (for low input energy), thermal conductivity (for temperature change) and heat capacity (for the output energy).},

In this paper, a novel energetic acrylate-terminated poly–3–nitratomethyl–3–methyloxetane (APNIMMO) oligomer was prepared and characterized. The performance of a new composite propellant composed of APNIMMO and CL-20 (Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane Dodecane) was also demonstrated. The new energetic printable resin and its composites are suitable for stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing, offering not only an improved thermodynamic energy, but also a substantially improved burn rate. Compared with the inert binder, the energetic binder offers the possibility to improve the thermodynamic energy by 15\% and the burn rate at 100 MPa by 480\% for 3D printed propellants.},

This paper addresses the design of viscoelastic damping under thermal consideration. For this purpose, the frequency and temperature dependent properties of a bromobutyl rubber compound were characterized in a dynamic mechanic thermal analysis. The viscoelastic material properties are employed in a finite element model of a structure with a constrained layer damping treatment. Subsequently, the modal damping of the structural vibrations is analyzed under varying temperature conditions. The analyses show a significant thermal impact on the modal damping. In this context, an approach is presented for compensating the adverse thermal effect on damping by a modified geometric design of the viscoelastic core layer.},

Herein, polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) hollow porous MFs (HPMFs) were prepared by improving and regulating the groups and structures of the MFs to address these challenges. The capacity of the HPMFs for the loading of polypeptide can be improved. Measurements involving the use of X-ray photoelectron, energy-dispersive, and ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopies in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy measurements showed that the amount of polypeptide (arginylglycylaspartic acid, RGD) loaded on the HPMFs was significantly higher than that loaded on the MFs. Animal cell experiments revealed that PBAT grafted MAH has good bioactivity. By loading RGD onto HPMFs and MFs, RGD@HPMFs and RGD@MFs were obtained. A study on HeLa and A549 cancer cells showed that the inhibition rates of RGD@HPMFs were higher than that of RGD@MFs by 14.1\% and 6.9\%, respectively. The results obtained herein show that HPMF scaffold preparation by improving the material groups and regulating the structure of MFs can address the challenges associated with control of the load and sustained release of polypeptides and other drugs.},

The influences of compaction pressure, hold time and particle size on the compaction were also analyzed. The results indicate that increasing the pressure and time, while decreasing the particle size, results in a higher density and strength of PBX parts. Then, the microstructures were analyzed to show the mechanism of density distributions. It is found that the density increase is due to the particle’s rearrangement leading to a “dense” structure and smaller particle sizes with ultrasonic vibration. Finally, the compressive modulus and strength, and the tensile fracture and strength were found to increase by applying ultrasonic vibration. These mechanical properties decrease along the radial and axial direction, indicating the surface effect of the ultrasonic vibration.},

Various aspects have to be considered for the preparation and the printability. A high stability is necessary, therefore agglomeration and sedimentation of the particles must be avoided. It is also important that long filaments and thus satellite droplets are not formed during printing. In this study, inks loaded with graphite nanoparticles were investigated regarding their stability and drop formation behavior to qualify them for reliable processing in binder jetting. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was used as a binder for the binder jetting process and simultaneously as a dispersing agent for the nanoparticles. The PVP mass fraction was investigated for its dispersion effect. To meet the print head requirements, the particle size distribution had to be below 1 μm. To destroy agglomerates with a diameter above this limit, ultrasonic treatment was used. The duration of the ultrasonic treatment was examined to identify the minimum time required to obtain a well dispersed ink. Particle loaded inks were then prepared and the fluid mechanical properties were determined for inks with different particle mass fractions. Monitoring of the drop formation provided information about a stable drop generation, the filament lengths, and the velocity of the drops. It was possible to qualify inks with a maximum particle mass fraction of 10 m\% for the binder jetting process.},

Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) incorporated basalt fiber reinforced polymers (BFRPs) exhibit promising potential applications in marine industries, such as offshore oil platforms and pipelines, due to their high mechanical strength and robust chemical durability. However, their damping capability, which is of great importance for large structural component applications, has not been yet thoroughly investigated. The main goal of this study is to investigate the damping property of nanoclays incorporated BFRPs, by combining the experimental patterns with the respective computational insights. Multiple-structured nanoclays were successfully synthesized by following various experimental approaches. The “stick-slip” mechanical model was implemented in order to elaborate on the energy dissipation issue, due to the development of interfacial frictional slip, whereas the experimental outcome was compared with the respective computational results in order to test the validity of our theoretical approach. Along these lines, the dynamic properties obtained by experimental analysis divulged a fair degree of agreement with the computational results. The fabrication of composites by incorporating HNTs with moderate aspect-ratio value and interfacial bonding can be considered as a quite promising solution in improving the energy dissipation performance.},

To overcome this difficulty, in this work, a novel photo-chromic molecule ( NBG1 ) was rational designed by linking triphenylamine (TPA) with spiropyran, which exhibited obvious photochromic propertie. Based on this, for the first time, the novel photochromic polysiloxane-based films ( Cns ) was achieved by using of facile thiol-ene “click” reaction. Cns could realize the fluorescence reversible transformation under Ultraviolet light or heating. Meanwhile, the potential application of NBG1 in anti-counterfeiting has been explored as a double anti-counterfeiting quick response (QR) code. Especially, the convenient approach of constructing photochromic film could be extended to design new stimuli-responsive materials.},

In this study, surface modified silica particles with different sizes (100, 500, and 800 nm) were incorporated with polycaprolactone (PCL) to study the influence of silica particle size on physical and biological properties. Controversial results were observed between the physical and biological properties. In terms of physical properties including surface roughness, hydrophilicity, and mechanical strength, the PCL scaffold with 800 nm-sized particles showed significantly enhanced results. However, the scaffold with 100 nm-sized particles significantly upregulated the biological properties such as human mesenchymal stem cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. This was also relevant for the in vivo results. Altogether, the results proved that the silica particle size influence the physical and biological properties of the PCL scaffold.},

Gelatin (Gel), chitosan (CS) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were first assembled to simulate extracellular matrix. The simulated matrix exhibited tunable pore size, porosity, swelling, pH, degradation and mechanical strength. After the incorporation of nHAp, the composite scaffolds showed improved compression resistance, pH adaptability, improved surface bioactivity and biomimetic structure. In addition, the composite scaffolds can effectively promote cell proliferation and adhesion, of which, scaffolds containing 12.5\% of nHAp were demonstrated to have high osteogenic differentiation ability.

To enhance the bioactivity and antibacterial activity of wound dressings based on the Janus nanofibers, Rana chensinensis skin peptides (RCSPs) and silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) were successfully loaded into the Janus nanofibers. The Janus nanofibers exhibited a bead-free surface and a characteristic side-by-side interior structure. The thermal properties, wettability, and mechanical properties of the Janus nanofibers were studied. The Janus nanofibers were found to have low cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity and were able to accelerate wound healing, which was typical of re-epithelialization, fibroblast proliferation, and regeneration of capillaries and hair follicles within 14 days. The findings indicate that Janus nanofibers loaded with RCSPs and Ag-NPs are promising wound dressing for skin tissue engineering.},

Early diagnosis, accurate staging, and imaging guided treatment response of RA remain crucial clinical significances for improving treatment outcomes. In this study, we introduced endogenous melanin nanoparticles (MNPs) conjugated with Cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide (MNP-PEG-RGD) as a contrast agent for accurate photoacoustic imaging (PAI) of RA diagnosis. It was observed that the prepared nanoprobes had favorable PA sensitivity, photostability and biocompatibility. In vivo studies using RA mouse model revealed that this nanoprobe could target α v β 3 actively at 1 h post-injection, while the signal was remarkably increased in the arthritic joint which could earlier diagnose RA than conventional imaging system. It was of crucial importance to staging RA by PAI with significant difference in nanoprobes accumulation. Furthermore, we tracked the therapeutic efficacy of etanercept in RA treatment by PAI. The observed advancement of arthritis on the PAI was confirmed by histological and immunohistochemical analysis. In conclusion, this study shed light on the development of innovative multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform for both RA monitoring and treatment with a promising future in clinical translation.},

The results indicated that VIM remelting vacuum drop has obvious effect on the existing form of trace oxygen. The total amount of oxygen did not increase significantly but a dramatic increase in the amount of oxide inclusions by 1–2 orders of magnitude was found. The inclusions are mainly oxides including Al 2 O 3 , Cr 2 O 3 , NiAl 2 O 4 and complex oxides or sulfides. Remelting under 100–110 Pa has no significant effect on mechanical properties such as stress rupture life and tensile strength but decreased ductility obviously. In comparison to the normal vacuum counterpart, the tensile elongation and impact ductility of the alloy remelted under lower vacuum level decreased by 67\% and 39\%, respectively. This study reveals the relationship between the vacuum level and mechanical properties of superalloys and highlights the trace amount of oxide inclusions which should be considered as one of the key issues for the cleanliness of virgin or revert superalloys apart from the typical measurement of the gas content only.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant efforts in multiscale modeling of multiphase materials, the effective mechanical response of the thin surface layers still remains elusive due to the complexity of heterogeneous microstructures and composition. This work presents a multiscale modeling approach for determining the effective elastic properties and mechanical behavior of heterogeneous materials such as thin multilayered oxides. This approach is specifically tailored for identifying the mechanical performance of porous solid oxides as the outermost layer. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to generate microstructure with varying porosities, complex pore shapes, and randomly distributed pores. The multiscale modeling framework is based on the Mechanics of Structure Genome (MSG) to concurrently derive micromechanics and structural analysis models from heterogeneous structures. We have evaluated the modeling approach based on the available experimental data in the literature. By resorting to the presented framework, not only the effective mechanical properties but also the global and local fields within the macro- and micro-structures, respectively, can be quantitatively predicted for a wide range of heterogeneous systems. A thorough investigation of the mechanical performance of aluminum alloys with deposited porous ZrO 2 – SiO 2 bilayer is presented to demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of this approach. Results show that the elastic properties of silica and zirconia are dramatically reduced when porosity exceeds 5\% 5\% and 3\%\% , respectively.},

This study proposes a new type of compliant curved-crease origami-inspired metamaterial, constructed with an ‘elastica’ non-zero principal surface curvature. Construction parameters for the new metamaterial are shown to influence a range of non-linear force–displacement response characteristics, including response shape, response duration, and response magnitude. A concise analytical curved-crease bending translation (CCBT) method is developed for rapid response prediction from metamaterial geometric parameters. The CCBT method also then enables the direct design and specification of a metamaterial with a fully programmable compliant force–displacement response.},

Particular attention was paid to surface characteristics such as equivalent diameter and shape factor. The inherent surface quality of external surfaces was optimized by a systematic variation of the LPBF contour parameters as well as the channel cross-section. The mean arithmetic roughness S a was analysed for upskin, vertical and downskin surfaces with respect to the build platform. Simultaneously, the effect of the build direction on the quality of internal free-shaped surfaces was investigated on channels with diameters from 500 to 1000 µm and build orientations from the horizontal (0°) to vertical (90°). A significant improvement in dimensional accuracy was achieved by using an optimized droplet-shaped cross-section that is scaled as a function with the build inclination. An angular analysis of the surface roughness in different regions of the channels confirms that this modified cross-section reduces the fraction of channel regions that show a particularly high surface roughness due to inward melting. In combination with an optimized contour processing strategy, the modified channel resulted in the best properties for inclinations below 45°. The shape factor increased from 0.4 to almost 0.9, i.e., close to the ideally round shape.},

Due to the difficulty of observing laser reflections, current understanding on the laser reflection mechanisms is still vague and unclear. This work constructs a high-fidelity CFD model coupled with a ray-tracing method to visualize the flow kinetics and reflection behavior during SLM Cu-Cr-Zr alloy. Considering the material specificity of copper, a temperature-dependent absorption rule is introduced to overcome the simulation deviation caused by the widely-used Fresnel absorption, showing good agreement with experiments in terms of track width and depth. The in-situ absorptivity measurement experiments are further conducted to compare with simulations with the error less than 2\%. Additionally, different reflection mechanisms for continuous and distorted tracks are revealed. At relatively high linear energy density (LED), the global absorptivity undergoes a rise and a decrease in the initial stage, and finally gets stable. At low LED level, the surface tension drives the melt pool to form isolated balls and exposed plat surface, which is responsible for the intense absorptivity oscillation as the balling effect occurs.},

Consequently, there are currently no suitable design support tools that can guide component designers using the most recent, and therefore unfamiliar, sheet metal manufacturing technologies. This paper aims to address this bottleneck by proposing a strategy for the creation of early stage manufacturing design guidelines for the common limiting design requirement of deep corners. Aluminium alloys formed under both cold, and elevated temperature working conditions are considered. A new methodology to simplify the analysis of complex viscoplastic behaviour of aluminium alloys at elevated temperatures into an equivalent strain hardening response is presented. The effects and trends of the deep corner geometry and simplified material hardening characteristics on the post-form thinning distribution are identified. New equation sets are proposed which model the identified trends and enable the development of intuitive design maps. Following the approach proposed in this paper, an awareness of the available design envelope can be created at the early stages of a design process to guide component design, material, and manufacturing process selection decisions.},

Limited by the expensive computational cost, it is particularly disadvantaged when instantaneous multiple designs are required. In recent years, an increasing number of research fields are harnessing machine learning approaches thanks to their experience-free manner and outstanding efficiency. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), as a type of machine learning algorithms, enjoy the special benefit of powerful generative capability, making them brilliantly suitable for designing purposes. Additionally, it can fully explore the data distribution space with enormous computational power and create brand new designs. In this work, GANs are newly employed for the topological design of metaporous materials for sound absorption. Trained with numerically prepared data, they successfully propose designs with high-standard broadband absorption performance, verified by simulation and experiment. The designing process is dramatically accelerated by hundreds of times using GANs (100 designs in 4.372 s). This allows GANs to easily provide more structures and configurations, and achieve instantaneous multiple solutions, giving designers more choices to satisfy various constraints such as mass or porosity. In addition, GANs are demonstrated remarkably capable of generating creative configurations and rich local features. This work proposes a new designing principle, illustrates the value of machine learning in guiding the designing and optimizing process in the mechanical world, and opens new possibilities for the future of AI-materials interdisciplinary research.},

Stress-strain responses and viscoelastic parameters were obtained through uniaxial tensile tests on the HMX-MDB propellant and stress relaxation tests on a nitrocellulose-nitroglycerine (NC-NG) propellant, respectively. A two-dimensional representative volume element (RVE) model was developed based on the molecular dynamics method by embedding HMX particles in the NC-NG matrix. A zero-thickness cohesive element was used to simulate the damage behavior of the matrix and the interface. A piecewise cohesive zone model (PCZM) was established to capture stress-strain responses resulted from the matrix rupture and the debonding process at the particle-matrix interface. The effects of matrix strength and interface strength on the mechanical properties of the HMX-MDB propellant were investigated by PCZM. The different ratio of matrix strength to interface strength revealed three kinds of HMX-MDB propellant’s damage patterns: matrix cracking, matrix cracking followed by particle-matrix interfacial debonding, and particle-matrix interfacial debonding followed by matrix cracking.},

  abstract     = {The growing requirements for efficient and reliable high-performance rotors have led to an increased application of advanced fiber-reinforced composites. For an efficient feasibility analysis , analytical calculation methods for composite structures can provide a first design draft of typical composite components without cumbersome finite element models to engineers having low experience with anisotropic materials. In these investigations, an analytical solution for polar-orthotropic multi-layered composite rotors under rotational load is presented by transferring the well-known formulation of the classical laminate theory given in Cartesian coordinates into a formulation given in a polar coordinate system taking into consideration of centrifugal loads. The analytical results are verified under different rotational speeds with standard finite element solutions and also with experimental results at selected positions from strain gauges and diffraction grating strain sensors. The results show the usefulness of analytical solutions for the design engineer and can be further expanded to take into consideration temperature and shrinkage effects.},

  abstract     = {Graphene-based hybrid coatings have received considerable research interest in realizing the anti-corrosion application due to their high strength and impermeability. Graphene morphology is an important factor in determining the behaviors of composites. However, there have been few reports on the application of GO nanoscrolls in anti-corrosion coatings. Here, we obtained a hybrid siloxane-epoxy (SE) coating reinforced with worm-like graphene oxide (FGO) nanoscrolls for the protection of AA2024 alloy. GO sheets were firstly functionalized with tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) through a sol–gel method and incorporated into the SE resin via a wet transfer method. Chemical, structure and morphological analyses revealed that FGO sheets with active -Si-OH groups, increased surface wrinkles and decreased layers were obtained. During the transfer process, Si-OH guided the transformation of FGO into the tubular structure. Ultrasonication provided the required activation for scrolling and the vacuum cavity offered the deformation space. FGO sheets resulted in better dispersion and interfacial interaction. The positive effect of the characteristic structure on the mechanical and anti-corrosion properties of the coating outweighed the negative effect of the laminated stacking GO. SE/FGO coatings were characterized by high cross-linking density, toughness, flexibility, easy-produced and eco-friendly. This work provides a new strategy for developing high-performance graphene-based nano coatings.},

The thermal simulations at the scale of the component are resolved at the level of a single stripe of the scan path. This resolution allows to model various process parameters (or scan strategies) in complex geometry domains, here demonstrated by an impeller, and predicts the complete thermal history within each finite element layer. The predicted thermal history is in-full passed to multiple phase-field simulation representative volume elements (RVEs) that explicitly model the evolution of the γ ′ γ′ and γ ″ γ″ precipitates in various locations of the impeller. We simulate the precipitate microstructures in different regions of the impeller and demonstrate the influence of process parameters on the volume fraction, size, and shape of the precipitates. Although no precipitates are found to form during the standard printing conditions (for instance EOS M290), we show that changing the process parameters such as stripe width or chamber temperature may induce significant precipitation in the as-built component.},

However, the application of MXenes in highly sensitive photodetection is far scarcely investigated. Here, we demonstrate high-quality Ti 3 C 2 T x /GaAs Schottky junction by simply dripping Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene solution on a pre-patterned GaAs substrate. Owing to the wide absorption of MXene and the good quality junction, the self-driven Ti 3 C 2 T x /GaAs Schottky junction photodetector with an impressive performance is realized. The assembled photodetector exhibits a high sensitivity over a wide waveband with a good responsivity of ~1.46 A/W, a large specific detectivity of ~1.23 × 10 13 Jones, and a high I light /I dark ratio of 5.6 × 10 5 . Significantly, the photodetector is capable of sensing infrared light signal up to 980 nm which exceeds the absorption edge of GaAs (874 nm) due to the generation of hot electrons in Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene film. Given the superior device performance along with a simple and facile fabrication method, the Ti 3 C 2 T x /GaAs Schottky junction photodetector may find the great potential in high performance broadband, self-driven photodetection applications.},

The addition of B and/or C is known to improve interface cohesion, allowing for a targeted improvement of mechanical properties through segregation engineering. In this work, the early stages of crack initiation of technically pure and B micro-doped Mo are investigated by scanning electron microscopy on the tension-loaded surface after three-point-bending of mm-sized specimens. Increased grain boundary cohesion is evident from a drastically reduced relative length of separated interfaces in the B-doped material.

However, its use in oil &amp; gas, marine or biomedical applications is limited by its poor tribocorrosion performance, since it is prone to wear-accelerated corrosion. On the quest for extending the applicability of 316L components deposited by laser processes to tribocorrosion applications, the present work develops 316L laser claddings reinforced with titanium carbonitride grains. An agglomerated and sintered (Ti,Mo)(C,N)-Ni powder was designed for preserving the chemical integrity of the hard phases during the laser deposition process. This results in 316L composites with homogeneously distributed titanium carbonitride reinforcements with a size ranging from sub-micrometre up to about 2 µm. These 316L composites improve the tribocorrosion performance in artificial seawater by over 10 fold in open circuit potential conditions and over 30 fold at an applied passive potential. The passivity of the 316L composites is maintained even though of a lower break down potential. These results highlight the enormous potential of 316L reinforced with titanium carbonitride deposited by laser processes for wear resistant components operating in saline environments.},

  abstract     = {The exchange of Ca 2+ ions in hydroxyapatite (HAp) with Zn 2+ ions into Zn-HAp is of interest for applications ranging from bone tissue engineering to the use as a precursor in subsequent ion-exchange reactions. Previous studies, using direct synthesis, showed that ~ 20 mol\% Zn 2+ ions can be incorporated into HAp, before byproducts are observed. However, this is realized at the cost of a loss in crystallinity and control over crystal size and shape with increasing amounts of Zn 2+ ion incorporation. In this work a simple post-synthetic ion-exchange strategy for the formation of Zn-HAp has been investigated. By merely exposing HAp to high concentrations of zinc nitrate in water, up to 22 mol\% of the Ca 2+ ions can displaced by Zn 2+ ions without any measured loss in crystallinity and preservation of crystallite size and shape. It was found that the incorporation of Zn 2+ ions destabilizes the HAp crystals resulting in their gradual dissolution and reprecipitation. Consequently, promoting the exchange of Ca 2+ with Zn 2+ ions using increased reaction times, sonication and increased temperature results in an increased dissolution of HAp and precipitation of hopeite crystals, thereby preventing the formation of more zinc rich Zn-HAp.},

For this purpose, a 3D stackable TaO x /HfO 2 -based selectorless memristor has been proposed and optimized via capacitance-dependent voltage division analysis. The proposed device utilizes the formation or rupture of conductive filaments for self-rectifying resistive switching operation, in contrast to nonfilamentary devices that often exploit the change in the charge state of the electron trap . This approach enables the reduction of the trapped charge leakage through the interface between the resistive switching and metal layers effectively, giving rise to excellent retention properties (&gt;5 × 10 5 s). Furthermore, the proposed device exhibits a sufficiently high on/off ratio (~1.35 × 10 3 ), rectification ratio (~2.3 × 10 3 ), endurance (1.5 × 10 2 cycles), and low resistance variation (standard deviation &lt;0.022).

Single-layer and five-layer WLAM experiments are conducted to validate the accuracy of the simulation. The simulation results agree with the experimental results.

  abstract     = {Natural bone substituting materials derived from living organisms have been utilized to treat bone malfunctioning. However, limited sources and immune issues have led to the use of artificial scaffolds consisting of biocompatible materials. Additionally, a functionally graded porous structure has been acknowledged as an alternative to overcome reduced mechanical properties by pores and alleviate stress shielding effect. In this study, a two-body combination achieved through a densification process, in which recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) and tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH) can be simultaneously released for efficient bone regeneration, is proposed. Biomimetic titanium scaffolds (BTSs), which possess significantly different pore characteristics, are successfully fabricated. The mechanical properties of these parts are proven to be applicable as bone substitutes. The release of rhBMP-2 and TCH from the BTSs is prolonged compared to that of homogenous porous titanium scaffolds (PTSs). The prolonged release of rhBMP-2 from the BTS results in a sustained degree of pre-osteoblast differentiation. The antimicrobial properties of these scaffolds are verified using pathogens. Furthermore, various structures exhibiting different pore characteristics are obtained by mechanical interlocking between components. This study demonstrates that the novel assembled platform as customizable Lego-like building blocks, with its tunable mechanical and multi-biomolecule release properties, is promising for bone tissue engineering.},

Zirconia (ZrO 2 ) nanoparticles were used as a carrier to load separately self-healing agent, polyethyleneimine (PEI), and corrosion inhibitor, imidazole (IM). The loaded ZrO 2 nanoparticles with IM and PEI were doped into the epoxy matrix and applied on polished steel substrate to form pre and top layers of nanocomposite coatings, respectively. TEM analysis confirms the almost globular morphology of the zirconia nanoparticles with a particle size of 15–25 nm. The chemical bonding interactions among various species were confirmed through FTIR. The synergistic effect of self-healing agent and corrosion inhibitor in epoxy-based double-layer nanocomposite coatings demonstrated the pH and time dependence release of inhibitor and self-healing agent. A comparative EIS analysis conducted in 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution reveals that epoxy-based double-layer nanocomposite coatings demonstrate improved corrosion resistance performance as compared to the blank epoxy and single layer epoxy reinforced coatings. This enhanced corrosion resistance of epoxy-based double-layer nanocomposite coatings can be ascribed to the efficient release of loaded IM and PEI in response to the external stimuli and can be potentially considered to circumvent corrosion in oil &amp; gas and marine applications.},

In this work, we numerically investigate the suitability of three topologically very different architected materials for long bone implants: the octet truss-based lattice, the Schwartz P minimal surface-based lattice and the spinodal stochastic surface-based lattice. Each implant topology (reinforcement) and its surrounding tissue (soft matrix) are modeled as a composite system via finite element analysis. Performance metrics are defined based on the Young’s modulus, the peak stress under service conditions, the interfacial surface area per unit volume and the relative bone growth rate (estimated based on the strain transferred to the soft matrix). We show that surface-based topologies are less prone to fatigue failure and may promote superior bone growth than conventional truss-based designs. Spinodal surface-based architected materials have the best performance, and can be fabricated via self-assembly approaches followed by material conversion, potentially allowing scalable fabrication of implants with unit cell sizes at the micro-scale, thus dramatically amplifying surface area per unit volume and bone growth efficiency.},

The low-velocity impact response of the origami-inspired honeycomb sandwich was investigated experimentally and numerically. And the numerical prediction closely matched the experimental results in terms of contact-force histories and permanent deformations of sandwich plates. The influence of structural parameters on the energy absorption characteristics has been analyzed by using the improved finite element model.

  abstract     = {Thermomechanically active shape-programmable elastomer microparticles are very promising for development of particulate composites with unique operational properties, which could be attractive for various applications, e.g., in 3D printing. Liquid crystal elastomers are one of the suitable candidate materials due to their remarkable spontaneous shape change response. Performed rheological and thermomechanical tests demonstrate that shear stress can be used to efficiently manipulate the nematic order-driven morphology of liquid crystal elastomer microparticles (μLCEs). Specifically, by exploiting the soft-elasticity character of the material through manipulation of shear amplitude time profile, the nematic director can be oriented along the flow, which results in alignment of microparticles. Using this method, a suspension of well-aligned, thermomechanically elongated monodomain μLCEs can be created by shear stress-assisted cooling. Although the alignment can be lost in absence of persistent flow, it is restored instantaneously on re-application of the flow. The reason for this is the preservation of particle elongation at room temperature in zero flow. This shape memory can be erased by heating the system to the isotropic phase. Our work represents an important step forward in the development of a new generation of shape-programmable materials, which are potentially suitable for additive manufacturing of artefacts with anisotropic physical properties.},

However, whether Zn metallic implants attenuate bone tunnel enlargement (BTE) after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and, if so, the underlying mechanism by which this occurs remains elusive. In present study, we explored the possibility of using pure Zn screws to attenuate BTE in rabbits, and the potential molecular mechanism was further explored in primary osteoblasts. Here, our study showed that the pure Zn screws more effectively attenuated BTE after ACL reconstruction in rabbits compared with pure Mg and Ti screws. This was attributed to the fact that the pure Zn screw-released Zn element diminished the size of the femoral tunnels, enhanced the bone mass around the screws, boosted the fixation strength, and promoted the tendon-bone integration. Several lines of cellular evidences suggested that Zn metallic implant-released Zn element induced upregulation of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 in primary osteoblasts and ultimately elevated the expressions of the osteogenic transcription factors to trigger osteogenic differentiation. This study showed that biodegradable Zn metallic materials were promising candidates for interference screw to attenuate BTE after ACL reconstruction.},

In this study, a 3D printed Cu-bearing Ti6Al4V (TC4) alloy with micro/nano-topographical was employed as material model to explore the role played by Cu 2+ and nanostructure in the physical–chemical properties of the material, osteoblast toxicity. The role of Cu 2+ and nanostructure on macrophage proliferation, polarization and oxidative stress without and with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation was also evaluated. Surface characterizations showed TNT significantly increased the roughness and surface hydrophilicity of TC4 alloy. TNT-TC4-5Cu exhibited excellent corrosion properties in the absence and presence of LPS. The in vitro tests with MC3T3-E1 cells demonstrated that the TNT-TC4-5Cu alloys showed the better cytocompatibility. Moreover, TNT-TC4-5Cu alloy can inhibit macrophage polarization and decreased ROS generation without and with LPS stimulation, thereby promoting the biocompatibility. In summary, the TNT-TC4-5Cu alloy promoted the proliferation and adhesion of osteoblasts and inhibited the inflammatory response of macrophages, which has great potential to benefit the future development of orthopedic applications.},

  abstract     = {The control of tungsten carbide (WC) grain coarsening using coarsening inhibitors is considered to be one of the most important advancements for hard metals, leading to metal cutting tools with increased performance. Until now, however, the grain coarsening inhibition mechanism for effective inhibitors such as V has been elusive, posing an obstacle to material optimization. This study serves to quantify the presence of nanoscale V-W-C over a wide range of V/Co ratios by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). The experiments help to delineate how additions of V affect the nanostructure during sintering and result in smaller WC grains. In contrast to the common view that grain coarsening inhibition originates from the presence of stable nanoscale (V,W)C x complexions formed at the WC/Co interfaces, we show that V segregates at the WC/Co interfaces already upon a minor addition of V and brings significant coarsening inhibition. Increasing additions of V result in the formation of (V,W)C x complexions; and above 0.76 wt\% V addition, where the coverage on WC grains is complete, no further reduction in average grain size is observed. Mechanistic modelling of grain coarsening reveals that grain coarsening inhibition is governed by the reduction of interface mobilities and total driving force for coarsening.},

Most defects of the continuous line scans had spherical morphologies, whereas non-spherical defects formed in the porous structure produced with discontinuous spot scans because of the availability of sufficient heat for melting the powder. The microstructures were composed of an α -titanium matrix, martensitic α′ phases, and elongated FeTi 4 phases on the grain boundaries. Furthermore, the atom probe tomography results showed that the FeTi 4 phase had a network structure with a diameter of 5 nm after the continuous line scan, which enhanced the compressive strength. The compressive strength and elastic modulus of the porous structures produced with the continuous line scan were more than 400 MPa and 11 GPa, respectively.

  abstract     = {Nickel-based alloys are extensively used in a wide range of extreme environments because of their exceptional mechanical properties. The excellent strength of these alloys is derived from the addition of long-range ordered precipitates, introduced by thermal aging. The interactions between the dislocations and LRO precipitates dictate the deformation modes and plastic response in these alloys. While the majority of studies have focused on L1 2 -structured precipitate-strengthened Ni-based alloys, less work has considered the Ni-based alloys containing Pt 2 Mo-structured, Ni 2 (Cr,Mo)-typed precipitates. In these alloys, Pt 2 Mo-structured precipitates enable room-temperature deformation twinning in addition to slip, which increases strain hardenability measured from bulk mechanical testing. Although previous geometric-based model suggested that deformation twinning is favored over slip, the factors that influence the activation between twinning versus slip have not been thoroughly explored in this class of Ni-based alloys. In this work, molecular dynamics examined the possible types of dislocation and Pt 2 Mo-structured precipitate interactions at low temperature. Combined with in situ micromechanical testing, the role of resolved shear stresses on dislocation partials were shown to directly influence the activation of slip versus twinning. Additionally, using an energy-based approach, molecular dynamics results demonstrated a novel twin formation process, caused by the dislocation interaction with the Pt 2 Mo-structured precipitates.},

Since hydrogel shows a positive volume change when absorbing water, it provides a new design strategy for actively deformed origami metamaterials composed of normal material framework and active hydrogel layer. In this paper, we proposed three synergistic mechanical designs with positive/negative/zero tunable swelling deformation by adjusting the opening direction of the circular holes. The deformation behaviors of the origami metamaterials manufactured by a multi-material 3D printer were qualitatively and quantitatively characterized and demonstrated, using finite element analysis, experimental test and theoretical method. The results indicate that the origami metamaterials present significant tunable swelling behaviors, which can be customized by adjusting the lattice microstructure geometry parameters. Utilizing the origami metamaterials, cylindrical shell and box structures with tunable swelling behavior were designed. Additionally, the hydrogel-driven actuator based on the origami metamaterials was manufactured to pull/drag an underwater object. Since the tunable swelling behaviors are not related to scale, these hydrogel-driven origami metamaterials can be applied to the design of reconfigurable and programmable devices on the macro and micro scale and possess promising potential for wide applications in bioelectronics and biological tissue engineering.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies offer novel opportunities for processing difficult to cast refractory materials. Electron beam melting (EBM) AM is particularly attractive as the rapidly moving electron beam can be utilized to heat the powder bed which mitigates against some process induced cracking mechanisms. A great deal of prior work has been done to investigate laser based processing of molybdenum but little EBM focused work currently exists. In this work we investigate EBM processed molybdenum and observe sharp 0 0 1 , 1 1 1 001,111 , and mixed 0 0 1 001 &amp; 1 1 1 111 crystallographic fibers in the build direction. The apparent preference between these build direction fibers is dependent on the imposed energy density and this is likely explained by the weld pool shape. Detailed microscopy reveals that the observed columnar grains consist of much finer equiaxed low angle boundary subgrains suggesting large process induced stresses leading to appreciable plastic deformation. The implications resulting from this work are that molybdenum may be processed crack-free via EBM AM and that fiber-switching may be controlled, and exploited, towards fabricating components with optimized performance.},

  abstract     = {Bimetallic structures processed via laser-based additive manufacturing (AM) efficiently combine multiple materials in single components, which are difficult to achieve using traditional methods. However, limited understanding exists on how processing parameters influence the resulting microstructures and thermal profiles of base material during processing, affecting component performance. To this end, we present a combined numerical and experimental study on the effects of input laser power and scanning speed on the heat-affected-zone (HAZ) and fusion-zone (FZ) of a tantalum-titanium bimetallic structure, two compatible materials that are challenging to process traditionally and are desirable in a bimetallic system. We demonstrate that a wide array of track characteristics can be achieved by varying the laser power and scanning speed. The HAZ and FZ microstructures&#39; width and depth within the underlying Ti6Al4V substrate can be estimated within 6–19\% of the experimentally determined values using a 3D transient-thermal finite element analysis (FEA) model, with the most significant errors occurring at low scanning speeds. Adjusting the absorptivity input to the model improves prediction to within 1–11\% difference of the HAZ/FZ dimensions and corresponding temperatures relative to the experimental dimensions across a broad range of laser power and scanning speeds. Our results indicate that the underlying temperatures achieved in bimetallic components can be predicted accurately using a detailed FEA approach, aiding larger-scale approaches towards improved process modeling and manufacturing of bimetallic structures using laser-based AM.},

Localised fluctuations of residual stress in the length scale, between 500 and 600 µm, coincides well with the morphological variations of the solidification microstructure that formed during direct energy deposition.

  abstract     = {During laser beam deep penetration welding, the characteristic keyhole occurs that enables efficient energy absorption due to multiple reflections. Since this welding mode usually shows high dynamic behaviour, often a high amount of weld imperfections like spattering or porosity occur. Elongated keyholes during buttonhole, a.k.a donut welding, have shown the possibility to create smooth welding tracks when controlled variations of energy input were induced, e.g. beam oscillation. It was observed that the elongated keyholes can maintain themselves due to the balancing effects of the melt pool surface tension, which can form a catenoid shape that does not require any additional forces to be stable. Basic theoretical descriptions of the catenoid shape keyholes were derived. However, the complex system requires a more detailed investigation of the effect of the metal plume and the melt flows in order to explain the opening and maintenance effects of the elongated keyholes. Therefore, this work examined different modes of elongated keyholes, comparing traditional non-oscillating keyholes to keyholes formed by different beam scanning strategies. Analysis was made mainly by observations with high-speed-imaging and theoretical considerations to explain the phenomena of elongated keyholes. The observations showed that extended keyholes are not necessarily related to a reduced occurrence of imperfections and not either to the formation of perfect catenoid shapes. The keyhole front is deformed where the laser beam impacts and the rear wall is impacted where the vapour plume strikes. The opening of an elongated keyhole is likely related to the keyhole vapour plume that pushes the keyhole rear wall rearwards, while the non-affected rear wall parts do not collapse the keyhole due to the balancing nature of the second curvature of the rear wall.},

This study was conducted to investigate the fabrication of Cu pillars through a high-speed electrodeposition method and their adhesion to an Ajinomoto build-up film (ABF). The morphological, crystallographic, electrical, and mechanical characteristics of the Cu pillars electroplated with various current densities ( j = 2, 5, 7.5, and 10 A/dm 2 ) were systematically investigated through a scanning electron microscope (SEM) combined with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis system, field-emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM), an ohm meter, and a nanoindenter. Additionally, the adhesion of the Cu pillars to an ABF substrate after high-temperature storage was evaluated via a shear test. Finally, a finite element analysis (FEA) method (COMSOL-Multiphysics) was employed to simulate the current density and electrolyte distributions in a via structure upon high-speed Cu electrodeposition to characterize the morphological/crystallographic/mechanical transitions induced by increasing j . This valuable information advances our understanding of electrochemical metal deposition and would be helpful in the development of high-speed Cu electrodeposition technology.},

  abstract     = {Vapor condensation and condensate collection play a crucial role in solar water desalination, which is a promising solution to the shortage of freshwater. However, the currently used condensers based on thermal conduction and/or convection cooling are limited in cooling power for vapor condensation, whilst their surface wettability requires appropriate modulation to facilitate condensate collection. In this work, we achieve efficient water collection via using a wettability and spectral selectivity engineered coating comprising hydrophobic SiO 2 and hydrophilic TiO 2 nanospheres at an optimized weight ratio. The tuning of surface wettability promotes a dropwise collection mode, leading to maximized droplet harvesting performance of 1047 mg·cm −2 ·h −1 . Further, the coating can spontaneously cool itself by reflecting ~90\% of the incident sunlight whilst emitting &gt;95\% of thermal infrared rays, leads to a daytime sub-ambient temperature drop of 7 °C. Hence, under an ultra-humid condition that mimics a solar water-purification system, the coating that integrates daytime radiative cooling with dropwise collection demonstrates an excellent water production rate, which is superior to those of the hydrophilic surface and the surface with restricted radiative cooling access to the sky. Moreover, the coating comprising TiO 2 photocatalyst can recover its wettability through the photocatalytic degradation of adsorbed oily dirt pollutants.},

However, the metallic surface is susceptible to passive film formation to reduce the dissolution rate of HX under low current density conditions during the ECM process. This study focused on optimising microstructures for SLM-fabricated HX via heat treatment to enhance its electrochemical dissolution behaviour. The rates of electrochemical dissolution with different heat treatments increased in the following order: as-received &lt; solution treatment (ST) &lt; ageing treatment (AT) &lt; solution and ageing treatment (ST + AT) in a 10 wt\% NaNO 3 solution at 35 °C. These results are attributed to 1) a large number of two representative precipitates (Fe 2 Mo and M 23 C 6 ) in the grain or on the grain boundary (GB), 2) the decreased low-angle GB density (1.71\%) and 3) few compact products on the surface of the samples with ST + AT. The parameter I , which is related to surface product composition, was quantitatively characterised based on the electrochemical dissolution rate of the samples. The enhanced mechanism of electrochemical dissolution is proposed to offer new insights into Ni-based superalloys in ECM applications.},

Herein, we fabricated a superhydrophobic film composed of hierarchical Cu cone-flowers via facile one-step pulse electrodeposition with a 30\% duty cycle for 20 min. Based on this film, the relationship between roughness/volume parameters and hydrophobicity was well studied. The resulting cone-flower film exhibits excellent corrosion resistance and self-cleaning properties due to a high water contact angle (WCA) of ~160° and a low sliding angle (SA) of ~3°. The large roughness skewness (Rsk = 0.7–1.3) and void volume ratio (Vvc/Vmc &gt; 1.5) are shown to be more desirable to achieve superhydrophobic surfaces. Moreover, a new hydrophobic model is proposed to explain the above results, which means that the nanoscale air cushions share most of the gravity of water droplets to help microscale air cushions closer to the Cassie state. Further experiments by adding or destroying the nanostructures to observe the change of hydrophobicity well verified our conjecture.},

Through appropriate annealing treatment, the amount of both, non-bonded interfaces and work hardening promoted dislocations during CS can be significantly reduced. Consequently, the annealed samples exhibit higher strength and fracture strain than the as-deposited ones. Cu was selected as a reliable material for CS. To correlate Cu deposit strength with primary process parameters and material properties, the Cu powder strength was assessed. Crack characterization of Cu deposits was performed by in-situ microscopic observations during tensile testing. The direct observation of crack initiation, growth and final fracture allows revealing failure mechanisms. The in-situ tests allow distinguishing the effects of reduced initial defect sizes due to annealing and improved ductility in the vicinity of initial defects on possible crack growth and part failure. Considering the necessary compromise between strength, uniform elongation, ductility and microhardness, a post-spraying annealing process is desirable for CSed Cu deposits. The identification of macroscopic and micro-mechanical properties attained under respective process parameters and influences of annealing processes therefore allow identifying solutions for improvements of CSed deposits for load-carrying applications, which is a prerequisite for using CS as additive manufacturing technique.},

The microstructure and magnetocaloric properties of the microwires were systematically investigated. The microwires possess tunable Curie temperatures, i.e. 81–108 K, above the typical rare-earth (RE) containing HE-MG reports. The high Curie temperatures are attributed to the designed composition. Magnetocaloric response peak values of Fe-containing GdTbCoAl alloy microwires range 7.6–8.9 J kg −1 K −1 (5 T), which are comparable to those of many outstanding RE-containing magnetocaloric HE-MGs. The characteristics of the melt-extraction method, combining with compositional effects, favor the formation of amorphous and nanocrystalline phases. The increase in the cooling efficiency for microwires with higher Fe content can be attributed to the broadening of the Curie temperature distribution induced by the composition difference between nanocrystalline phase and amorphous matrix. The designed composition and the melt-extraction processing approach for Fe-containing GdTbCoAl alloys can tune their Curie temperatures towards a temperature range of natural gas liquefaction and improve their magnetocaloric properties.

  abstract     = {Herein, we investigated the fracture behavior of thermally aged Ag–Cu composite sinter joints through nano-X-ray computed tomography (nano-CT) combined with microscale tensile testing. Nano-CT results showed that the joint comprised Ag/oxidized Cu flake sintered layer and Cu oxide, which was formed on the Cu substrate; further, pores were present at the interface between the substrate and Cu oxide layer. The tensile test showed that the stress increased with plastic deformation up to a maximum of 308 MPa, before a subsequent steep decrease due to crack initiation inside the sintered layer. The nano-CT and in situ observation results suggest that the microscale joint fractured through the interface between the oxidized Cu flake and Ag. Results obtained herein suggest that microscale tensile testing coupled with nano-CT is an effective approach to describe the intrinsic fracture behavior of joints.},

The aim of this study was to prepare a genipin/hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex thermosensitive hydrogel system (genipin-THS) and evaluate its antidepressant effects. The genipin-THS was constructed using the cold method and was further optimized based on the results of gelation temperature and in vitro drug release. In the in vivo experiment, the genipin-THS significantly reduced the immobility time of mice displaying behavioral despair, decreased the ptosis score and increased the change in the body temperature of mice induced by reserpine, and improved abnormal levels of neurotransmitters (including 5-hydroxytryptamine and norepinephrine) in brain. In addition, the intranasally administered genipin-THS increased the bioavailability of the drug in the hippocampus, and the fluorescence distribution also showed that the thermosensitive hydrogel continuously released the drug for a longer time. In summary, the intranasally administered genipin-THS improved the bioavailability of genipin in the brain, increased its brain targeting, and further enhanced its antidepressant effects on depressive disorder.},

Two different failure modes, namely the Impact Side Dominated (ISD) and Impact-/Non-impact Side (INIS), were found to have relation with the braiding angle and localized temperature rise. The hybrid effect can not only prevent resin fragmentation in the triangle region at the lateral side and the diamond region at the non-impact side, but also inhibit the CFRP damage development at the lateral and non-impact side. In small-angle braided tube, the impact-side rebound trend of CFRP layer leads to mismatch at the CFRP-Al interface, which results in opening delamination. In large-angle braided tube, the non-impact-side damage plays an important role in further load-bearing capacity. Apart from the structure effect, temperature rise has an effect on composite damage mode by degrading the localized matrix stiffness.},

Alloys containing 3\% and 6\% Ni exhibited almost fully ferritic matrix microstructures and a weak age hardening response. Alloys containing 9\%, 12\%, and 15\% Ni, on the other hand, developed primarily martensitic microstructures . Differential scanning calorimetry measurements indicated the occurrence of an exothermic reaction in the approximate temperature range 375–625 °C. Dilatometry measurements indicated that the exothermic reaction was accompanied by a net contraction. Hardness measurements after aging for 5 min indicated significant hardening of alloys already at 350 °C due to the formation of B2-(Ni,Fe)Al intermetallic precipitates. The age hardening response was significantly superior to that of conventional precipitation-hardenable martensitic stainless steels . Tensile elongation in the aged condition was negatively influenced by the presence of soft ferrite regions. Processing conditions associated with a fully martensitic microstructure prior to aging are required to render a uniform age hardening response. Guidelines for the development of a new family of lightweight precipitation-hardenable steels with lower raw material costs and a higher corrosion resistance compared to the standard 18Ni maraging steels are provided.},

The novelty is that an adaptive fiber shaking module is developed on the basis of Delaunay triangulation and combined with the proposed algorithm. The adaptability is to realize coordination between the parameters of fiber volume fraction and fiber spacing, in order to overcome the jamming limit and eliminate the unreasonable resin-rich zone that may appear at the boundary of the microstructures. The maximum fiber volume fraction reached is 67.43\%. Statistical analysis is conducted on the generated microstructures, and there is a good agreement by comparing it with the statistical results of random sequential expansion algorithm and completely spatial random pattern. Finite element analysis is also performed to predict the elastic properties of the generated microstructures. It shows that a maximum absolute error is only 7.354\% in elastic property by comparing with the experimental and simulation results in literatures. The proposed algorithm contributes to the further researches on the strength and micro-damage evolution of carbon fiber reinforced plastic.},

The theoretical investigation, multiscale simulation, and experimentation show that the thermo-mechanical properties of nano-architected kirigami metamaterials can be tuned by altering geometrical parameters and introducing the hierarchical cutting patterns. Additionally, the thermal conductivity of kirigami-inspired graphene and carbon nanotube metamaterials can be regulated by an external mechanical tension. We develop closed-form formulations for predicting the mechanical behavior of kirigami graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes. Molecular dynamics and finite element simulations are conducted to evaluate theoretical predictions. By analyzing and comparing the results from atomistic and continuum-based simulations, the effect of length scale on the thermo-mechanical properties is explored. We realize that the stress–strain response, thermal conductivity, and buckling-induced 3D patterns of nano-architected graphenes can be programmed by utilizing kirigami building blocks, nano-architectural hierarchy, and heterogeneous material design.},

A physical model was developed to describe the viscoelastic-plastic deformation of PBXs. The plastic part was added on the basis of the viscoelastic statistical crack mechanical model (Visco-SCRAM) model, and the compaction behavior of charge in different environments was characterized based on the Heckel compaction equation. The model was implemented in LS-DYNA, and the simulation results were verified by the experiments. The dynamic mechanical behavior of PBXs under different excitation by deceleration was studied from the macroscopic and mesoscale aspects. The stress curves, strain curves, the density change and the interaction between particles in deceleration environment were predicted. After comparison and analysis, the dynamic response law of the charge in the penetrating process was obtained. Macroscopic responses along with mesoscale modeling results are significantly important to have a better understanding of deformation mechanisms of PBXs.},

In comparison with the commonly adopted square honeycomb, Miura-ori, and eggbox sandwiches, the average compressive stress of the new sandwich was respectively increased by 73\%, 342\%, and 130\%.

Micron scale long rectangular single-, double-, and triple- punch molding was conducted on polycrystalline Cu with varying grain sizes. Mechanical size effects were observed regarding the compression pressure and the material flow to fill the gaps between neighboring punches. The nominal compression pressure depended significantly on the punch width in single-punch molding and on the spacing between neighboring punches in double-punch molding. Analysis of double- and triple- punch molding data showed that both the punch geometry and the grain size of the molded Cu influence the Cu gap filling behavior in significant ways. Detailed microstructural examinations of molded Cu features were carried out to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

Both unreinforced polymer blends and glass fibre-reinforced composites were studied; physical insights into the polymer structure and properties were obtained through complementary spectroscopic analysis, thermal analysis and microscopy. Spectroscopic analysis revealed the formation of multi-component mixtures in the blends, containing both CDCl 3 -soluble and -insoluble constituents, with the latter likely corresponding to a reacted acrylic/PPE species. These findings show that incorporating reactive PPE into a reactive acrylic resin to produce a hybrid-matrix system is a simple, yet effective strategy towards enhancing solvent resistance (mass retention: 98\% – PPE-modified; 72\% – unmodified), while simultaneously enhancing the glass transition temperature (+9\%) in acrylic-matrix composites.},

  abstract     = {The bioprosthetic heart valve (BHV) has attracted considerable attention in clinical practice. However, complications of the BHV such as thrombosis, calcification, and early deterioration after implantation have limited further applications. In the present study, we provide a strategy to fabricate an anti-biofouling BHV by constructing interpenetrating polymer network structures on both inner and outer valve materials. We systematically investigated the morphologies, wetting properties, elemental compositions, stability of the extracellular matrix, transparency, mechanical properties, and anti-biofouling properties (e.g., anti-cell adhesion, resistance to bovine serum albumin protein adsorption, anticoagulant properties, and anti-calcification properties) of the modified BHV via both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Compared to the BHV without coating treatment, treated with heparin, or treated with a hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane coating, the BHV treated with a hydrophilic coating containing both polyacrylic acid and polydimethylsiloxane exhibited better multifarious anti-biofouling properties. Our findings provide a method for the preparation of multi-antifouling medical materials with better synergistic hemocompatibility and anti-calcification.},

In the liver and spleen, GO led to alterations in immune components at different time points. GO exposure showed an effect on the populations of different types of hepatic macrophages. In the liver, the populations of macrophages mainly affected by GO including Kupffer cells and monocyte-derived macrophages. Stimulated hepatic inflammation led to the infiltration of platelets from the circulation into the liver and decreased peripheral platelets population at day 1. Interestingly, a decreased platelet population was observed on day 7 in the spleen. GO also led to accelerated hematopoiesis in the spleen. Therefore, the possible forced generation of more platelets and the release of mature platelets from the spleen contributed to the increased circulating platelet count on day 7. Therefore, although GO showed a low potential to induce severe inflammation in the liver and spleen, it disrupted hematopoiesis in the spleen, which contributed to fluctuations in circulating platelet counts. The interaction of GO with the immune system warrants comprehensive study for gaining better understanding.},

The antifungal test against two fungi ( G. trabeum , C. versicolor ) demonstrated that the Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) of Forsythia @CQDs was about 1\% of the MIC of Forsythia suspense extract. The weight loss rate of wood samples treated by Forsythia @CQDs was as low as 1 (±0.5)\%. The antifungal property was equivalent to that of the traditional chemical preservative Ammoniacal Copper Quats (ACQ). The leachability test results of wood preservatives showed that Forsythia @CQDs had a higher fixation rate in wood than Forsythia , and even exceeded ACQ preservatives. Also, its easily-detectable fluorescence effect could track the distribution of preservatives in the wood.

Traditionally, the two wicks are manufactured separately and subsequently joined, thereby creating an interface that reduces the liquid transfer efficiency. In order to overcome this situation, a gradient porous wick is proposed and successfully manufactured through the freeze-casting method in a single operation. The influence of two different dispersant agents, KD4® and stearic acid was studied on the processing parameters, final pore size and morphology, and capillarity performances. A variate of gradient porosity was obtained by applying a diverse thermal gradient and solidification front velocity during directional solidification. The rheological characterisation of the camphene-based NiO suspensions was performed using a rotational viscometer . The final pore size and morphology were characterised by Optical Microscopy, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy , and X-ray computed tomography. The use of stearic acid improves the particle stabilisation and generates pore enlargement with an equiaxed pore structure , while commercial dispersant KD4® shows a dendritic pore morphology at lower thermal gradient.},

For bicrystal model, Goss and Cube grains are not the best ones for relieving stress concentration caused by their orientations, but they are the best ones for relieving grain boundary (GB) stress concentration. To this end, the dependence relations are discussed between GB stress and an advanced comprehensive factor combining SF, and geometry compatibility factor for 5 independent slip systems. It is found that this proposed comprehensive factor considering the contribution from 5 to independent slip systems effectively improves its dependence on GB stress.},

This study proposes to trigger supramolecular self-assembly during the process by a gemini imidazolium-based low-molecular-weight gelator, allowing printing of certain monomers. The as-printed hydrogel structures were supported by a gelator network immobilising monomer:water solutions. A thixotropic hydrogel was formed with a recovery time of &lt;50 s, storage modulus = 8.1 kPa and yield stress = 18 Pa, processable using material extrusion 3D printing. Material extrusion 3D printed objects are usually highly anisotropic, but in this case the gelator network improved the isotropy by subverting the usual layer-by-layer curing strategy. The monomer in all printed layers was cured simultaneously during post-processing to form a continuous polymeric network. The two networks then physically interpenetrate to enhance mechanical performance. The double network hydrogels fabricated with layers cured simultaneously showed 62–147\% increases in tensile properties compared to layer-by-layer cured hydrogels. The results demonstrated excellent inter- and intra-layered coalescence. Consequently, the tensile properties of 3D printed hydrogels were close to mould cast objects. This study has demonstrated the benefits of using gelators to expand the variety of 3D printable monomers and shown improved isotropy to offer excellent mechanical performances.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing by near-field electrospinning is based on the continuous deposition of a nanofiber on a substrate. Owing to the small fiber size and the high jet speeds that can be achieved, this method potentially combines submicrometer resolution with high printing speed. Printing with high fidelity depends critically on controlling the jet arrival speed, which must be matched to the printing speed. Unfortunately, current methods to determine the jet speed are cumbersome and cannot be performed in situ as they are based on laborious high-resolution imaging of individual nanofibers. Using inexpensive optical equipment, here we demonstrate a new way to determine the jet speed in situ during printing. Our strategy is based on electrostatic jet deflection, in which the speed is readily computed from the width of a printed object made from a periodically printed motif. Such width can be easily obtained inline by optical inspection, overcoming the need to resolve individual nanofibers. This information can be used to feedback control the printing process. The proposed approach will not only assist in studying the fundamental relation between the jet speed and other printing parameters, but also enable reproducible printing of fibers in a rapidly expanding area of applications.},

The self-propagating high-temperature reaction occurring in reactive Ni/Al multilayers after ignition represents an ultrafast heat source which is used for the transformation of a thin films Al/CoFe/CrNi multilayer structure into a single-phase high entropy alloy film. The materials design of the combined multilayers thus determines the phase formation. Conventional rapid thermal annealing transforms the multilayer into a film with multiple equilibrium phases. Ultrafast combustion synthesis produces films with ultrafine-grained single-phase B2-ordered compound alloy. The heating rates during the combustion synthesis are in the order of one million K/s, much higher than those of the rapid thermal annealing, which is about 7 K/s. The results are compared with differential scanning calorimetry experiments with heating rates ranging from about 100 K/s up to 25000 K/s. It is shown that the heating rate clearly determines the phase formation in the multilayers. The rapid kinetics of the combustion prevents long-range diffusion and promotes the run-away transformation. Thus, multilayer combustion synthesis using reactive Ni/Al multilayers as heat source represents a new pathway for the fabrication of single phase high-entropy alloy films.},

It has received extensive attention and been used in the modern engineering design process. However, the original CO is low optimization accuracy and efficiency for the design of high-dimensional nonlinearity systems because of the involved compatibility constraints. To solve this problem, an enhanced CO method based on the adaptive surrogate model is proposed in this study. The strategy of the proposed method includes the following steps. Firstly, the traditional surrogate models of system objective and performance function are constructed by the Latin hypercube sampling and the Kriging method. Then, the expected improvement function and the self-cycling optimization strategy are utilized to modify the traditional surrogate models into the corresponding adaptive surrogate models. Finally, the original objective and constraints at the system level and disciplinary level are replaced by their adaptive surrogate models, respectively. Consequently, the formulation of CO based on the adaptive surrogate model can be obtained. In the proposed method, the accuracy of the non-linear region of the response surface can be enhanced efficiently. An engineering structure design problem is introduced to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Trans-micrometric particles of hafnium nitride (average size 1 µm) could be dispersed better than the other three nitrides (average size between 8 and 10 µm), but the chemical analysis confirmed that the former, due to the higher surface area, are more prone to spontaneous oxidation in air. After deposition, the surface of the various coatings contained between 40\% (silicon nitride) and 90\% (hafnium nitride) of exposed ceramic particles. All composite materials showed antibacterial effects when compared to standard polymethylmethacrylate, with hafnium nitride being the most effective against E. coli and aluminum nitride against S. epidermidis . It has been postulated that while Si 3 N 4 long-term antibacterial effects are granted by the constant dissolution of the SiO 2 surface layer, zirconium and hafnium composites are effective because they possess antibacterial properties both in their nitride and oxide forms.},

However, the grains of the LPBF-processed AZ91D Mg-Al alloys could be coarse. The grains might undergo columnar growth, which is less resistant to hot tearing than equiaxed growth. Refining the microstructure by manipulating the processing parameters requires extensive experimental work. In this study, we used SiCnp-decorated AZ91D powder to additively manufacture AZ91D-SiCnp composites. The nanoparticles react with the melt, ensuring a high density of nucleation sites. The nanoparticles at the solid–liquid interface significantly blocked the diffusion of Al solute atoms, leading to solute enrichment at the interface. The remaining melt undercooled to a greater extent comparing with the nanoparticle-free melt, thus more potential nucleus were activated. As a result, columnar-to-equiaxed transition of the grains&#39; growth has been achieved and the grains&#39; size has reduced significantly by assembling SiCnp onto the feedstock AZ91D powder. In conclusion, AZ91D-SiCnp composites with desirable microstructure and mechanical properties have been successfully manufactured by LPBF.},

  abstract     = {As displaying many advantages including high specific strength, light weight, energy absorption, etc., porous structures have been widely used in aerospace, medical science, engineering and other fields. In this paper, an adaptive anisotropic porous modeling method is proposed for improving the mechanical performance of 2.5D mechanical parts whilst minimizing weight and maximizing product benefits. The method relies on the Anisotropic Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (ACVTs) by offsetting closed B-spline curves. To enhance adaptability to a given parts, the finite element analysis (FEA) results of stress field is combined with stress-based weighted random sampling strategy to generate ACVTs according to Riemannian metric. A skin frame is established to improve geometrical quality of porous structure and ACVTs is tailored to be adaptive for concave and Non-zero genus. Besides, a parametric model between the stress tensor distribution and the relative density field is formulated, allowing the size, the distribution and the shape of pores to be controlled by stress mapping. Both the FEA results and the experimental data show that the adaptive anisotropic structures have significant advantages in mechanical properties, topological consistency and connectivity. Additionally, an example of wrench is provided to prove the great potential of the adaptive anisotropic structures in engineering applications.},

Although electrospun piezoelectric PVDF-based nanofibers have been extensively studied for application in wearable devices , they do not have sufficient flexibility and strength for practical application. Therefore, in this study, the effects of various experimental parameters, such as MWCNT content and fiber orientation , on the mechanical and piezoelectric properties of PVDF nanofibers were investigated in depth. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that the average diameter of the PVDF nanofibers decreased with an increase in degree of orientation, while transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed the uniform dispersion of MWCNTs in the PVDF nanofibers. The PVDF nanofibers containing 0.008 wt\% MWCNTs exhibited an excellent tensile strength . Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis revealed that the β-phase fraction increased with increasing MWCNT content. The thermal stability of the nanofibers increased with an increase in β-phase fraction, as evidenced by the increase in melting and initial decomposition temperatures and decrease in weight loss determined by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis .},

  abstract     = {Elastocaloric cooling technology has obtained huge attraction over vapor compression systems because it is more efficient with negligible environmental impact. The elastocaloric effect (eCE) is generally concerned with superelasticity and latent heat of shape memory alloys (SMAs), related to the martensitic transformation (MT) under uniaxial loading/unloading. There are various small-scale applications such as microelectromechanical systems, medical devices and lab-on-chip systems, where active local cooling with precise temperature control is essential for their proper functioning. To explore potential eCE for miniaturized active refrigeration, reduced dimensions SMAs (i.e. thin films, microwires, ribbons and foams) may be attractive for micro cooling devices by providing a large surface to volume ratio and thus high heat transfer capacity, low thermal hysteresis and high working frequency. Therefore, the eCE properties of the state-of-the-art reduced dimensions elastocaloric materials (eCMs) are thoroughly reviewed and comparatively discussed with their bulk counterparts. The most appropriate eCMs for miniaturized eCE refrigeration are revealed on the basis of large adiabatic temperature change (△ T ad ), low stress hysteresis (△ σ hys ), high cyclic stability and large coefficient of performance of material ( COP mat ). The challenges and recent achievements for micro cooling eCE devices/prototypes based on small-sized eCMs are summarized.},

Here we present a facile method that could tailor and strengthen the pore structure of carbon nanotube (CNT) foams to obtain highly effective and reliable EMI absorbers that maintain their superior EMI effectiveness under heavy mechanical deformation and extremely high temperature. The hierarchical macro-to-micro pore structure and properties of CNT foam were tailored in a wide range via a secondary chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. Benefiting from the multi-level reflection in hierarchical pore structures, the optimized CNT foam presents a high shielding efficiency (SE) of 84 dB and a specific SE (SSE/t) of 5.6 × 10 4 dB·cm 2 ·g - 1 in X-band. The tailoring process also provides outstanding stability and mechanical resilience, leading to 83.8\% EMI SE maintained after 1000 compressive cycles. Moreover, the foams can keep 76.5\% EMI SE after 30 min of 1000°C thermal-destruction process (in argon atmosphere). All these features demonstrate the potential of using the optimized CNT foam as an EMI shielding material under extreme conditions. These findings have essential inspiration for pore engineering in CNT-based EMI shielding materials, giving further guidance for the design of EMI shielding materials used in harsh conditions.},

Furthermore, it demonstrated impressive performances in terms of tunable sensitivity (0–549.78), suitable stability under various strain ranges, superb electrical conductivity, wonderful durability over 2000 cycles, broad workable strain range (0–240\%), and remarkable electrical heating property. Importantly, the proposed strain sensor was investigated to be used for human motion detection including tiny human movements and robust body motions, as well as temperature detection, implying its further favorable application in flexible wearable devices.},

  abstract     = {Poor melt strength and crystalline properties are the key barrier for polylactide (PLA) toward broader applications. Long chain branched PLA (LCB-PLA) with high foamability and heat resistance are prepared by employing dual-functional 4-vinylbenzyl glycidyl ether (VBGE) as branching coagent with cyclic peroxide. As a result, the branched chains with same length of original PLA chains are uniformly dispersed on PLA backbones via both the free-radical grafting reaction of the vinyl group in VBGE with one PLA backbone and end-group reaction of the epoxy group in VBGE with the carboxyl group of the other PLA chain. Not only the significantly enhanced foamability and heat resistance of LCB-PLA induced by the largely improved melt strength and crystallization performance but also the excellent processing flowability due to a relatively slight increase in the shear viscosity are found. Specifically, as compared to the pure PLA, the expansion ratio of LCB-PLA with 0.6 wt\% VBGE is increased by 17.4 times, and the Vicat softening temperature is enhanced by 95.5 °C. Thus, this study paves a novel one-step continuous strategy to design LCB-PLA with ultrahigh foamability and heat resistance, which is valuable for the large-scale popularization of foamed PLA packaging products.},

The tensile properties and deformation behavior of the materials were evaluated by increasing the unit cell size (1, 2.5, and 5 mm) for each topology. The results of the tensile tests showed that the yield strengths and Young’s moduli of both topologies decreased, and that their elongations increased with decreasing unit cell size. We compared the mechanical properties of the Neovius and IWP lattices, which had the same unit cell size, and found that the former exhibited higher yield strength, tensile strength, and elongation. Further, the tensile deformation behavior of the specimens was analyzed by applying the Gibson–Ashby analytic model. The Neovius lattice accommodated more uniform deformations in a greater number of cell layers. These experimental observations and the use of a simplified model of the lattice structure can enhance the understanding of the mechanism of the room-temperature tensile deformation of Neovius and IWP sheet-based lattice structures.},

In this respect, we have developed a strategy on studying the MPEAs for its composition design in a certain mechanical property by high throughput preparation of powder metallurgy and by machine learning. We chose Zr-Ti-Nb-O alloys as target materials. To unveil key features that mainly influence the mechanical properties, models selection, features screening, and further features importance ordering were performed. The results indicate that the strength and plasticity are dominated by Λ parameter, difference of atomic radius, difference of shear modulus, etc. The prediction error for the strength and plasticity can reach to below 10\% and 16\%, respectively. According to analysis of the key features, a strength model is modified and used for evaluating the contributions of solid solution strengthening among principle and trace elements. The strategy proposed here will be applicable on element selections for a large variety of material property modulations in the MPEAs prepared by powder metallurgy.},

Radar charts are plotted to demonstrate the differences among different parameters to a better understanding and a more global characterization of single-pass stabbing impact. An image analysis methodology of Structure From Motion (SFM) is used to compare the fabric deformation in Z direction after the stabbing tests. Results indicated that fabric structures have significant effects on the stab impact property that the orthogonal/through-the-thickness interlock fabric has a good stab impact resistance. Besides, the fabric with stab angle of 90° exhibited better single-pass stab impact property than the counterparts with stab angle of 0°. More importantly, the double-pass stabbing tests are compared to the ones of the single-pass stabbing which shows that a better condition occurs when the stab angles are identical in each pass.},

The structure and the rheological properties of the composites were characterized by microscopy, the measurement of melt flow rate and oscillatory rheometry. Viscosity was modelled with the modified Carreau-Yasuda and the modified Cross models, and a new model was proposed as well. The results show that RC is a suitable reinforcement for PLA and the Pickering emulsion process produces homogeneous material. Good dispersion and the relatively large aspect ratio of the cellulose nanofiller leads to the formation of a network structure already at small cellulose content. Viscosity increases rapidly with increasing cellulose concentration and a yield stress appears already at 0.5 wt\% RC content. Modeling helps the quantitative analysis of the experimental results and offers additional information about the structure and properties of the composites studied. All three models predict yield stress well, but only the new model gives reasonable values for the power law exponent. Other parameters and their composition dependence are difficult to interpret.},

  abstract     = {In this study, poplar wood flour at various concentrations (1–10 wt\%) is incorporated into a methacrylate-based resin via solution blending to fabricate wood-reinforced composites using stereolithography apparatus (SLA) 3D printing. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) along with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis shows the presence of a small amount of residual monomer in the printed samples. For the printed composites, the glass transition temperature (T g ) from dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) decreases as more wood flour is incorporated, which indicates an increase in free volume occupied by polymer chains. The tensile strength is improved up to 17.3\% from 21.1 MPa (no wood flour) to 24.7 MPa (1.0 wt\% wood flour). The highest Young’s modulus reaches 323.8 MPa (2.0 wt\% wood flour), which is 1.9-fold of that of the sample without wood flour. Moreover, the composites show “stress whitening” with the addition of wood flour during the uniaxial drawing. Morphology analysis of the tested samples show that the formation of microcraze and microvoids likely causing the stress whitening. This is the first study that demonstrates wood flour can be utilized in SLA 3D printed wood plastic composites (WPC) which can reinforce the printed products with a modest loading amount.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a procedure to transform an isotropic nonlinear and rate-dependent material model into orthotropic. This transformation relies on a fast computation modifying the material inelastic evolution along any desired direction. With this concept, the constitutive law of the pure isotropic, nonlinear and rate-dependent material is fully preserved. This paper shows a direct application to describe the nonlinear response of unidirectional (UD) or bidirectional (BD) fiber-reinforced polymer composites. Imposing one constraint leads to a UD composite, whilst imposing two orthogonal directions leads to a BD composite. The proposed methodology is implemented as user-defined material for Finite Element solvers. To prove the method, two different visco-plastic material models used to describe isotropic polymer resins are anisotropized to obtain their corresponding composite counterparts. The mechanical response of the simulations are compared qualitatively and quantitatively to experimental tests on a UD coupon under off-axis tensile test under different load directions. Consistency between the UD and BD anisotropization formulations is proved under tension, shear and different loading directions. Additionally, a complete study of computational performance is addressed to assess the anisotropization’s feasibility to be applied in modeling and design of new laminated and multilayer-based structures exhibiting nonlinear material response.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical properties of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) are of essential importance to the practical application. Much effort has been done to further improve the properties of PVA by modifiers. However, in-depth insight into the role of the modifiers in the properties of PVA at a molecular level still remains rare. Therefore, the Glass transition temperature (Tg) and mechanical properties of PVA, PVA/graphene oxide (GO) and PVA/TRIS functionalized graphene oxide (Tris-GO) are investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The results indicate the volume of PVA, PVA/GO and PVA/Tris-GO regularly varies with temperature. The PVA/Tris-GO show a higher Tg compared to the PVA/GO owing to stronger hydrogen-bonding interactions. The Young’s modulus, Shear modulus and Cauchy pressure of PLA/Tris-GO nanocomposites are enhanced by 50\%, 46\%, and 40\% at 2.5 wt\% addition amount of Tris-GO. In addition, the introduction of Tris-GO can significantly reduce the mobility and flexibility of the PVA chains in the PVA/Tris-GO. The binding energy between PVA and Tris-GO is larger than that between PVA and GO, which leads to the improved mechanical properties of the PVA/Tris-GO. These simulation results provide a better understanding of the thermomechanical mechanism of PVA/Tris-GO nanocomposites, and an effective guidance for improving their mechanical properties.},

One such structure, the bistable helical lattice, is augmented in current work. To date this type of structure, shows promise in aerospace systems which require linear actuation. Herein, morphing capabilities are enhanced by removing traditional mechanical fasteners at the joints, and replacing them with magnets which allow detachment and re-attachment in a controlled, purposeful way. Within a helical lattice structure, joint detachment creates new functionality by allowing a new topology to be formed which is used to convert a linear actuator to one that is curved and then back again, when the joints are reattached. The required force to actuate the topological change is characterised through the use of both finite element analysis and experimental testing. The structural response is observed through the manufacture and testing of a demonstrator which replaces the traditional joints with a series of magnets in order to capture this variable topology behaviour.},

Here, by adopting dual-phase strengthening mechanism in crystallography, we proposed a microlattice strengthening strategy which incorporates stretching-dominated octet-truss (OCT) units as the second phase particles into the diagonal planes of the bending-dominated body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice matrix, to form an anisotropic OCT-BCC lattice. The OCT-BCC dual-phase microlattice possess superior specific compressive strengths that are ~300\% and 600\% higher than BCC microlattices along its horizontal direction and longitudinal direction, respectively, accompanied with a significant increase in stiffness and energy absorption as well. Moreover, a large-scale OCT-BCC lattice metamaterial with dimensions up to 5.0 cm × 2.0 cm × 1.0 cm was successfully manufactured and integrated into a micro aerial vehicle (MAV). The metamaterial-integrated MAV has an airframe that is ~65\% lighter than its bulk counterpart, resulting in a significant increase (~40\%) in flight duration. This work not only provides an effective metamaterial enhancement design strategy, but also promotes the practical application of large-scale 3D printed metamaterial in the field of micro unmanned aerial vehicle.},

This work aims to provide an atomic-scale insight into the creep behavior and deformation mechanism for nanocrystalline FeCrAl alloys, using molecular dynamics method. Both primary and steady state creeps are observed in all creep curves, and tertiary creep occurs at stresses above 2.5 GPa in the time period of the present simulation. As stress increases, the creep mechanism transits from Coble creep to grain boundary sliding, and then to the synergy of grain boundary sliding and dislocation creep. The turning points are about 0.8 GPa and 1.8 GPa, respectively. The dislocation motions are controlled by viscous gliding at low temperature, and then by climbing when temperature exceeds 1000 K. Moreover, the grain size and alloy composition have little impact on the transition of creep mechanism within the present research scope. The proposed creep mechanisms are further analyzed not only from the comparison between activation energies for diffusion and creep, but also from the representative atomic snapshots.},

The exocuticle adjacent to the surface was approximately 0.25 mm thick, which accounts for about 10\% of the exoskeleton’s thickness of 2.5 mm. It had a twisted plywood pattern structure rotated 180° around an axis normal to the surface; its stacking height was about 2.3 μm. No such plywood structure was observed in the endocuticle, which is 10 times thicker. The hardness of the exocuticle was about five times that of the endocuticle and this increase was due to the dense tissue structure and calcium carbonate calcification. In the intermediate layer, the hardness and composition also changed significantly. Three-dimensional analysis have been very helpful in understanding the complex tissue structure. The tissue structure of the coconut crab claw may provide ideas for developing stronger, tougher ultimate materials.},

Life extension of the current fleet of light water reactors could necessitate repair of cracks on irreplaceable internal components, but heat input of weld repairs exacerbates the problem by initiating He-induced cracking. Laser welding is a promising low-heat-input technology thought to limit the extent of He-induced cracking. In this study, we produce laser welds in a hot cell on AISI 304L stainless steel plates previously irradiated in the Experimental Breeder Reactor (EBR)-II. We select a systematic set of three specimens spanning fluences ~1–28 displacements per atom (dpa) at ~415–430 °C and He concentrations ~0.2–8 atomic parts per million (appm) amounting to ~0.2–2.8\% swelling. He-induced cracking is observed only in specimens containing ≥3 appm He. Laser welding nearly eliminates all irradiation-induced cavities and reduces the dislocation loop number density, similar to conventional post-irradiation annealing. Microchemically, laser welding induces Cr-rich precipitation and suppresses grain boundary radiation-induced segregation. The mechanism of He-induced cracking is discussed in the context of these microchemical changes. The weld heat input is calculated and suggests that further refinement of laser welding parameters may improve the cracking resistance for higher dose and He conditions.},

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results illustrated that the surface nanograins were introduced by the effect of SP and the hindering of reinforcements to the matrix deformation. The nanograins were formed near the reinforcement/matrix interface because the matrix was squeezed by both the shots and the reinforcements. Moreover, with increasing the volume fraction of reinforcements, the smaller nanograins were introduced near the interfaces due to the severe deformation between the matrix and reinforcements, which were caused by the decrease in average distance between two reinforcements. Under the same intensity of SP, the deformation of TiC was more severe than that of TiB, and more dislocations were introduced around TiC. The results were influenced by both the different shapes and distribution of reinforcements, and the impact direction of shots. After SP, the compressive residual stress (CRS) and the hardness in the peened surface layer were improved, which was due to the surface deformation, nanograins and high dislocation density in the nanocrystal layer.},

This has led to case reports on reconstructions with these prostheses, particularly for large anterior resections. A novel design of thoracic implant with dynamic capacity has already been reported, with promising short-term outcomes. However, specific biomechanical studies are needed to clarify its mechanical behaviour. A study of the evolution of the design of dynamic thoracic implants was carried out and such implants were biomechanically tested. Furthermore, finite element analyses were carried out to obtain a simple and reliable model to predict the implant behaviour, considering a rib and its costal cartilage. In the models, the stiffness and stress distribution along the implant and the bone showed that the reconstructions exhibited adequate mechanical behaviour. One of the designs provided a flexibility that closely matched the native model and the maximum stress values did not exceed the 30\% of the yield strength of Ti-6Al-4V. The implants strength was demonstrated to be sufficient under tested conditions.},

  abstract     = {Bulk MAX phase materials were investigated heavily in the last decades due to their advantageous combination of metallic and ceramic properties. In recent years, MAX phases also gained the interest of the protective coatings community. Cr 2 AlC is a very promising material, since the crystalline MAX phase can be deposited at comparatively low (550 °C) substrate temperatures. Another advantage of the Cr 2 AlC MAX phase is its self-healing ability. The goal of this investigation was to characterize the fracture toughness of Cr 2 AlC protective coatings using in situ SEM micro-cantilever tests and to determine the influence of different microstructures on the fracture behavior. Surprisingly, the fracture toughness is only moderately affected by the microstructure of the crystalline samples investigated here, which reveal a fracture toughness ranging from 1.8 ± 0.1 MPam 1/2 to 2.4 ± 0.2 MPam 1/2 . In contrast to that, it could be shown that there is a significant increase in fracture toughness for the amorphous coating with identical chemical composition ( 4.1 ± 0.5 MPam 1/2 ) of almost twice the fracture toughness compared to the crystalline coatings. The detrimental influence of grain boundaries in the crystalline coating and the lack of grain boundaries in the amorphous sample might explain the formidable fracture toughness.},

  abstract     = {In this study, to enhance the understanding of characteristics and interaction of Al-SiO 2 composites manufactured with hot extrusion, artificially-cultured diatom frustules (DFs) reinforced aluminum matrix composites have been manufactured by isostatic cool pressing and hot extrusion process. The effect of DFs content on composite particle characteristics, microstructures, phase distribution, fracture surfaces and mechanical properties of the hot-extruded composites were investigated in details. For hot-extruded Al-DFs composite samples, two typical morphologies of DFs were identified: (a) those with apparent matrix-DFs voids were formed by deformability inconsistency between matrix and reinforcement; (b) those with strong matrix-DFs interfacial integration originated from aggregated nano-sized DFs particles and potential reduction reaction between Al and SiO 2 . Uniform distribution of nano-sized DFs particles surrounding matrix grain boundaries significantly improved mechanical properties of Al-DFs composites. When DFs increased to 3 wt\%, the fractography were transformed from dimple rupture of ductile failure into brittle-dominant fracture mode. Meanwhile, aluminum composites with 3 wt\% DFs illustrated optimum tensile strength (185.2 MPa), yield strength (117.6 MPa) with elongation (13.5\%), which exhibited strength increase of 20.7\% and 32.0\% respectively, compared with that of pure aluminum.},

  abstract     = {Osteoporosis leads to various complications, such as prosthesis loosening and periprosthetic fracture, after joint replacement. This is mainly due to the impaired osteogenesis and excessive osteoclastic activity in osteoporotic microenvironment, which leads to insufficient osseointegration between prostheses and host bone. In this study, a functional drug-releasing inorganic–organic bioactive interface was constructed, comprising inorganic three-dimensional (3D) printed porous titanium alloy interface and organic poloxamer 407 temperature-sensitive hydrogel loaded with a novel anti-osteoporosis drug (technetium methylenediphosphonate, 99 Tc-MDP). The inorganic–organic bioactive interface showed good biocompatibility and exhibited a sustained release profile. This performance enhanced osteogenic differentiation, inhibited the expression of osteoclast-related genes and inhibited the osteoclastogenesis, as compared with traditional bisphosphonates (alendronate) in vitro . When implanted into the distal femoral defect using an osteoporotic rabbit model, the 99 Tc-MDP-loaded bioactive interface exhibited the most stable osseointegration with native bone. Furthermore, the drug delivery system inhibited osteoclastic activity via regulation of the osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (OPG/RANKL) signaling pathway, which significantly ameliorated the osteoporosis status to effectively prevent continuous bone destruction around the interface. This study has clinical significance, as it demonstrates that the 99 Tc-MDP modified inorganic–organic interface serve as a novel artificial prosthetic interface for patients with poor osteogenesis.},

  abstract     = {Asphalt mixtures with high porosities (known as porous asphalt (PA) mixes) are becoming a popular choice among road authorities as it provides better skid resistance while also reducing tire-pavement noises. Towards the design and manufacture of PA mix pavement, the evaluation of the mechanical properties of PA mixes is of great importance. To predict the mechanical properties of PA mixes, micromechanical models have been considered as an effective tool. In most research studies, continuum-based micromechanical models, i.e. the Self-consistent model, the Mori-Tanaka model, etc. are widely used to predict the stiffness of asphalt mixtures. However, the limitation of these models is that they cannot describe the characteristics of individual particles and thus they cannot provide accurate predictions. On the other hand, the discrete-based micromechanical model (DBMM) which simulates a granular material as an assembly of bonded particles seems to be a promising alternative. Limited research studies have focused on studying the utilization and the applicability of this model for asphalt mixes. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a framework to use DBMM and to evaluate its performance in estimating a PA mix’s stiffness. Based on the obtained results, both the merits and limitations of this model were highlighted.},

In the R-BUT process, a metallic strip undergoes repeated localised bending and unbending. Load-displacement curves derived from R-BUT tested samples displayed a drastic increase in elongation to failure as compared to samples subjected to standard tensile tests. Additionally, the results confirmed that the force required to deform the R-BUT samples is much reduced as compared to the load required during simple tension. Finite element analysis confirmed that the sample subjected to the R-BUT process underwent intense shear deformation. Transmission-electron-microscopy (TEM) and electron-backscattered-diffraction (EBSD) analysis of the deformed matrix from the ND-RD plane (through-thickness) exhibited evidence for the formation of fine grains. TEM analysis confirmed that the fine grains formed were in the size range of 200–400 nm. Intense shear deformation experienced by the matrix led to shearing followed by spheroidization of precipitate particles. The influence of precipitate particles on the grain refinement process through Particle Stimulated Nucleation of fine grains in the matrix is also presented. EBSD analysis suggested that a Continuous Dynamic Recrystallisation process is the key mechanism behind the grain refinement in the sample during R-BUT processing.},

Both relative strut radii and fillet parameters are defined as design variables, for BCC and PC lattices. Numerical homogenization is employed to characterize the effective elastic constants and yield stresses of the lattice metamaterials. Metamaterial models are developed to represent the relationships between the metamaterial effective properties and lattice geometric variables. Yield and buckling constraints, based on modified Hill’s yield criterion as well as Euler and Johnson buckling formulae respectively, are developed as functions of lattice geometric variables. A new optimization framework is proposed with both yield and buckling constraints integrated. A case study on minimizing the compliance of a Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm beam, composed of either BCC or PC lattices, is conducted. The yield and buckling constraints guarantee the structural safety of the optimized lattice beams. The optimized beams composed of filleted lattices, compared with non-filleted lattices in the corresponding type, show reduced proportions subject to high modified Hill’s stress ( σ Hill ≥ 0.95 σHill≥0.95 ) with 6 ~ 7\% reductions in compliance.},

In the process of solid-state transformation, recrystallization nucleation is promoted, and grain boundaries are pinned by nanoparticles.

Demineralisation of the enamel was characterised at the micron to sub-micron scale. The structure of the healthy enamel was investigated using Focused Ion Beam - Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) and compared with an etched sample to reveal their structural differences. Additional chemical analysis using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed and a decrease in the Ca/P atomic\% ratio was found in etched samples in comparison with healthy enamel, suggesting greater loss of calcium compared with phosphorus. Synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) was performed on the samples to reveal the differences in the diffraction patterns before and after etching in terms of lattice structure and preferred orientation (texture). Texture maps were extracted from diffraction analysis at 500 nm spatial resolution. These maps were correlated with the dimension of the enamel structure. The multi-scale correlative approach provided insights into the demineralisation-induced enamel structure alteration at a resolution approaching 500 nm.},

Using synthetic 3D point clouds rather than experimental data could save a huge amount of training time and costs associated with many prints for each design. Besides distance differences of individual points between source and target point clouds, this scheme uses a new concept called “patch” to capture macro-level information about nearby points for ML training and implementation. Numerical comparisons of prediction results on experimental data with different shapes showed that the proposed scheme outperformed the existing Z-difference method in the literature. Five ML methods ( Bagging of Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, K-nearest Neighbors and Linear Supported Vector Machine) were compared under various conditions, such as different point cloud densities and defect sizes. Bagging and Random Forest were found the two best models regarding predictability; and the right patch size was found to be at 20.

To accelerate the adoption of electronics for chronic recording of physiological parameters in health and disease, there is a demand for biocompatible, conductive &amp; flexible materials that can integrate with various tissues while remaining biologically inert. Conventional techniques used to fabricate biosensors, such as mask lithography and laser cutting, lack the versatility to produce easily customisable, micro-fabricated biosensors in an efficient, cost-effective manner. In this paper, we describe the development and characterisation of an electronic ink made from an environmentally sustainable copolymer - ω-pentadecalactone-co-ε-decalactone, (PDL) incorporating silver nanowires (AgNW), which are known for their antimicrobial and conductive properties. The composites were shown to possess a low percolation threshold (1\% w/w of AgNW to PDL), achieve a low electrical resistance (320 ± 9 Ω/sq) and a high electrical capacitance (2.06 ± 0.06 µF/cm 2 ). PDL nanocomposites were biocompatible, demonstrated in vitro through the promotion of neural adhesion and prevention of astrocyte activation. An optimised ink formulation was subsequently used to fabricate strain-responsive biosensors with high spatial resolution (sub – 100 µm) using a direct write additive manufacturing process. Using a customized in vitro set-up, the sensitivity of these biosensors to biologically-relevant strains was assessed under simulated physiological conditions for 21 days. Critically, these 3D printed biosensors have applications in chronic prophylactic monitoring of pressure changes within the body and related pathologies.},

First, the prism array microstructures were processed on tungsten carbide-cobalt (WC-8 wt\% Co) substrate by low-speed wire electrical discharge machining and used as the mold core. Then, the glass fiber reinforced polypropylene composite (GF/PP) was melted under ultrasonic vibration, and the surface microstructure of the mold core was replicated. The experimental results show that this method can efficiently and accurately manufacture microstructured parts, and the microstructure has a high replication rate up to 95.5\%. By replicating the microstructure, the surface contact angle of GF/PP parts increased from 57.1° to 134.9°, and the wettability changed from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity. The mechanical properties test results show that the GF/PP parts fabricated by ultrasonic injection molding had excellent mechanical properties, and the 30\% GF/PP parts show the highest tensile strength of 56.9 MPa. This work provides a new option for fabricating fiber reinforced composite parts.},

  abstract     = {Improving mechanical properties of the Ni-based superalloy Alloy 718, commonly used in turbine discs , is of vital importance to commercial aviation . The need for higher efficiency will push materials to the limit. Modifications in the processing routes of this alloy can be more easily implemented in industry than changes in the alloying elements. Variations in ageing treatment or cooling rate from hot forging can produce a wide variety of mechanical properties. These are mostly caused by changes in the nanoscale precipitates responsible for strengthening. The effects of different common ageing treatments such as conventional and direct ageing on clustering, size, volume fraction, morphology, configuration, and chemical composition of γ′-and γ′′-precipitates are still largely unknown. We investigate these aspects of the precipitates with atom probe microscopy and correlate them with hardness. The flux of the main chemical elements in the formation of co-precipitates such as duplets and triplets is remarkably different in conventionally and directly aged materials. Dislocation rich structures also inflict in unexpected rapid formation of γ′′-precipitates at temperatures more than 90 °C higher than predicted by time–temperature-transformation diagrams. Water quenching from forging impedes precipitates formed along dislocations to coarsen during ageing, considerably impacting hardness, in comparison to air cooling.},

Fluorescent nanofibers prepared by conjugate electrospinning are wrapped on the surface of flexible core fiber to form a skin-core AIEgen fiber. The electrospinning parameters including spinning concentration, traction rate, spinning rate and tetraphenylethylene (TPE) concentration were designed and optimized via the non-interactive orthogonal experimental design. The optimized flexible AIEgen fiber retains the excellent mechanical properties of core fiber and is equipped with the fluorescence properties of the wrapped fluorescent nanofibers. In addition, the fabricated AIEgen fibers can still exhibit good fluorescence characteristic after being stretched, bent, washed and rubbed, displaying excellent durability. Different from reported luminescent fibers which required an external power supply or complicated preparation process, the flexible AIEgen fibers fabricated in this study can be prepared continuously in a large-scale way and exhibits effectiveness in clothing display, anti-counterfeiting, information transmission and hazardous gas detection, which shows great application potential for wearable smart textiles.},

The adaptability, adjustability and stimulus responsibility were the desired properties of supramolecular gel beyond traditional nanoscale materials. Of the external stimulus sources, anions are of particular interest because of their essential role in environment and many biological processes. Generally, the design of anions-responsive supramolecular gelators contained three parts: the binding site (or reaction site), the linker and the assistant self-assembly moieties (usually hydrophobic or hydrophilic groups). In this review, we discuss three types of anions-responsive supramolecular gels by giving the latest summaries (from 2015 to 2020), including the responsive properties of various structures, design strategy, mechanisms and drawbacks. We also believe that although current researches of those gels are mainly focused on the visual detection of anions in vitro, with the deep understanding of the properties and mechanism of the anions -responsive supramolecular gels, the applications should be paid more and more attention in vivo like anionic related drug targeted delivery and rapid detection of diseases.},

The development of antibacterial alloys with good biocompatibility and sufficient antibacterial properties are highly demanded. Herein, by employing Cu and Mo, we prepared a new Ti-12Mo-5Cu alloy with different heat treatments to control the size and distribution of Ti 2 Cu crystals. For the solution-treated sample at 750°C (SA750), Ti 2 Cu could undergo heterogeneous nucleation, whereas for the solution-treated sample at 900°C (SA900), nanoscale Ti 2 Cu crystals would be widely distributed throughout the alloy via homogeneous nucleation. Interestingly, SA900 presented better antibacterial effect than SA750, with the antibacterial mechanism proposed to be associated with the size and number of Ti 2 Cu in the obtained alloy. At evidenced by a rabbit osteomyelitis model, it was found that the new alloy had a better antibacterial effect than that of pure Ti. Compared to SA750, SA900 could further reduce the inflammatory reaction and slow the progression of osteomyelitis around the implant, then kept the cortical bone more intact. This study provides a straightforward strategy to control the precipitation of nanoscale Ti 2 Cu in Ti-12Mo-5Cu, obtaining a new antibacterial alloy with great biocompatibility, corrosion resistance and the ability to induce osteogenesis differentiation, promising for clinical translation.},

However, the unintentional surface destruction due to melting degrades the quality and reduces the corrosion resistance. Here we have introduced the nondestructive laser peening using femtosecond lasers with ultrahigh pulse density and ultralow pulse energy by a combined approach of experiment, finite element analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations, taken stainless steel as a paradigm. A reinforcement of 33.6\% was achieved on surface hardness of American National Standards Institute (ANSI) 301 stainless steel with the pulse energy of 0.375 μJ (fluence of 0.45 J cm −2 ) and pulse density of 2 × 10 8 mm −2 , without penalty in surface roughness compared with conventional nanosecond laser peening. Two-temperature finite element analysis indicates the non-melting of the peening process. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal the pinning mechanism on dislocation movement by defect meshes generated during femtosecond laser peening process. Dislocation pinning, multiplication, and intertwining enhance both the linear and nonlinear mechanical properties, agreeing well with experiment. With the atomistic insights, our results imply promising applications of nondestructive laser peening on various surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Metal Big Area Additive Manufacturing (MBAAM), an additive manufacturing based on wire-arc process, is progressively evolving from rapid prototyping to the industrial scale production. In MBAAM, the height of printed part can easily reach eight feet, and the printing can last for hours or days. For such large printed structures, distortion and residual stress management are primary challenges in production process. Although transient thermo-mechanical simulations with very small time increments have resulted in accurate process predictions on small parts, such time resolutions are not computationally feasible for large components. Hence, the time increment in thermo-mechanical simulations of large structures needs to be evaluated with respect to simulation accuracy and computational feasibility. In this work, two thin walls were printed using MBAAM, and temperature and process parameters were recorded and used to calibrate and validate the model results. The part distortion and residual stresses were measured before and after stress relaxation by neutron beam diffraction in High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). These measurements were compared to the predicted simulation results. In this work, we investigated the robustness of the computational model and the effects of time increment magnitude on the large-scale MBAAM simulations in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. We found that a coarse time increment of 20 s effectively captured the overall part distortion, but the model was not able to capture the development of residual stresses in the base plate. We determined a combination of fine and coarse time increments that offers an optimal computational efficiency and accuracy for residual stress prediction. A fine time increment of 1 s can be used to resolve the thermal interactions between the wall and base plate during the printing of the first few layers, as well as for other transitions in the geometry or process conditions. These findings provide general guidelines for selection of simulation time increments and offer a general understanding of the effect of time increments on computational efficiency and accuracy in prediction.},

So far, WPI has been considered mainly as a food industry by-product and there are very few reports on the application of WPI in tissue engineering (TE). In this work, WPI-based hydrogels were modified with bioactive glass (BG), which is commonly used as a bone substitute material. Ready-to-use, sterile hydrogels were produced by a simple technique, namely heat-induced gelation. Two different concentrations (10 and 20\% w/w) of sol–gel-derived BG particles of two different sizes (2.5 and &lt;45 µm) were compared. µCT analysis showed that hydrogels were highly porous with almost 100\% pore interconnectivity. BG particles were generally homogenously distributed in the hydrogel matrix, affecting pore size, and reducing material porosity. Thermal analysis showed that the presence of BG particles in WPI matrix reduced water content in hydrogels and improved their thermal stability. BG particles decreased enzymatic degradation of the materials. The materials underwent mineralization in simulated biological fluids (PBS and SBF) and possessed high radical scavenging capacity. In vitro tests indicated that hydrogels were cytocompatible and supported MG-63 osteoblastic cell functions.},

The ω precipitates with two variants are directly probed to be decomposed from FeGa bcc matrix with the assistances of both spinodal decomposition and displacive transformation.

In this paper, to realize the simplified, low-cost and high efficient metallisation, a new method had been proposed without both the noble metal activators and the corrosive chemicals. The modified electroless plating processes had been employed in activation and deposition procedure. The nickel ions were first physiadsorbed on the cellulose paper (CP) fibers and then reduced into clusters by reducing agent which can act as the seeds to initiate the electroless plating process. The gold galvanic displacement was conducted further to modify the nickel surface. Via these processes, the cellulose paper was metallised with Ni-P and Au/Ni-P successfully. The morphological and microstructural properties of the resulted Ni-P/CP and Au/Ni-P/CP hybrids were evaluated. The Ni-P/CP composites had a low surface resistance below 0.5 Ω sq -1 while the Au/Ni-P/CP composites are below 0.1 Ω sq -1 . The relationship between the mechanical and electrical properties with the plating parameters is discussed. The results indicated that Au/Ni-P/CP had good electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility. Finally, the application demonstration for supercapacitor with the modified metallisation method was exhibited. This work offers a facile and non-toxic path to develop high-performance metallisation for functional cellulose-based materials.},

It ruptured fastest in PBS buffer solution with pH 6.3, and the release rate reached 50\% at 4 h. Furthermore, it showed that the addition of histidine polypeptides increases uptake by HepG-2 cells. This study integrates drug loading and detecting aspects into a single theranostic platform by a simple and efficient strategy, opening a new route for the construction of advanced drug delivery systems.},

  abstract     = {The point-by-point wire and arc additive manufacturing technology allows precisely depositing of high strength material. In combination with a robotic arm and sensing techniques during printing, it can be used as a novel efficient joining method for custom structural steel components. For accessibility to the parts to be joined, flexibility on the orientation of the printing tool is of high significance. In this contribution, the focus is set on the influence of different printing orientations on relevant properties of point-by-point wire and arc additively manufactured steel bars. Geometry scans show an irregular variation of the cross-section area along the length of the bars. The mechanical properties of the bars are determined from uniaxial tensile tests on as-printed specimens and on locally milled specimens. It is shown, that different printing orientations have an influence on the geometry of the bars, but only a negligible effect on their mechanical properties. The results of the uniaxial tensile tests indicate a good suitability of the additively manufactured steel bars for structural applications. Finite element simulations validate a proposed elastic-plastic material model, which allows predicting the structural behaviour of the point-by-point wire and arc additively manufactured steel bars produced with different printing orientations.},

Nanofillers, aluminium-doped ZnO nanoparticles, were prepared by microwave-assisted polyol method and characterized by XRD, SEM, and TEM. Obtained nanoparticle colloids were mixed with dissolved polymer. Then, nanocomposite active layers of prepared PLEDs were spin-cast in one processing step. Specific optoelectronic and electric properties of nanocomposite materials and performance of PLED devices were investigated using UV–Vis absorption, photoluminescence, energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (ER-EIS), and I-V and luminance measurements. The addition of Al-doped ZnO nanoparticles improved power efficiency of diodes exhibiting an order of magnitude enhancement in electroluminescence intensity, luminance (from 1 900 to 20 700 cd/m 2 for MEH-PPV and from 4 600 to 38 000 cd/m 2 for F8BT) and had pronounced effect on opening bias voltage of final devices. In addition, two effects of nanoparticulate doping were revealed. The first, specific one, related with electronic structure of used nanoparticles. The second, non-specific, which indirectly contributes to structural ordering of the polymer matrix. Observed phenomena are related to electronic band structure affected by the addition of nanoparticles as revealed by ER-EIS.},

However, their applications are restricted due to poor hydrophilicity and single function. In this study, we show for the first time how blending of L-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC) to PLGA to yield hybrid scaffolds alters the physical properties and wettability and consequently affects the biodegradability and biocompatibility. Soybean-derived phospholipids complexed PLGA nanofibrous scaffolds (PLGA-PC) were readily fabricated by electrospinning polymer solutions of PLGA and PC in different ratios. The obtained scaffolds exhibited a dramatic decrease in fibre diameter and a significant increase in porosity and hydrophilicity as the PC component was added. Although the mechanical strength of PLGA scaffolds decreased due to the incorporation of PC, the PLGA-PC groups showed tensile strength above 2.5 MPa in both dry and wet states. Based on in vitro degradation, we found that it was accelerating for PLGA-PC scaffolds with PC content increased. Additionally, these scaffolds presented superior blood compatibility and cytocompatibility. The explored research on phospholipids complexed scaffolds can readily extend to other polymers and provides a feasible strategy to construct optimal microenvironments for seeded cells, indicating promising use in various tissue engineering.},

  abstract     = {Bamboo cell wall exhibits a microscopically graded architecture, and micro-layer distributed cells around individual cell walls, which leads to the preferred mechanical properties of bamboo for impact loading. This work proposes a cellular structure, as called Bamboo Biomorphic Structure (BBS), which is a functionally graded honeycomb cellular structure inspired by the microstructure of bamboo and manufactured using fused filament fabrication (FFF). It is hypothesized that, by introducing bamboo biomorphic micro-unit cells, including a range of thickness step differences within an individual honeycomb unit cell, the successive stages of deformation of the honeycomb structure can be controlled, making the system absorb impact energy more efficiently. Characterization of the designed structures was conducted under in-plane quasi-static loading conditions, and then evaluated using a nonlinear finite element commercial code LS-DYNA. The proposed gradient BBS showed higher absorbed impact energies by four times compared with the conventional Honeycomb structure. The proposed parametric design would aid engineering design principles for the development of a novel biomorphic cellular structure, which has the potential for large-scale manufacturing of efficient energy-absorbing engineering structures. Such an energy-absorbing structure can help improve the lightweight structure design for various applications, including automobiles and aircrafts, while ensuring safety under impact load.},

However, the tradeoffs between biodegradability, mechanical strength, porosity and pore size, and bioactivity of the tissue-engineered nanocomposites remain a challenge. To this end, we constructed a novel biodegradable nanocomposite scaffold by chemical crosslinking of hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC)/soy protein isolate (SPI) and montmorillonite (MMT) modification. Owing to the strong interfacial interaction between nanoclay and polymer chains, the prepared nanocomposites showed enhanced mechanical and physical properties, within the ideal range for bone tissue engineering. Furthermore, sustained sequential release of Ca and Mg ions during the degradation of the nanocomposites provided essential signaling cues for guiding bone regeneration. It was verified in vitro that the engineered nanocomposites possessed satisfactory cytocompatibility, offering a highly desirable microenvironment for cellular behaviors, including adhesion, proliferation, and spreading, as well as promoting the mineralization and osteoblastic differentiation of rat bone marrow stem cells. Notably, when employed to repair critical-sized cranial defects in rat models, the nanocomposites demonstrated not only reliable biosafety but also significant osteointegration and bone-forming ability in vivo. Collectively, our results confirmed that the incorporation of inorganic MMT nanosheets into biocompatible HEC/SPI scaffolds is a viable strategy for fabricating a suitable biomaterial that enhances the regeneration of large bone defects.},

Our study revealed that the MOX/OGP PDA-modified SPK (SPD-MOX/OGP) surface exhibited a durable and excellent antibacterial effect against planktonic/adherent Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in vitro . A remarkable enhancement in specific cell adhesion, proliferation and osteogenicity were observed on the SPD-MOX/OGP substrate due to the presence of OGP and PDA molecules compared to all other groups. More significantly, using the infected and non-infected rat tibia models confirmed the in vivo antimicrobial and osteogenesis abilities of SPD-MOX/OGP. Therefore, we are confident that such dual-functional PEEK surface with both antibacterial and osseointegrative capacities in this study would give a positive answer to periprosthetic joint infection-related issues.},

The MnCO@CuS nanoplatform revealed superior properties in colloidal stability, photothermal conversion, H 2 O 2 /NIR-stimulated CO release and tumoral accumulation. More importantly, the enriched H 2 O 2 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) triggered MnCO to release CO in situ, and this process was further strengthened by the NIR irradiation. Subsequently, the intermediate products MnO x was degraded into Mn 2+ by the mild acidic tumor microenvironment to enable T 1 -weighted MR imaging. Simultaneously, the in situ-released CO combined with NIR irradiation exhibited strongest inhibition to the growth of MV3 tumor in vitro and in vivo . Moreover, the multifunctional nanoplatform also exhibited low toxicity and good biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo .

Recent advances in additive manufacturing provide a pathway to emulate the hierarchical architectures of biological materials. In this review paper, we consider biological structures from marine and terrestrial animals that safeguard their body parts from external attack. We also discuss biological structures that are not employed for protective purposes but provide flexibility and have damage tolerant properties suitable for developing strong, tough and lightweight bioinspired armour. Mobility and protection strategies have been considered to enhance the development of bio-inspired designs.

The crack initiation region of both aluminized steel with or without annealing treatment comprise coarse columnar grains and cleavage planes with river patterns.

Firstly, an orthogonal decomposition and uniform sampling (ODUS) method will be proposed to avoid the time-consuming double loops, in terms of load uncertainties described by upper and lower bounds. Secondly, a non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion (NIPCE) is implicitly implemented, in terms of base material uncertainties subjected to Gaussian distributions. In the optimization formulation, the robust objective function is defined according to both the expectation and standard variation of structural compliance, and the sensitivity information with respect to the two-scale design variables are given in detail. Finally, an effective evolutionary method is employed to iteratively find the optimal topologies of the design. In addition, this study also defines a dimensionless index to evaluate the robustness of deterministic and robust designs. Three numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method, and 3D design results are fabricated by using appropriate additive manufacturing techniques.},

  abstract     = {Experimental characterization of high-strength fine wires often arises challenges greater than expected due to the difficulties encountered gripping the wire to the fixtures. To avoid premature breakage within the fixtures, capstan grips are widely utilized, but slippage might occur unless the wire is folded many times around the capstan. Further, estimating the actual elongation of the gauge section might be an issue since wires do not deform in the gauge section only but also within the folded length. This work proposes a simple clamping approach relying on sacrificial tabs made of soft and ductile material allowing to utilize classic wedge-shaped steel jaws to characterize high-strength fine wires without encountering any slippage or break within the gripping region. The suggested tabbing strategy further allows referring to the crosshead motion to evaluate the overall strain in the wire as its deformation concentrates only over the gauge length, hence excluding the use of an extensometer. This is particularly needed in the case of testing in a climatic chamber. On top of the experimental evidence, the proposed tabbing methodology is studied through analytical solutions and finite element analyses, which result in a generalized design tool that can be utilized to choose the best material and dimensions of the sacrificial tabs to correctly test wires other than the ones considered in this work.},

  abstract     = {The nickel-based superalloy Haynes 282 is a promising candidate material among the existing batch of aerospace alloys for manufacture via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). LPBF Haynes 282 has a strong preference for epitaxial grain growth in the (0 0 1) orientation, promoting inhomogeneous grain morphologies and anisotropic mechanical behaviour. In this paper, LPBF Haynes 282 specimens have been extracted from perpendicular and parallel orientations in respect to the primary vertical build direction and studied in their original as-built form and when exposed to a solution and age heat treatment. The effect of alternative energy densities is also considered in the different conditions. Results show that the numerous processing variables discussed in this research have a direct influence on the morphology of the final grain structure. Although a strongly anisotropic microstructure was present in the as-built material in both respective orientations, this behaviour was eradicated following the solution and aging heat treatment through recrystallisation, and the alleviation of local texture and misorientation to help produce a more uniform equiaxed grain morphology. The subsequent mechanical behaviour has been assessed through hardness, tensile and creep stress rupture testing, and results have corroborated the microstructural findings to confirm a more isotropic material was successfully achieved.},

  abstract     = {ω -embrittlement is ubiquitous in metastable β -titanium (Ti) alloys, while the fundamental understanding on the damage-fracture mechanism hitherto remains elusive. In this study, we systematically investigate ω -embrittlement of high misfit Ti-10Cr (wt.\%) alloys by coupling experiments and first-principles calculation. It is found that brittle cleavage-like fracture prevails in tensile samples, irrespective of the quenching or subsequent aging states. Microscopically, cracks nucleation and propagation proceed along slip bands, inside which ω -lattices are first disordered and then the localized ( β + ω )-amorphous-like structures are developed in the shape of white patches. The underlying mechanism of mechanically-driven localized amorphization is that due to the remarkable covalent character of atomic bonding of ω -precipitates caused by composition partitioning of the Cr element, ω -precipitates impart extremely high energy barrier opposed to dislocation gliding and render dislocations pile-up ahead of ω -precipitates, thus leading to their lattice disordering. It is unveiled that the hydrostatic pressure, serving as the driving force for dislocations pile-up, plays a critical role in this unusual cleavage-like fracture of Ti-10Cr alloys caused by mechanically-driven ω -mediated localized amorphization. Accompanied by the transition from the co-operation of deformation twining and ordinary dislocation slip in the quenched Ti-10Cr alloys to the exclusive ordinary dislocation slip in the long-time aged Ti-10Cr samples, it is unexpected that the resulting tensile fracture strength monotonically decreases to a stress level of ~ 100 MPa. These findings provide new insights into the damage and fracture behavior of high misfit β -titanium alloys, such as Ti-Cr alloys.},

  abstract     = {Macrosegregation is the key issue in the solidification field. Oxygen and its inclusions play the important role in driving the melt flow and the resulting macrosegregation in steel. Here, to reveal the inducing mechanism and quantitative model of oxygen content in real industrial steel ingots , we demonstrate for the first time that there exists the critical oxygen content in triggering the formation of channel-type segregation, the most undesirable macrosegregation type in steel. Our multiscale simulations from density functional theory calculations to multiphase/multicomponent macromodel , clarify the quantitative conditions initializing channel-type segregation and reveal two typical growth modes via oxide flotation. The oxygen content model and criterion to induce the channel onset is built accordingly, which are validated by the numerous full ingot dissections and experimental characterizations including the in situ electrolysis of inclusions, X-ray microtomography, scanning electron microscope , large-scale measurement system of inclusions and chemical analysis. With oxygen controlled below this critical value of 0.0008 wt\%, channel disappears. This study quantitatively uncovers the novel role of oxygen in steel, changes the traditional sole concept of cleanliness, and highlights an innovative and controlling-effective route to fabricate homogenized steel.},

In terms of thermal neutron shielding, the composite with the highest HEC content (EP/W3) had a nearly 100\% shielding efficiency, while that of EP was approximately 50\%, indicating that this material has favorable thermal neutron and γ-ray shielding performance. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of the resulting composite material was lower than 0.3 W·m −1 ·K −1 , the tensile strength was higher than 10 MPa, and the density was lower than 1.5 g·cm −3 .

Here, a class of stretchable microstrip antennas composed of serpentine mesh layouts in both the patch and ground plane is designed. The study of the representative stretchable microstrip antenna reveals the effects of the geometric parameters on its electromagnetic properties . Although the non-dimensional parameters have been shown to uniquely determine the mechanical properties of the serpentine mesh structure, their influence on the coupled mechanical-electromagnetic properties is different in the stretchable antenna. This study systematically reveals the effects of the non-dimensional parameters at various tensile strain levels from the coupled mechanics-electromagnetics simulations, with experimental validations. The mechanical stretchability of the serpentine mesh structure increases as the arc angle increases or the normalized width (i.e., the ratio of the width to radius) decreases. The normalized width together with the change in radius and width provides an effective means to tune the initial resonance frequency, impedance matching, and radiation pattern of the stretchable antenna without altering the strain sensitivity. Additionally, the advanced laser micromachining technology for the manufacturing of the stretchable microstrip antenna can also be explored to the other stretchable microwave devices.},

The rheological properties of a water-based, high viscosity graphite ink were optimised using a secondary solvent for the rheological requirements of a syringe dispensing method. The microstructure of high coat-weight battery electrodes produced from printing and tape cast methods were compared and the electrochemical performance evaluated. Cross sectional analysis of the slurry cast coatings showed improved component homogeneity, lower graphite alignment with 0.1\% to 10\% weight increase of the secondary solvent, with a corresponding change in tortuosity of the electrodes of 5.3–2.8. Improved cycle life is observed with a printed electrode containing an embedded electrolyte channel. Performance properties were elucidated through charge discharge, GITT and PEIS measurements. Improved electronic conductivities, exchange currents and diffusion coefficients were observed for the syringe deposited electrode.

  abstract     = {In this study, we explored the suitability of laser-scanning vibrometry (LSV) for evaluation of the mechanical behavior of rectangular prisms produced by Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF). Our hypothesis was that LSV would be able to discriminate the mechanical behavior of specimens fabricated with different process parameters combinations. Build orientation, raster angle, nozzle temperature, printing speed and layer thickness were the process parameters of interest. Based on a factorial design of experiment approach, 48 different process parameter combinations were taken into account and 96 polylactic acid (PLA) rectangular prisms were fabricated. The characterization of their dynamical behavior provided frequency data, making possible the computation of an equivalent elastic modulus metric. Statistical analysis of the equivalent elastic modulus dataset confirmed the significant influences of raster angle, build orientation and nozzle temperature. Moreover, multivariate regression models served to rank, not only the significant influences of individual process parameters, but also the significant quadratic and cubic interactions between them. The previous knowledge was then applied to generate an ad hoc model selecting the most important factors (linear and interactions). The predicted equivalent elastic moduli provided by our ad hoc model were used in modal analysis simulations of both 3D printed rectangular prisms and a complex part. The simulated frequencies thus obtained were generally closer to the experimental ones (≤11\%), as compared to modal analysis simulations based on internal geometry modelling (≤33\%). The use of LSV appears very promising in the characterization of the mechanical behavior and integrity of 3D printed parts. Other additive manufacturing technologies may benefit from the use of this technique and from the adoption of the presented methodology to test, simulate and optimize the properties of 3D printed products.},

In this work, we report wet spun nanocomposite fibers based on Poly (ether-block-amide) (PEBA) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) that show differential sensitivity under uniaxial loading. This nonmonotonic piezoresistance is triggered by yielding of polymer segments which later influences the interaction between the embedded MWCNT at higher draw ratios. We confirmed this observation by correlating the stress – strain curve with the resistance – strain response and further studied its influence on the strain sensing phenomena of PEBA / MWCNT fibers. Moreover, pre-stretched fibers at draw ratios slightly above the yield point produced stable and reproducible sensing signals after applying them as biomechanical sensors for motions associated with small bending radii such as finger-wagging.},

  abstract     = {With advanced manufacturing processes, many modern structural designs need to include microscale uncertainties of material properties and microstructures that can affect overall performances, such as microelectromechanical systems, micro–opto–electro–mechanical systems, and micro-optical electronics systems. Topology design optimization at this scale must consider uncertainties from material microstructures as the scale of the structure and material microstructure is comparable. Very few studies consider microstructure uncertainties in topology design due to their scales are much different in classical mechanical/civil engineering. A novel framework of reliability-based topology optimization is proposed to specifically address this gap for the design. The microscale uncertainties of heterogeneous materials are quantified by the explicit mixture random field model. Then, the material distribution is optimized by a heuristic updating scheme, and sensitivities of reliability constraints are calculated using the adjoint design-point-based importance sampling method. The proposed methodology simultaneously considers microscale hierarchical uncertainties in microstructures and material property variations for each phase. The feasibility of the framework is demonstrated by several numerical examples with different multi-phase materials. Compared with deterministic topology optimization and classical topology optimization with first-order reliability method approximations, the optimal design obtained from the proposed method can achieve accurate target reliability with minimized limit state function evaluations.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold with specific surface morphology was prepared by cryogenic printing technique. Biocompatible hydroxyapatite (HA) was added to the PCL matrix to enhance the surface properties and bioactivity of the scaffolds. The effects of HA on the mechanical strength and surface morphology were studied systematically. It was found that the extra surface morphology of filament enhanced the exposure of the HA particles, which induced a positive synergistic effect on surface properties. The wettability and bio-mineralization were significantly improved, and the protein adsorption capacity was 4.5 and 3.9 times than the ones of sample with 20\%HA and smooth surface, respectively. Rat bone mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) were used as the cell model to evaluate the cellular response to the specific surface of the scaffolds. The results showed that the scaffolds with 20–40\% HA and extra surface had better proliferation ratio. The ALP assay also demonstrated that the synergistic effect was beneficial to cell osteogenic differentiation, and the ALP level was significantly higher than that of pure PCL and smooth PCL/HA composite scaffold samples at the 14th day. Therefore, the PCL/HA composite scaffold with extra surface morphology had better potential for bone tissue engineering.},

  abstract     = {This study explores carbon addition as a materials design approach for simultaneously improving the hardness, crack resistance, and corrosion resistance of high entropy thin films. CoCrFeMnNi was selected as a starting point, due to its high concentration of weak carbide formers. The suppression of carbides is crucial to the approach, as carbide formation can decrease both ductility and corrosion resistance. Films with 0, 6, and 11 at.\% C were deposited by magnetron co-sputtering, using a graphite target and a sintered compound target. The samples with 0 at.\% C crystallized with a mixture of a cubic closed packed (ccp) phase and the intermetallic χ-phase. With 6 and 11 at.\% C, the films were amorphous and homogenous down to the nm-scale. The hardness of the films increased from 8 GPa in the carbon-free film to 16 GPa in the film with 11 at.\% C. Furthermore, the carbon significantly improved the crack resistance as shown in fragmentation tests, where the crack density was strongly reduced. The changes in mechanical properties were primarily attributed to the shift from crystalline to amorphous. Lastly, the carbon improved the corrosion resistance by a progressive lowering of the corrosion current and the passive current with increasing carbon concentration.},

Here, we report ultrastrong alloys, discovered via high-throughput screening of the nc CoCr 33-69 materials library. The nc materials library was fabricated using magnetron co-sputtering. The alloys consist of textured, columnar structures with grain size in the nanometric regime. We found that the texture and phase composition can be tailored by changing the Cr concentration. In the investigated region of the nc CoCr system, a relatively broad spectrum of yield strength, determined via micropillar compression tests, was found ranging from 1.41 GPa up to 3.64 GPa. The remarkable strength increment was caused by a chemically- and thermally-driven phase and microstructure evolution of the system. The strongest alloys were found in the regions containing the δCoCr phase, which was considered previously as metastable. Density functional calculations revealed that the δCoCr phase is more energetically favourable in Cr-rich regions compared to single-phase simple solid solutions (HCP, BCC). Experimental results showed that the range of its occurrence is wider than previously thought, i.e. after annealing the δCoCr phase was found above 44 at.\% of Cr. We demonstrate that systematic screening of materials libraries can boost the discovery of new materials with outstanding properties.},

Solid-state phase transformation and dislocation density evolution are incorporated to simulate the effects of martensite dissolution and α α - β β transformation at high temperature. Predictions are validated by comparison with measured tensile test data for (i) effects of additive manufacturing process conditions (such as build orientation and sample size) on tensile properties, based on the microstructure attributes inherited from the process, and (ii) the effect of temperature on tensile stress-strain response across a broad range of temperatures. The model is thus applicable for rapid process-structure-property prediction, in conjunction with AM process modelling, to capture the effects of key manufacturing variables and for process optimization.},

The combination of Eu 3+ complexes with SiO 2 nanoparticles doped in chitosan enhances the fluorescence performance. Photophysical measurements show that when the Cu 2+ concentration is 100 μmol/L, the fluorescence of the composite chitosan nanofibers can be quickly and sensitively quenched, and that concentrations as low as 10 μmol/L Cu 2+ can be detected. Furthermore, the use of chitosan and PEO to prepare the material makes these new fluorescence-based copper sensing materials suitable for Cu 2+ detection in biological systems.},

The shape and lattice structure of Au nanostars and Fe 3 O 4 were confirmed with TEM , HRTEM and XRD experiments. Compared with other Au nanoparticles@Fe 3 O 4 composite probes, the Au nanostars@PDA@Fe 3 O 4 structure has a low photothermal conversion threshold. Compared with the corresponding pure Au nanostars, the photothermal efficiency of the probe has increased by 50\%, while maintaining 171\% and 32\% fluorescence enhancement in vitro and in vivo , respectively. Due to the charge transfer channel, the phonon emission of Au can go on in Fe 3 O 4 via the PDA linking. Under the precise guidance of multimodal imaging, the nanoprobe conducts homogeneous photothermal ablation of bulky solid tumors (~ 400 mm 3 ) in a xenograft mouse model. Animal model magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results found that the MRI T2 signal intensity of the probe was 65\% stronger than that of pure Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles .

Gyroid cellular structure (GCS) is the most widely studied type of TPMS structure. The majority of previous studies on GCS have focused on its isotropic structure. However, as a potential candidate for bone repair, anisotropic structures need to be considered. This study presented a strategy to control the anisotropy of GCS by changing its geometrical parameters. The finite element method was subsequently applied to determine the elastic response of anisotropic GCS under compression. The degree of anisotropic (DA) of GCS was evaluated in terms of the ratio of equivalent elastic modulus in vertical and horizontal directions. Within the parameters considered, the DA of GCS varied from 0.17 to 3.6, as compared with 0.2 to 4 for human bones. The main factors affecting the anisotropic elastic response of GCS were structure anisotropy, porosity, and loading direction. The elastic modulus of the anisotropic GCS was in the range 0.03 to 5.6GPa for titanium alloy, as compared with 0.1 to 4.5GPa for human trabecular bone. Combining the porosity and anisotropic models of GCS can offer a scaffold that matches closely the human bone mechanical environment.},

The finite element prediction results are consistent with the experiments, indicating that the FEM can effectively predict the progressive damage and strength of 3D5d braided composites. Damage evolution shows that the main failure modes with small braiding angles include tensile failure of braiding yarn and axial yarn, while the large braiding angles are tensile shear failure of braiding yarn. As the fiber volume fraction increases, the initial damage location of the FEM changes from the intersection of braiding yarn/axial yarn to the junction among the braiding yarns. The stress-strain curves results show that the 3D5d braided composites exhibit brittle fracture characteristics under longitudinal tensile loading, and the mechanical properties are significantly correlated with the braiding angle and fiber volume fraction.

Subsequent lap shear testing showed that single-shot laser peening increased the average weld strength by 12\% to 25\%, depending on the flyer and target material combination. In contrast, with double-shot laser peening, the average weld strength decreased regardless of the flyer and target materials involved. Scanning electron microscope images revealed wavy weld interfaces and increased interlocking between the foils for the single-shot laser peening treatments as compared to the initial “flat” weld interface geometry, thereby leading to greater flyer/target weld strength. In the double-shot laser peening treatments, however, separations and melting were observed along the weld interface due to rebounding and excessive plastic heat dissipation of the foils.

However, 4D printing of precise hydrogel structures is still highly challenging due to the relatively poor printability of hydrogels and high surface roughness of printed patterns, when micro extrusion-based 3D printers are used. In this study, a highly printable and shape morphing hydrogel was investigated for 4D printing by blending alginate (Alg) and methylcellulose (MC). The optimized Alg/MC hydrogel exhibited excellent rheological properties, extrudability and shape fidelity of printed structures. The printable Alg/MC hydrogel was 4D printed into a series of patterned 2D architectures which were encoded with anisotropic stiffness and swelling behaviors by strategically controlling the network density gradients vertical to the orientation of the patterned strips. By controlling the strip interspacing and angle, these 2D architectures could transform into various prescribed simple 3D morphologies (e.g., tube-curling and helix) and complex 3D morphologies (e.g., double helix and flowers) after immersion in a calcium chloride solution. This shape morphing Alg/MC hydrogel with excellent printability has high potential for 4D printing of delicate hydrogel patterns, which are increasingly needed in the tissue engineering, biomedical device and soft robotics fields.},

Moreover, the Arrhenius thermal decomposition of PBXs chips and its turning Logistic retardation growth model were also unified successfully, and the temperature measurement tool, thermal analysis tests and surrogate face cutting experiments were implemented separately. According to the controllable self-acceleration safe cutting criterion, this novel model reliably predicts the safe cutting zone of HMX-based PBXs. Finally, the turning experiments of PBXs validated that: (1) The combination of high cutting velocity and cutting temperature can induce a sufficient amount of PBXs chips to release uncontrollable chemical energy; (2) The frictional heating interface between the HMX crystal and the diamond tool tip is the most hazardous zone; (3) A reliable evaluation for the turning safety of PBXs requires detailed analyses on the cutting energy, friction time and hot spot distribution, which can be characterized by the theoretical model and cutting curve of T-v .},

Or, as in the case of the ductile cast iron EN-GJS-SiMo5-1 at 500 °C and the nickel-base superalloy Hastelloy X at 800 °C, the components are considered unified, meaning that the effect of inelastic straining is the same irrespective of whether it is caused through creep at constant stress or by plastic deformation due to an instantaneous stress increase. Based on these assumptions, the proposed method is used to assess the creep strain from SSRT in good agreement with conventional creep test results.},

  abstract     = {Fracture toughness, rather than strength, is often the limiting factor of structural materials. Developing new base materials with improved fracture toughness often takes more than a decade. Alternatively, topological design has recently been expanded by additive manufacturing. In the present study, architected planes of internal porosity mimicking a weak interface were found capable of arresting and deflecting a propagating crack, delaying fracture. This concept was demonstrated experimentally in solid beams of polymeric 3D printed material, and in gyroid metamaterials constructed from either a brittle polymer or stainless steel. Improvements in fracture toughness ranged from 22\% to 300\% depending on the material. Especially with topological optimization, toughening via designed porosity provides an avenue for cost-effective and simple toughening across a range of materials.},

  abstract     = {Noble metal nanoparticles are highly attractive, owing to their optical, physical, electrical and chemical properties. Specifically, ease of surface modification, exceptional plasmonic and optical properties of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) have created increasing interest in the assembly process. Once assembly is achieved successfully, the disassembly of the Au NPs is considered to be an exciting challenge. There are different kinds of forces involved in the assembly and disassembly process of Au NPs with a great deal involving the chemistry of surfactants. These forces can be externally triggered to achieve reversible assembly and disassembly. Less effort has been devoted to collate the study and mechanism involved behind environmentally or chemically triggered reversible assembly of Au NPs. Hence, the emphasis of this review is to highlight a number of promising stimuli such as light, pH, temperature and magnetic fields that can cause the reversible assembly of Au NPs. In addition, the surfactants utilized for assembly and disassembly of Au NPs under external stimuli response are examined. Furthermore, this review gives an account of the mechanism and chemistry of reversible assembly of Au NPs, taking into account the latest published literature. Indeed, it covers many ligands, biomolecules and thiol-mediated surfactants that can be linked to the surface of Au NPs and can also respond to external stimuli, realizing reversible assembly. The emerging challenges and an outlook on future developments in this research area are also discussed. The ultimate goal of this review is to encourage synthetic chemists to use ligand functionalized Au NPs (building blocks) for complex chemical systems as it will revolutionize the organic ligand synthetic processes that are responsive to different stimuli.},

  abstract     = {Selective Laser Melting (SLM) technology has undergone significant development in the past years providing unique flexibility for the fabrication of complex metamaterials such as octet-truss lattices. However, the microstructure can exhibit significant variations due to the high complexity of the manufacturing process. Consequently, the mechanical behavior, in particular, linear elastic response, of these lattices is strongly dependent on the process-induced defects, raising the importance on the incorporation of as-manufactured geometries into the computational structural analysis. This, in turn, challenges the traditional mesh-conforming methods making the computational costs prohibitively large. In the present work, an immersed image-to-analysis framework is applied to efficiently evaluate the bending behavior of AM lattices. To this end, we employ the Finite Cell Method (FCM) to perform a three-dimensional numerical analysis of the three-point bending test of a lattice structure and compare the as-designed to as-manufactured effective properties. Furthermore, we undertake a comprehensive study on the applicability of dimensionally reduced beam models to the prediction of the bending behavior of lattice beams and validate classical and strain gradient beam theories applied in combination with the FCM. The numerical findings suggest that the octet-truss lattices exhibit size effects, thus, requiring a flexible framework to incorporate high-order continuum theories.},

This article describes the simple and cost-effective manufacturing of Self-Healing Elastomeric/Cementitious/Mechanical Adhesive Structures (SECMAS). SECMAS are comprised of cementitious bricks joined by mechanical adhesive interfaces and organized in nacre-inspired, brick-and-mortar structures. This scalable staggered design provides SECMAS with the capability to concentrate the formation and propagation of cracks along the mechanical adhesive interfaces, which efficiently distribute loading forces and accommodate deformation. The periodic distribution of elastomeric reinforcing layers inside the SECMAS facilitates its elastic self-recovery after severe deformation, restoring the interlocking of the mechanical adhesive interfaces and enabling SECMAS to autonomously recover their original mechanical properties at room temperature. Moreover, the rapid recovery of the mechanical adhesive interfaces enables repeated self-healing under cycling bidirectional loading forces. The modular structure of SECMAS and their easy-to-assemble and easy-to-disassemble mechanical adhesive interfaces facilitates the rapid exchange of damaged components for new ones, enlarging service life. Furthermore, the simple and scalable design rules derived for the construction of SECMAS facilitate their rapid reconfiguration into a variety of self-repairing structural elements, promoting sustainable construction.},

  abstract     = {A planar surface that can be reconfigured into several 3D target shapes is of importance in numerous fields at different length scales, e.g. aeronautical systems, buildings, and in medicine. Transformation into target shapes is typically an inverse problem solved by mapping a discretized representation of the surface to the flat plane and distorting the periodicity or the shape of each element. As this is a geometric problem, the system is not necessarily mechanically stable when reconfigured into the target shape. Here, a method is proposed for the generation of fabrication surfaces that can be reconfigured into several target shapes, each of which are statically stable. First, the target shapes are discretized as Chebyshev nets. The resulting quadrilateral elements are mapped to the fabrication surface, possibly planar for ease of manufacturing, by accounting for their defects in internal angles. These are accommodated by the lengthening or shortening of the diagonal members through the use of bistable actuators. Using a multi-material 3D printer, we fabricate a planar structure that reconfigures into two distinct and stable target shapes. The proposed method serves as a new direction for the design of material-based reconfigurable systems.},

This tuneability is achieved by exploiting the balance between in-cure phase separation and differential reactivity within the formulation to successfully produce composite structures via both casting and valve-based jetting processes. The structure and properties of both cast and 3D printed materials were examined in a range of compositions of silicone to acrylate between 30:70 and 70:30. The phase segregated structure, evidenced from distinct glass transitions, and the thermal stability of these materials were both shown to be insensitive to the composition ratio, whereas the elastic properties were strongly dependent on the composition. The stiffness could be made to vary from ~50 kPa to ~180 kPa by increasing the silicone content. This study will guide the formation of a new generation of Additive Manufacturing (AM) silicone elastomeric functional structures for various applications ranging from flexible electronics to regenerative medicine, which will benefit from local changes in mechanical properties within the same material family.},

The effect of the process stages on the damage and mechanical properties of a continuous carbon fibre/polyamide filament material is determined. Fibre damage occurs at multiple stages of the FDM process, although most damage occurs in the final stages when the FDM filament is extruded through the printer nozzle and then printed. The average strength of carbon fibres within the FDM filament evaluated in this study is reduced ~33\% by the FDM process. The tensile strength and compression kinking stress of the 3D printed filament material are reduced by ~60\% and ~25\%, respectively. The causes of the damage and the resultant reductions to the mechanical properties of the FDM filament during 3D printing are identified.},

Until now, common techniques such as scratch and indentation tests are used to establish a qualitative ranking of a coating’s adhesion on various substrate materials. Nevertheless, there is a lack of quantitative measures to describe the strength of the interfaces between individual microstructural constituents of substrate-coating composites. The current work investigates the interfacial strength and thus the adhesion of TiN deposited as a hard coating on an MC-type carbide, an M 6 C-type carbide and on martensite being constituents of high speed steels. Tensile stresses were introduced at the interface between TiN and the individual microstructural constituents of a high speed steel via micromechanical testing of a novel MSC specimen within a scanning electron microscope. The tested MSC specimens were subsequently investigated in detail by scanning electron microscopy. Evaluation of the interface stress at fracture via finite element analysis yielded a ranking in interface strength and therefore coating adhesion in a sequence from high to low strength values from MC/TiN over M 6 C/TiN to martensite/TiN.},

The two new structures have greater water contact angles in a low-temperature environment than the conventional structures. We set up corresponding models for various microstructures contacted with water droplets and discuss hydrophobicity diversity.

In this work, the PLA and nucleating agent filled PLA (T-PLA) are coextruded to form the PLA/T-PLA alternating multilayers, in which the multilayered PLA/T-PLA interface induces the formation of the high content, continuous and ordered PLA TC. The SEM, 2D-WAXD and the polarized-FTIR results indicate that the PLA TC is consisted of highly stacked and oriented lamellae, where the b-axis lays perpendicular to, but the a-axis and c-axis PLA lamellae parallel to the multilayered interface. Compared with the spherulites, the compacted and oriented TC has a positive effect on the yielding strength, and this may result from the highly compacted and oriented lamellar arrangement. In brief, here we provide a facile route to construct high content, continuous and ordered PLA TC and thus provides an ideal prototype to further investigate the intrinsic properties of PLA TC.},

  abstract     = {Although the channel architecture of a scaffold is critical for bone regeneration, little is known for the channel direction. In this study, four types of carbonate apatite cylindrical scaffolds; scaffolds with biaxial channels (VH-scaffold), with uniaxial vertical channels (V-scaffold), with uniaxial horizontal channels (H-scaffold), and without channels (N-scaffold), were implanted in a rabbit femur defect for 4 and 12 weeks. Although the largest bone was formed 4 weeks post-implantation in the VH-scaffold, newly formed bone disappeared with the scaffold after 12 weeks. Thus, biaxial channels resulted in the rapid dissolution of the scaffold and were counterproductive in long-term bone regeneration. The V-scaffold that had channels connected to the periosteum was gradually resorbed throughout 12 weeks post-implantation. The percentage of mineralized bone in the V-scaffolds was equal to that in the natural bone. The resorption and bone percentage of H-scaffolds that had no channels connected to the periosteum were slower and lower, respectively, than those of V-scaffolds. Thus, channels should be connected to the periosteum to achieve smooth replacement by the new bone. In the N-scaffold, much less bone was formed inside the scaffold. This study contributes to providing a design guide for scaffold development in bone engineering.},

  abstract     = {Flaw formation in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is influenced by the spatiotemporal temperature distribution – thermal history – of the part during the process. Therefore, to prevent flaw formation there is a need for fast and accurate models that can predict the thermal history as a function of the part shape and processing parameters. In previous work, a thermal modeling approach based on graph theory was used to predict the thermal history in LPBF parts in less-than 20\% of the time required by finite element-based models with error within 10\% of experimental measurements. The present work transitions toward the use of the graph theory approach for predicting flaw formation. The objectives of this paper are to: (1) apply the graph theory approach for predicting the thermal history of several LPBF parts that have different geometries but were all built together on a single build plate; (2) compare the graph theory thermal model with experimental temperature measurements made using an in-situ infrared camera; and (3) relate the thermal history predictions obtained from the graph theory approach to flaw formation in LPBF parts. In pursuit of these objectives, fifteen different Inconel 718 parts encompassing five different shapes were built simultaneously on an open architecture LPBF platform (build time 9.5 h). Second, the LPBF machine was instrumented with an in-situ infrared camera to capture the layer-wise surface temperature of each part as it was being deposited. Third, the thermal history for each part was predicted with the graph theory approach, and the model predictions were assessed against experimental temperature measurements. Fourth, the porosity in certain test parts was quantified with X-ray computed tomography, and their microstructure was characterized with optical and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the shape of the part has a significant effect on the thermal history, and thereby influences the occurrence of build failures (recoater crash), type and severity of porosity, and morphology of the microstructure. The graph theory approach correctly predicted the thermal history trends that lead to flaw formation in LPBF within a fraction of the build time – the root mean squared prediction error was less-than 20 °C, and computation time was approximately 5 min. The graph theory method has the potential to serve LPBF practitioners as a rapid physics-based approach to guide part design and identify suitable processing parameters in place of expensive and time-consuming empirical trial-and-error optimization.},

However, machine-specific, optimized process conditions and parameters are required to assure consistent part quality. In addition, differences in supplied powder can cause variation in the mechanical properties of the final parts. In this paper, the variability in mechanical properties of 316L stainless steel produced with two different laser powder bed fusion machines from two different powder batches was studied by producing an identical set of tensile and impact toughness test specimens. The samples were subjected to stress-relieving, solution annealing and hot isostatic pressing to assess the effectiveness of standardized heat-treatments in reducing variation in the mechanical properties of the built parts. Porosity, microstructure, tensile properties, and impact toughness of the specimens were measured to study the effect of changing the material, machine, and heat treatment. The maximum differences observed between the studied machine-powder combinations were approximately 7\% for tensile properties and approximately 20\% for impact toughness. HIP reduced the variability in all other studied properties except elongation. All the specimens fulfil the minimum requirements set in ASTM F3184-16 for AM 316L.},

The antimicrobial polypeptide (PonG1) and bFGF, were encapsulated in the core of the CS microsphere. The preparation of CS microspheres was studied by changing the parameters. The surface morphology of CS microspheres and the release quantities of PonG1 and bFGF were observed and detected. In vivo experiments were conducted to study the neovascularization and anti-inflammatory abilities of bFGF and PonG1. The repair ability of CS microspheres was evaluated using a rat model of full-thickness skin wound. Both bFGF and PonG1 exhibited slow release from the CS microspheres within 14 days. In vivo experiments showed that CS microspheres containing PonG1 (3 mg/ml) and bFGF (300 μg/ml) had the best neovascularization and anti-inflammatory effects. CS microspheres containing both bFGF and PonG1 had the strongest ability to repair skin wound.

The shape of the cavity was designed as a mechanical test sample scaled down from the standard tensile specimen. The micro-molded specimens were subjected to tensile tests and Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) measurements to analyze their mechanical properties and possible macromolecular alterations, respectively. The influence of process parameters on the injection rate and mechanical properties was obtained by orthogonal and single factor experiments. The results show that the simultaneous plasticizing and filling process can be quantitatively characterized by the injection rate which is significantly affected by the plunger speed. With the capability of the present experimental setting, a maximum injection rate of 237 mg/s for polypropylene can be achieved via process optimization. Particularly, it was confirmed that higher injection rates can be utilized for increased molding efficiency while without undermining the mechanical properties of micro-molded specimens according to the tensile tests and GPC measurements.},

Several characterization tests were conducted to study and compare the performance of the samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated the successful fabrication of nanofibers with diameter range of 140–240 nm as well as nanoparticles with average sizes within the range of 6 nm and 9 nm. The effect of annealing and RuO 2 addition was illustrated by the decrease in fibers diameter. The vibration mode and structure of the samples were studied by Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTIR) along with Raman spectroscopy that revealed the strong interaction as well as crosslinking between the polymer blend and RuO 2 . The annealed samples exhibit enhanced thermal stability and less crystallinity as compared to the as prepared samples according to thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) along with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Impedance spectroscopy tests were conducted to study the electrical properties of the samples as a function of ruthenium oxide concentration and temperature. The results illustrated the increase in resistivity as well as the activation energy with the increase of nanoparticle concentration due to the reduction in the free SO 3 H groups because of the strong ionic crosslinking. These observations revealed the enhancement of nanofiber properties at low temperatures, which make them suitable for different applications including supercapacitor as well as sensor applications at low temperatures.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing, e.g. by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), is very attractive for lightweight constructions, as complex and stress-optimised structures integrating multiple functions can be produced within one process. Unfortunately, high strength AlZnMgCu alloys tend to hot cracking during LPBF and thus have not so far been applicable. In this work the melting and solidification behaviour of AlZnMgCu alloy powder variants with particle surface inoculation was analysed by Differential Fast Scanning Calorimetry. The aim is to establish a method that makes it possible to assess powder modifications in terms of their suitability for LPBF on a laboratory scale requiring only small amounts of powder. Therefore, solidification undercooling is evaluated at cooling rates relevant for LPBF. A method for the temperature correction and normalisation of the DFSC results is proposed. Two ways of powder modification were tested for the powder particles surface inoculation by titanium carbide (TiC) nanoparticles: via wet-chemical deposition and via mechanical mixing. A low undercooling from DFSC correlates with a low number of cracks of LPBF-manufactured cubes. It appears that a reduced undercooling combined with reduced solidification onset scatter indicates the possibility of crack-free LPBF of alloys that otherwise tend to hot cracking.},

Herein, a frugal and facile approach is reported for decorating MoS 2 nanosheets on copper nanorods to design MoS 2 /Cu architecture as a trifunctional catalyst for electrochemical water splitting and photocatalytic CO 2 conversion. Under optimized conditions, MoS 2 /Cu electrocatalyst shows high performance at an overpotential of 252 mV for oxygen evolution reaction and 160 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction to attain 20 mAcm −2 and 10 mAcm −2 current densities in alkaline medium. The improved efficiency is mainly credited to the synergistic effect of MoS 2 nanosheets and Cu nanorods architecture. The electrode delivered a cell voltage of ~1.508 V to impart about 10 mAcm −2 current density with high durability. Also, the negligible overpotential decay after running the cell for 12 h with 3000/HER and 2000/OER CV cycles suggests remarkable stability that makes it a promising electrocatalyst for energy production. The photocatalytic CO 2 conversion activity was also measured, where MoS 2 /Cu exhibited a significant efficiency of CO 2 to methane conversion (CH 4 ~ 23 µmol g −1 h −1 ). Based on the obtained results, it is foreseeable that this work validates the significance of transition metals tuning for electrocatalysts and photocatalysts toward more efficient water electrolysis and CO 2 reduction for potential large-scale energy applications.},

Transmission electron microscopy observations confirmed the existence of strain fields generated by Mrozowski cracks, manufacturing and neutron irradiation in multiple graphite grades. This research confirms the existence of crystal strains in filler particles and quinoline insoluble (QI) particles. The observations gathered in this research indicate that crystal strains provide different degrees of rigidity to the filler and binder phase.

The main attention is paid to the analysis of experimental results on investigation of noble metals (Ir, Pt, Pd, Ag, Au) as multifunctional biocompatible and antibacterial materials in medical practice. In contrast to recent reviews that discussed individual classes of implantable materials or properties and applications of metal nanoparticles, this review attempts to generalize data on the modification of implant surfaces by thin films of platinum group metals and silver or gold nanoparticles. The formation of the “implant of the future” requires a comprehensive approach and solution of interrelated tasks, including selection of effective implant materials and methods of implant surface modification.

The temperature gradient (TG) induced gene clusters that carried the information similar to the solid-state crystals and conical cavities that provided preferred nucleation sites at one side of the joints were identified as the keys for generating heredity effect. There was non-heredity effect in Cu/Sn/Cu joints whether the joints were reflowed under TG or not for the first time due to the absence of gene clusters and in Cu/Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu(SAC305)/Cu joints during isothermal multi-reflow due to the absence of deep and narrow conical cavities. However, the Cu/SAC305/Cu joints that had orientated β-Sn grains after the first reflow under TG exhibited remarkable heredity effect during the subsequent second and third reflow. The critical peak reflow temperature was confirmed to be 255 °C over which the heredity effect disappeared. A general guidance of the strategies for inducing heredity effect in Cu/SAC305/Cu joints during multi-reflow process was demonstrated focusing on reflow temperature, times, duration, cooling rate and TG. The novel reflow method is believed to be beneficial to improve the reliability and anisotropy of micro solder joints containing few β-Sn grains.},

  abstract     = {Recent progress in manufacturing now enables the efficient fabrication of complex oxide-glass components at the micrometer– to sub-micrometer scale. This benefits both the industry and fundamental research as such miniature glass parts have numerous applications. However, at these length-scales, the mechanical properties of glasses can no longer be predicted based on bulk material characteristics. Here it is shown that fused silica micro-pillars fabricated by laser-assisted etching are almost ten times stronger than their bulk-sized counterparts. The relatively rough surface typical for this process does not much impair this strength. Additionally, it is demonstrated that annealing of the as-fabricated structures at 1200 °C in air results in significantly smoother surfaces. The accompanying increase in mechanical strength from approximately 8 GPa to 10 GPa is due to the reduction of stress concentrations at the surface, as demonstrated by finite element simulations. It is also demonstrated that the gain in mechanical resistance of glass components due to downsizing occurs already for parts as large as almost 20 µm – orders of magnitude above the critical size reported for other micro-mechanical effects. These micro-mechanical properties of selective laser-assisted etching structured fused silica components are key to a reliable use of glass micro-components.},

  abstract     = {The construction of a hierarchically ordered “brick-and-mortar” structure with a high content of “brick” phase is a key challenge in the preparation of nacre-mimetic composites. Herein, inspired by the transverse cracks in the ceramic lamellae after freeze-drying caused by the secondary nucleation of ice crystals during directional freezing of water-based ceramic slurry, we propose a new idea to use these structural defects and an in-situ reaction to construct composites with a nacre-like “brick-and-mortar” structure and high hard-phase content. This uses ice-templating to first prepare lamellar TiO 2 scaffolds with transverse cracks that separated the ceramic lamellae into “brick” whose size was controlled by adjusting the initial ceramic particle size (50, 300, and 700 nm). After the reactive infiltration, these cracks were filled with molten Al, leading to the formation of a “brick-and-mortar” structure with a high hard-phase content (86 vol\%). The increasing ceramic particle size reduced the hard-phase content but significantly increased the aspect ratio (height/width) of the ceramic “brick” and the fracture toughness. The excellent damage tolerance was attributed to multiple toughening mechanisms, i.e. , multiple cracking, crack deflection, and uncracked-ligament bridging of the metal layers. The existence of “mortar” increased the probability of the formation of multiple cracking.},

However, despite planar geometry pertains to a large part of modern technology, no information is available yet on the scalability of Ga-oxide segregation mechanisms in oxide thin films . In fact, incorporated Ga-oxide nanostructures have only been obtained in bulk materials. Here we show that deposition of Ga-alkali-germanosilicate thin films by radiofrequency-plasma sputtering gives rise to Ga-oxide nanostructures incorporated in an amorphous matrix. X-ray diffraction, X-ray reflectivity , small-angle X-ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy data unveil the formation of lenticular nanoaggregates, only a few nm thick, even in as-deposited materials as a result of two-dimensional aggregation of spinel-like Ga 2 O 3 nanoparticles . Importantly, the aggregate size distribution is controlled not only by the temperature but also by the film thickness when it is reduced from 10 2 nm to only a few nm. The results open the way to the design of oxide-in-oxide thin films with incorporated networks of nanostructures which can act as percolation paths for unconventional electric responses in neuromorphic functional systems.},

X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that annealing temperature played a key role in the crystallinity and phase composition. Due to the coexistent of fine grains and amorphous phase, PHO AFE films annealed at 650 °C displayed not only optimal energy-storage density and energy efficiency, but also excellent thermal stability and fatigue endurance.

How to maximize the structural efficiency of a part to achieve the desired performance has become the focus and challenge of design for additive manufacturing (DFAM). To give full play to the complex-geometry, multi-material, multi-scale, and multi-function manufacturing capabilities of AM, new approaches in DFAM have to be explored. The relationship between stress and growth in biology indicates that naturally evolved perfect structures are all optimal responses to their applied force. This work discusses a novel method to DFAM at the macroscale , mesoscale and microscale from a force-flow perspective, aiming to achieve an organic integration of force-flow based design with AM-driven manufacturing. Firstly, the characteristics of force-flow and its embodiment in nature and engineering are analyzed. Then, an overview of topology optimization, lattice/cellular structure design and infill pattern design are respectively provided in the combination of force-flow and AM. Finally, the future development directions of DFAM based on force-flow are proposed according to the limitations of current research.},

Without preheating procedure, the softening point did not show a positive effect on the conductivity of modified salts, but changed the salt-releasing property after being mixed with the asphalt concrete. Further testing through simultaneous thermal analysis and scanning electron microscope has shown that the experience of high temperatures (between 100 and 200 °C) softens the small hydrophobic particles into thin layers coated on the surface of the salt, while hydrophobers decompose at temperatures above 200 °C. The result of heating cycles indicates that, based on the SEM observation, there are four situations of hydrophobic polymer particles on the salt surface. The salt-releasing property trends could be divided into three typical patterns. Generally, a higher softening point of hydrophober produces a better moisture susceptibility of the AFACs, while the pre-heating treatment on salts reduced the moisture susceptibility of AFACs.},

The results show that RST and RA treatment can improve the corrosion resistance without sacrificing the strength compared to T6 temper . The aging precipitation process is reversible, and the number and distribution of δ’, T 1 and θ’ precipitates can be effectively regulated by the RA treatment, so that the strength of the alloy approximately reaches the level of T6 temper and the ductility is improved. The corrosion mode of the alloy changed from pitting into intergranular corrosion during RST and RA treatment. The coarsening and discontinuous distribution of grain boundary precipitates as well as the increase of precipitate-free zone (PFZ) width inhibit the generation and propagation of stress corrosion cracking and thereby improve the corrosion resistance of the alloy. The increase of Cu content in grain boundary reduces the electrochemical corrosion sensitivity of the alloy. The optimal process parameters of RST and RA treatment for 2196 Al-Cu-Li alloy are finally determined to be 515 °C for 90 min and 170 °C for 24 h.},

The developed finite element model predicts the thermal history and the melt pool dimension evolution in the middle section of the clad during deposition. Numerical results were correlated with experimental analysis (light optical and scanning electron microscopies and thermocouple records) to validate the model and discuss the possible solidification mechanisms. It was proven that implementation of forced convection in the boundary conditions was of great importance to ensure equilibrium between input energy and heat losses. The maximum peak temperature shows a slight increase trend for the first few layers, followed by an apparent stabilization with increasing clad height. That demonstrates the high heat loss through boundaries. While in literature, most of the modeling studies are focused on single or few layer geometries, this work describes a multi-layered model able to predict the thermal field history during deposition and give consistent data about the new materiel. The model can be applied on other shapes under recalibration. The methodology of calibration is detailed as well as the sensitivity analysis to input parameters.},

Twin-cantilever beams and cubic coupons were printed in a wide range of process parameters to characterize residual stresses under preheated and non-preheated conditions. Results revealed the significant role of martensitic phase transformation, process parameters, densification level, and preheating condition on the residual stress regime and beam deflections . The residual stress regime was governed by the competition between the tensile and compressive stresses caused by the solidification/cooling contraction and martensitic phase transformation, respectively. The compressive residual stresses on the top surface turned into tensile immediately below the last consolidated layer. Higher heat inputs led to the increased magnitude of compressive residual stresses on the top surface of non-preheated samples. For parts having relative densities higher than 97\%, the residual stresses were found to be independent of the densification level. Deflection modeling results indicated that for steels experiencing martensitic phase transformation, the martensite start temperature needs to be set as the relaxation temperature to accurately predict the beam deflection. This study proves that 200 °C of preheating eliminates not only cracks but also the need for stress-relief post-processing.},

  abstract     = {The present study investigated the sensitivity of material constitutive models on thermomechanical responses in laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V. Uniform scan strategies with scan lengths of 0.5, 1, and 2 mm were applied so that wide ranges of thermal histories could be generated. The Johnson-Cook (JC) and Mechanical Threshold Stress (MTS) material plasticity models were chosen to capture the influence of strain, strain rate , and temperature. The JC model is a phenomenological model which is known for its easy implementation and excellent agreement with material testing results. On the other hand, the MTS model is a more complex physics-based internal state variable plasticity model that is expected to provide more accurate estimation, particularly for cases involving changes in strain rate and temperature. Numerical results revealed that both JC and MTS models provided a similar stress evolution, however, the plastic strain evolution was more realistic using the MTS model. Moreover, it was found that the maximum strain and the strain rate in the LPBF process are high compared to typical quasi-static testing, i.e., ~ 2\% and ~ 4 s −1 , respectively. Accordingly, the material models should be calibrated with data obtained under similar deformation conditions . The choice of scan length also strongly affects in-plane stress anisotropy. Ultimately, we show both qualitatively and quantitatively the dependency of mechanical behavior prediction in LPBF on the choice of material models.},

Herein, a facile micro-scale thermal functional unit structure is proposed assisted by an advanced picosecond laser technology to realize the fabrication of thermal metamaterials with thermal shielding and thermal concentrating. To obtain the optimal design criterion of thermal functional units, the effects of thermal conductivity ratio, layer orientation angle, and laminated thickness on thermal conduction are investigated. Both simulation and experiment validate that thermal metamaterials assembled by diverse thermal functional units with different orientation angles exhibit completely neoteric performances of thermal concentrating and shielding. Besides, the results verify that the micro-scale thermal metamaterials exhibit better heat flux regulation capability and higher thermal concentration efficiency. Additionally, the effect of inevitable air convection on the thermal performance of these metamaterials has also been evaluated. This work provides an effective strategy to achieve small-scale thermal energy harvesting and protection by using thermal metamaterials with micro-structure.},

  abstract     = {Although various alloy systems have been explored for additive manufacturing (AM) during the past decade, introducing a new alloy remains a challenging task. Most of the materials require iterative builds, for investigating numerous parameters and determining a viable and repeatable process window. Among the challenging yet highly demanded materials, Haynes 282 superalloy was chosen. It was initially processed through conventional density cube approach, by varying the process parameters for each processed cube. Although the relative densities of the initial builds were not dramatically low, micro-cracks were present in all of them, mostly evolved on a selective number of grain boundaries and spanning only across a single laser path. Detailed modelling and advanced characterization techniques were employed to understand the root cause and cracking mechanism . It was found that the grain boundary precipitates are responsible for crack initiation, amid stress gradient across the grain boundary due to the adjacent grain orientations. Therefore, the failure mechanism is determined as ductility-dip cracking. Based on the findings, a new process window was defined using elevated temperature and novel scanning strategy. No cracks were observed under the modified processing window, meaning that the material can reliably be processed by laser beam powder bed fusion (PBF-LB).},

  abstract     = {Functionally graded triply periodic minimal surface ( TPMS ) structures are characterized by their various structures and mechanical properties , thereby exhibiting better mechanical performance than uniform structures. At present, most graded TPMS structures in studies possess unidirectional variable densities. However, when performing lattice optimization on an actual engineering model, the required multidirectional graded TPMS structure still relies on manual work, including parameter adjustment and modelling, so the optimization process is cumbersome and the design is suboptimal. In this paper, a new design method is proposed that realizes the stable and adaptive generation and optimization of functionally graded TPMS structures. This procedure is divided into two stages. In the preparation stage, the performance regulation of the TPMS and the values of von Mises stress are obtained from mesoscopic and macroscopic scales, respectively. In the optimization stage, optimization algorithms based on voxels are proposed so that functionally graded TPMS structures can be automatically obtained in different situations. Based on the simulation results, the compressive properties of our optimized design improves by 25.23\% compared with that of the uniform structure and 8.63\% compared with the functionally graded TPMS structure with topology optimization, which confirms the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is the most widely used additive manufacturing technique and has received increasing attention owing to the high design freedom it offers. The production of aluminium alloys by LPBF has attracted considerable interest in several fields due to the low density of the produced alloys. The peculiar solidification conditions experienced by molten metal during the SLM process and its layer-by-layer nature causes a variety of microstructural peculiarities including the formation of metastable phases and supersaturated solid solutions, extreme microstructural refinement, and generation of residual stresses. Therefore, post-build heat treatments, which are commonly applied to conventionally produced aluminium alloys, may need to be modified in order to be adapted to the peculiar metallurgy of aluminium alloys manufactured using LPBF and address the specific issues resulting from the process itself. A number of studies have investigated this topic in recent years, proposing different approaches and dealing with various alloying systems. This paper reviews scientific research results in the field of heat treatment of selective laser melted aluminium alloys; it aims at providing a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the induced microstructure and the resulting mechanical behaviour , as a function of the various treatment strategies.},

With the development of new manufacturing methodologies such as additive manufacturing , not only can the outer shape of a scaffold (the macroarchitecture) be personalized, but also the microarchitecture, defined as the distribution of material within the scaffold, can be designed and optimized for bone ingrowth . Our study assessed the optimal pore-based microarchitecture for osteoconduction in comparison to vertical bone augmentation. Histological analysis of the samples from an osteoconduction and a bone augmentation model showed that the best microarchitecture to achieve vertical bone augmentation contained pores of 1.7 mm diameter and differed from the optimal microarchitecture for osteoconduction, which contained pores of 1.2 mm diameter. The extent of vertical bone augmentation correlated with increasing pore diameter . Moreover, the differences between the microarchitectures were highly significant for osteoconduction, but less significant for vertical bone augmentation. Thus, our results suggest that the microarchitectures of the scaffolds in vertical bone augmentation and in bone regeneration of a defect are crucial determinants of the depth of bone ingrowth and the area of bony regeneration. However, the microarchitecture appears to be more crucial in osteoconduction.},

To understand the creep behaviour of LPBF alloy 718, parts were fabricated using different scanning strategies and build orientations and creep tested at 650 °C under a 600 MPa load. Heat treatment increased the creep life by a factor of 5, confirming its necessity. The build orientation and stress state were shown to be determining factors in the creep failure mechanisms. The Meander scanning strategy resulted in a 58\% increase in creep life compared to the Stripe strategy, due to the detrimental effects of the numerous laser overlapping regions in the Stripe strategy. For a given strategy, a 24\% increase in creep life compared to wrought alloy 718 was observed, indicating that LPBF has the potential to surpass wrought material properties .

  abstract     = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is increasingly accepted as a cancer treatment because it can target the tumor precisely and treat it noninvasively. The therapeutic effect of PDT is generally affected by three parameters: the light, the photosensitizers (PSs), and the local oxygen, where the performance of the PSs with light is greatly affected by the availability of local oxygen. However, hypoxia is one of the typical characteristics of the microenvironment in solid tumors, which renders the efficacy of PDT in cancer treatment. Here, we introduced a novel nanozyme platform, which composed of metal-organic frameworks (MOF) derived materials and could directly load the PSs. The nanozyme could generate oxygen by catalyzing H 2 O 2 , which enhanced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and resulted in an improved cytotoxic effect of the PSs. We showed that, especially under the hypoxic environment, this nanozyme could alleviate the hypoxic situation by generating oxygen in the H 2 O 2 solution and further improved the therapeutic effect of PDT consequently. In conclusion, this nanozyme platform allows the loading of PSs with ease and can catalyze H 2 O 2 to generate oxygen to enhance the effect of PDT for cancer treatment in both normoxic and hypoxic environments.},

  abstract     = {The optimisation of processing parameters to produce high densification AlSi10Mg parts by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) has received considerable attention in recent years. Nonetheless, it is important to consider the potential presence of as-built large pores in real world applications , e.g. due to limitations of the available LPBF system, time and cost constraints associated with producing near-perfect density and so on. In this work, recycled powder was used to fabricate AlSi10Mg specimens with sub-optimal densification by LPBF and an experimental investigation into the evolution of specimen porosity occurring under increasing tensile load was performed. A combination of high-resolution X-ray micro computed tomography (XμCT) and an in-situ micro-testing stage was employed to acquire 3D images at different loading stages. Specimens were tested in the as-built condition and following hot isostatic pressing (HIPping) or HIPping with T6. As-built porosity did not change markedly in the lead-up to brittle-like fracture. Pores within ductile HIPped specimens were uniformly elongated up to the onset of damage propagation and pore coalescence . Pore shape change occurred largely without volume change at small extension. HIPping plus T6 produced a compromise between as-built and HIPped conditions in terms of the extent of pore modification observed prior to failure.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques have been widely used to fabricate structural components with complex geometries. Understanding AM materials under extreme environments is crucial for their implementation in various engineering sectors. In this study, the deformation behavior and irradiation damage of 316 L stainless steel (SS) fabricated by the direct energy deposition (DED) process are investigated. The fabrication-induced nanopores with an average diameter of 200 nm exhibit a core-shell structure with a local tensile strain . The precession electron diffraction (PED) reveals that austenite-to-martensite phase transformation preferentially occurs around the nanopores under tension test at room temperature. Proton irradiation experiments performed at 360 °C to a fluence of 1.09 × 10 19 cm −2 and 5.42 × 10 19 cm −2 show that the DED fabricated 316 L SS exhibits a stronger void-swelling resistance and lower dislocation loop density than its wrought counterpart. AM-induced features, such as nanopores and sub-grain boundaries, could serve as defect sinks to absorb irradiation-induced defects. The design of microstructure using AM processes opens up new avenues for the development of irradiation tolerant materials for nuclear applications.},

Homogenization using MSG is conducted on a structure genome (SG) that incorporates the basic building details of the heterogeneous microstructure from the grain level and the modeling is carried out using the constitutive behaviors of the constituent phases with the evolution of microstructure without redoing homogenization. The microstructure-based MSG was employed to simulate the compression and tensile behaviors of AMed Ti6Al4V based on their microstructures. The predicted true stress-strain curves were then compared to the corresponding curves acquired from experimental testing. The simulation results matched well with the experimental results and showed the existence of martensite to be the reason behind the high strength in the AMed Ti6Al4V and the reduced ductility. Additionally, the inclusion of the microstructure in the SG allowed the MSG simulations to conform to the experiments in showing the reductions in the strengths and improvements in the maximum elongations in the AMed+heat treated Ti6Al4V due to grain coarsening and absence of martensite.},

A series of statistical models were applied to analyze the mechanical properties and followed by mapping the curve of cumulative failure rate for wire application. It was found that the average and highest fracture strengths , average tensile strain increased with Cu substitution and reached peaks of ~3725 MPa, ~4250 MPa and ~2.7\%, respectively. Verified structure-simulation experiments revealed that surface Rayleigh waves effectively split the main crack and the diffusely distributed nanocrystalline in surface area acted as a pinning point to impede the crack growth, enhancing the mechanical properties. The GMI ratio displayed similar variations and attained a maximum value of 700 ± 5\% as well as the resistance and reactance ratios improved to ~687\% and ~2206\%, respectively.

The bonding strength and failure work values reached 6.45 MPa and 316 mJ/cm 2 , respectively. The images of the de-bonded polymer surfaces indicated that the interlocks were established by the polymer which diffused into the pores after the vaporing of the bonding solvent and underwent different degrees of deformation when the metal surface was filled with different scales of complex nanopores network structure, which is a determinant of obtaining bonding strength, while on the other hand, negative factors to the bonding performance were also discussed.

  abstract     = {The unprecedented increase in component design space has led to significant focus on fusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) technologies. The new design possibilities integrate features and functionalities that are not supported by conventional manufacturing, and simultaneously achieve unitization of components. However, fusion-based AM suffers from a lack of diverse alloys, as conventional high-strength Al alloys are prone to hot cracking and other defect formation during printing. New alloy design approaches are being pursued to overcome these limitations. Current strategies for design of printable Al alloys for laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) are primarily experimental and revolve around grain refinement and eutectic solidification (ES). Each of these strategies targets hot cracking at only a specific stage of solidification. Consequently, the processing window of the alloy shrinks and fine-tuning of the alloy microstructure becomes difficult, thus prohibiting the activation of multiple deformation mechanisms . On the other hand, strategies that integrate microstructural refinement (MR) and ES attack the problem during multiple stages of solidification. Such MR+ES integrated alloy design strategies allow widening of alloy-processing-window (printability) and activation of multiple deformation mechanisms such as back-stress strengthening and work-hardening, thus producing alloys with excellent synergy of printability and performance.},

ESEM was employed to examine the microstructure of binders as well, and a series of microstructure parameters were quantified with image analysis. The results demonstrated that the chemical composition changes correspond to the evolution of microstructure morphological and rheological properties. Moreover, the rheological and microstructure characteristics were analyzed with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and regression analysis. Based on PCA results, the microstructure of rejuvenated binders has shown a good correlation with stiffness after combining various principal components. According to regression analysis, the distance between adjacent fibrils exhibited a significant correlation with J nr3.2 and the complex modulus index. Overall, the results of this study strengthen the hypothesis that the ESEM microstructure is intimately correlated with chemical composition and rheological properties, rather than with irrelevant surface phenomena.

This original setup allows for hybrid and homogeneous heating of nuclear fuels. Reliable in situ monitoring of the samples&#39; shrinkage and temperature is performed with an optical dilatometer and infrared pyrometers calibrated with a specific protocol. A dedicated software including a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller was developed to precisely control the sintering cycles like under conventional heating. The setup is also designed for operating in a glovebox under reducing sintering atmosphere. A stable and homogeneous heating with controlled sintering cycles is reached to successfully sinter UO 2 crack free pellets to high density. This is a key point of innovation compared to previous studies in the literature on microwave sintering of nuclear ceramics. The pellets&#39; final densities are equivalent to those obtained under conventional sintering, but with a significant decrease in the total duration of the sintering cycle.},

The second-order elastic constants are calculated by least-square fitting of the analytical expressions of stress/strain relationships to simulation results obtained from three tensile and three shear deformation modes. Sound-velocity measurements are employed to validate AIMD values of bulk, shear, and elastic moduli of single-phase B1 (Ti,Zr,Hf,Ta,W)C and (V,Nb,Ta,Mo,W)C at ambient conditions. In comparison with the predictions of previous ab initio calculations – where the extrapolation of finite-temperature elastic properties accounted for thermal expansion while neglecting intrinsic vibrational effects – AIMD simulations produce a softening of shear elastic moduli with T in closer agreement with experiments. The results show that TaC is the system which exhibits the highest elastic resistances to tensile and shear deformation up to 1200 K, and indicate the (V,Nb,Ta,Mo,W)C system as candidate for applications that require superior toughness at room as well as elevated temperatures.},

However, current production and characterization workflows still rely on manual, time-consuming, and low-throughput processes, ultimately limiting widespread adaption. To address these challenges, an open-source technology platform is engineered and validated for automated high-throughput production of GelMA-based 3D constructs by integrating automated pipetting capabilities for viscous and non-viscous liquids. Firstly, the platform is applied in combination with inexpensive absorbance measurements to systematically optimize the mixing sequence for GelMA-based precursor solutions . This enables a decrease in the relative standard deviation of the prepared mixtures from 63\% to 2.5\%, demonstrating a significantly improved reproducibility. Next, the applicability and high-throughput capacity are demonstrated by the reproducible generation of GelMA dilution series with 0.5 and 2\% ( w / v ) concentration steps as well as double network hydrogels consisting of 2\% ( w / v ) alginate and 5\% ( w / v ) GelMA. Finally, a simple and user-friendly methodology is described that integrates Design of Experiments approaches to systematically study the combinatorial effects of material and crosslinking parameters and to establish a parameter library for on-demand production of mechanically defined GelMA-based hydrogels. The platform enables reproducible production and offers an open-source and accessible alternative to high-priced liquid-handling robots and bioprinters.},

  abstract     = {Superhydrophobic and superoleophilic (SHSO) membranes have gained remarkable attention, particularly in selective and efficient oil-water separation applications. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the SHSO membranes, fabrication and characterization methods, the advantages and disadvantages of the fabrication techniques , current status and prospects of SHSO surfaces, and potential future research directions. Chemicals such as silanes , thiols, fatty acids, carbon nanotubes, and polyethylene-based polymers are commonly used to adjust the surface energy for the SHSO membranes. These membranes have been proven successful in selectively separating oil from oil-water mixtures with oil separation efficiency &gt;99\%. Although there are limited studies on the short-term stability assessment of the SHSO coatings upon exposure to acid and alkaline environments , the effects of temperature, and adsorption of heavier components of the crude oils (such as asphaltenes , and resins) on the separation efficiency have not been adequately investigated yet. Moreover, the fouling performance of the SHSO membranes with water-derived fouling is surprisingly missing in oil-water separation applications in the literature. With the breakthrough in technology, the use of 2D materials such as graphene and high-resolution 3D printers to create hierarchical features on membranes, research on application of SHSO membranes in oil-water separation processes can be further advanced.},

By using this analytical design method, the design of the bi-layer ceramic armor can be more efficiency and the material of armor can be selected more accurately.},

Additionally, with the recent proliferation of additive manufacturing tools across industrial sectors, the ability to readily fabricate geometrically complex metamaterials is now possible. However, in many high-performance applications involving complex multi-physics interactions, design of novel lattice metamaterials is still difficult. Design is primarily guided by human intuition or gradient optimization for simple problems. In this work, we show how machine learning guides discovery of new unit cells that are Pareto optimal for multiple competing objectives; specifically, maximizing elastic stiffness during static loading and minimizing wave speed through the metamaterial during an impact event. Additionally, we show that our artificial intelligence approach works with relatively few (3500) simulation calls.},

The interfacial chemical bonding between TiO 2 and the CP could act as a linker for close proximity of two species for easy transfer of the excited electrons from the CP to the conduction band of TiO 2 , which significantly enhanced the photocatalytic efficiency in the visible range. The robust covalent bond between the CP and TiO 2 led to increased stability during photocatalysis , enabling repeated use after simple washing. Moreover, the hydrophilic surface of the photocatalyst could be fabricated by modifying the CP on the photocatalyst&#39;s surface. Such a wettability change of the photocatalyst&#39;s surface allowed the photocatalyst to be used in reduction and oxidation reactions with high efficiency in both water and organic solvents .

The results reveal the complex interplay between the various damage dissipation mechanisms. The effects of modifying the matrix of the skins with polysiloxane core–shell rubber (CSR) nanoparticles and silica nanoparticles were investigated. Single cantilever beam specimens were tested to evaluate skin-core debonding. The addition of CSR nanoparticles to the matrix beyond 3 wt\% causes a change in failure mechanism from sub-interface foam failure to interfacial failure when 6 and 9 wt\% CSR are added. The sandwich structures were impacted with an aluminium projectile at 130 m/s. High speed cameras were used to obtain 3D digital image correlation of the back-face. Sectioning and imaging of the panels revealed damage in the form of front skin perforation and delamination , crushing and fracture of the core and back-face skin-core debonding. The impacted specimens also exhibited a transition in failure mechanism relating to rear face skin-core debonding between 3 and 6 wt\%. Panels containing low amounts of CSR resulted in increased core cracking, while beyond the transition point, widespread rear face skin-core debonding was observed. At 3 wt\% CSR, optimum back face deflection is achieved, and lower front skin delamination is experienced.},

The microstructure, and the superelastic behavior of additively manufactured samples were assessed by a detailed comparison with induction melted material. The precipitation of the α phase, which inhibit the martensitic transformation, were not observed in the additively manufactured samples owing to the high intrinsic cooling rates during the fabrication process. Fine columnar grains with a strong [001]-texture along the building direction lead to an enhanced yield strength compared to the coarse-grained cast samples. A maximum recoverable strain of 2.86\% was observed after 5\% compressive loading .

We used this hydrogel to prepare an active biofilm with uniform pores using modified autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) technology to effectively repair cartilage defects. The Alg/Gel/HA composite hydrogel combined with FN promoted the chondrogenic differentiation of CPCs by upregulating their gene expression of collagen II, SOX9, and especially PRG4. Adjacent biofilm provided adequate mechanical support and architectural integrity, offering a stable postoperative microenvironment for bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) released from subchondral bone , and ensured that a laminar structure similar to natural hyaline cartilage was regenerated in the rat cartilage defect model. Characteristic cartilage-like lacuna structures and a gradient structure were observed in the AMIC+FN + CPCs group. We developed an effective method to regenerate full-thickness cartilage defects, this biofunctionalized cell-laden biofilm has great potential for application as a supplement to traditional AMIC technology to improve the quality of cartilage regeneration in a relatively feasible way.},

Compositional gradients of C and Mn were characterized qualitatively and quantitatively through electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) results were utilized to identify and segment the microstructural constituents. A novel nanoindentation approach was used to obtain hardness maps. Cube-corner indenter and micro-newton load were applied to limit the indent depth and spacing between adjacent indents to the nanometer scale.

  abstract     = {Aluminum alloys fabricated by spray forming (SF) technology are commonly followed by hot-working without heat treatments. A new approach that is a pretreatment before hot-working is proposed in the present work. The results show that the microstructural stability of materials processed by this new approach is improved evidently, which is related to the pinning effect on dislocations and grain boundaries by Al 3 Zr particles induced during pretreatment. The strength of SF Al alloy processed by this treatment can be enhanced significantly. Owing to the combined effect of grain refinement strengthening, dislocation strengthening and precipitation strengthening, the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength can be enhanced by 171 MPa and 143 MPa, respectively. Based on experimental characterizations and a physical-based model, the underlying mechanisms regarding on enhancement of mechanical properties is mainly related to the induced Al 3 Zr particles and the optimized precipitates by the pretreatment.},

  abstract     = {The integration of shape memory materials into additive manufacturing has added a new dimension of time to conventional 3D printing and enabled innovative product designs with high tailorability and adaptability. To date, most studies on shape memory effects mainly adopt experimental approaches to characterize the material responsiveness to various stimulation conditions considering a single thermomechanical loading cycle. The information regarding the cyclic shape memory behaviors as well as the potential additive manufacturing-induced impacts on the achieved shape memory performance is limited. In this paper, the shape memory behaviors of the stereolithography printed thermo-responsive structures are theoretically modeled by jointly considering the influences from both the printing process and the shape memory process. The cyclic shape memory effects are analytically characterized and experimentally validated using methacrylate copolymers under iterative thermomechanical loadings. Meanwhile, case studies are presented to provide insights into shape memory behaviors upon the impacts of various levels of critical process parameters. The results indicate an exceptional prediction accuracy of 96.24\% and 95.73\% for the established shape fixity and recovery models, respectively. It is also observed that the printing process parameters, including layer thickness and scan speed, have considerable impacts on the shape memory performance of the printed parts.},

Herein, thin film UV photodetectors based on inorganic ZnO/SrCoO x heterojunction are designed and fabricated on flexible polyimide substrate at room temperature. The built-in electric field between n-type ZnO and p-type SrCoO x films facilitates the separation and transportation of photogenerated carriers without any external bias. A high photosensitivity of (73.8 mA/W) and a quick response time (0.6/4.8 ms) at zero bias are realized under UV light illumination. Moreover, a long-term stability and a good flexibility are also demonstrated. This self-powered flexible UV photodetector fabricated at room temperature is a promising candidate for future energy-efficient, wearable and lightweight optoelectronic devices.},

Powder size distribution (PSD) is an important parameter governing the densification of powders and the overall quality of as-built S-DMLS parts. Therefore, this work aims to reveal the underlying mechanism of layer-by-layer powder compact densification during the S-DMLS with different PSDs via a multi-scale computational framework: 1) a powder-based 3D heat transfer simulation is conducted to predict the thermal response at the macroscale during laser heating; 2) the obtained thermal information is input to a non-isothermal phase-field model to simulate the sintering behavior of powder particles in a layer-by-layer manner at the mesoscale . Using stainless steel 316 L as an example, a narrow PSD presents a small volume of gap between powders with an elevated effective thermal conductivity , causing a deep laser-induced heating zone that promotes full grain coalescence and reduces porosity during the S-DMLS. Furthermore, a bimodal powder mixture with an optimized size ratio can also effectively reduce the porosity of as-built S-DMLS parts. Moreover, the effect of layer-wise manufacturing on the densification is comprehensively explored. Finally, the influences of laser beam size and scanning speed are discussed.},

Herein, the surface reactivity and corrosion behavior of 304 L stainless steel specimens, deformed to different strain levels, was analyzed using advanced multimodal and multiscale methods. For the first time, we observed that localized deformation regions, e.g., deformation bands and α’-martensite featured smaller Volta potentials than the parent austenite matrix. This resulted in the establishment of localized corrosion potential gradients and the emergence of accelerated microscale galvanic corrosion . Particularly, regions that featured higher dislocation concentrations were more reactive on account of the reduction in the activation energy of corrosion due to the stored energy. The superposition of surface reactivity and strain distributions reveals that, SCC cracking is expected to initiate in regions of strain localization wherein micro-galvanic corrosion is favored.},

To minimize collateral damage, the combined phototherapy should be accompanied by a real-time thermal sensing. However, it is still challenging to develop multifunctional agent which combines therapy and temperature control. In the present study, contactless fluorescent thermometry based on ratiometric and lifetime approaches was realized using water-soluble anionic meso- tetrasulfonatophenylporphyrinate (tetra sodium salt) TSPH 2 and cationic meso -mono(4-pyridyl)-triphenylporphyrinato)phosphorus(V) bromide MPyPP(OH) 2 porphyrins photosensitizers . Both sensing techniques provide simple linear calibration curves in the biological temperature range. Thermometric performance of the suggested porphyrins was evaluated in terms of relative sensitivity, temperature resolution and repeatability and was found to be in upper range among porphyrin-based thermometers reaching 1\% K −1 and 0.1 °C. The relative sensitivity was enhanced from 2 to 7 times by using peak-to-valley ratio compared to usual peak-to-peak ratio. Porphyrins&#39; cytotoxicity was studied in vitro both in dark and blue-light activated conditions. Exposure-dependent cell viability showed that porphyrins could be used as molecular thermometers for phototherapy to avoid heat-induced adverse effects or as promising photosensitizers depending on chosen laser power.},

Accordingly, a high reversible discharge capacity (1048mAh/g at 0.5C) with a low capacity fading (0.06\% per cycle) are achieved when the S-NPs/GCA is used as the cathode of Li S batteries (LSBs).

However, the targets and molecular mechanisms how prenatal AgNP exposure affects fetal development in mammals are largely unknown. In the current review, the translocation and developmental toxicities of AgNPs upon maternal exposure in mammals are summarized. AgNPs are able to translocate to the fetus, resulting in resorption , growth retardation and histological and functional abnormalities in the fetal central nervous system (CNS), reproductive system, immune system and other systems and organs. A few likely mechanisms, including direct and indirect mechanisms, and knowledge gaps are elucidated.

As a novel response, application of Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) featured by strain-hardening characteristics and inherent crack control ability in artificial dam is proposed. The special influence of simulated high sulfate mine water and drying-wetting cycle on ECC is investigated in this study, by measuring the mass and compressive properties evolvement and characterizing the microstructure and phase change. The results show that both the mass change and compressive strength of ECC specimens exhibit an initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease with extended drying-wetting cycles. Particularly, the specimens in sulfate solution show lower peak strength and sharper decline than that in tap water, which highlights the deteriorating role of sulfate attack . However, all of the stress-strain curves would eventually access a stable stage, showing toughness irrespective of the erosion ages. The micro-analysis indicates the filling effect of needle-like ettringites on the internal pores at early age. As the erosion extended, a large amount of coexistent ettringite and gypsum crystals are found responsible for the deterioration. Fortunately, the presence of microfibers mitigates the damage evolution.},

In general, an underwater shock wave, whose high-pressure duration is considerably larger than that of laser-induced shock waves, can imprint higher quality sub-micron reliefs from a mold onto a foil surface compared to that achievable through conventional laser shock imprinting. To realize large-area imprinting, the size of the explosives must be increased. However, the detonation of explosives usually starts at one end, and if the dimensions of the explosives are increased, the metal foil may be compressed into a mold by an oblique shock wave. Nevertheless, the imprinting using oblique shock waves has not been examined. Therefore, in this study, a linear explosive was used to generate an oblique underwater shock wave and compress a 10 μm thick Al foil into a plastic mold. The oblique shock wave was evaluated through optical observation using a high-speed video camera and numerical simulation. The recovered reliefs exhibited a molding depth of 62\% relative to the mold. The proper placement of the explosives could alleviate the production size limitation. The proposed technique can facilitate the realization of outdoor applications for metasurface materials.},

The root cause to this problem is obscure demanding a systematic approach to identify potential influencing parameters for better process control. In this article, the quality repeatability of laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) technology, in terms of static mechanical properties of printed parts, was quantified using relative standard deviation, and a machine learning approach for root cause analysis was demonstrated. While most of the prior work focused on the effect of laser-related process parameters to part properties, this research emphasises on the downstream production parameters while keeping laser-related parameters fixed. It was found that the combinational effect of part location and post-chamber pressure drop heavily influences the quality of printed parts. A follow-up experiment with the new process control was able to produce parts with improved quality repeatability. This proves the effectiveness of the proposed approach for process control of L-PBF at large scale implementation.},

Conventional research has, however, mostly been in a glass state after a shape change such as self-folding of 4D printing, because the heat shrinkage or shape memory effect of polymers is used. Therefore, the 4D printed hinges are rigid and cannot be folded or unfolded after 4D printing below the glass transition temperature of the shape memory polymer (SMP). Hence, in this study, we proposed a hybrid hinge structure that is elastic and can be largely deformed as an origami structure even after 4D printing. On the hybrid hinge, a soft elastomer hinge was arranged beside the rigid 4D printing hinges to achieving the elastic folding deformation after self-folding. We confirmed that the samples recovered to almost their original shape without failure after 500 cycles of folding. They exhibited high durability and elasticity. Finally, the usefulness of the hybrid hinge was demonstrated by fabricating a miura-ori and an origami compliant mechanism gripper, which could be deformed as origami structure below the glass transition temperature of the SMP. We believe that our 4D printing method can be applied for developing self-folding actuators and robots, which require origami deformation.},

The trained ANN is verified by evaluating its predictability of material parameters of FE simulations unseen in the training stage. The experimental data obtained from the shear tensile test using Digital Image Correlation is introduced to the trained ANN to identify the parameter set that predicts the real mechanical response of the shear specimen. Three different ANN architectures with distinguished input representations are studied. It turns out that all of them can acceptably describe the experimental behaviour of not only the calibration specimen but also the specimens not used for training the model.},

  abstract     = {Superstructures are seriously damaged because of plastic deformation when natural disasters, such as large earthquakes or unexpectedly large waves, occur. Therefore, there is a need to develop materials that are resistant to damage and fracture while maintaining a certain level of strength . In this paper, the difference in material toughness changes when cyclic prestrain occurs among different ferrite/pearlite two-phase microstructures were investigated. Synthetic analysis using strain gradient plasticity (SGP) theory, one of the crystal plasticity theories , was carried out, and conventional macroscopic material damage consideration rules were employed. Then, it was suggested that the amount of material damage changes among the different microstructures. In addition, a parametric study using SGP theory is performed to suggest directions for the microstructural design of steel with a lower risk of brittle fracture due to plastic deformation. As a result, damage-resistant materials with sufficient strength can be proposed.},

By infilling Ti-6Al-4V trusses with an incompressible elastomer (polydimethylsiloxane) or compressible foam (polyurethane), we demonstrate non-porous composite materials with controlled mechanical properties . The advantages of infilled composite trusses include corrosion resistance , density- or strength-matching, and the creation of a continuous external surface that can enable surface properties such as resistance to aerodynamic pressure and biomedical compatibility. Flexural and compressive testing of composite trusses show reproducible behavior dominated by the underlying truss in elastic and plastic regimes. Compared to unfilled trusses, those filled with an incompressible elastomer or compressible foam delay initial compressive failure to higher strains. For all investigated energy dissipation metrics, foam-infilled trusses demonstrated equivalent or improved performance compared to unfilled ones. This included plateau stress, volumetric energy dissipation (+19\%), and energy absorption efficiency (+12\%) and ideality (+20\%). For the highest tested truss relative density ( ρ ∗ = 0.43), 150\% improvement in volumetric energy absorption was observed. Compressive loading of the incompressible siloxane-filled trusses yielded higher peak failure stresses but at reduced energy dissipation. Composite trusses can therefore serve as structural solutions to improving energy absorption in higher stress applications with minimal increases to density.},

In this paper, the fatigue test was designed and carried out by using beach marking method to record the crack propagation process. By conducting microscopic examination on the fracture surface , it shows that the lack of penetration (LOP) at the weld root, combined with the high stress at that site, results in the fatigue crack initiation and propagation to penetrate the deck. Additionally, the fatigue assessment in terms of the S-N curves for such a failure mode was carried out. With comparison to other fatigue test results from the literature, it manifests the differences between the specimens failed due to root-deck crack and toe-deck crack, which can benefit the fatigue design of OSDs by giving a more specific and process-oriented results.},

The T1 weighted MR images in solution indicated that SS@GAH-GdCl 3 has higher T1 relaxivity in pH 5.8 than that in pH 7.4, and magnevist under 3.0 T magnetic field. Further, the T1 weighted MR images in vivo suggested that SS@GAH-GdCl 3 could target tumors and accumulate around tumor tissues to achieve MR imaging on the tumor up to 2 h. Moreover, SS@GAH-GdCl 3 is stable without any leakage of gadolinium ions.

Three different simulations for austenite growth and solute partitioning during isothermal holding were conducted using the DICTRA™ module of Thermo-Calc®. The microstructures after intercritical annealing exhibit film-like retained austenite; however, in situ HEXRD indicates that retained austenite in the initial martensitic microstructure had decomposed upon heating to the isothermal holding temperature, suggesting that film-like austenite may be generated during intercritical annealing via nucleation and growth of new austenite and without necessarily preserving initial retained austenite films in the martensitic microstructure. Metallography and in situ HEXRD also indicate that cementite had formed upon heating but did not readily dissolve during an 1800 s isothermal hold although considerable growth of austenite had occurred during the isothermal hold, suggesting that austenite nucleation and initial growth during intercritical annealing does not solely occur due to carbon partitioning. A simulation incorporating cementite suggests that the increase in austenite fraction during intercritical annealing initially occurs in association with Mn partitioning followed by austenite growth induced by gradual cementite dissolution.},

However, this therapy has appreciable side effects. Nanoscale carriers, such as metal nanoparticles and liposomes, are being widely utilized as drug delivery vehicles to achieve precise targeting of tumor cells. In this study, we designed a novel upconversion nanocarriers (UCNCs) host-guest complexation system based on a photolabile capping-like molecule. UCNCs containing epirubicin (EPI) were grafted with a dimer-targeting peptide via cyclodextrin-adamantine host-guest complexation. After entering breast tumor cells with the guidance of the dimer-targeting peptide, the core of the UCNCs upconverted near-infrared light to ultraviolet light which subsequently triggered the intracellular on-demand release of epirubicin. The precise and efficient delivery and release of epirubicin inside breast cancer cells significantly inhibited cancer cells proliferation , migration, and invasion in vitro and decreased the tumor size in vivo . We believe that this UCNCs system is a promising platform for the precise and controllable delivery of various chemotherapy drugs for clinical cancer treatments.},

Afterwards, the prepared KCF was incorporated with δ-MnO 2 to prepare a series of δ-MnO 2 /KCF composites. The as-prepared composites were then used to degrade bisphenol A (BPA) in water via oxidative catalysis. Significantly enhanced oxidative capability of the δ-MnO 2 /KCF was realized, since the KCF could not only prevent δ-MnO 2 aggregation, but also facilitate electron transferring between δ-MnO 2 and BPA. The impacts of catalyst dosage, initial pollutant concentration, solution pH value, temperature, Mn 2+ and natural organic matters on the performance of the δ-MnO 2 /KCF composites were examined in detail. The results showed that 0.025 mM of BPA could be completely degraded within 10 min by 0.5 g/L of the catalyst at the pH value of 3.80. The subsequent LC-MS analysis results indicated that the δ-MnO 2 /KCF initiated BPA oxidative degradation and mineralization through capturing one electron from the BPA molecules and forming BPA radicals. Moreover, the as-prepared δ-MnO 2 /KCF composites also had promising long-time use stability and reusability .

  abstract     = {In the field of bone implantation, there is a large demand for isotropic lattice with appropriate mechanical properties and porosity. Two isotropic lattice structure design and anisotropy control strategies are proposed in this work. The first way to acquire isotropic lattice structures is to combine the cross-frustum with octet-truss structure. Then the anisotropy can be adjusted by changing the frustum parameters. The second strategy is implemented in the space of normal lattice to generate hierarchical structures to achieve lattice anisotropy control by changing the inner and outer diameters. In virtue of homogenization method and finite element analysis (FEA), the relationship between elastic modulus , anisotropy and lattice parameters can be established. Based on that, the lattice structures with required elastic modulus and isotropy can be obtained. In addition, the isotropic lattice structures acquired by these two methods are applied as acetabular cup implant in this work. Compared with normal octet-truss, experimental results validate that the elastic modulus of designed lattice implant fluctuates significantly smaller. The standard deviation of elastic modulus in different directions is reduced by about 80\%.},

In this study, a novel inverse identification strategy is proposed based on the dynamic virtual fields method (VFM) to enable a simultaneous identification of the anisotropic constitutive parameters from a single high speed impact test of a non-uniform specimen. This is implemented by taking advantage of the heterogeneous full-field strain and inertial acceleration data, in which the restrictions of one-dimensional stress wave propagation and homogeneous deformation states for the conventional methods are released. Specifically, the dynamic VFM-based identification algorithm is developed first. Then, several virtual impact tests with different specimen configurations are designed to provide distinct stress/strain distributions. Next, the simulated full-field strain and acceleration data are utilized to extract the input target orthotropic stiffness components. The results show that the identification accuracy of the anisotropic parameters is highly dependent on the heterogeneity of the stress/strain distributions. Also, the identification results are unstable for different time steps but can be significantly improved using a minimization algorithm on multiple time steps. Finally, the influences of noise, impact speed and loading mode are analyzed in the sensitivity study.},

In this method, the optimized volume fraction of the components achieves a concordant collaboration of multi-phase in the counteraction of NTE and positive thermal expansion (PTE) at several adjacent temperature ranges and thus the temperature range is broadened as expected. By this method, MnCuGeN-based NTE composite (290 K ≤ T ≤ 385 K, ΔT = 95 K) and MnCuZnSiGeN-based NZTE composite (200 K ≤ T ≤ 400 K, ΔT = 200 K) with excellent stability have been successfully designed and prepared.

  abstract     = {The article discusses the results of investigations performed during a thermo-mechanical treatment of forgings made of chromium‑molybdenum 42CrMo4 grade steel. The treatment was realized during a regular series production. The forging process was combined with a heat treatment carried out directly after forging on a specially adapted station. Such a production technology will make it possible to eliminate the step of repeated heating of the forgings. On the example of an element of a steering gear, it was demonstrated how it is possible to perform an isothermal annealing process starting from the temperature at which the trimming of the forgings ends. During the cooling of the forgings, it is enough to maintain the temperature at the proper level in order for the exothermal phase transformation of austenite into pearlite to take place. The test results show that, with the properly selected temperature of isothermal annealing, it is possible to obtain an equilibrial ferritic-pearlitic structure in the required hardness scope. Introducing such a solution into the industrial practice would allow savings more than 80\% of the energy used for the heat treatment of forging in this case.},

  abstract     = {Strain localization , a cross-scale issue degrading homogeneity and formability during hot working of TA15 titanium alloy , is complicated by lamellar microstructure for hierarchical feature, spatial morphology, and orientation relationship. In this work, by taking advantage of hat-shaped specimens to maintain deformation mode , the effect of heterogeneous lamellar microstructure on strain localization is accessible and visualized by cross-section comparison enlightened by cake cutting. Moreover, the evolution behavior and mechanism are also investigated by the two-scale crystal plasticity model. The mechanism of strain localization during hot working of lamellar microstructure is re-recognized as the structural softening governed by an abrupt phase interface weakening and continuous geometrical softening. The driving force of strain localization is the ‘collapse’ of the stress gradient between constituent phases intensified by the progression of compelled uniformed deformation. The key to microstructure-dependent strain localization is the influence of lamellar orientation on germination and colony interface on intensification. Colonies with lamellar orientation deviated 45 o from the direction of maximum shear stress are endowed with the intrinsic potential of strain localization. Large-size and strongly-orientated colony interfaces intensify strain localization. These findings provide new insights into microstructure-dependent strain localization supporting a more efficient design of processing routing to control localization powerfully.},

After hot pressing, the GLC with ultralow content (170 to 350 ppm) can be uniformly dispersed and tightly embedded within the copper matrix.

Results of various indentation tests showed simultaneous improvement in both indentation yield strength (~379 MPa) and fracture toughness (0.78 ± 0.17 MPam 1/2 ), mainly attributing to synergetic toughening and strengthening mechanisms associated with the adding GNSs such as load transfer, GNS pull-out, inter-layer sliding of a GNS, crack branching, GNS bridging and crack deflection.

However, current anti-biofouling strategies based on either the release of biocidal compounds or surface textured/chemical design (superhydrophobic grille) cannot satisfy the practical demands when encountering real-world complex conditions. Here we, inspired by the ferroelectric/piezoelectric effect, report a refreshing strategy to prepare anti-biofouling coatings. The BaTiO 3 particles are embedded in TiO 2 coatings by micro-arc oxidation of pure titanium, and the obtained coatings have marvellous antifouling performance against Gram-negative E. coli . The contact potential differences (CPD) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are successfully induced by the spontaneous polarization of micro/nano BaTiO 3 , and then the BaTiO 3 -incorporated TiO 2 coatings (BaTiO 3 /TiO 2 ) can effectively resist fouling organisms. Our experiments demonstrate that the ferroelectric effect of coatings plays a crucial role in the antimicrobial mechanism. It is therefore believed that our design strategy could also guide the development of other anti-biofouling materials and bring a new era to the marine antifouling.},

Because the tungsten particles work as release enhancer, the hydrogel microbeads become to have high sensitivity to ultrasound with localized variation in acoustic impedance so that the release rate of drug models improves. By applying ultrasound at 20 kHz to the hydrogel microbeads, the release of fluorescent silica nanoparticles that are a drug model for virus vectors, micelles , and proteins was tested. Importantly, the proposed hydrogel microbeads released the drug model even under a cavitation-suppressed environment. Furthermore, the additional coating on the hydrogel microbeads with poly- l -lysine enabled us to adjust the release rate of the drug model. The proposed ultrasound-triggered drug release system using release enhancer is expected to be an effective approach for expanding the varieties of applicable treatments using on-demand drug delivery systems.},

As a process dealing with deformation of solid particles possibly leaving non-bonded interfaces and causing work hardening, any optimization should (i) adjust spray parameters to obtain high performance as-sprayed parts and (ii) tune ductility and internal stresses by post-treatments. The present study first deals with strategies to optimize spray parameters for fabrication of high performance steel 316 L deposits. Next, the performances of deposits are further adjusted by various heat treatments. The structural strength of the freestanding samples before and after the heat treatments is evaluated under static and cyclic axial loading and supported by fatigue crack growth rate analysis. The results highlight the feasibility of obtaining high quality steel 316 L deposits using N 2 as process gas, rather than the costly He that is commonly suggested. This study demonstrates the potential of cold spraying to be used for deposition of freeform structural components with a static strength comparable to that of bulk and laser-based additive manufactured materials and a fatigue strength similar to that of bulk cast material.},

Conventional techniques are characterized by a high degree of manual labour and mechanical load of the processed part. Here, a novel laser-based and controlled approach for automated and layer-accurate removal of damaged areas is presented. In-line depth measurements by optical coherence tomography during nanosecond laser ablation enable depth-controlled homogeneous material removal with minimum damage &lt;10 μm and low surface roughness in the range of 7 μm to 13 μm. The processed layer must be detected for an unknown or varying layer thickness to stop the ablation process at the interface between two layers and not somewhere within one ply. The image processing-based determination of the fibre orientation from the depth measurements allow for a reliable online detection of the processed layer with a maximum error of 4° and root mean square error of 1.1°. As a result, layer-accurate damage removal is demonstrated for a complex repairing geometry. The suitability of the automated laser-based approach as preparation for repairing is proven by cross-sections and scanning-electron-microscopy.},

The experimental data were complemented by the finite element modeling in order to reveal the underlying physical background of the observed twinning dynamics. It was shown that the thickness of a twin should reach a critical value before triggering the nucleation of another twin to accommodate further strain. Nucleation and growth are repeated until the twins form throughout the whole micropillar, from top to bottom. Afterwards, the thickening and coalescence of all these twins take place until the entire micropillar volume is twinned. In addition, a line-by-line analysis of the scanning electron microscopy images was employed to reveal the twin lateral growth rates, which were shown to be on the order of 10 −5 –10 −4 m/s.},

The present work started with stress-free and stress-assisted pre-service treatments of a DS Ni-based superalloy to obtain microstructures with different degraded states. An imaging process based on two-phase rotary chord length distributions was established to extract the high dimensional statistical information for identifying the morphology and size features of microstructures. To reduce the dimension of the statistical information and quantitatively characterize the microstructural states in fewer parameters, principal component analysis was employed to capture the core microstructural indicators, which was utilized to establish the response surface between the deterioration of fatigue resistance and the microstructural degradation. Finally, a multi-output support vector regression (SVR) model was constructed to map between service process and microstructural degradation. The results showed acceptable accuracy to estimate the microstructural degradation of pre-serviced alloys. Meanwhile, the framework provides a technical chain for the waste determination and microstructural degradation estimation of the hot section components made by DS and SC Ni-based superalloys.},

However, the regulation mechanism of the assembly structure during the process of CNT fiber synthesis is still unclear. Herein, in order to obtain high-strength CNT fibers, we demonstrated the synergistic relationship between the orientation and length of CNT inside the CNT fibers during the FCCVD growth process by adjusting the winding rate (5–30 m/min) and the length of the high-temperature reaction zone (660–1060 mm). It also revealed that the particle impurities inside the fibers could greatly reduce mechanical strength of CNT fibers.

  abstract     = {The multi-component (AlCrTiZrMo)-Si x -N high-entropy films with different silicon contents were deposited on the silicon substrate by magnetron sputtering. The influence of silicon contents on the structures and properties of the films was studied by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) and nanoindentation . The results show that the (AlCrTiZrMo)N film without silicon has columnar crystals and the (200)-preferred direction. With the increase of the silicon content, the films gradually change from columnar grains with a (200) preferential orientation to structures with amorphous phases (amorphous phases are the state of near order and long disorder in the arrangement of atoms in a solid state) containing nanocrystals (nanocrystallites are single-phase (AlCrTiZrMo)N of grains with a size of 5–10 nm) with finer grains. As the silicon content increases, the mechanical properties of the films first increase then decrease. Thus, when the silicon content is 4.5 atomic percent (at.\%), the film obtained possessed comprehensive mechanical properties with the maximum hardness and modulus values of 28.5 GPa and 325.4 GPa, respectively. The results show that the improvement of hardness and modulus is mainly attributed to the microstructures of the films.},

  abstract     = {Superhydrophobic coatings can offer promising protection for metals against harsh service conditions. However, real applications are facing great challenges with the focus problem of lacking mechanical robustness. Current methods addressing this issue can not completely solve the problem or is not unsuitable for large-scale applications. Here, we propose an innovative strategy to fabricate a bioinspired superhydrophobic coating on 6061 Al via a simple and high-output route. By creating a mosquito-eye-like nanoframework-nanofiller structure with two different length scales, the coating is equipped with superhydrophobic property and excellent mechanical robustness, which are usually considered as two mutually exclusive properties. Based on a modified Cassie-Baxter model and a Gibbs interfacial energy model, a wetting theory is established to analyze the observed nonlinear change of the water contact angle, which suggests that the coating initially remains in the heterogeneous wetting state and abruptly transits to the intermediate wetting state. The theory further predicts the loss of anti-icing property upon abrasion, which is also confirmed by experiments. The superhydrophobic coating with robustness against abrasion will find its potential application values in complex service conditions.},

In this manufacturing, the molten pool morphology and temperature were gained by high speed camera and thermal imager . After LMI, a graded distribution of SiC p with 4.6\%–4.8\% volume fraction was obtained along the depth direction of weld. The aluminum grain under LMI (12.80 μm) was much finer than that under single laser welding (SLW) (40.94 μm). It was novel that the in-situ reactant Al 4 C 3 platelets would mainly locate discontinuously on the SiC/Al interface whereas acicular Al 4 SiC 4 was found primarily in the aluminum matrix. In addition, the nano-spherical simple substance carbon was precipitated around the surface of SiC p . Eventually, due to these particular in-situ reactions during laser welding with SiC p injection, the Vickers hardness of weld with SiC p was larger than that under SLW; a gradual hardness distribution in the depth direction of PRW was also observed; the tensile strength of weld with SiC p (192 MPa ~ 243 MPa) became much higher without sacrificing ductility than SLW (165 MPa); the failure mechanism of weld with SiC p would change from SiC p cracking to the SiC p decohesion with the increasing welding speed.},

  abstract     = {Chitosan-based hydrogel has been widely used in the field of tissue engineering due to its favorable biocompatibility and good biodegradability. However, this kind of hydrogel generally exhibits poor mechanical stability, which greatly limits its application in the field of 3D bioprinting . In this study, we provided a hybrid bioink created from photocurable chitosan and acrylamide (AM) for digital light processing (DLP) based 3D bioprinting in tissue engineering applications. This hybrid bioink was facilely prepared by combining AM and chitosan modified with methacryloyl groups (CHIMA). The gelling point of the hybrid pre-hydrogel bioink was greatly dependent on the photoinitiators. Both the mechanical properties and cytocompatibility of the hydrogel formed by the bioink can be modulated by varying the AM contents. The hybridization of natural CHIMA and synthetic AM enables the hybrid hydrogels with desirable biological activity and mechanical properties. Utilizing the DLP based 3D printing , this hybrid bioink can be processed into complex 3D hydrogel constructs with high-strength and good biocompatibility . Therefore, the photocurable hybrid bioink composed of CHIMA and AM in proper proportion is well suitable for use in DLP based 3D bioprinting, which would play a promising role in constructing tissues and organs in the future.},

Subsequently, using the viscous process, the viscous/PAM-rGO composite fiber on the pilot scale. When compared to the pure viscous fiber, the tensile strength and Young’&#39;s modulus of the viscose/PAM-rGO composite fiber that loaded with 1.0 wt\% PAM-rGO demonstrated a significant by 170\% and 314\%. Comparing the experimental results and the Halpin-Tsai theoretical simulation indicated that most of the incorporated PAM-rGO nanosheets aligned along the fiber axis direction. It was further evidenced by calculating Herman&#39;s orientation factor ( f ) of the viscous/PAM-rGO fibers. Additionally, strong non-covalent interactions dominated by hydrogen bonding between the cellulose and PAM-rGO were demonstrated by Raman and FTIR analysis. Furthermore, incorporating PAM-rGO into the cellulose matrix has also improved the thermal stability of the composite fiber.

It was found that the measurement accuracy of the rivet head height was not influenced, but the accuracy of the interlock and the remaining bottom sheet thickness were affected by the joint cutting position. A pure offset distance could lead to an overestimated interlock while a solo rotation angle could result in an underestimated interlock. For the studied joint configurations, the relative interlock error was found in the range of −5\%–5\% with the offset distance smaller than 1.0 mm and the rotation angle less than 10°. The offset distance and rotation angle can cause larger errors on the remaining bottom sheet thickness around the joint central area than around the rivet tip. Moreover, the proposed correction strategy for the interlock has been proved effective and the relative interlock error could be reduced to 1\%–3\%.},

The GTM compression seals were fabricated using pre-oxidized AISI 304 and borosilicate glass with different thermal expansion coefficients (TECs). The variation of TEC was investigated by changing the alkali oxides contents. The chemical bonding strength between the glass and the pre-oxidized AISI 304 was evaluated using shear strength test and fracture surface analysis. And the mechanical compressive stress was analyzed by fiber Bragg grating technology at elevated temperature. In addition, the seal hermeticity with varying temperature under high pressure helium was also recorded. The results show that the hermeticity failure temperature increases as compressive stress attenuation reduces. But the contribution of increasing chemical bonding strength to high-temperature hermeticity is covered up by that of compressive stress decay. This demonstrates that mechanical bonding has a stronger influence on high-temperature hermeticity of the seals than chemical bonding. The findings of this work will guide the development and optimization of GTM compression seals towards further improvement of the high-temperature tolerance.},

  abstract     = {Processing titanium (Ti)-based materials in high-concentration nitrogen gas (N 2 ) atmosphere is credited with reducing ductility/plasticity arising from the excessive formation of brittle agglomerated TiN. However processing these materials in dilute N 2 may reduce the risk. In this study, a novel method is developed for laser additive manufacturing of in-situ synthesized TiN and AlN co-reinforced Ti6Al4V matrix composites (NTMCs) by the gas–liquid reaction in low-concentration N 2 atmospheres. The manufacturing process of the NTMCs involves melting Ti6Al4V powders followed by laser-induced pyrolysis of N 2 near the melt pool. The process is facilitated by the reaction between the decomposed nitrogen and molten Ti6Al4V, dissolution and precipitation of nitrides, and formation of the composites layer-by-layer. The formation of the nitride precipitates was verified by XRD, SEM, EDS, and HR-TEM. Such in-situ synthesized nanoscale reinforcements exhibited good dispersion and strong interfacial bonding with the matrix alloy in the composites. The microhardness, 0.2\% compressive yield strength, and ultimate compressive strength of the NTMCs significantly increased with increasing N 2 concentration in additive manufacturing; their maxima were 511 HV, 1721 MPa, and 2010 MPa, respectively, increased by 36.3\%, 67.9\%, and 16.8\% from those of the Ti6Al4V alloy.

Polypropylene (PP) constitutes a major fraction of post-consumer plastic wastes, and mechanical recycling is currently the most sustainable recovery strategy. Sandwich-structured multi-layer products with recyclate cores are a seemingly easy way to satisfy demands for recyclate utilization without compromising on product aesthetics. We present the case of a reusable plastic transport box with a recycled content of 45 wt\% manufactured by a co-injection molding process. The box was characterized by spectroscopic and thermo-analytical methods. Mechanical performance was tested on both specimen and product levels. A comparison was made to transport boxes fabricated entirely from virgin or entirely from recycled PP, respectively. A number of contaminants including foreign polymers were identified within the recyclate core layer of the sandwich-structured material. While these contaminants had no deteriorative effect on stiffness-controlled performance, a strong influence on strength-controlled and impact-related properties was observed. We argue that the presence of inclusions of both polymeric and inorganic nature is an intrinsic quality characteristic of post-consumer recyclates. These need to be considered in any design-from-recycling philosophy to guarantee functionality, reliability, and safety of products with recycled content.},

Recent nanomechanical studies revealed plasticity by dislocation glide in the (Mg,Al) 2 Ca Laves phase, even at room temperature. As strengthening skeleton, this phase remains, however, brittle at low temperature. In this work, we present experimental evidence of slip transfer from the Mg matrix to the (Mg,Al) 2 Ca skeleton at room temperature and explore associated mechanisms by means of atomistic simulations . We identify two possible mechanisms for transferring Mg basal slip into Laves phases depending on the crystallographic orientation : a direct and an indirect slip transfer triggered by full and partial dislocations , respectively. Our experimental and numerical observations also highlight the importance of interfacial sliding that can prevent the transfer of the plasticity from one phase to the other.},

In this study, pulse electrochemical deposition method was used to drive PPy in situ , and HA-NPs as well as the osteoinductive drug Dex were introduced to PPy based on its doping characteristics to endow the titanium-based composite coating with long-term osteoinductivity during the osseointegration process. During the oxidative polymerization of PPy, PO 4 3− and Dex − were doped into the main chain of PPy, and HA was formed due to the electrostatic interaction of PO 4 3− and Ca 2+ , finally realizing the co-deposition of HA-NPs and Dex. Dex drug release experiments showed that the doping effect of PPy has reduced the release rate of Ca 2+ from the coating and increased the physiological stability of the coating. The in vitro evaluation of osteoblasts and vascular endothelial cells showed that the number of cells increased steadily with good proliferation conditions, showing promising osteogenic ability and angiogenic property. In summary, a bioactive PPy@HA/Dex nanocomposite coating with sustained osteoinductivity was successfully constructed on the titanium surface using pulse electrochemical method .},

  abstract     = {Mg-Y based alloys exhibit a promising combination of strength and deformability through tuning precipitation and solute strengthening mechanisms and tailoring the activity of non-basal dislocations. Understanding the precipitation sequence of Mg-Y based alloys and its dependence on Yttrium concentration in the matrix will provide a guideline for fine tuning structure, morphology and distribution of precipitates in Mg-Y based alloys. In this paper, we explore the precipitation behaviors of Mg-11Y (wt\%) and Mg-11Y-1Al (wt\%) alloys using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy , and rationalize the experimental observations based on first-principles density functional theory calculations. The precipitation sequence during ageing at 225 °C is identified to be SSSS → clusters/G.P. Zones → β ′ (Mg 7 Y) → β ′′/ β t ′′ (Mg 3 Y). A novel β t ′′ phase forms through in-situ transformation from the β ′ phase, which shares the same Mg 3 Y composition with D0 19 - β ′′ phase and exhibits the same cbco -structure as β ′ phase in Mg-Y based alloys.},

Increasing x from 0.5 to 1.0, the microstructure changes from hyper-eutectic ones consisting of primary Laves phase and eutectic structure ( x  0.8). Interestingly, two different morphologies of eutectic microstructures are observed when x = 0.7 and 0.8 probably due to different fusion entropies of each phase. Increasing x from 0.5 to 1.0 reduces the yield strength from 1661 ± 64 to 688 ± 17 MPa but enhances the compressive ductility due to an increased fraction of soft FCC phase from ~0.39 to ~0.74. The second phase strengthening is the main strengthening mechanism . Importantly, when x = 0.9 and 1.0, these two alloys are not fractured when the strain reaches 0.5, one of which shows a large yield strength of 1028 ± 45 MPa ( x = 0.9).

To study their interaction and effects on structural evolution and mechanical properties , we synthesised Mo–Ta–N coatings by reactive magnetron sputtering using nitrogen-to-total pressure ratios, p N2 / p T , of 0.32 and 0.69. Low p N2 / p T results in high concentration of N vacancies, which stabilise single-phase fcc-Mo 1- x Ta x N y up to x = 0.76. These solid solutions follow the MoN 0.5 –Ta 0.875 N 0.875 quasi-binary tie line. Compressive residual stresses , σ , indentation hardness , H , and toughness, K C , increase with Ta content, reaching their maxima of (on average) -2.0 GPa, 28 GPa, and 7.0 MPa√m, respectively, within the x range 0.38–0.69. Higher Ta contents favour higher concentration of metal vacancies deteriorating the properties. High p N2 / p T favours the formation of fcc-Mo 1- x Ta x N y rich in metal vacancies, which however always coexists with a hexagonal phase. Within the x range 0.33–0.66, the fraction of the hexagonal phase is negligible, and σ , H , and K C deviate from −1.0 GPa, 28 GPa, and 2.9 MPa√m, respectively, within the error of measurements.

Nano enabled WC-Co/CNT coatings were obtained by internal diameter HVOAF thermal spray at three different spray powers (48, 41 and 34 kW). A general increase in microhardness and decrease in fracture toughness has been found when adding CNT. Also, carbide retention index upon spray was improved by lowering the process temperature and adding CNT, reaching 99\% in the low power case with CNT. The interplay of these features has shown an overall better wear performance in the medium power case without CNT; in fact, the addition of CNT has improved the wear performance at high power conditions (reduction of coefficient of friction by half) while reducing the wear performance in medium and low power. A tailored choice of CNT concentration can offer enhanced mechanical or tribological properties according to the needs for different applications. This novel process for nanoparticles incorporation opens the way for the production of large batches of readily usable nano-enabled powder.},

To disclose the correlations between mechanical properties and microstructures for these composites, positron annihilation lifetime (PAL) measurements were carried out. Thereafter, better impact and compression properties were observed for composites with smaller free volume holes. Meanwhile, the impact and tensile properties of the composites are positively correlated with the free volume holes fraction at 77 K.

  abstract     = {Rejuvenator encapsulation technique showed great potential for extrinsic asphalt pavement damage healing. Once the capsules are embedded within asphalt pavement, the healing is activated on-demand via progressing microcrack . When the microcrack encounters the capsule, the fracture energy at the tip opens the capsule and releases the rejuvenator. Then the released rejuvenator wets the crack surfaces, diffuses into and softens the aged bitumen, allowing two broken edges to come in the contact, preventing further asphalt pavement deterioration. The quality and speed of the damage repair process strongly depend on the quality of rejuvenator, thus it is important to choose a proper rejuvenator with good abilities to restore the lost properties of bitumen from ageing and show a sustainable performance after healing. To this aim, three different rejuvenators were studied and ranked based on the performance of their rejuvenated bitumen, including physical properties, rheological properties, chemical properties and the performance after re-ageing. Furthermore, these rejuvenators were encapsulated in calcium alginate capsules and the tests on these capsules indicate the diameter, mechanical resistance and thermal stability of the capsules are influenced by the encapsulated rejuvenator. The findings will benefit the development of rejuvenator encapsulation technique and the optimization of the capsule healing system towards a better healing effect in asphalt pavement.},

Moreover, influence of simultaneous changes in the grain size and texture on tensile yield strength and ductility of the hot-worked Mg alloy was studied using the grain size and texture maps established. The processing-grain size map showed that the DRX grain size decreased with the increase in Z, also revealing various characteristics ranging from a grain growth, grain refinement, to a bimodal distribution of ultrafine grains and partially recrystallized grains . The effect of twinning on the grain refinement was also evident at high Z conditions. The processing-texture map revealed that the initial fiber texture was altered significantly to a shear, off-normal, or extension-twin texture with the increase in Z. The Schmid-factor maps were calculated to identify a dominant deformation mode during a subsequent tensile deformation of the hot-worked samples. Finally, a corresponding Hall-Petch relationship for each dominant deformation mode was used to establish tensile yield-strength maps, which agree well with the measured data.},

This phase transformation introduced a compressive stress field and deflected the micro-cracks. In addition, the ZrO 2 particles dispersed homogeneously in the WC skeleton and had good interfacial bonding with both WC and Co phases, which was beneficial to the mechanical properties of the cemented carbides. This study provides a new promising approach to break the trade-off between the hardness and fracture toughness of cemented carbides to achieve excellent comprehensive mechanical properties.

Taking two representative metals of Mg and Zn as a demonstration, it reveals that both tensile and compressive strain would contribute to the corrosion rate by lowering the activation energy barrier, in agreement with previous experimental observations.

  abstract     = {The incorporation of additive into rubber matrix is a promising approach toward desirable damping materials. However, the design and selection of additives remain a challenge. Herein, tetraphenylphenyl-modified damping additives were synthesized by Diels-Alder chemistry. The effects of additives on the mechanical and morphological properties of phenyl silicone rubber were investigated experimentally and computationally. Experimental results showed that the addition of additives substantially improved the damping while preserving excellent mechanical properties . The composite with 15 phr tetraphenylphenyl-modified dimethylpolysiloxane (TPP-VMPS-3) exhibited a broad plateau of loss factor (tanδ &gt;0.25) from −50 to 30 °C, effectively expanding the damping temperature range. When the composite incorporated 15 phr tetraphenylphenyl-modified methylphenylpolysiloxane (TPP-VPMPS), the tanδ increased from 0.09 to 0.21 at 150 °C, showing excellent high-temperature damping performance. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provided mechanistic insights into the phase separation and relaxation behavior of composites by studying the compatibility, interaction mechanism, and diffusion characteristic. The results demonstrated that the enhanced intermolecular interactions and steric hindrance were the crucial reason for the improvement of damping. This work shed light on the relationship among composition, structure and property, which may provide a framework for preparing high-performance silicone composites via the synergistic experimental and computational method.},

This work deals with the determination of residual stress in rapidly solidified AlSi10Mg samples using two non-destructive techniques: Raman spectroscopy , rapid, unconventional but applicable to Al Si alloys, and XRD (ω-method), used as benchmark, being a classical method for determining residual stresses. Al stress level was studied by XRD both on the surface of LPBF samples and in the interior, after in-depth sectioning. Raman was employed to assess the stress on Si. The effect of particle size and stress on the Raman was separated determining the size distribution of Si particles , making Raman suitable to study residual stresses in alloys containing free Si. Al and Si stresses were evaluated also by means of the Williamson-Hall method: stresses are of tensile type with agreement among all methods. Considering the alloy as a composite, stress on Si was estimated using the Eshelby&#39;s model, showing that larger eutectic particles undergo lower stress with respect to nanometric precipitates.},

  abstract     = {Although nanostructuring strategies can greatly enhance the hardness of diamond, a large amount of grain boundaries were involved, and little research has been reported on the effect of grain boundaries on the indentation hardness and plastic deformation of diamond. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we have systematically investigated the diamond symmetrical 〈001〉 tilt grain boundaries under Vickers indentations. Our results indicate that the smaller the misorientation angle is, the more favorable for the hardness enhancement of diamond. For the symmetrical 〈001〉 tilt grain boundaries models with misorientation angles smaller than 36.87°, the plastic deformations are mainly resulted from the dislocation propagation mode . For the grain boundaries with misorientation angles larger than 36.87°, the plastic deformation is mainly through the atomic disordering mode, accompanied with the dislocation mode. The effects of grain boundaries on dislocation activities and atomic disordering transformations are systematically discussed. The results presented in this work not only answered the question about the effect of symmetrical 〈001〉 tilt grain boundaries on the hardness of diamond, but also offers fundamental insights for understanding the indentation induced plastic deformation mechanisms of diamond grain boundaries, which could provide reference data for the design of novel nano structured superhard materials.},

Three kinds of nanostructure including polymer nanowires , nanopit arrays, and nanogrooves were regulated via controlling scratching velocity and the heated temperature. Inspection of the nanopit arrays proved that fabrication of continuous bundles with desired dimensions can be realized by controlling the feed between adjacent scratching paths.

By reduction of the fiber diameter in randomly oriented electrospun polyetherurethane (PEU) meshes from the micro- to the nano-scale, we observed changes in the molecular orientation within the fibers and its impact on the structural and shape-memory performance. It was assumed that a spatial restriction by reduction of the fiber diameter increases molecular orientation along the orientation of the fiber. The stress-strain relation of random PEU scaffolds is initially determined by the 3D arrangement of the fibers and thus is independent of the molecular orientation. Increasing the molecular orientation with decreasing single fiber diameter in scaffolds composed of randomly arranged fibers did not alter the initial stiffness and peak stress but strongly influenced the elongation at break and the stress increase above the Yield point. Reduction of the single fiber diameter also distinctly improved the shape-memory performance of the scaffolds. Fibers with nanoscale diameters (&lt; 100 nm) possessed an almost complete shape recovery, high recovery stresses and fast relaxation kinetics, while the shape fixity was found to decrease with decreasing fiber diameter. Hence, the fiber diameter is a relevant design parameter for SMP.},

The temperature-time profile was determined taking into account the laser power, the optical and thermal properties of both the amorphous and crystalline phase . The mechanical properties of the amorphous and of the crystallized regions were characterized by an ultra nano-indentation technique. This procedure allows a direct and local measurement of hardness and Young&#39;s modulus in the amorphous and in the contiguous crystalline regions on the micrometer scale. The following values for Young&#39;s modulus and for hardness were obtained: 33±4 GPa and 2.00±0.3 GPa for the amorphous phase, and 51±8 GPa and 2.90±0.45 GPa for the crystalline phase. The stresses induced by the density increase in the crystallized region cause, on the irradiated surface , a series of fracture whose characteristic behavior depends on the laser power and on the spacing between two contiguous scans.

This study employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate a continuous microstructure space based on synthetic microstructural images. The structure-property relationships are explored using a computational approach with microstructure quantification, dimensionality reduction, and finite element method (FEM) simulations. The FEM of representative volume element (RVE) with a microstructure-based constitutive model model is proposed for predicting the overall stress-strain behavior of the investigated dual-phase steels. Then, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is used to make connections between the latent space point and the ferrite grain size as inputs and mechanical properties as outputs. The GPR with VAE successfully predicts the newly generated microstructures with target mechanical properties with high accuracy. This work demonstrates that a variety of microstructures can be candidates for designing the optimal material with target properties in a continuous manner.},

Additionally, the values of the critical resolved shear stresses were determined for slip systems activated during plastic deformation . A new important finding of this work is the determination of significant residual intergranular stresses in textured magnesium alloy subjected to plastic deformation. These stresses are correlated with the orientation of basal plane with respect to the applied stress, and they can be explained by a large difference between critical resolved shear stress values for basal and non-basal slip systems. In contrast to the magnesium alloy studied in this work, low values of the second order stresses were found previously in a two-phase Ti alloy due to the small difference between critical resolved stresses in both phases.},

In this study, ambient condition electrochemical slot jets are applied to rapidly etch (e.g. 31 s) large surface areas (e.g. 160 mm 2 ) at controlled depths (e.g. 20 μm) with no in-process monitoring. Unveiled surfaces are conducive to measurement by EBSD (raw index rates between 75 and 95\%), despite topographic anisotropy arising both from the process and the material. The mechanisms of topography formation during dissolution under the slot jet are analysed and understood. It is proposed that this slot jet method can be applied to create measurement surfaces for analysis with optical-based microstructural measurement routines reliant on topography and directional reflectance, at a significantly lower cost and time intervention than electron beam-based analysis methods.},

  abstract     = {In addition to its use in the conventional textile industry, Bombyx Mori silk has attracted significant attention in the materials science and biomedical engineering disciplines. Recently, the possibility of drawing silk fibers with superior toughness has gained particular research interest. Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) is widely studied as a reinforcement material owing to its excellent mechanical properties combined with relatively low density and promising biocompatibility. This paper reports silkworm silk fibers dispersed with CNF that present outstanding tensile properties compared with conventional silk fibers. The silkworm diet was modified by including CNFs , and tensile tests were carried out for the drawn silk fibers. Tensile testing of the drawn silk showed improved Young&#39;s modulus and tensile strength when the diet included CNFs at 5 wt\% concentration. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy studies were also conducted to determine the reason for the observed improvement in properties. Morphological studies revealed that the individual fibrils or fibril bundles are aligned in the longitudinal direction of the silk fibers and are uniformly dispersed. Moreover, finite element analysis was performed to estimate the volume fraction of CNF in the silkworm silk fiber. This work opens the door for development of renewable and sustainable bio-composites.},

  abstract     = {The modification of metal alloy powders by coating with nanoparticles offers the possibility to improve additive manufacturing processes, in particular the powder bed fusion of metals with laser beams (PBF/LB-M), from the material side of view. Subsequently, component qualities including mechanical properties and microstructural characteristics could be improved. Furthermore, the modification enables improved energy utilization due to an increase in laser absorption. In this work three commercial additive manufacturing powders, namely stainless steel (1.4404), tool steel (1.2709), and aluminum alloy (3.2381) were coated with three different nanoparticles (Silicon carbide (SiC), few layer graphene (FLG), and iron oxide black (IOB) to increase the laser light absorption in the PBF/LB/M process, mechanical properties, and flowability of the powders. The coating was conducted within a fluidized bed system, resulting in homogeneous coatings. This study demonstrates, that well scalable processes i.e. stirred media milling and fluidized bed coating have the potential to improve the commercial AM powders regarding their bulk density, flowability, and energy absorption, which is a crucial step towards an improvement in the efficiency of the whole PBF process. Overall important information and relations were gathered to transfer them to the real powder deposition process in future work.},

Advanced microstructure characterization encompassing scanning and transmission electron microscopy , coupled with synchrotron X-ray diffraction, were used. Defect-free welds were obtained with a conduction welding mode. The weld thermal cycle altered the microstructure across the heat affected and fusion zones of the joints . The heat affected zone exhibited partial H-phase dissolution, causing a decrease in hardness. In the fusion zone, the H-phase fully dissolved, and the non-equilibrium rapid solidification conditions prevented the H-phase from re-precipitating during cooling, leading to a microstructure resembling that of an as-cast alloy with the same material composition. Mechanical testing revealed that the laser welded samples sustained stresses in the order of 500 MPa and exhibited stress-strain responses comparable to those of the unwelded base material.

The ML model trained by the 5 features is validated by 155 annealing experimental data points from 15 publications and then used to predict 213 new single-phase alloys with BCC and FCC structures of the alloy families of AlCrNiFeMn and AlCrCoNiFeTi. We also highlight the importance of equilibrium temperature and offer in-depth insights into the paradigm of composition-feature-phase of HEAs. On the basis of the 5 important features, we establish new phase selection rules for single FCC and BCC phases with a success rate above 90\%, significantly outperforming all existing phase selection rules and providing a powerful tool for mapping single-phase in the complex temperature-composition space of HEAs.},

In our work, we propose a method for defined-shape polymer capsules fabrication inspired by a traditional “pelmeni” (dumplings) making process. The proposed method is based on soft lithography technique. Two different approaches were demonstrated resulting in polyelectrolyte multilayer and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) capsules both showing monodisperse size and shape distribution with about 7 μm long torpedo-like shape. The PLA capsules are described in terms of their morphology, loading of model cargo molecules, cell cytotoxicity and cell uptake. Carboxyfluorescein, FeCl 2 ground crystals and Fe 3 O 4 nanopowder were used as model cargoes for microcapsules. Capsules demonstrate core-shell structure, high loading capacity, hydrophilic molecules retention and internalization by cells without causing toxic effects. The loading efficiency of model cargo in PLA capsules was more than 80 wt\%, resulting in about 40 pg of carboxyfluorescein inside each capsule. Proposed method allows unique advantages compared with alternative microencapsulation techniques, such as precise control over capsules&#39; geometry, flexibility for the choice of active cargoes, regardless of their solubility and molecular weight and potential for triggered release mechanism.},

Polyetheretherketone (PEEK), which shows similar adjustable elastic modulus with cortical bone, is considered to be an ideal candidate to replace metallic implants , especially for osteoporotic bone. However, the bioinertness and poor osteogenic properties of PEEK fail to pave the way for clinical application. Here, a novel coating (EBE-SrSi) with bioactive elements on PEEK implants was generated via electron beam evaporation (EBE) to enhance the rapid osseointegration by inducing osteogenesis, as well as angiogenesis. In vitro, the dual Sr/Si ion modified surface exihibits a better osteo-inductive effect on the BMSCs derived from ovariectomized rats (rBMSCs-OVX). Furthermore, the modified samples also stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) migration and angiogenesis. Finally, in the OVX rat bonedefect model, the EBE-SrSi group exhibited faster bone formation which might be attributed to the impact of the transformation of endogenous MSC accompanied by promotion of the angiogenic activity of endothelial cells. Our results unveiled the potential of dual Sr/Si modified PEEK in promoting osseointegration under osteoporotic conditions and will further broaden the adoption of PEEK materials in dental fields.},

To this end, several numerical analyses were performed to analyse different substrate designs in order: (i) to reduce the sensitivity to the initial non-steady stage when the first layers of material are deposited, (ii) to optimize the heat flux through the substrate to reduce the Maximum Temperature Gradients (MTG) and, (iii) to modify the substrate stiffness and its mechanical constraining to the thermal deformations during the building process and the cooling phase. To ensure the reliability of the numerical simulations, an in-house software is calibrated to allow for an accurate analysis of DED. Thus, an experimental setting is undergone to feed the numerical model with suitable values of both material and process parameters through temperature and displacement measurements and numerical fitting. Once calibrated, the software is used to evaluate the performance of several substrate designs to mitigate the residual stresses induced by the DED process. A thin-walled rectangular part selected as industrial demonstrator showed a significant reduction (up to 62\%) of the maximum tensile stresses .},

Firstly, the necessary and sufficient condition that is required for elasticity constants of pentamode micro lattices with at least elastically orthotropic symmetry is derived. Secondly, a general mathematical formulation for design optimization of such pentamode micro lattices is developed. Thirdly, a truss-based three-dimensional ground structure with geometrically orthotropic symmetry is generated, with geometric constraints to avoid intersection and overlap of truss bars within the ground structure. The genetic algorithm is then used to solve the topology optimization problem described by the ground structure.

In this work, 3D-acoustic metamaterials of the body- and face-centered cubic lattice systems encompassing nodal isotropic multivibrators are investigated. Our main results are: (1) the number of bandgaps equals the number, n , of internal masses as each bandgap is a result of the classical analog of the quantum level-repulsion mechanism between internal and external oscillations, and (2) the upper boundary frequencies, ω upper 2 i , i = 1, 2, ⋯, n , of the gaps formed coincide with eigen-frequencies, ω int ; i 2 ≠ 0, of the isolated multivibrator, ω upper 2 ; i = ω int ; i 2 , and the lower boundary frequencies, ω lower 2 , i 2 , are in good agreement with estimations as ω lower , i 2 ≈ ω ^ int ; i 2 ωlower,i2≈ω^int;i2 ( ω lower , i 2 ωlower,i2&amp;lt;ω^int;i2 ), where ω ^ int ; i 2 ω^int;i2 represent the eigen-frequencies of the multivibrator when its external shell is motionless. The morphologies of the set of dispersion surfaces, ω m 2 ( k ), m = 1, 2, …, 6, in the corresponding passbands are similar to each other and to that of the set of dispersion surfaces, ω ext ; m 2 ( k ), obtained through the exclusion of internal masses. Thus, the problem of analyzing the acoustic properties of the complicated system is reduced to the study of two simple sets { ω int ; i 2 } and ω ^ int ; i 2 ω^int;i2 , along with { ω ext ; m 2 ( k )}, the morphology of which depends only on the type of lattice symmetry. This splitting renders controlled phononic bandgaps formation in homogeneous multi-resonator metamaterials feasible.},

  abstract     = {Superlattice (SL) thin films composed of refractory ceramics unite extremely high hardness and enhanced fracture toughness ; a material combination which is often mutually exclusive. While the hardness enhancement is well described by existing models based on dislocation mobility, the underlying mechanisms behind the increase in fracture toughness are yet to be unraveled. Here, we provide a model based on linear elasticity theory to predict the fracture toughness in (semi-)epitaxial nanolayers . As representative of cubic transition metal nitrides , a TiN/CrN superlattice structure on MgO (100) is studied. The density of misfit dislocations is estimated by minimizing the overall strain energy, each time a new layer is added on the nanolayered stack. The partly relaxed coherency stresses are then used to calculate the apparent fracture toughness ( K app ) by applying the weight function method . The results show that K app increases steeply with increasing bilayer period for very thin SLs, before the values decline more gently along with the formation of misfit dislocations. The characteristic K app vs. bilayer-period-dependence nicely matches experimental trends. Importantly, all critical stress intensity values of the SLs clearly exceed the intrinsic fracture toughness of the layer materials, evincing the importance of coherency stresses for increasing the crack growth resistance.},

We examine the dynamic crushing and energy absorption characteristics of three typical elementary plate-lattices, namely, simple cubic (SC), body-centered cubic (BCC) and face-centered cubic (FCC) as well as three hybrid plate-lattices (SC-BCC, SC-FCC and SC-BCC-FCC) comprising different weight fractions of MWCNTs at different impact energy levels. The results reveal that the SC-BCC-FCC nanocomposite plate-lattice offers the most favorable impact response as each constituent plate in the lattice contributes to the load carrying capacity for all direction vectors included in the plane of the plate. Furthermore, the results show that impregnating MWCNTs into the PPR and HDPE plate-lattices significantly influences their impact energy attenuation characteristics. Compared with the respective unreinforced plate-lattices, PPR/6 wt\% MWCNT SC-BCC-FCC plate-lattices evince higher energy absorption (70\%) than HDPE/6 wt\% MWCNT SC-BCC-FCC plate-lattices (47\%) due to uniform MWCNT dispersion and effective interfacial interaction of MWCNTs in PPR matrix. Our hybrid 3D plate-lattices exhibit a specific energy absorption (SEA) capacity as high as 19.9 J/g, demonstrating their superior impact performance over aluminum and other conventional lattices.},

  abstract     = {Plants have evolved many capabilities to anchor, position their stems and leaves favourably, and adapt themselves to different environmental conditions by virtue of growing. Selenicereus setaceus is a cactus and is an impressive example of a climbing plant found mostly in the Atlantic forest formations of southern Brazil . This cactus displays striking changes in stem geometry along different stages of growth: older parts are circular while the younger parts are star-like in shape. Such a transformation in shape optimizes its flexural rigidity and allows the cactus to search in three-dimensionally complex environments. Its organisation offers novel schemes for the design of plant-inspired soft robotic systems . In this paper, we have created multi-material systems for soft robotics that display controlled movements as well as mimicking the cactus stem geometries from star-like to circular. The unique star-shaped geometry is 3D printed using a soft elastomer and hydrogel is used as an actuating component. Through anisotropic swelling, the hydrogel-elastomer system adjusts its configuration and shows a controlled movement. Furthermore, the isotropic swelling of the hydrogel of the artificial cactus multi-material system result in the change in shape from star-like to circular as the cactus does naturally in the tropical forest.},

A solid mechanics formulation is used, allowing the resolution of both elastic and plastic strains. An explicit dynamics time stepping scheme is used to ensure that the code is robust for the large level of non-linearity native to the AFS-D process. In this present work, a description of the meshfree method will first be described. Then a new thermo-mechanical joining contact algorithm will be introduced. Following that, a description of the experimental setup for the AFS-D model calibration experimental one layer deposition cases is explained. Subsequently, the simulation model and results for three different parameter sets will be detailed and compared against the experimental results.

We develop closed-form expressions for acoustic forces on particles, enabling rapid simulation of thousands of particles, and find excellent agreement with experimentally focused patterns over a range of conditions. We map the geometrical and microstructural features of focused particle patterns and their dependence on processing parameters. We find that mesostructural geometrical features (focused line height, width, and profile shape) can be controlled reliably over a broad range by modulating input parameters, and that while microstructural features are less readily modulated via input parameters, they are well-suited for various transport properties in functional materials . Notably, packing density nears the random close packing limit at 0.64, and particle contact density shows anisotropy favoring particle contacts along the focused lines. These results guide process design for controlling the properties of patterned materials, and outline the property ranges accessible via acoustic focusing. Additionally, we discuss the dependence of material functionalities, particularly electrical, thermal, and ionic transport properties, on the meso- and micro-structural features of patterned composite materials in the context of acoustic focusing.},

A comprehensive evaluation on the fatigue strength debit of axles with foreign object damage (FOD) is vital for their safe operation and maintenance under damage tolerance philosophy. In this study, FODs were simulated by shooting tungsten steel balls to the specimens extracted from surface induction hardened S38C axles. Specifically, tests were performed under three impact velocities, i.e. 200, 300 and 400 m/s, and five incident angles for each impact velocity. Morphologies of impact damage were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) as well as the cross-sections. Fatigue strength of impacted specimens were then evaluated. Results show that depth and volume of damaged zone increases with the incident angle at the velocity of 200 m/s. Fatigue strength losses of specimens impacted at velocities of 300 and 400 m/s is around 50\% compared with that of smooth ones. Fatigue crack originated from the exit rim for 200 m/s glanced impacted specimens, while multiple cracks propagated from both exit rim and bottom of crater impacted at 300 and 400 m/s. Finally, fatigue strength of damaged specimens was evaluated based on the defect depth concept and Kitagawa–Takahashi (K–T) diagram.},

  abstract     = {Wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) has proven that it can produce medium to large components because of its high-rate deposition and potentially unlimited build size. Like all additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, however, an optimized process planning that provides uniform, defect-free deposition is key for the production of parts. Moreover, AM, particularly WAAM, is no longer just a prototyping technology, and most of today&#39;s attention is on its transformation to a viable and cost-effective production. With this transformation, a number of issues need to be addressed, including the accuracy and effectiveness of the manufactured components. Therefore, the emphasis should be on dimensional precision and surface finish in WAAM. This paper covers heat input and management concept, related to the resulting shrinkage, deformation, and residual stresses, which is particularly critical. In addition, we focus on process planning including build orientation, slicing, and path planning, as well as the definition of process parameter selection from a single track to multi-track and multilayer, and finally geometric features from a thin-wall to lattice structures with several case studies. Central to addressing component quality and accuracy, we summarize guiding designs and future needs through numerous WAAM-specific issues, which require for manufacturing of complex components.},

The combination of ICD-inducing nanomedicines and immunoactivators represents a promising strategy for enhancing chemoimmunotherapy in clinical applications. In this review, we provide an overview of the latest advances in chemotherapeutic nanoformulation-mediated immune activation and the combination strategies with various immunoactivating agents, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase inhibitors, cytokines, and Toll-like receptor agonists, and predict their potential to contribute significantly to clinical cancer chemoimmunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of non-weldable high-γ’ Ni base superalloys is challenging due to various issues, but notably because of their inherent cracking propensity. Typically, the segregation of melting point-depressant elements to grain boundaries (GB) drastically increases the solidification interval, allowing the high processing-induced stresses in the parts to pull apart the liquid film at GBs. To achieve a better understanding of the consolidation process of nickel superalloys as well as the origin of defects and cracks, a simplified model γ/γ’-strengthened Ni-Cr-Al-Ti alloy with reduced solidification interval, related to the commercial CM247LC alloy, is investigated under a large parameter survey. The consolidation behavior is typical of nickel superalloys produced by AM, with the optimal condition being a compromise between cracking and porosity. The cracking mechanism is, however, changed to solid-state cracking, localized at high-angle GBs, and likely due to the lack of GB strengthening phases and the inherently low strength of this simplified alloy. Transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography reveal elemental segregation of Ti, and to a lower extent Cr and Al, to the solidification cell boundaries, in agreement with Calphad calculations. No γ’ precipitates are observed in the as-processed condition, indicating that all elements remain in solid solution. No chemical differences are observed between cracked and non-cracked boundaries. Trace amounts of oxygen contained in the powder lead to Al 2 O 3 slag formation, as well as nano oxide dispersoid incorporation. Sulfur, a critical contaminant in superalloys, is detected but rendered harmless by the formation of TiS nanoprecipitates.},

In recent years, the focus has initially been on increasing the efficiency of the systems itself. However, the modification of standard AM metal alloys using nanoparticles offers the possibility to improve the PBF-LB/M-process concerning its process efficiency and actual densification and thermal conductivity . In this work, a methodology for an in-situ investigation of the thermal conductivity as well as the reflectance behavior of metallic powder materials during the PBF-LB/M-process is established. The powder material stainless steel 1.4404 was coated with different nanoparticles (few-layer graphene (FLG), silicon carbide (SiC)) and processed in a standardized build process. As a result, the reflectance rate of all modified materials could be increased. Besides, the thermal conductivity of the material is attested to be a decisive and influencing factor for the quality of the final component. Thus, an improved relative density was achieved using the FLG/1.4404 and SiC/1.4404 (1 vol\%) due to the increased thermal conductivity of the material. Also significant defects in the cross section were visible at SiC/1.4404 (4 vol\%).},

Experimental results indicate that significant cyclic softening was observed for both modes. The cyclic strain ratio is independent of strain amplitude and strain ratio. The plastic strain, plastic strain energy density, and cumulative strain energy density at strain ratio of 0.1 are higher than that at strain ratio of −1. Therefore, applied stress amplitude and fatigue life fitted by Manson-Coffin formula under strain ratio of 0.1 is lower than that at strain ratio of −1. According to the evaluation of the internal stress variables, i.e., back stress, isotropic stress and viscous stress under both modes, the back stress is a critical part of the cyclic stress , which can directly control the cycle softening behavior . Besides, the fatigue life prediction model considering the strain ratio is constituted through hysteresis energy method.

The aim of this study is to propose a novel ultrasonic vibration-assisted (UV-A) electrosurgical cutting system to minimize tissue adhesion and thermal injury, and thereby improve the cutting performance. To this end, the ultrasonic vibration technology was integrated into electrosurgical cutting to develop a UV-A electrosurgical cutting system. Finite element (FE) simulations and experiments were performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed UV-A technology. An orthogonal UV-A electrosurgical cutting FE model was developed using the Comsol Multiphysics software. Subsequently, the effect of UV-A on the temperature distribution and thermal injury during the electrosurgical cutting process was investigated. The FE simulation results indicated that UV-A can reduce the temperature distribution and thermal injury area. The experimental results demonstrated that the temperature and injury depth under UV-A electrosurgical cutting were respectively decreased by approximately 40\% and 30\% compared with that without UV-A. The experimental results agreed well with the FE simulation results. Hence, it is concluded that UV-A electrosurgical cutting can be a novel promising and practical technology for reducing tissue adhesion and thermal injury.},

  abstract     = {Supercapacitors (SCs), with favorable features including excellent stability, superior rate performance, and ultrahigh power densities, offer a cost-effective avenue for energy storage. Electrode materials play a decisive role in SCs. Porous carbon materials have attracted intense interests benefit from their large specific surface area, tunable porosity and high electrical conductivity . For the preparation of porous carbon materials, various hard templates and soft templates have been explored. Among those templates, nano-ZnO turn out to be good choices owing to their facile preparation, adjustable structures, inexpensive and eco-friendliness. Moreover, ZnO could be converted to Zn via carbothermal reduction and the reduced Zn could catalyze the graphitization of carbon. The resulting Zn will be evaporated which makes the template removing process unnecessary. The major purpose of this review is to elucidate the structure-directing role of ZnO templates for the construction of porous carbon nanomaterials and the capacitance performance of corresponding carbon materials. For this objective, the advance in capacitance performance of porous carbon materials synthesized by ZnO templates in the past few years are summarized. This review provides constructive ideas to the design of porous carbon with ZnO templates and applicable to other hard templates for energy storage applications .},

  abstract     = {To reduce the initial peak force (IPF) and improve the crushing force efficiency (CFE) of tubular energy absorbers, buckling induced tubes (BITs) were designed based on modal analysis of straight-walled triangular tubes. The crushing mechanism of the BIT under quasi-static compression was revealed through finite element analysis (FEA) and theoretical analysis. It is found that the BIT can be folded according to specific mode by cleverly presetting the convex-concave structure form. The larger is the amplitude of the buckling wave, the smaller is the IPF, as well as the mean crushing force (MCF). But the CFE is greatly improved. Compared with straight tubes, high-order mode BITs have lower IPF but greater MCF, CFE and specific energy absorption (SEA). A simplified model based on Shanley model was proposed to predict the IPF of the BIT. The MCF was predicted by improved super folding element (SFE) and simplified super folding element (SSFE) models. End buckling induction mechanism is introduced as an efficient way to reduce the IPF, but keep the MCF and enhance the CFE simultaneously.},

In this study, dedicated powder sampling from different positions within the build chamber and powder bed was performed. The results clearly indicate the importance of the surface-to-volume ratio of the built components on powder degradation, as demonstrated by the analysis of the powder using capsules filled with dense lattice structures. Extensive formation of Al- and Cr-rich oxides on the entrained powder deposited on the gas inlet and outlet was detected. Significant oxygen pick-up by spatter particles compared to the virgin powder was measured (&gt;300 ppm O 2 ); while the as-built material experienced a slight loss (~30 ppm O 2 ). The change in the microstructure of spatter particles in comparison to the virgin powder, namely the primary dendrite arm spacing, indicates significantly higher cooling rate during spatter solidification, estimated to be of about 10 8 K/s, compared to around 10 6 K/s for the virgin powder and 10 7 K/s for the L-PBF component. These findings allows to evaluate the extent of powder degradation during L-PBF and establish the oxygen balance of the process.},

The instantaneous power density can reach 1.1 mW/cm 2 and the charge quantity in single capacitor charging circle is approximately 0.30 μC. It also has the surpassing force-electrical linearity that the output voltage positively correlating to stretching speeds and stretching rates.

The SACNAs composed of CuO nanotentacles show excellent gas-sensing performance at room temperature of 25 °C mainly due to the diameter of nanotentacles close to the Debye length of CuO. Besides, CuO nanoarrays can maximize the adsorption of the gas molecules on the surface area, and further their diffusion between CuO nanotentacles based on the structure of the cross-linked clusters, which could be beneficial for gas-sensing performance. Moreover, the adequate point-to-point contacts between CuO nanotentacles build abundant effective electrical conducting paths for the sensing reactions. A high response up to 24.08 was achieved at as low as 5 ppb H 2 S with an ultra-low detection limit of 1.52 ppb. In contrast, there are negligible responses to other gases such as ethanol, methanol, acetone and so on, even at very high concentrations (200 ppm). The sensor based on SACNAs indicates a remarkable response to extremely low concentrations of H 2 S, as well as ultra-high selectivity, excellent repeatability, and long-term stability at 25 °C.

The slightly increased Al content was chosen to counteract an Al loss during the process. Therefore, the chemistry of the powder was investigated after each building job, especially in terms of Al evaporation and O impurities. Based on an extensive parameter study with different preheating temperatures of the base plate , crack-free samples with relative densities of 99.9\% were built. It could be shown that the process parameters have a direct influence on the microstructure in terms of phase composition, grain size, and lamellar spacing. The results of the post-processing heat treatment study enable the definition of parameters for adjusting an isotropic nearly lamellar γ or a fully lamellar microstructure, which corresponds to the respective microstructure obtained using conventional processing routes.},

This study employed miniature mechanical tests to investigate the deformation and failure behaviors of nugget, heat affected zone (HAZ), and corona bond of resistance spot welded JSC980YL steel. A novel mini-peel test was developed to enable local fracture in HAZ for numerical inverse calibration of constitutive parameters. The fracture constants of weld zones calibrated using Cockcroft-Latham ductile failure criterion were incorporated in finite element models to predict the failure modes of spot welds in tensile-shear and cross-tension coupon tests. The result indicates that the ultimate tensile strengths of the nugget and the corona bond were 37.6\% higher and 5.8\% lower, respectively, than that of the base material. The nugget and HAZ exhibited ductile fracture , whereas the corona bond was brittle fracture with only 1.2\% elongation. In the coupon tests, the increase of nugget diameter slowed down the damage accumulation rate in the nugget and accelerated that in the HAZ, resulting in the transition of failure mode from interfacial to pullout. The failure load of corona bond in coupon tests increased with the increase of nugget diameter while its contribution to the peak load decreased.},

Three distinct composite powders containing 1, 3, and 5 wt\%VC were prepared through ball-milling and subjected to laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process to print different composites on top of monolithic H13 in a wide range of process parameters. Almost fully-dense parts were achieved (maximum of 99.8, 99.8, and 99.5\% for 1, 3 and 5 wt\%VC composite systems , respectively); however, the increase in VC content narrowed down the processability window range from 60 J/mm 3 for 1, and 3wt\%VC systems to 30 J/mm 3 for 5 wt\%VC system. The mechanical properties of optimum samples were characterized through microhardness , nanohardness , and wear tests. The incorporation of VC significantly improved the mechanical properties, 17–40\% in microhardness, 10–40\% in nanohardness, and 20–53\% in wear resistance. The underlying reasons behind such an improvement were correlated to the dissolution of VC during the heating stage of the LPBF process and the formation of (V + C)-supersaturated solid solution in large extents as a result of extremely high cooling rates . This study introduces LPBF-processed FGMs as promising candidates for applications in which wear resistance is paramount.},

  abstract     = {Decommissioning of the damaged Chernobyl nuclear reactor Unit 4 is a top priority for the global community. Before such operations begin, it is crucial to understand the behaviour of the hazardous materials formed during the accident. Since those materials formed under extreme and mostly unquantified conditions, modelling alone is insufficient to accurately predict their physical, chemical and, predominantly, mechanical behaviour . Meanwhile, knowledge of the mechanical characteristics of those materials, such as their strength , is a priority before robotic systems are employed for retrieval and the force expected from them to be exerted is one of the key design questions. In this paper we target to measurement of the standard mechanical properties of the materials formed during the accident by testing small-scale, low radioactivity simulants. A combined methodology using Hertzian indentation, synchrotron X-ray tomography and digital volume correlation (DVC), was adopted to estimate the mechanical properties. Displacement fields around the Hertzian indentation, performed in-situ in a synchrotron, were measured by analysing tomograms with DVC. The load applied during the indentation, combined with full-field displacement measured by DVC was used to estimate the mechanical properties, such as Young&#39;s modulus and Poisson&#39;s ratio of these hazardous materials.},

  abstract     = {Metal additive manufacturing (AM) improves the design flexibility of titanium aluminides (TiAl-based alloys) as a new class of high-temperature alloys towards widespread applications. In this work, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the site-specific thermal history and grain evolution during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of TiAl-based alloys are investigated through an integrated computational and experimental effort. In specific, a multiphysics modeling framework integrating a finite element thermal model with a highly efficient phase-field method is developed to simulate the solidification microstructure at different locations within the melt pool during LPBF processing. The investigation of process-microstructure relationship is accomplished using a Ti-45Al (at.\%) alloy for a binary approximation, with a focus on site-specific primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) and non-equilibrium microsegregation . The microstructural sensitivity to spatial variations, individual processing parameters, and misorientation angle between the preferred crystalline orientation and the temperature gradient direction are studied to thoroughly understand the rapid solidification during LPBF. LPBF experiments are carried out to validate the modeling results in terms of melt pool dimensions and site-specific PDAS across the melt pool. The knowledge gained in this work will benefit the development of AM processing routine for fabrication of high-performance TiAl-based alloys towards extensive applications.},

  abstract     = {Joining of dissimilar metals is required for numerous applications in industries such as chemical, energy and automotive. It is challenging due to differences in melting point, density, and thermal expansion of the metals being joined. Common welding techniques involve limiting melting and solidification to a narrow area leading to high thermal stresses and potentially brittle intermetallic phases. Furthermore, the geometric complexity of these welded joints can be rather limited. Additive Manufacturing (AM) presents new techniques for joining of dissimilar metals. One of the emerging methods is the building of functionally graded parts using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) to spatially vary composition. In this paper, a SS316 L and C300 maraging steel couple were joined by DED and heat treated. 13 discrete composition layers were selected using metallurgical considerations, in order to ensure a smooth transition in properties and microstructure. The mechanical properties of the as-built joints were found to be similar to the SS part and no intermetallic phases were found in the interface.},

  abstract     = {Diffusion driven high-temperature oxidation is one of the most important failure mechanisms of protective thin films in industrial applications. Within this study, we investigated the diffusion of oxygen at 800 to 1100 °C through nano-laminated crystalline Ti-Al-N and amorphous Mo-Si-B based multilayer coatings . The most prominent oxygen diffusion pathways, and hence the weakest points for oxidation, were identified by combining 18 O tracer diffusion and atom probe tomography . An oxygen inward diffusion along column boundaries within Ti-Al-N layers in front of a visually prevalent oxidation front could be proven, highlighting the importance of these fast diffusion pathways. Furthermore, the amorphous Mo-Si-B layers act as barriers and therefore mitigate the migration of oxygen by accumulating reactive O species at a nanoscale range. Preventing oxygen diffusion along column boundaries – through the implementation of amorphous interlayers – lead to paralinear oxidation behavior and stable scales even after 7 h at 1100 °C. Our results provide a detailed insight on the importance of morphological features such as grain and column boundaries during high-temperature oxidation of protective thin films, in addition to their chemistry.},

In this study, new findings on the structure-property relationships of a specific class of AM meta-biomaterials based on minimal surfaces which have not been well understood previously (i.e., Primitive and Schoen-IWP (IWP)) are presented. Biocompatible Ti-6Al-4V meta-biomaterials based on Primitive and IWP topologies, with three different morphological properties for each, were designed and fabricated via laser powder bed fusion technique. The microstructure, morphological, quasi-static compressive, flexural properties, and fracture mechanisms of the designed meta-biomaterials are thoroughly evaluated. Studied meta-biomaterials exhibited distinct fracture mechanisms under flexural loading depending on their topology; crack growth path was either zigzag (i.e., deflected) or straight. Additionally, Primitive meta-biomaterials exhibited ductile material behavior , under both compressive and flexural loading conditions, with pore size, porosity, and elastic gradient similar to the trabecular bone (850–1020 μm, 40–64\%, and 3200–6000 MPa). However, IWP meta-biomaterials showed brittle behavior with porosity and elastic gradient closer to cortical bone (20–42\% and 7000–13,000 MPa). These outcomes indicate that both mechanical behavior and fracture mechanisms of meta-biomaterials can be controlled based on topology and morphology.},

One of the challenges is how to accurately forecast the property by the features including chemical compositions, experiment conditions, and structure information. In this study, with consistent features in statistics and materials science, we proposed a microstructure-informatic strategy to achieve the goal of accurately predicting Vickers hardness of austenitic steels . Feature engineering including correlations analysis, importance ranking and microstructural features extraction was employed to ensure the most information contained in the features related to the property. Through training and comparing six regression models with different input features, we demonstrated that one of the models inputting microstructural features obtained by two-point statistics combined with principal component analysis (PCA) maintains the highest accuracy (absolute error≤13.63 MPa, relative error≤8.86\%) and predictive stability (minimum error range). The excellent generalization ability of this model was validated by eight experimental instances unseen in the original dataset. We believe that our strategy can be used to guide future experiments due to its high precision. Most importantly, the strategy can be generalized to predict other mechanical properties controlled by microstructures in more material systems.},

The original microstructure of 18Mn18Cr0.6 N steel was examined using electron backscatter diffraction analysis. Specimens were eroded using an ultrasonic cavitation erosion facility. The damaged surfaces were observed using scanning electron microscopy. Coherent Σ3 boundaries had the worst cavitation erosion resistance; the cavitation damage was located primarily at the same sides of the twins with a low Taylor factor . The cavitation erosion resistance decreased in the order: random high-angle grain boundaries and Σ27 boundaries; incoherent Σ3 boundaries; Σ9 boundaries; and coherent Σ3 boundaries. The Taylor factor was important in the analyses of metal material cavitation erosion. A large difference between the two grains or twins in the Taylor factor yielded a higher cracking risk of the boundary between them. Grain rotation led to a step formation at a boundary and the cavitation damage was accelerated. Three types of cavitation erosion were identified. A cavitation mechanism model for coherent Σ3 boundaries was proposed. Finally, the design of grain-boundary characteristics to improve the cavitation erosion resistance was discussed.},

In order to investigate the weldability of these two lightweight materials, the hybrid joints of 5052 aluminum alloy (AA5052) and carbon fiber reinforced polyether ether ketone composites (CF-PEEK) were fabricated by friction stir spot welding . The variance analysis revealed that the dwell time and plunge speed were the most significant factors. By optimizing the welding parameters, the ultimate tensile shear load reached 2690±64 N (the dwell time: 8 s, the plunge speed: 10 mm/min). The interface could be divided into pin-affected zone, shoulder-affected zone, resin adhesive zone and resin concentrated zone. Since resin concentrated zone could not provide interfacial bonding due to delamination , the shoulder-affected zone and pin-affected zone were decisive regions for mechanical properties . The bonding mechanism included three parts: adhesive bonding provided by re-solidified resin, macro-mechanical interlocking of aluminum alloy that entered CF-PEEK, and micro-mechanical interlocking of resin that was tightly trapped at surface slits as well as the carbon fibers beset into AA5052. This work clarifies the interfacial characteristics of AA5052/CF-PEEK hybrid joints and provides an approach to improve the mechanical properties.},

MSNP obtained by using 20 mol\% of ED achieved a surface area of 80 m 2 .g −1 and increasing the ED content to 30 mol\% resulted in a surface area of 501 m 2 .g −1 . Zeta potential of novel MSNPs (−65.5 and 70.0 mV) were much higher than the nanoparticle (NP) prepared from only TEOS (−49 mV), indicating the presence of a large number of –SiOH and phosphonic acid surface functional groups, as confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. The functionalized MSNPs were used as an adsorbent for the removal of cationic pollutants like methylene blue (MB). The MSNP with the highest porosity displayed favorable MB adsorption behavior with ~380 mg.g −1 of MB adsorption capacity . Facile regeneration in an acidic medium (~pH 4.5) with easy recyclability (10 cycles) confirmed the practical applicability of this novel functionalized MSNPs.},

Furthermore, the present work investigates the electrochemical performance of the NFO thin film electrode in the different electrolytes (viz. Na 2 SO 4, Li 2 SO 4 , and Na 2 SO 4 : Li 2 SO 4 ). It was revealed that the NFO thin film shows improved electrochemical performance in Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte with a high specific capacity of 18.56 mAh/g at 1 mA/cm 2 current density. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopic results reveal that the NFO thin film electrode shows low series and charge transfer resistance values for Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte than other electrolytes.

The results showed that a thin buffer layer can be naturally generated in-between the deposition layer and substrate owning to the dilution effect, producing functionally graded structures consisted of martensite dendrite matrices and intermetallic phases (e.g., M 23 (C, B) 6 ). Unfortunately, the poor deformation characteristic of natural buffer layers can exacerbate the risk of cracking, leading to an incompatibility between martensitic stainless steel and forming steel. A thick artificial buffer layer was then designed by addition of Inconel 625 powder. Because of the formation of graded austenite phase in the artificial buffer layer, the yield strength of specimen was enhanced significantly. Hence, our study can be used for manufacture of reliable moulds with high surface hardness and structural strength and may be helpful in further developing hybrid forming strategy in the field of mould manufacture. When subjected to stress impact during mould filling, the artificial buffer layer with functionally graded properties would have a perfect capability to bear the deformation as the load increased, dramatically improving the reliability and functionality of moulds.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the influence of 0.005 vol\% and 0.05 vol\% of carbon nanoparticles on the surface of polyamide 12 powder particles by dry coating and colloidal additivation is evaluated in great detail concerning thermal and microstructural properties. The dispersion of the nanoparticles on the polymer surface influences the flowability of the feedstock powder already during the additivation process. When analyzing the composite powders dynamically and isothermally with fast scanning and differential scanning calorimetry , carbon nanoparticles influence the crystallization behavior of the feedstock material significantly by acting as nucleation seeds, already at a few percent of a monolayer coating , while showing no effect on the fast heating process. The difference in calorimetric properties and crystallization behavior between the additivation methods of different abrasive forces is discussed. The surface-additivated carbon nanoparticles significantly increase the crystalline area by up to a threefold and the crystallization rate by up to a hundredfold. Furthermore, they change the crystal growth from a typical two- to three-dimensional growth of spherulites to a one- to two-dimensional growth of ellipsoidal impinged lamellar structures . Between 0.005 vol\% and 0.05 vol\% of well-dispersed carbon nanoparticles should be added to polyamide 12 to trigger an anisotropic heterogeneous nucleation while avoiding agglomerates.},

Here, this fabrication technique is exploited for engineering scaffolds accurately mimicking the shape and size of three types of human cells. The human cell models employed in the study were chosen to include a range of dimensions and different identifiable features to highlight the versatility of this fabrication approach , yet other cell shapes can easily be fabricated in similar manner. The design and fabrication parameters for the additive manufacturing process were optimized to obtain polymeric scaffolds with biomimetic shapes. After fabrication, the cell scaffolds were converted to polymer-cushioned model cell membranes through layer-by-layer functionalization with a cationic polymer and a lipid bilayer . Scaffold functionalization was verified using confocal laser scanning microscopy . Polymer-cushioned model cell membranes supported on 3D scaffolds mimicking the shape of human cells are particularly suitable for membrane interaction studies where membrane curvature plays an important role. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the engineering of biomimetic cell membranes by high-resolution additive manufacturing combined with surface functionalization . The interdisciplinary approach highlights the value of additive manufacturing as technological solution for challenges encountered in biomedical studies.},

The biocompatible polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) based microneedle patch was prepared using gamma rays . The back side of the PVP based microneedle patch were coated with gold or silver as bioelectrodes using the thermal evaporation method to maximize and control the efficiency of drug release. The Au or Ag-coated microneedle patch has enough mechanical properties to successfully penetrate the skin. In addition, it was confirmed using a Franz cell that the amount of drug released from a drug-loaded microneedle patch was maximized by thermal or electrical stimulus. The drug-release efficiency increased more than 7.9 times compared to a flat PVP patch (without applying electricity) when 3 V was applied. In addition, when ~40 °C heat were applied, the drug-release efficiency of the Au- and Ag-coated PVP based microneedle patches improved about 5.3 times compared to a flat PVP patch at room temperature. These excellent properties of our metal-coated PVP based microneedle patches can be used not only in whitening or anti-wrinkling cosmetics, but also as medical drug-delivery systems to treat such as hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis.},

Recently, neural tissue engineering scaffolds with appropriate physical and biological functions have been extensively developed to promote nerve regeneration and improve motor and sensory functions during SCI therapy. In this work, we summarized the physical support and bioelectrical signal conduction of polymer scaffolds for SCI repair from the aspects of biocompatibility, biodegradation, internal structure, mechanical performance, and conductivity. In addition, the biological functions of the polymer scaffolds were reviewed for the reversal of adverse pathophysiological factors to improve the microenvironments of the injured site and promote endogenous neurogenesis during SCI therapy. Moreover, the future development of these engineered scaffolds for potential clinical applications was predicted.},

However, the effects of anisotropy and handedness (chirality) on their mechanical properties , such as directional moduli, Poisson&#39;s ratio, and other coupling effects, are not clearly understood due to the lack of analytical methods to handle both anisotropy and chirality . Herein, we construct a generalized micropolar homogenization method to characterize the elastic constants of tetra-chiral and tetra-achiral lattices having different joint types. The developed method can identify the directional moduli and Poisson&#39;s ratio and coupling effects in the anisotropic wavy lattices. The generalized micropolar homogenization of the wavy square lattices reveals i) the axial–shear coupling effect of tetra-chiral structures, ii) the weak correlation of the chirality of tetra-chiral lattices to auxeticity, and iii) the directional positive and negative Poisson&#39;s ratio of tetra-achiral lattices.

In intact wood, zone lines define an irregular volume of decaying wood. They are primarily aggregations of melanised hyphae that enclose wood being decayed by a single genetic individual of a wood decay fungus . In the industry for speciality wood products, zone lines are highly valued, especially for decorative pieces produced from wood turnery. While zone lines are commonly found in naturally infected wood, they can also be induced under controlled conditions. Although with great economic potential for application, there is currently no spalting process to produce zone lines on a commercial scale for niche furniture and construction markets. Successfully spalting wood in a defined timeframe that meets industry expectations requires a knowledge of fungal species, wood colonisation strategies, fungal decay processes along with wood behaviour (i.e. its hygroscopicity), anatomy and wood mechanical properties in relation to fungal decay. This review identifies current limitations of zone-line spalting and looks at a novel approach to inducing wood by combining genetic individuals from the same fungal species, enabling the operator to homogenise the spalting method.},

As additive manufacturing (AM) technology advances, the lattice structures, which are extremely difficult shapes to fabricate using conventional manufacturing processes , has attracted great interest due to their intrinsic characteristics such as high strength and lightweight. We propose an effective global-local design approach of gradient lattice structures with the selection of a lattice type in a zone and optimizing its strut diameter considering the whole loading conditions of a mechanical part, in order to obtain higher specific strength than other corresponding designs. In this work, two basic types of a lattice named as BCC and OTC, was utilized to design diverse local lattices based on optimizing a strut-diameter. To evaluate the usefulness of this approach, we designed a three-point bending test specimen with topology-optimized multi-lattice wire model, and strut-based topometry optimization on the wire model. The experimental test results show that the optimized specimen had more than 67\% higher strength per weight compared to other multi-lattice ones. Through this work, we believe that this method is a promising way to effectively design high strength mechanical parts with lightweight for use in high-valuable industrial applications.},

However, coalescence , and not merely melting, is the basis for mechanical properties in LPPBF printed parts. The authors present a method for (1) predicting polymer coalescence based on transient temperature profiles resulting from a combination of LPPBF process parameter values and (2) connecting the predicted coalescence response to the observed onset of a plateau in mechanical properties. This work tests the hypothesis that the observed onset of a mechanical property plateau corresponds with a transition in consolidation physics. Complete coalescence must be achieved prior to the onset of physical gelation . For this work, in situ transient temperature profiles were obtained using infrared thermography . Coalescence prediction, via the Upper-convected Maxwell model , and physical gelation prediction, via Lauritzen-Hoffman and Avrami equations , were found to successfully identify LPPBF parameter combinations resulting in parts with density and tensile strength inside the plateau region . The hypothesis that the plateau occurs at the onset of closed pore morphology is supported.},

For powder bed fusion of polymers the knowledge about which material properties are important for the process and the product quality is insufficient. This causes significant difficulties in developing new materials. To address this problem, it is necessary to establish a clear link between the material properties, process parameters and the resulting component quality. This link can be achieved by performing a combination of experimental investigations, numerical simulations and analytical considerations to develop dimensionless characteristic numbers that are able to describe the process. Therefore, this paper presents material properties and monolayer printing experiments for polyamide 12. The experimental results are compared with numerical simulations based on the material and process data. Based on these results, we present a method of how to calculate the dimensionless energy input by combining the surface energy density with material properties and measured thickness of the monolayer samples.

Fatigue lifetime is computed using a straightforward approach, based on a one-parameter damage law, developed via uniaxial low-cycle fatigue tests .

  abstract     = {In this work, TiO 2 nano particle was used for two purposes: it played as a role of a solid carrier for immobilization of HRP, and meanwhile acted as a photo-catalyst itself. In this way, the loss of enzymatic activity during enzyme immobilization can be compensated by the coupling of TiO 2 photo-catalysis. Then, the surface of TiO 2 nanoparticles were modified by phase-transitioned lysozyme (PTL) and connected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) via a DNA helix (HRP-DNA-PTL@TiO 2 ). The DNA double helix chain was utilized as a flexible spacer arm to keep the flexibility of the immobilized enzyme. The HRP-DNA-PTL@TiO 2 showed a high recovered activity (90.52\%) of the original activity of free HRP. This data is better than most reported activity recovery of immobilized enzyme. Moreover, HRP-DNA-PTL@TiO 2 can maintain high catalytic activity, stability and reusability when degrading phenol in wastewater. The phenol of 0.5 mmol∙L −1 could be totally degraded within 10 min. Moreover, a visual colorimetric method for phenol concentration by HRP-DNA-PTL@TiO 2 was established, and the phenol concentration of 0–0.2 mmol∙L −1 can be visually detected with naked eyes. Furthermore, an enzymatic-photocatalytic synergetic effect of HRP-DNA-PTL@TiO 2 is found and investigated. The efficiency of HRP-DNA-PTL@TiO 2 ensures it a potential application in the wastewater treatment .},

Herein, we newly developed NbMoTaTi 0.5 Ni 0.5 HEA which renders a high room-temperature compressive strength of 2297 MPa and high-temperature (1000 °C) compressive strength of 651 MPa. Meanwhile we present that the addition of both Ni and Ti can suppress the crack formation and enhance the formability of NbMoTa HEA, prepared by selective laser melting (SLM), without compromising the mechanical performance. Actually, the fracture is suppressed by the transformation of microcracks due to grain boundaries with low stacking fault energy (SFE) which can greatly improve the formability of HEAs while ensuring its high-temperature performance.

Thanks to these features, the obtained nanofibrous dressings achieved excellent unidirectional water-transport performance, which could drive wound exudates to flow spontaneously from inside to outside and prevent pumped biofluids rewetting the wounds. In addition, the designed trilayered dressing exhibited approximately 100\% antibacterial ability against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli when the concentration of antibacterial agents polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride (PHGC) was 0.06 wt\%. Moreover, the trilayered dressings revealed excellent water absorption performance , air and moisture permeability, mechanical strength , biocompatibility, and low cell adhesion behavior, indicating the potential applications for the trilayered nanofibrous wound dressings in wound care.},

There is a growing interest in improving the spectral response of solar modules, especially in harvesting UV photons, which offer intense energy in a narrow wavelength range. To harvest UV photons and reduce reflection without interfering with the formulas and manufacturing process of solar cells, in this work, thin films that possess downshifting and antireflection capabilities were fabricated on the cover glass of multicrystalline Si solar cells. The thin films were composed of graded index layers of europium-doped yttrium orthovanadate (YVO 4 :Eu) and hollow silica nanoparticles (HSNPs). The design of the composite thin films was assisted by the FDTD mathematical model that simulated the refractive index and thickness of each layer to obtain the optimum transmittance. The cover glass with multifunctional thin films harvested more than 30\% of UV photons and enhanced the solar conversion efficiency by 4.12\% at normal incidence compared to the uncoated cover glass.},

Here, SMP metamaterials with mechanical reconstruction and self-recovery ability are proposed. Affected by the glass transition temperature of the material, the mechanical properties of the metamaterials are related to the geometric parameters of the lattice configuration and the external temperature. The metamaterials can adaptively switch mechanical properties and shapes without continuous external excitation of the physical field. The finite element method and experiments were used to analyze the deformation and self-recovery process of the metamaterials. The results show that the metamaterial can achieve mechanical programming and response recovery, and the bandgap of the metamaterial can be greatly adjusted by changing the external temperature.},

This paper, therefore, reports on the development of a novel non-destructive inspection method for detecting white layers using grain size-sensitive and crystallographic texture-sensitive techniques. It is shown that x-ray diffraction can be used to detect white layers as thin as 5 μm in Ti-6Al-4 V through measurement of diffraction peak breadths and diffraction peak intensities, due to the influence of the sub 100 nm grain size and high lattice strain in the white layer, as well as the strong crystallographic texture in this titanium alloy . Compared to the existing optical microscopy inspection method, which can take days due to the number of steps involved, the x-ray diffraction peak breadth method offers non-destructive white layer detection in a matter of minutes at a resolution of 5 μm or less that competes directly with the optical method. Spatially resolved acoustic spectroscopy, a laser-generated ultrasonic surface acoustic wave detection method, can also be used to identify anomalous surfaces, containing a white layer or swept grain material, due to its sensitivity to the crystallographic texture changes that arise in severely plastically deformed Ti-6Al-4V as in Titanium with 6\% Aluminium and 4\% Vanadium.},

Icariin (Ica), which is the main active component of traditional Chinese medicine - herba epimedii, has been widely loaded to scaffolds for the treatment of bone fracture and osteoporosis. To increase drug loading capacity, and meanwhile achieve a stable and safe drug delivery, in present study, a novel icariin derivative - thiolated icariin (Ica-SH) molecule with good cytocompatibility and bioactivity was incorporated into biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) ceramic scaffold through Ica-SH intermolecular disulfide bonds ( abbr., Ica-SH/BCP) to form film coating. Compared with Ica-loaded BCP scaffolds via physical adsorption (abbr., Ica/BCP), the formation of Ica-SH intermolecular disulfide bonds in Ica-SH/BCP scaffolds led to a decreased real-time drug release concentration, and a reduced drug release rate. The released drug from Ica-SH/BCP scaffolds could promote the proliferation, migration, and osteoblastic differentiation of ovariectomized rat bone mesenchymal stem cells (OVX-rBMSCs), and up-regulate the angiogenic gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro . The OVX-rat femoral condyle defect model also demonstrated that Ica-SH/BCP scaffolds promoted a superior bone regeneration in osteoporotic animals than BCP ones. These findings suggest that Ica-SH is a promising drug, which can be facilely incorporated into a variety of scaffolds for repairing bone defects of patients, in particular the ones with osteoporosis.},

In this study, we incorporated various degrees of cross-linking of gelatine microspheres (GM) into MPBC and improved the physicochemical and biocompatible properties, biodegradation and drug release behaviour of the composites. Diclofenac sodium (DS) was utilized as a model drug. Through experiments and observations, we found that the GM induced an adjustable setting time (12 min–16 min), high compression strength (23 MPa–58 MPa), abundant macropores (30.2\%–37.8\%) and sustained DS release with the double exponential biphasic kinetic model (more than 2 months) into the MPBC composites. Moreover, the sustained release of magnesium and calcium ions had a synergistic effect with GM on the proliferation, osteogenesis differentiation, mineralization ability and gene expression (COL I, OPN, and Runx2) of MC3T3-E1 cells. Subcutaneous implantation and histological analyses indicated that the MPBC-GM composites activated angiogenesis without inducing severe inflammatory reactions.

Small amphiphilic fluorophores in aqueous solution present a rather complicated system, where individual molecules (monomers) or nano-scale assemblies co-exist in the solution. How and in which form do they enter into cells, and how they further gather in cells? These questions are still remain unknown to the best of our knowledge. In order to unravel the above problems, we herein studied the cellular uptake of a cationic amphiphile TPE-11, which shows strong aggregation induced emission effects in aqueous solution. Significant differences of fluorescent signals were obtained when concentration of TPE-11 applied to label Hela cells was below and above its critical micellar concentration (CMC). To elucidate the pathways for assembly forms entering into inner cells, we screened candidate proteins involving in internalization of TPE-11 in HeLa cells by using proteomics analysis, liquid chromatography plus mass spectrometry. The results indicate that TPE-11 mainly takes form of assemblies to enter into cells via Clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE). The result was confirmed by the specific inhibitor of the CDE pathway and knockdown of Clathrin with shRNA interfering. The cellular uptake demonstrated by TPE-11 might also apply to analogous cationic amphiphilic molecules .},

They exhibited thermal stability above 250 °C, which allowed them to be melt-processed with polypropylene (PP) and formed into thin films (~ 0.6 mm). Rheological measurements of the PP blends exhibited a typical shear thinning behavior and provided evidence for the synthesized compound&#39;s thermo-oxidative stabilizing effect. This was also confirmed by thermal analysis showing that the thermo-oxidative stability of PP-SEDOPO and PP-SEDPPO blends was higher (~25 °C) than the blank PP; however, PP-SEDPP had a smaller impact. Small scale fire tests of the PP-FR blends confirmed the flame retardant efficacy of the new P-compounds. Cone calorimetry on PP-SEDOPO blends showed a reduction in the heat release rate (HRR) (~48\%) compared to blank PP. Further thermal and evolved gas analysis of the PP blends confirmed that the new P-compounds are primarily active in the gas-phase.},

  abstract     = {Surface modification of carbon fibres (CFs) is an important part of the interfacial study of CF composites . Traditional modification methods feature complicated production processes and a variety of influential factors. The modification technology utilized may cause fibre damage. To solve this problem, a simple and efficient CF surface modification method involving the in-situ carbonisation of micron-sized sucrose particles, is proposed in this paper. Sucrose crystals were introduced on the surface of the CFs by an ethyl acetate suspension coating and carbonised in atmosphere at moderate temperatures. Carbonisation of sucrose at 290 °C in air resulted in not only the formation of a large amount of C O content, but also in micron-sized particles. The attachment of these uniform and reactive particles to the CF surfaces resulted in a markedly improved impact resistance level of the carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite. Meanwhile, the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of the carbonised sucrose-deposited fibre/epoxy composites increased by 20.8\% and 13.8\%, respectively. This method provides a novel, convenient, and effective approach to enhance the mechanical properties of high-performance CFRPs .},

Based on comprehensive microstructure characterizations and mechanical property examinations, underlying microstructural evolution mechanism and microstructure-property relationship of the produced alloys were uncovered and elucidated thoroughly. Homogeneous macrostructure and fine-grain microstructure without undissolved particles and large pores are obtained for the alloy after thermomechanical powder consolidation as a result of the concurrent effect of external deformation and high-temperature diffusion. One-step open-die forging is verified to produce full-dense and sound PM alloy pancake with large-scale and high strength . Attributed to the harmonious concurrence of hierarchical α precipitation and heterogeneous grain structure , synergistic strength-ductility combinations are achieved for the alloy after specific processing and heat treatment with the tensile strength and strain at failure values of 1386.5 MPa/7.3\% and 1252.3 MPa/9.0\%, respectively.

A preferential interface character of {110}Cu[111]//{110}Ag[111] was formed when the layer thickness was reduced to 20 nm. Specifically, high strength , high electrical conductivity and excellent thermal stability were obtained simultaneously in bulk Cu/Ag nanolayered composite with h = 20 nm. Ultimate tensile strength of 938.1 MPa was achieved, corresponding to 2.9 times higher than the rule-of-mixtures estimate based on the strength of the heavily deformed Cu and Ag samples with 95\% rolling reduction. Furthermore, a high electrical conductivity higher than that of pure copper was obtained, while high hardness (3.74 GPa) was maintained up to an annealing temperature of 500 °C. Nevertheless, degradation of the mechanical hardness and nanolayered structure occurred once the temperature exceeded 500 °C. Two major mechanisms are responsible for driving the onset of the thermal instability in this CARB-processed Cu/Ag nanolayered composites, namely triple junction motion and Rayleigh instability mechanisms.},

Two widely used tests, four-point bending (4PB) and the stressed overlayer (SOL) technique, are juxtaposed and employed in this study to determine adhesion of WTi on borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) implemented in a model multilayer material stack with representative materials encountered in microelectronic applications including silicon , ductile metallic films and soft polyimide layers. The applicability and reproducibility of both methods is discussed in this paper including a detailed analysis of the stress evolution of the delaminating WTi using X-ray diffraction. While both adhesion measurement techniques reveal comparable adhesion energies for the WTi-BPSG interface, namely (9.4 ± 0.6) J/m 2 and (10.1 ± 1.0) J/m 2 for 4PB and SOL, respectively, we come to the conclusion that 4PB allows to integrally test the entire stack on a larger scale and SOL allows to determine the weakest site of the interface on a local scale. Both suggested methods are promising for future sub-micrometer thin film designs in complex multilayered structures since they are easy to perform and allow for a good statistical output of the results.},

The metal was characterized in the horizontal and vertical build orientations under uniaxial tension to failure in the as-built and machined conditions. Results showed that there was an increase in strength and decrease in ductility of the metal with powder reuse, resulting from rising oxygen content of the powder. The elongation at failure and tensile toughness of the metal exhibited anisotropy, which increased substantially with powder reuse. For the horizontal orientation, the elongation at failure decreased by over 60\% in the 30 builds, which was one and a half times greater reduction than that for the vertical orientation. The anisotropy in ductility with reuse is suspected to result from changes in microstructure with oxygen content, specifically changes in the grain boundary alpha phase .

The Menger sponge-like fractal structures consisting of non-periodic fractal pores mimick the architectures and biomechanical properties of human bone. In this investigation, porous NiTi alloys designed with Menger sponges were fabricated by additive manufacturing using selective laser melting technology, and their superelastic behaviors were systematically characterized for the first time. Additively manufactured bulk NiTi alloys exhibit fully recoverable superelastic responses with slim stress hysteresis . The mechanical properties of bulk NiTi alloys match the properties of human cortical bones. The Menger sponges display excellent superelastic recovery strain ratios even at high porosity levels. The mechanical properties of highly fractalized Menger sponges are almost identical to the properties of human cancellous bones. The deformation mechanism undergoes a transformation from bending-dominated to stretching-dominated mode when the porous structures are highly fractalized. The unique combination of fractal topology, nanostructured microstructure, highly controllable elastic modulus and large recoverable deformation make the NiTi Menger sponge a promising candidate for metallic implants.},

Multi-domain configurations, including long range ordered ferroelectric domains and nano domains, were observed using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). Under an applied DC field, the nano domains irreversibly transformed to micro-meter sized domains, which is consistent with the Vogel-Fulcher Law fitted results that show that the freezing temperatures of the two ceramics are above room temperature.

  abstract     = {Fusion and advanced fission power plants require advanced nuclear materials to function under new, extreme environments. Understanding the evolution of mechanical and functional properties during radiation damage is essential to the design and commercial deployment of these systems. The shortcomings of existing methods could be addressed by a new technique - intermediate energy proton irradiation (IEPI) - using beams of 10–30 MeV protons to rapidly and uniformly damage bulk material specimens before direct testing of engineering properties. IEPI is shown to achieve high fidelity to fusion and fission environments in both primary damage production and transmutation, often superior to nuclear reactor or typical (low-range) ion irradiation. Modeling demonstrates that high dose rates (0.1–1 DPA/per day) can be achieved in bulk material specimens (100–300 μm) with low temperature gradients and induced radioactivity. The capabilities of IEPI are demonstrated through a 12 MeV proton irradiation and tensile test of 250 μm thick tensile specimens of a nickel alloy (Alloy 718), reproducing neutron-induced data. These results demonstrate that IEPI enables high throughput assessment of materials under reactor-relevant conditions, positioning IEPI to accelerate the pace of engineering-scale radiation damage testing and allow for quicker and more effective design of nuclear energy systems .},

  abstract     = {Experimental investigation was conducted to explore the formation conditions and provide new insights into the formation mechanisms of the unexplained intermixing phenomenon observed at the substrate-coatings interface of cold sprayed materials. The results indicate that the formation of intermixing interface significantly depends on the extent of plastic deformation at the coating-substrate interface, with severe deformation creating favorable conditions for the intermixing interface. Two factors have been identified to be critical for inducing the severe interfacial plastic deformation: low deposition efficiency and material properties . During low deposition efficiency cold spraying, most of the accelerated particles rebound after impact while inducing accumulative plastic deformation and thus intermixing at the coating-substrate interface. Considering the material properties, the coating materials must have sufficiently high density to attain enough kinetic energy for creating substantial plastic deformation of the first coating layer and the substrate upon their impact. Also, the substrate materials cannot be too hard so that plastic deformation can be induced. Based on the experimental analyses, the hypothesis of the intermixing interface formation mechanism is proposed in this paper.},

Despite the lack of antibacterial performance, this modification has potential to improve the osseointegration properties of Ti-based implant . To address this limitation, we demonstrated a new concept, showing that partial incorporation of graphene oxide (GO) to porous-PEO Ti-surface can significantly improve its antibacterial performance. Our idea for partial coating compared with a full surface coverage of GO was motivated to create a mixed surface with porous PEO and GO to improve antibacterial ability, while maintaining the osseointegration properties. To achieve these goals, we combined PEO and electrophoretic deposition process (EPD) to deposit GO sheets over the titanium PEO-treated substrate. The SEM, EDS , optical profilometry, XRD and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the growth of unique multi-structured porous PEO structures decorated with GO patches. The bio-mineralization test provided the evidence of hydroxyapatite formation over the PEO-GO surface, indicating its good bioactivity . Finally, PEO-GO samples demonstrated a superior antibacterial rate of ~80\% against E.coli and ~100\% against S. aureus . These results indicate that PEO-GO modified titanium substrates are very promising for the development of advanced biomedical implants.},

  abstract     = {The relationship between material failure and surface roughness has been investigated using two titanium alloys : Ti64 and the more ductile Ti407. Three surface types were created (polished, sandblasted and scratched) with instances spanning a wide range of average roughness. The surfaces were tested in three-point bending with the imparted roughness on the tensile under-surface of a rectangular beam specimen . Results showed failure of Ti64 to be highly sensitive to both magnitude and orientation of roughness. High roughness in the maximum tensile stress direction (and scratch like features perpendicular to this direction) were most detrimental. Thus, strain-to-failure (and work-to-failure) in Ti64 dropped off significantly with increasing surface roughness in the tensile direction . Finite element modelling of the test indicated that cracks initiate at zones of high plastic strain at the tips of roughness valleys due to high local surface curvature. Thus, roughness can be considered as a series of blunt crack-like features where larger crack tip curvature induces greater likelihood of crack propagation . Contrastingly, the mechanical response of Ti407 was insensitive to surface roughness owing to its significantly greater ductility. Thus, designers need to be aware of the sensitivity of failure of particular materials to surface roughness. The insensitivity of Ti407 is advantageous, but the sensitivity of failure to surface roughness in a material like Ti64 is potentially serious if not properly accounted for.},

In this paper, a hybrid lamination model is proposed to describe the forming behavior of woven fabric reinforced thermoplastic composites (WFRTP) during solid-state thermo-stamping process. The woven carbon fiber (CF)/ Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) sheet/prepreg is modelled as laminate structure with woven reinforcement layers (shell elements) embedded in thermoplastic resin layer (solid elements). More specifically, a hypoelastic constitutive model is used to represent the anisotropic mechanical behavior of fabric reinforcement under large deformation , while the fabric model is calibrated and validated by uniaxial bias extension (UBE) test and tensile test of woven fabric. A phenomenological model is adopted to describe the viscoelastic-plastic deformation behavior of thermoplastic resin, while the resin model is calibrated by tensile tests of PEEK. The applicability of the hybrid model is demonstrated through comparing numerical results of UBE tests and Erichsen tests with their corresponding experiment results. The hybrid lamination model provides a theoretical foundation for numerical simulation of WFRTP solid-state thermo-stamping.},

It is shown that the gas-to-metal ratio of volume flow rates (GMR V ) is more relevant than the ratio of mass flow rates (GMR) in order to analyse the effect of atomisation variables on the particle size. Kishidaka&#39;s equation, originally proposed for water atomisation, is modified to predict the median particle size in gas atomisation. The accuracy of the new equation is compared with that of Lubanska, and Rao and Mehrotra. Kishidaka&#39;s modified empirical correlation is the most accurate in predicting the median particle size of the powders produced in this work.

  abstract     = {Light-weight cellular materials with periodic repetitive microstructures are widely used in various fields due to their superior mechanical/multi-physical performances. As the microstructural design problem is known to have multiple local minima, most gradient-based topology optimization methods significantly depend on the initial guess of the microstructural geometry, thus requiring the designer’s experiences. This paper presents an effective gradient-free framework for periodic microstructure design, which exhibits powerful global searching capabilities and requires no sensitivity information. The proposed framework combines the material-field series-expansion (MFSE) topology representation of periodic microstructures and the sequential Kriging-based optimization algorithm. The MFSE method decouples the topological representation from the finite element discretization, and describes a relatively complex microstructural topology with high-quality boundary description using a greatly reduced number of design variables. Based on the Kriging surrogate model , a solution scheme is suggested to solve material microstructural topology optimization successively in a sequence of sub-optimization problems with self-adaptive design spaces. With the present gradient-free optimization method, high-performance cellular materials that approach the H-S upper bound with porosities from 0.2 to 0.6, or that achieve negative Poisson’s ratios of -0.94 in the principal directions for materials with square symmetry, are obtained without prior knowledge of the optimum microstructural topology.},

In copper/aluminum (Cu/Al) joints, additional defects (such as partially-bonded interfaces, porosity and cracks) lead to further weakened strength and lowered electrical conductivity . In this study, nickel‑phosphorus (Ni-P) coatings are deposited on Al to address these issues. With the aid of Ni-P coatings, the detrimental Cu-Al IMC is eliminated, a donut-shaped weld with a partially-bonded interface is evolved into an hourglass-shaped weld with a fully-bonded interface, while the porosity and cracks are inhibited. Numerical simulations indicate that, during the welding without Ni-P coating, the Al oxide aggravates the inhomogeneity of heat generation at the Cu/Al interface, promoting the formation of donut-shaped weld and defects. Microstructural characterization suggests that the Ni-P coatings obstruct the Cu-Al interdiffusion which results in CuAl 2 -free interfaces, while the amorphous Ni-P convert into eutectic microstructure composed of nanocrystalline Ni and fine Ni 3 P grains through a solid-state transformation. Using the Ni-P coatings, joints gain an improvement of 140\% in lap-shear peak load and a 25-fold increase in lap-shear maximum elongation, as well as an 84\% reduction in electrical resistance.},

  abstract     = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes enable the reduction of manufacturing time, material waste, and allows for the creation of complex structures. However, anisotropic mechanical behaviour is frequently observed in additively manufactured parts, and it is directly linked to the component&#39;s grain structure characteristics, which itself is dependent on the process parameters. The formation of grain structure in 316 L stainless steel fusion lines is investigated in this paper, combining experimental results and numerical simulations. Experimentally, fusion lines are built on a 316 L substrate, using an instrumented LPBF process. The high-speed camera recordings combined with the characterization of the samples enables capturing of melt-pool sizes and grain characteristics. The numerical modelling is based on a three-dimensional “CAFE” model, coupling Cellular Automata and Finite Element models to predict grain formation. The thermal model is defined and calibrated using the experiments. The experimental and numerical grain characteristics are compared. Numerical results are discussed with regards to the growth models and the process parameters. The growth model defined here is compared to existing models and is well fitted to capture grain formation in single-track configurations. Finally, the average grain size and aspect ratio of the grains increase with an increase of the process&#39; linear energy.},

  abstract     = {The main drawback of laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), commonly called selective laser melting (SLM) is the high porosity which may lead to an early failure of the parts. To minimize it, the L-PBF parameters need to be optimized focusing on the laser power, scanning speed and hatching space. However, no standard guideline exists. In this study, an efficient and cost-effective methodology is developed and validated on AlSi12. This innovative methodology brings together single scan tracks (SST), macroscopic properties analysis and design of experiments (DOE). It requires three batches of SST, cubes and tensile samples. The DOE significantly decreases the manufacturing and characterization costs. 9 SST are sufficient to identify a process window that is 85\% similar to the one obtained from a full factorial design with 105 SST. This process window reliably leads to high densities and better mechanical properties in comparison to the state-of-the-art properties reported in the literature for L-PBF AlSi12. In conclusion, a methodology using only 9 SST, 18 cubes and 12 tensile tests has been validated on AlSi12. It is further envisioned to optimize the L-PBF parameters of any existing or new alloy leading potentially towards better mechanical properties than the state-of-the-art in the literature.},

Taking into account the strongly different time scales of laser motion, thermal diffusion and viscous flow , normalized master curves for the transient melt pool temperature and the surface temperature are presented. Infrared camera measurements of the surface temperature confirm the validity of the theoretical framework. Based on these master curves a novel ratio of laser energy input and energy required to melt the polymer – the attenuation melt ratio (AMR) – is introduced, which puts material properties and process parameters into relation. Based on the AMR, normalized process diagrams, which relate depth and temperature of the melt pool to the laser energy input, are constructed. The process diagrams include process windows for optimal part properties. The predictive quality of the process windows is confirmed by the assessment of mechanical properties of laser sintered parts made of different polymers.},

  abstract     = {The precision control of thermal expansion is of fundamental interest and desirable for applications that require materials to retain their shape at different temperatures. In the present study, we propose that the thermal expansion coefficient can be tuned by uniaxial external stress for a single material embedded with nanoclusters , if the formation, growth or alignment of the nanoclusters depends on the external stress. We demonstrate the idea in a prototype alloy (Ti 50 (Pd 40 Cr 10 )) located at the compositional crossover region between martensite and strain glass in the temperature-composition phase diagram of Ti 50 (Pd 50− x Cr x ). Its thermal expansion coefficient varies linearly from positive, through zero to negative values with increasing uniaxial tensile stress within 200 K ~ 300 K. The phase field simulations show that the volume fraction of nanoscale martensite variant favored by the external stress increases with stress, producing extra strain and compensating for the contraction of the austenite matrix on cooling. The degree of compensation leads to different thermal expansion coefficients. Such a tunable thermal expansion behavior occurs only in the crossover compositions between martensite and strain glass, providing a design recipe for searching new systems with similar behavior.},

In the present study, a microstructural analysis was completed by transmission electron microscopy of Gd 2 Ti 2 O 7 thin films exposed to different synthesis conditions to determine these conditions&#39; effects on the resultant morphology. The Gd 2 Ti 2 O 7 thin films were prepared by a sputter-deposition technique using Ar and O 2 mixed process gas. The film structure was found to be sensitive to process gas pressure and substrate temperature during sputtering based on two different choices in process gas pressures and four different choices in substrate temperatures. Amorphous Gd 2 Ti 2 O 7 thin films with a unique, dyadic void network were synthesized at substrate temperatures at and below 600 °C and relatively low process gas pressures of 2.7 Pa. Single crystal Gd 2 Ti 2 O 7 thin films were synthesized at 800 °C and 4 Pa. While the temperature-dependent film morphology that was observed has been seen in a number of other systems, this is the first report generalizing this behavior to complex oxides.

However, little is known about mechanistic formation of fat-based in situ forming matrices. In this study, VCM-loaded fatty acid (C 8 –C 16 )-based in situ forming matrices and their computational model were investigated. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at various conditions confirmed the steps of the fatty acid-based in situ formation process and the movement/location of VCM. The MD simulation, topography of dried matrix and model fitting of VCM release profile indicated the movement of VCM through a complex/non-complex interior matrix structure of fatty acids where the low-molecular-weight fatty acid showed a more tangled passage than the high-molecular-weight fatty acid. The release pattern/mechanism were influenced by the aliphatic chain length and the environmental temperature. A sustained drug release was attained in the C 12 -C 14 fatty acid-based system. However, the temperature affected the C 12 fatty acid-based structure in which the invert in situ formation process was revealed, and its ability to sustain drug release subsequently diminished. Hence, the mechanistic formation of VCM-loaded fatty acid-based in situ forming matrix and drug release were revealed for further development of in situ forming systems based on fatty acid.},

We also investigated the regulatory effect of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). SMCs displayed higher survivability and proliferation after treatment with TGF-β1 than untreated controls at 1 week after inoculation. SMCs in the SF scaffolds exhibited efficient synthesis of ECM-related proteins. All three proteins were deposited in scaffolds, and this was promoted by treatment with TGF-β1. Incipient expression of collagen-III was lower than that of elastin and collagen-I, but it was increased significantly at 2 weeks. The phenotype of SMCs in SF scaffolds changed from a synthetic phenotype to a contraction phenotype after inoculation for 2 weeks. However, treatment with TGF-β1 slowed down this phenotypic transformation, and enhanced the ECM protein synthesis ability. This method could potentially be used for a wide range of polymers where specific architectures and microenvironments are required.},

  abstract     = {Modern lubricants require additives for improving their frictional and wear performance. The most effective and widely used additives rely on organo-metallic compounds, which lead to ash formation and pose serious environmental concerns. Despite intensive research, a cost-effective alternative cannot be foreseen in the immediate future. On the quest for an alternative concept, the reactive formation and self-assembly of few-layer MoS 2 nanoflakes in a carbon-based tribofilm is studied during reciprocating sliding contact of molybdenum substrates lubricated with oils containing sulfurized olefin extreme-pressure (EP) additive. Based on a combination of Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy it can be concluded that nanoflakes of well-adherent 002-oriented MoS 2 layers form in the presence of S-containing EP additive. This leads to a reduction in friction from 0.3 to 0.08. The reaction rate to form MoS 2 nanoflakes increases with temperature and EP concentration. At temperatures over 100 °C, the MoS 2 nanoflakes are accompanied by carbon-based tribofilms. These carbon-based tribofilms are catalytically formed by dissociating hydrocarbon molecules of the lubricant. These results suggest that applying Mo alloyed materials with sulfur containing lubricants provides an alternative to conventional organo-metallic compounds. The presented lubrication concept can be utilized for further developments of materials (like protective hard coatings) and machine designs .},

DAP-4 was synthesized by a molecular assembly strategy. G-C 3 N 4 and M-g-C 3 N 4 composite samples were prepared by pyrolytic and co-sintering methods. X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersion X-ray spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the morphology, structure, element distribution, and element chemical states of the catalysts. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to elevate the thermal catalytic decomposition effect of g-C 3 N 4 and M-g-C 3 N 4 on DAP-4. The results showed that g-C 3 N 4 and M-g-C 3 N 4 have catalytic activity for the thermal decomposition of DAP-4.

A series of common GPB zones and a novel type of GPB zone named “GPBX” were observed in the cold-worked samples aged at 443 K for 20 min. In the subsequent aging, two types of S phases were found to coexist, labeled S-I and S-II phases. Density functional theory calculation results indicate that GPBX zone is stable and the S-I and S-II phases have almost the same formation enthalpy. Common GPB zones transform to S-I phases, while S-II phases are formed from GPBX zones preferentially along dislocation lines . The misorientation angles and morphologies of the S phases are also discussed.

Here, the deformation behaviour of the two-phase TiAl+Ti 3 Al nano-polycrystalline alloys is investigated at different temperatures by molecular dynamic simulation. For a comprehensive understanding of the processes, mechanical properties of the single-phase TiAl and Ti 3 Al nano-polycrystalline alloys are explored as well. The results of numerical simulations indicate that temperature has a strong influence on the deformation mechanism of the alloys. When temperature is below 800 K, the critical grain size (~8.3 nm) becomes a dominant factor controlling the deformation process in the single-phase TiAl. In the two-phase TiAl+Ti 3 Al nano-polycrystalline alloys, the motion of dislocations in the TiAl phase with the grain size smaller than the critical size dominates the deformation process. On the other hand, no obvious phenomena linked with the critical size occur in the Ti 3 Al phase. Once the strain exceeds 18.0\%, the dislocation emission is observed in the Ti 3 Al grains. At high temperatures (≥800 K), in the two-phase nano-polycrystalline alloy, the deformation mechanism changes from the plastic deformation to the boundary slip and recrystallization.},

  abstract     = {Thermoplastic nanocomposites were fabricated in order to deliver a suitable material for thermal management devices, commonly processed by injection molding or 3D printing . Scalable manufacturing of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) and multi-functional polymers with good thermal conductivity and ease of handling was demonstrated in the present study. The standard grade polyethylene reinforced with CNTs, was formed by melt mixing. Polyethylene glycol was used for concentrating CNTs in a masterbatch for its plasticizing properties, ensuring safe handling and even dispersion of CNTs. Through characterization of morphology and thermal properties, an interconnected CNTs network was established, which enhanced the heat transfer at high concentration by changing the main conduction path from polymer crystal lattice to CNTs conductive network. Moreover, it was shown that modification in the matrix crystallinity is key to maximize the phonon and electron conduction interfaces and achieve advances in thermal conductivity beyond 68\% and 100\% achieved for 15 wt\% content of CNTs compared to neat PE and PE@PEG matrices, respectively, within this study.},

  abstract     = {Crystalline bio-based composites exhibit discontinuous feeding and warpage of printed parts in traditional filament printing. Therefore, an additive manufacturing (AM) system based on micro-screw extrusion was designed, and wood flour/polyhydroxyalkanoates (WF/PHA) composites without additives were manufactured. The differential scanning calorimetry test showed that the crystallization temperature and melting temperature of the WF/PHA composites increased by 35.7 °C and 46.1 °C, respectively. The evaluation of the extrusion stability of the micro-screw extrusion system showed that the micro-screw speed had a greater influence on extrusion output than the printing temperature. The forming process under pressure and the WF/PHA blend prevented the warpage of printed samples. The tensile and flexural strengths of the WF/PHA composites reached 38.7 MPa and 77.3 MPa, respectively, and the modulus of the WF/PHA composites significantly improved with the increase in WF content. The rheological, thermal, and mechanical properties of the printed samples were used to determine the reason for the decrease in warpage. Finally, the test printing of thin and large-area sheets provides the conditions for the application of AM in fully bio-based composites.},

  abstract     = {The microstructure of grain boundaries (GBs) in the commercial NdFeB-based alloy for permanent magnets has been studied. It is generally accepted that the unique hard magnetic properties of such alloys are controlled by the thin layers of a Nd-rich phase in Nd 2 Fe 14 B/Nd 2 Fe 14 B GBs. These GB layers ensure the magnetic isolation of Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains from each other. It is usually supposed that such GB layers contain metallic Nd or Nd-rich intermetallic compounds. However, the commercial NdFeB-based permanent magnets frequently contain a tangible amount of neodymium oxide Nd 2 O 3 at the triple junctions between Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains. The goal of this work was to check whether the Nd 2 Fe 14 B/Nd 2 Fe 14 B GBs could also contain the thin layers of Nd 2 O 3 oxide phase. Indeed, the screening with EELS-based elemental analysis permitted to observe that some of these Nd-rich layers in Nd 2 Fe 14 B/Nd 2 Fe 14 B GBs contain not only neodymium, but also oxygen. More detailed analysis of such GBs with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR TEM) showed these GB layers are crystalline and have the lattice of neodymium oxide Nd 2 O 3 . In turn, the Lorentz micro-magnetic contrast in TEM permitted to observe that the Nd-oxide GB layers prevent the migration of domain walls from one Nd 2 Fe 14 B grain to another during remagnetization. This finding proves that the GB oxide layers , similar to those of metallic Nd or Nd-rich intermetallic compounds, can ensure the magnetic isolation between Nd 2 Fe 14 B grains needed for high coercivity . Therefore, the GB oxide layers can be used for further development of NdFeB-based permanent magnets.},

The development and formation of shear band need to be clarified, and versatile approaches to suppress the shear band are required. In this study, we explored the formation mechanism of shear band using a representative Al–12Si alloy lattice structure, consisting of a simple body-centered cubic (BCC) unit cell manufactured by laser powder bed fusion. The X-ray computed tomography observations of an interruptedly compressed lattice specimen and finite element analyses revealed that the crack initiations in the bent struts under the localized tensile stress trigger the formation of shear band. Accordingly, an attempt was made to fabricate various lattice structures consisting of BCC unit cells with different strut diameter ratios to suppress shear band formation. Finite element analyses revealed relaxed tensile stress inside the struts with the controlled diameter ratios, suggesting the suppressed formation of shear bands; this was demonstrated by compression tests. The present results provide new insights for achieving a stable compressive deformation and high energy absorption capacity of lattice structures.},

In this study, PVDF-TrFE coatings were in-situ fabricated and directly functionalized on structural surfaces in the consecutive processing steps as spray, thermal annealing, and corona poling. The processing conditions, including annealing temperature/time and poling voltage/duration, were correlated with their crystallinity , ferroelectric phase, morphology, polarization, and final piezoelectricity , through a systematic study. With the help of various characterization methods, the conditions of optimal functional performance were identified and rationalized. To study the feasibility of thus-prepared functional coatings in transducing guided waves, the host structures with sensors made of such coatings were interrogated by passive acoustic emission and active ultrasonic transmission to validate the sensing and actuation capability, respectively. The developed piezopolymer coatings possess excellent performance as a novel configuration of sensing networks, with lightweight, ultrathin, flexible, rapid-prototyping and adhesive-free features, manifesting high adaptability, high consistency, negligible inter-path interference, and minimal extra penalty for a robust SHM system.},

  abstract     = {Acoustic metasurfaces can reshape a reflected wavefront rather arbitrarily, despite being much thinner than the wavelength, thus allowing on-demand wavefront modulation in a variety of applications. Recent passive metasurfaces, however, have suffered from bandwidth limitations, thus restricting their range of operation. In this work, we propose the systematic design of ultra-broadband passive metasurfaces by combining the broadband local reflection rule with an optimization method. The validation of the technique is demonstrated by fabrication and measurement of an ultra-broadband carpet cloak. Numerical and experimental results show that the relative bandwidth of the optimized carpet cloak, thinner than one fifth of the maximum wavelength, can exceed 93.33\%, a value that is much larger than that of previous passive metasurfaces. Furthermore, multi-frequency pulse incidence tests reveal the excellent time-domain broadband characteristics of the metasurface over a wide range of angles of incidence. The proposed strategy opens a new route for the design of advanced passive metasurfaces for ultra-broadband wave manipulation and thus promotes practical applications of broadband acoustical devices.},

Compared with PEEK, FPK with submicro structure exhibited elevated surface property (roughness, hydrophilicity, surface energy and protein absorption). Moreover, FPKH with micro-submicro structure and -OH group further enhanced the surface property. In addition, compared with PEEK, FPK significantly activated the response (adhesion, proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity and expressions of osteogenic genes) of rat bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) in vitro. Furthermore, compared with FPK, FPKH further enhanced the cellular response, which were the synergistic effects of micro-submicro structure and -OH group. In short, combination of femtosecond laser and hydroxylation treatment created micro-submicro structure and grafted functional group of -OH on PEEK with elevated surface property, which played key roles in activating cellular response.

The methodology presented permits the generation of unit cells with different degrees of curvature based on the location of the Bézier control points along a spiral. The apparent stiffness of these structures was characterized using finite element analysis and compression tests on additively manufactured samples using stereolithography . The mechanical properties of spiral based cubic Bézier metamaterials were related to the location of the control points, curvature, etc. It was found that the apparent stiffness decreases proportionally to the cubic root of the distance between the control point and the predefined origin of the coordinate system. Due to symmetry conditions, the slope continuity in the curves conforming the unit cells is fulfilled and the origin of the coordinate system used coincides with the center of the unit cells. The procedure presented for the synthesis of metamaterials enables the generation of structures with customized mechanical properties by adjusting the geometry of the unit cells.},

It departs from specific austenization requirements in terms of a desired size for the austenized region at any cross section of the treated sample, aiming at calculating suitable process parameters to obtain it. This approach contrasts with conventional direct procedures, from process parameters to thermal cycles and austenite distribution, where stochastic design strategies, falling on the dynamics of successive approximations , are performed. A thermo-metallurgical numerical model is used to determine the irradiance distribution capable of meeting the prescribed austenization requirements. This theoretical irradiance distribution is implemented by means of an adaptative high-frequency scanning of the treated surface. The minimum scanning frequency to guarantee the equivalence between the pursued theoretical irradiance distribution and the scanning is established attending to the evolution of temperature and its influence on the austenization rate by means of Avrami Law. A value of 100 Hz grants a continuous heating of the material. Considering this threshold, equations to calculate the parameters of the scanning to achieve the desired irradiance distribution are built. These equations are used to approach a design case where real hardened cross sections are achieved, confirming the utility of the proposed systematic methodology .},

  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce the Deformation Infrared Calorimetry (DIRC) technique for resolving spatial distributions of heat and work in samples subjected to uniaxial loading under isothermal conditions . Heat and work distributions are computed from synchronized temperature and strain fields obtained by infrared thermography (IRT) and digital image correlation (DIC). The DIRC data acquisition and processing are described in the first part of the article. Then, we show the relevance and usage of DIRC by employing it to characterize the cyclic evolution of the thermomechanical response of a superelastic NiTi wire termed functional fatigue. Particularly, we evaluated the evolution of the heat, work, and internal energy changes upon the repeated propagation of stress-induced martensitic transformations (SIMTs) shear-bands, producing a highly heterogeneous deformation scenario. Further postprocessing of DIRC allowed us to associate the functional fatigue of the material with the evolution of the production/recovery of martensite and the energy storage and dissipation during the propagation of SIMT shear-bands.},

  abstract     = {Primary creep regeneration (PCR) is a phenomenon observed during stress-varying/cyclic creep loading conditions where a load reversal might clear the previous strain hardening memory and cause the regeneration of the primary creep regime ( i.e. a period of high creep strain rate) upon reloading. In this study, in-situ and ex-situ microstructural examinations, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), neutron and synchrotron X-ray diffraction were conducted to better understand the responsible mechanisms of PCR for a 10\%Cr martensitic steel at 600 °C. Our experimental evidence indicated that the PCR phenomenon is related to the change of dislocation density due to activation of dislocation generation and recovery mechanisms, formation and relaxation of dislocation pile-ups, as well as bowing/unbowing of dislocation-lines during stress-varying creep loading conditions. These mechanisms could explain the observed creep strain accumulation in the steel during the examined stress-varying creep loading conditions reported in the current and previous studies. The presented mechanistic description of the PCR phenomenon and the reported experimental observations for the microstructural and mechanical parameters can provide a basis for the formulation of physically-based models to describe the creep behaviour of the steel under high-temperature stress-varying creep loading conditions.},

Initially, all tested specimens were permeated by hydrogen atoms through an electrochemical hydrogen charging scheme. Then, the comparisons between different currents and charging time were performed. The influence of different storage time was compared as well. Additionally, the effect of the plastic strain introduced by pre-stretching was also investigated. The experimental results showed that the negative impact of hydrogen embrittlement was altered from reversible to irreversible as the magnitude of the charging current increased. The hydrogen blistering and the hydrogen charging-induced cracks were both observed and inspected in the tested samples regarding the irreversible situation. Moreover, the adverse influence of hydrogen embrittlement was enhanced by plastic pre-straining or extending the charging period. At the micro-level, hydrogen charging-induced cracks generally were generated at defect locations, such as the prior austenite grain boundaries and lath martensite interfaces. Particularly, crack direction occurred perpendicular to the orientation of lath martensite, and transgranular fracture occurred at the prior austenite grains.},

Room-temperature high-energy ball milling is exploited for the mechanical activation of elemental powder mixtures, which, along with adjusted input stoichiometry and heat treatment, achieves high-purity and highly crystalline Ti 3 AlC 2 and Ti 3 C 2 with rather quick and easy methodology. Several approaches are offered, as not all of these preparation steps are strictly necessary for acquiring MXene. The structure and properties of Ti 3 C 2 are shown to depend on the preparation history and precursor characteristics. The MXene is additionally shown to perform well as a substrate for binder-free electrochemical cell electrodes; high electrical conductivity and cycling stability render this MXene@Zn anode a viable option for aqueous Zn-ion systems.},

  abstract     = {Thermal responsive polymers were introduced for effectively cell detachment from the extracellular matrix (ECM), where the poor cell adhesive capacity was improved by the immobilized biodhesion molecules (most are proteins) at the termini of grafted polymer. However, this protein-mediated adhesion makes it hard to be precisely controlled and takes longer time to start initial cell attachment. Here we describe a choline phosphate(CP) modified thermal responsive surface with enhanced initial cell adhesion based on multivalent CP-PC (phosphatidyl choline, the head-group of phospholipids in all the eukaryotic cell membranes) interaction. The well-defined functional surfaces were constructed using surface-initiated ATRP and click reaction, where the initial cell attachment reach saturation in 10 min and can be regulated by CP density on the surface. Consequently, the fast cell adhesion significantly accelerates cell spreading and proliferation. The facile cell harvest, as opposed to the original mechanism of thermally-induced cell detachment, is to take advantage of the thermal contraction of the polymer above the LCST, which release the adherent cell by reducing the accessibility of the CP groups to cell membrane PC lipids. Si-CP is expected to provide a promising universal structural model for modulating cell attachment and detachment in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine field.},

Under low voltage (3–24 V ), solution concentration (≤5.0 wt\%), and neutral, alkaline conditions, silk fibroin fibrous electrogels were easily formed.

Moreover, the recovery rate of electrogels can reach more than 50\% after 10 compression-recovery circles, exhibiting excellent flexibility.

  abstract     = {Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) are high-strength, highly elastic materials due to their disordered atomic structure. Because BMGs require sufficiently high cooling rates to bypass crystallization, laser-based additive manufacturing (AM) methods have recently been employed for the fabrication of BMGs. In this study, we present an optimized Laser Powder-Bed Fusion (LPBF) process on a Zr-based BMG (Zr 59.3 Cu 28.8 Al 10.4 Nb 1.5 , in at.\%), with a focus on characterization, mechanical properties , and dimensional accuracy. A volumetric density of 99.82\% was achieved. Although the sample was qualified as amorphous via laboratory X-ray diffraction experiments, a more meticulous study using synchrotron radiation revealed nanocrystals in the heat-affected zones (HAZs) of the melt pool. Fast differential scanning calorimetry (FDSC) and numerical simulations were then employed to illustrate the mechanism of crystallization. The LPBF-processed alloy revealed excellent mechanical properties, such as high hardness, wear resistance, compressive strength , and flexural strength . Apart from vein-like patterns, the fracture surfaces of the compression test samples showed liquid-like features, which indicate a significant local temperature increase during fracture. The dimensional accuracy was assessed with a benchmark exhibiting complex geometrical features and reached at least 40 μm. The results indicate that LPBF processing is a promising route for the manufacturing of BMGs for various applications.},

Graphene oxide (GO) is an effective reinforcement, whereas silicon-doped hydroxyapatite (Si-HA) possesses excellent bioactivity, but either GO or Si-HA tends to aggregate in PLLA matrix. In this study, a GO@Si-HA nanosystem was achieved by in-situ growth of Si-HA on GO, and then incorporated into PLLA scaffold fabricated by laser sintering technology. On one hand, Si-HA on the surface of GO effectively prevented the aggregation of GO by acting as a barrier between GO nanosheets . On the other hand, GO hindered the aggregation of Si-HA by means of anchoring Si-HA. Results displayed that the compressive strength and modulus of the PLLA/GO@Si-HA composite scaffold were enhanced by 85\% and 120\%, respectively. Meanwhile, the scaffold exhibited significantly improved bioactivity, and consequently promoted cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation.

In many concentrated fcc alloys, the SFEs determined from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental methods are found having opposite signs. Here, we show that the negative SFE by DFT reflects the thermodynamic instability of the fcc phase relative to the hexagonal close-packed one; while the experimentally determined SFEs are restricted to be positive by the models behind the indirect measurements. We argue that the common models underlying the experimental measurements of SFE fail in metastable alloys. In various concentrated solid solutions, we demonstrate that the SFEs obtained by DFT calculations correlate well with the primary deformation mechanisms observed experimentally, showing a better resolution than the experimentally measured SFEs. Furthermore, we believe that the negative SFE is important for understanding the abnormal behaviors of partial dislocations in metastable alloys under deformation.

  abstract     = {Dielectric particles are often added to ink formulations to tailor the macro level permittivity of printed dielectric substrates and coatings. In these inks, the combined role of particle morphology , discrete spatial arrangement and material properties on variance is difficult to distinguish experimentally and hence poorly understood. This is primarily due to the large parameter space of processing variables as well as electrical sensitivity to local heterogeneities. We address this challenge by combining a finite element capacitor model with a neural network biased genetic algorithm (NBGA) to optimize the volume fraction, particle size, and permittivity distributions of dielectric particles to identify systems with high capacitance variance. Analysis of the database generated from the optimization process provided insights on effect of polydisperse particles on variance of the system. Design rules/strategies were also identified for achieving target variance. Unsupervised machine learning techniques were applied to the NBGA-created database to extract correlations between the spatial/material distributions of the dielectric particles and the capacitance variance. Collectively, this study provides a useful framework to correlate electrical performance with both macro- and microstructural variation sources, which is key to accelerating the development of 3-D printing materials.},

Alloying of the materials with various elements is considered as prospective approach to enhance material properties . This work reports on the preparation and characterization of pure Ge-Sb-Te-O (GSTO) and alloyed with La-Sr-Mn-O (LSMO) thin films . Thermal heating of amorphous thin films to different temperatures show distinct crystallization behavior. A general trend is the decrease in the size of GSTO crystallites and the suppression in the formation of stable trigonal GSTO phase with increasing content of LSMO. Microstructural studies by transmission electron microscopy show the formation of metastable GSTO nanocrystallites dispersed in the amorphous matrix. Analysis of local chemical bonding by X-ray spectroscopy reveal the presence of different oxides in the GSTO-LSMO composites. Moreover, the composites with a high LSMO content exhibit higher crystallization temperature and significant larger sheet resistance in amorphous and crystalline phase, while a memory device made of GSTO-LSMO alloy reveals bipolar switching and synaptic behavior. In addition, the amount of LSMO in GSTO-LSMO thin films influences their optical properties and band gap. Overall, the results of this work reveal the highly promising potential of GSTO-LSMO nanocomposites for data storage and reconfigurable photonic applications as well as neuro-inspired computing.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical analog to the topological insulators brings anomalous elastic wave properties which diversifies classic wave functions for potential broad applications. To obtain topological mechanical wave states with good quality at desired frequency ranges, it needs repetitive trials of different geometric parameters with traditional forward designs. In this work, we develop an inverse design of topological edge states for flexural wave using machine learning method which is promising for instantaneous design. Nonlinear mapping function from input targets to output desired parameters are adopted in artificial neural networks where the data sets for training are generated by the plane wave expansion method. Topological edge states are then realized and compared for different bandgap width conditions with such inverse designs, proving that wide bandgap can promote the confinement of the topological edge states. Finally, direction selective propagations with sharp turns are further demonstrated as anomalous wave behaviors. The machine learning inverse design of topological states for flexural wave provides an efficient way to design practical devices with targeted needs for potential applications such as signal processing, sensing and energy harvesting .},

The results indicate that the difference of initial microstructures had no evident influence on the precipitation behavior of the Mg-RE alloy. Static recrystallization took place in the alloy with low-temperature extrusion of 300 °C during aging treatment at 200 °C due to relatively higher dislocation density in the deformed grains, which offset the reduction of elongation caused by aging treatment and resulted in the good combination of strength and ductility. In the high-strength Mg-RE alloy, grain boundary strengthening, solid solution strengthening, and precipitation strengthening are the main strengthening mechanisms. As shearable β’ particles by basal slip existed in the Mg matrix, precipitate shear strengthening other than Orawan bypassing strengthening should be utilized in predicting the precipitating strengthening behavior of Mg-RE alloy.},

Using atomic resolution STEM, we investigated the effect of a 3 T magnetic field on the spinodal decomposition, as well as microstructure and hardness in step-aged Fe27wt.\%Cr15wt.\%Co samples. Spinodal decomposition resulted in a homogeneous α phase transforming into an Fe-Co rich α 1 phase and a Cr rich α 2 phase. Although α 1 and α 2 showed distinct contrast at low magnification Z -contrast images, close examination at atomic scale of the samples showed no sharp α 1 /α 2 interfaces. Inside each phase, composition fluctuations occurred. A 3 T external magnetic field during step aging increased the size of the α 1 phase and introduced microstructural anisotropy, which is desired for permanent magnet applications, In addition, the spinodal decomposition increased the hardness. Annealing in a 3 T magnetic field decreased the hardness but increased the ductility, which is desirable for manufacturing permanent magnets. The change in hardness values is attributed to the composition fluctuations of Fe, Cr and Co, and we further discuss the mechanisms for composition fluctuations and hardness.},

Several spherical metal powders were fabricated successfully by using the high-temperature remelting spheroidization (HRS) technology. Among these powders, thorough research on copper powder spheroidization was conducted. The influence of feed rate and temperature on the properties of as-prepared HRS copper powder was investigated. The particle morphology , particle size distribution , oxygen content, bulk density, fluidity and spheroidization rate of copper powder were characterized. The results showed some unique advantages of the HRS technology in the preparation of spherical metal powders. When the temperature was 1623 K, the particles of HRS copper powder were perfect spheres with smooth surfaces and fully dense with no pores inside. The HRS technology can effectively avoid the defects in conventional methods such as satellite particle and hollow particle. The spheroidization rate of HRS copper powder was nearly 100\%. The fluidity of HRS copper powder was 11.4 s/50 g, significantly increased compared to the 56.1 s/50 g of the raw powder. Regarding the settling process and heat exchange behavior of metal particles, we developed the HRS process analytical model.

In order to effectively solve these problems, a novel method of hot-wire arc additive manufacturing is used to fabricate aluminum alloy. Systematic studies are carried out to investigate the formation mechanism of the pores, the macro/microstructures, as well as the mechanical properties of the parts. It is found that the pores were mainly clustered at the inter-layer. With the increase of the hot-wire current, the porosity firstly decreases, then reaches a minimum at 100 A, and afterwards increases progressively. The corresponding density changes from 96.8\% at the hot-wire current of 0 A to 99.6\% at 100 A. Increasing the current from 0 A to 120 A also leads to the increase of the deposition rate by about 3.5 times, and the gradual increase of the size of equiaxed grain by 1.6 times. The mechanical properties are considerably improved with the decrease of the porosity.},

Based on the considerably higher thermal stability of Aramid and PBO fibers in comparison to UHMWPE, the effect of elevated temperatures on the tensile behavior of SHCC made with Aramid and PBO was expected to be less pronounced. Nevertheless, the SHCC made with UHMWPE fiber yielded a significantly superior multiple cracking and pre-peak ductility up to 150 °C both during and after thermal exposure . At 105 °C, the SHCC reinforced with UHMWPE fiber yielded only a small reduction in tensile strength and a considerable increase in strain capacity. The composites made with Aramid and PBO fibers yielded a pronounced degradation in tensile strength and strain capacity already at 105 °C and a considerably weaker recovery of ductility when cooled down to the room temperature. At 200 °C all composites except those containing Aramid fiber exhibited no multiple cracking and brittle failure with dramatically reduced tensile strength .},

Such information can instead be achieved via bioelution testing under simulated physiological conditions. The use of bioelution data instead of bulk contents would hence refine the current hazard classification of alloys and enable grouping. Bioelution data have been generated for nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) released from several stainless steel grades, one low-alloyed steel, and Ni and Co metals in synthetic sweat, saliva and gastric fluid, for exposure periods from 2 to 168 h. All stainless steel grades with bulk contents of 0.11–10 wt\% Ni and 0.019–0.24 wt\% Co released lower amounts of Ni (up to 400-fold) and Co (up to 300-fold) than did the low-alloyed steel (bulk content: 0.034\% Ni, 0.015\% Co). They further showed a relative bioaccessibility of Ni and Co considerably less than 1, while the opposite was the case for the low-alloyed steel. Surface oxide- and electrochemical corrosion investigations explained these findings in terms of the high passivity of the stainless steels related to the Cr(III)-rich surface oxide that readily adapted to the fluid acidity and chemistry.},

Nanotechnology allowed development of effective erosion resistant coatings by reducing the grain size of coatings to ≤ 10 nm. As a further development to it, here the porous metal layers, sandwiched between blocks of Ti/TiN multilayers to develop the next generation SPE resistant coatings. Two different ultra-thin Ti/TiN (bi-layer ~7.5 nm, 373 bilayers) multi-layered coatings (each ~9 μm) with dense (Ti/TIN-D) and porous (Ti/TIN-P) Ti layers (320 nm) were deposited on Ti6Al4V substrates using magnetron sputtering system. The erosion tests were conducted with respect to erodent speed (30 to 100 m/s), angle (30 to 90°), and temperature (25 to 700 °C). The average erosion resistance performance of Ti/TIN-P coating is 44 times better than Ti6Al4V substrate and 3.3 times better than Ti/TIN-D coating for 100 m/s erodent speed. Finite element simulations were used to understand the superior performance of Ti/TIN-P over Ti/TIN-D coating for different speeds (20 to 100 m/s). The simulation results are in agreement with the experimental results.},

However, an efficient method to design and fabricate programmable 3D shape-shifting structures from 2D polymer films still lacks. In this work, we design programmable shape-shifting 3D structures via the release of internal gradient stress using the frontal photopolymerization (FPP) method. First, the relation between the non-uniformly distributed material and loading parameters, and the geometric and fabrication parameters are established theoretically. The finite element (FE) model is then developed based on the theoretically obtained material and loading parameters. Next, the elastic instability in the shape-shifting behaviors of a cured film is captured through an elastic energy minimization. Furthermore, by using grayscale light patterns, it is shown that we can selectively manipulate the geometric and fabrication parameters to improve the design freedom of various complex 3D structures.},

To achieve this, SiC particle skeletons with continuous micro-channels (SSCC) were integrated with AgCu filler as an interlayer. The effects of SSCC porosity and brazing temperature on joint microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated. In particular, the braze/ZS and braze/SSCC interfaces were analyzed through X-ray diffractometry (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS). The residual stress was also evaluated. The results indicate that increasing the brazing temperate improved the infiltration into the SSCC and promoted the SSCC/braze interface reaction (was detrimental to the SiC particle skeleton). Reducing the SSCC porosity changed the thicknesses of the two L-DSs and enhanced the inhomogeneity of the SSCC/braze interface reaction (induced a shear stress in L-C-SiC). For brazing with an interlayer of 30\% porosity at 820 °C, the joint shear strength reached a maximum of ~41.2 MPa, mainly due to the construction of the multi-layered joint architecture.},

  abstract     = {Fabrication of fully dense and highly conductive copper alloy parts via laser-based additive manufacturing (L-AM) is challenging due to the high optical reflectivity of copper at λ = 1060 – 1080 nm and high thermal conductivity . To overcome this, the use of optically absorptive surface-modified copper powders is being evaluated in the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. Although the surface-modified powders exhibit high optical absorption at room temperature, not all of them allow the fabrication of fully dense parts at a laser power below 500 W. Accordingly, this article proposes the use of optically absorptive carburized CuCr1 powder for the consistent fabrication of copper parts. Moreover, a densification mechanism of parts is discussed to explain the distinct LPBF processing behavior of different surface-modified powders, such as carburized CuCr1 and carbon mixed CuCr1 powders, albeit having similar room temperature optical absorption. This investigation clearly outlines the advantage of a firmly bonded modified layer present on the surface of the carburized CuCr1 powder over a loosely attached carbon nanoparticle layer present in the carbon-mixed CuCr1 powder. Apart from the successful fabrication of CuCr1 parts, fabricated parts are subjected to two different post-heat treatments, and it is shown that the final properties can be customized by applying tailored post-heat treatments.},

Machine learning-driven optimization was applied to determine promising gas atomization process parameters for the manufacture of Ni-Co based superalloy powders for turbine-disk applications. Using a Bayesian optimization without expert assistance, starting from just three sets of data, three optimization cycles were used to determine the gas atomization process parameters. In particular, we determined the melt temperature and gas pressure that could achieve a 77.85\% yield (size: &lt;53 μm), compared to the 10–30\% yield that is generally achieved. This substantial increase in yield enabled us to successfully reduce the manufacturing cost by ~72\% compared with that of a commercial powder.},

Magnesium alumino silicate hydrate containing sodium (M-A-S-H N samples) were synthesized in batch experiments with NaNO 3 ~ 100 mmol/L at Mg/Si ratios equal to 0.8 and 1.2, and Al/Si ratios of 0, 0.1 and 0.2, and equilibrated at 20 and 50 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-rays diffraction (XRD), 29 Si MAS NMR data showed that M-A-S-H phases formed, with a similar structure as M-S-H. 27 Al and 23 Na MAS NMR data showed that only little sodium was sorbed, while aluminium was possibly incorporated in both tetrahedral and octahedral sites of M-A-S-H. We found evidence that the presence of sodium nitrate led to the formation of hydrotalcite-like phase probably containing NO 3 − and possibly to the trace formation of hydrated alumino-silicate containing sodium: N-A-S-H gel. These minor phases limited the aluminium uptake by M-S-H at higher Al contents (Al/Si = 0.2).},

However, there are limitations, inconsistencies, and knowledge gaps in the current stage in developing macrophage-mediated nanotherapeutics to realize its fullest potential. Thus, it demands more efforts on understanding the interplays between macrophage and nanomedicine as well as nanomedicines and tumor cells in modulating anti-cancer immunity in the tumor microenvironment.

Some potential absorber materials with a 3D perovskite structure have been identified by using the calculated decomposition enthalpies, band gaps, and optimized atomic structures. The structural factor screening is found to be not decisive since the electronic effects are not taken into account. Furthermore, by doping at the B or X sites with a proper concentration, it is possible to improve the stability and optimize the band gap of perovskite materials. Since the present calculations are conducted for small monovalent organic molecules and the tetragonal perovskites, the present theoretical results should provide a useful guidance for designing the organic−inorganic perovskite solar cell absorbers.},

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant brain tumor. Owing to its highly infiltrative nature and restrictive blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB), the current treatment strategies, including surgery and the following chemoradiotherapy, offer very low efficacy. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop novel multifunctional theranostic agents for visualized diagnosis and treatment of GBM. In this work, a phototheranostic nanoprobe (CH4T@MOF-PEG-AE), constructed of Fe-based metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles loaded with a small-molecule near-infrared II (NIR-II) fluorophore (CH4T), is rationally designed and modified with tumor-targeting AE105 peptide for efficiently targeting the over-expressed urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor (uPAR) on GBM. The nanoplatform combines advantages of high penetration depth of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with high detection sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution of NIR-II fluorescence imaging, enabling it to diagnose and delineate GBM accurately. Besides, in vivo studies reveal that CH4T@MOF-PEG-AE can realize MR/NIR-II imaging-guided photothermal therapy (PTT), achieving successful ablation of U87MG tumors. More importantly, the nanoprobes can efficiently transport across the BBTB facilitated by active tumor-targeting and enrich in the orthotopic GBM tumors, being capable of guiding the surgical resection of GBM via real-time intraoperative NIR-II imaging. Our work provides new insights into developing theranostic nanoplatforms for efficient diagnosis and treatment of GBM.},

Using integrated experimental efforts and calculations, the evolution of microstructure entities such as dislocation density , organization, cellular structure and recrystallization behaviors were characterized as a function of heat treatments. Furthermore, the evolution of dislocation-type, namely the geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) and statistically stored dislocations (SSDs), and their impacts on the hardness variation during annealing treatments for L-PBF alloy were experimentally investigated. The GND and SSD densities were statistically measured utilizing the Hough-based EBSD method and Taylor&#39;s hardening model. With the progress of recovery, the GNDs migrate from cellular walls to more energetically-favourable regions, resulting in the higher concentration of GNDs along subgrain boundaries. The SSD density decreases faster than the GND density during heat treatments, because the SSD density is more sensitive to the release of thermal distortions formed in printing. In all annealing conditions, the dislocations contribute to more than 50\% of the hardness, and over 85.8\% of the total dislocations are GNDs, while changes of other strengthening mechanism contributions are negligible, which draws a conclusion that the hardness of the present L-PBF alloy is governed predominantly by GNDs.},

The θ&#39; precipitates did not exhibit measurable coarsening after thermal exposure at 300°C for 5000 h. Kinetic effects of Mn and Zr interfacial segregation, which dominate over thermodynamic effects under these conditions, were necessary to understand the complete inhibition of precipitate coarsening. The θ&#39; phase fraction was stable during the 5000 h exposure. This stable phase fraction was regarded as the metastable equilibrium value and was smaller than that predicted by the θ&#39; solvus line of the ACMZ alloy. As expected from the observed phase stability, the alloy hardness also remained stable during the 5000 h exposure.

Results demonstrate that a wide range of bending and torsional stiffness values can be effectively achieved and controlled independently.

However, these materials suffer from brittleness , which substantially limits the range of their applications, where high toughness is required. This investigation draws inspiration from a concept of architectures with three-dimensional (3D) networks of weak interfaces targeting high toughness ceramics. In this study, a comprehensive method combining an advanced computational model with 3D digital image correlation (DIC) was developed to engineer bioinspired multilayered architectured ceramics and assesses their toughening and deformation mechanisms when subjected to a low-velocity impact load regime. A complete finite element (FE) analysis was conducted to precisely evaluate the crack growth and displacement field of the architectured ceramics and is compared to those of plain ceramics. The damage and displacement evolution results from FE analysis and experimental testing revealed that the primary source of toughening of the architectured ceramic systems is extrinsic, resulting from extensive crack deflection and delamination . Crack propagation along an irregular long path at the weak interfaces of architectured layers increased the toughness of the plain ceramics by two orders of magnitude. Based on the DIC data, both extrinsic and intrinsic toughening mechanisms were captured: sliding of the tiles in the architectured ceramics and channel plastic deformation in adhesive interlayers , respectively.},

Therefore, inorganic fillers [talcum powder (TP), CaCO 3 (CC)] and a bio-filler [eggshell powder (EP)] were added, and the resulting mechanical properties , water resistance, thermal stability and biodegradation characteristics were compared. Results show that the tensile strength of the EP-composite increases by 34\% and the compressive strength of the CC-composite increases by 69\% when compared with those of the non-filler (NF) composite. The mechanical properties of the composites improved because of the reduction of starch crystallinity and the formation of new hydrogen bonds . The EP-composite offered optimal cushioning owing to its uniform and dense open-cell structures. Besides, the CC- and EP-composites offered better thermal stability. The composites with fillers were more waterproof than the NF-composite (by approximately 33\%). After conducting biodegradability tests for 30 days, the EP-composite lost 67\% of its mass, which was more than those associated with the TP- and CC-composites and can be attributed to the presence of organic matter in the EP-composite. These results demonstrate the potential of EP to replace CC and TP for reinforcing the starch-fibre composites with open-cell structures.},

  abstract     = {Introduced is a comprehensive numerical modeling framework that includes microstructure when simulating the laser impact welding (LIW) of metals to study the transient phenomena that occur during weld formation. Such transient phenomena include evolution of shear stresses, plastic strains, thermal response, and material jetting. Inhomogeneous microstructures for two dissimilar foils (aluminum 1100 and stainless steel 304) are first predicted using the Dynamic Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method to simulate laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) additive manufacturing (AM). These microstructures are subsequently incorporated into an Eulerian finite element (FE) simulation of the LIW process , enabling prediction of grain elongations that result from the varying yield surfaces, stacking fault energies , and grain-boundary sliding effects. Trends in the predicted microstructure deformation patterns show strong agreement with those from experimental images in the literature. Compared to existing homogeneous models , the new framework with inhomogeneous AM microstructure reveals higher collision velocities at the weld interface, resulting in increased plastic strain rates , greater plastic heat dissipation, and increased material jetting with higher jet temperatures. The framework allows for new opportunities to study correlations between grain topography (as well as polycrystalline metal texture) and the transient process phenomena occurring at the impact weld interface.},

Although the tensile behavior of SHCC has been a matter of study in numerous research works, the behavior of these composites under other loading modes has scarcely been investigated. The article at hand addresses the mechanical behavior of two types of normal-strength SHCC subject to uniaxial tension, torsion, and combinations of torsional and axial loading . The SHCC under investigation were made with polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers, respectively. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was applied to evaluate the multiple cracking process and crack opening modes in conjunction with the axial and torsional loading histories. The study demonstrates the suitability of torsion experiments to assess the multi-axial and shear performance of SHCC, highlights the relation between multiple cracking and transfer capacity for shear forces, and emphasizes the importance of the type of reinforcing fibers on the shear strength and ductility of such composites.},

The process-inherent high cooling rates and localized melting pools allow to overcome geometrical restrictions given for the production of BMGs by classical casting routes. Yet, the achievable surface qualities are still limited, making an adequate post-processing necessary. In this work, we report on applying thermoplastic forming on LPBF-formed parts for the first time to decrease surface roughness and imprint finely structured surface patterns without the need for complex abrasive machining. This BMG-specific post-processing approach allows to functionalize surface areas on highly complex LPBF-formed specimens, which could be of interest especially for medical or jewelry applications.},

The combination of the two exciting materials to form silica/graphene (SiO 2 /G) composites not only overcomes the aggregation problem but also leads to enhanced or even new physical/chemical properties and high performance due to their synergic effects. Designing and constructing a reasonable structure of SiO 2 /G composite material is vital for its practical application. In this review, the synthesis strategy of SiO 2 /G-based composites is highlighted. This strategy includes growing silica layers on graphene nanosheets to form sandwich structures, growing silica spheres on graphene nanosheets, and wrapping graphene layers on silica spheres. This review focuses on the superior application of the nanocomposites in the fields of energy storage, catalysis, environmental protection, biomedicine and polymer composites .

Reducing the thickness to a single-layer level would prompt the scaling limit to sub-nanometer. However, monolayer materials based vertical memristive devices generally suffer inferior performance with high operating voltage, large leakage currents, and poor reliability. In this study, an interfacial polymer layer is inserted between the monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and top electrodes, which not only helps to constrain the conducting filament size but also block the formation of excess filaments from the bottom Cu foil. Therefore, the device shows stable bipolar resistive switching behavior with low operating voltage ( 10 5 s), and excellent flexibility. It is demonstrated that tunneling conduction is shown in off-state and on-state current conducts via metallic conducting filaments, which are formed by the substitute of metal ions for lattice vacancies in h-BN. This work presents a scalable interface engineering strategy to control the interactions between metal ions and defects in monolayer h-BN films and sheds light on their promising application for large-scale integrated ultrathin flexible memory.},

Here, a clamped cantilever with dimensions of 200 × 23.7 × 40 μm 3 was machined by focused ion beam milling from a thin film composed of four alternating CrN and Cr layers. The cantilever was loaded to 460 mN in two steps and multiaxial strain distributions were determined by in situ cross-sectional X-ray nanodiffraction. Characterization in as-deposited state revealed the depth variation of fibre texture and residual stress across the layers. The in situ experiment indicated a strong influence of the residual stresses on the cross-sectional stress fields evolution and crack arrest capability at the CrN-Cr interface. In detail, an effective negative stress intensity of −5.9 ± 0.4 MPa m ½ arose as a consequence of the residual stress state. Crack growth in the notched Cr layer occurred at a critical stress intensity of 2.8 ± 0.5 MPa m ½ . The results were complemented by two-dimensional numerical simulation to gain further insight into the elastic-plastic deformation evolution. The quantitative experimental and modelling results elucidate the stepwise nature of fracture advancement across the alternating brittle and ductile layers and their interfaces.},

To determine the effective permittivity of the plastic–air mixture, we use an exponential model .

The results obtained suggest that the permittivity of solid and powdery asteroid minerals can be modelled with the proposed technique and, in particular, that the numerical structural permittivity models of the earlier numerical studies can be approximated by 3D-printed analogues.},

Sufficient radial strength of the stent is essential, as insufficient vessel wall support can lead to a significant recoil (reduction of the vessel lumen) and can cause dangerous complications. To assess the stress development and deformation of the stent, finite element analysis (FEA) was used. First, a complex FEA of the inflation and crimping processes of a bioresorbable coronary stent was performed. An optimisation procedure based on the simplified parametric FE model was subsequently performed to obtain the optimal geometric parameters of the analysed structure. The objective of the optimisation was to maximise the vessel diameter after the BVS implantation. The optimisation procedure was based on automatic model-generating scripts, numerical analyses and implementation of genetic algorithms . Finally, a comparison of the parametric and complex models results was performed, as well as a final validation at several stages (structural studies, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and in vivo testing). The validation confirmed that the presented optimisation methodology represents a valid and useful tool for the stent design process.},

Resulting internal coherency stresses govern the microstructure, its evolution and mechanical properties .

Due to their preferred partitioning to γ, the addition of both leads to a stronger increase of the lattice parameter of γ than of γ&#39; and thus to a more negative misfit. The overall content of Re and Ru influences significantly the evolution of the misfit with temperature. Alloys with high contents show an atypical behavior, where the magnitude of the negative misfit gets smaller at high temperatures. Alloys with a medium content exhibit a rather constant misfit and alloys with a low content or without Re and Ru follow the typical trend of a more negative misfit with increasing temperature. The observed differences are ascribed to different thermal expansion coefficients and particularly to the changing chemical composition of γ due to the dissolution of γ&#39; precipitates. An advanced model for determining the misfit based on thermodynamic calculations is presented. Different approaches for determining lattice parameters and calculating lattice misfits are evaluated in the supplementary.},

High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed the successful loading of GA into the CONPs. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) techniques confirmed approximately ⁓30.0 wt\% loading of GA into the CONPs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) demonstrated the anticorrosion properties of the epoxy coatings modified with the GA loaded CONPs when compared to reference coatings.

Thus far, there have been comprehensive investigations to reveal the process-microstructure-property link of as-built AlSi10Mg planar-surface or lattice/honeycomb structural parts. However, little is known about the geometrical, microstructural, and mechanical properties of as-deposited curved-surface parts. In this paper, the effects of curvatures on the geometrical performance, defects, microstructure, and mechanical properties of as-built AlSi10Mg parts with curved surfaces were investigated. Specifically, the results of average cloud-to-cloud distances indicated that the largest curvature (the peak position) exhibited higher dimensional accuracy than the others of as-built curved-surface parts. In addition, the lowest porosity was achieved at the largest curvatures owing to the sufficient localized energy input. We also found that the grain size and the width of grain boundaries increased with an increase in the curvature. Moreover, the tensile property of as-built curved-surface specimens was assessed for the first time. The positions with the largest curvatures became the preferable failure positions due to the largest bending moment. This paper provided great insights into the curvature-microstructure-property relationship for the industrial adoption of PBF-built AlSi10Mg parts with curved surfaces.},

High throughput density functional theory calculations were therefore performed to quantitatively assess the strengthening effects of 35 potential alloying elements from the 2nd to the 6th row of the periodic table in FCC-Ni with varying concentrations. The obtained composition-dependent lattice constants and shear moduli were employed to analyze their strengthening effects within the framework of the Labusch model. It is found that the strengthening ability correlates with the position of the element on the periodic table. Elements in both ends of each period tend to have higher strengthening abilities than those in the middle, and the lattice misfit is found to dominate the strengthening effect for elements in the 5th and 6th period. Stability analysis reveals that all the solid solution models are dynamically stable and intrinsically ductile. Thermodynamic consideration finds that roughly half of the elements are prone to form solid solutions with Ni. By adopting the experimental solubilities, the strengthening potentials of these elements were further evaluated and promising strengthening elements were screened.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge concerning powder degradation during additive manufacturing (AM) processing is essential to improve the reusability of the powder in AM and hence maximize feedstock powder reuse and economy of the process. AlSi10Mg powder degradation in Concept Laser XLINE 2000R machine over the total period of 30 months was analyzed in order to understand the extent and mechanism affecting powder aging. Thereby, detailed analysis of the powder morphology, microstructure and surface chemistry was performed by SEM, TEM and XPS . The results show an increase in volume fraction of heavily oxidized spatter particles up to 3\% in 30 months. XPS analysis of the powder surface chemistry indicates that powder particles are covered by uniform oxide layer , formed by Mg- and Al-based oxides, average thickness of which increased from ~4 nm in case of the virgin powder up to about 38 nm in case of the reused for about 30 month powder, established by XPS. Analysis of the oxide characteristics were consistent with the observed oxygen content in the sampled powder. Columnar oxide scale formation on spatter particles was revealed as well, reaching up to 125 nm in thickness measured using STEM. Results of the XPS and STEM-EDX analysis of oxide composition are shown to be in agreement with the thermodynamic calculations confirming that oxide scale on sputter particles is formed by MgAl 2 O 4 spinel and Al 2 O 3 (corundum) oxides.},

  abstract     = {This study focused on developing an efficient phase change material (PCM) with a stable shape that can be applied in a wide range of industries. To prevent leakage of the PCM liquid at a temperature above the melting point, we used an encapsulation method by making use of an interfacial polycondensation reaction , and attempted to develop a new PCM with excellent thermal conductivity and thermal energy storage capacity. In order to improve the functionality of the PCM in latent thermal storage applications, a magnetic material, Fe 3 O 4 , was mixed with n -eicosane and a shape-stable phase change microcapsule with a silica shell was successfully prepared. In this study, we loaded Cu metal nanoparticles on the outer wall of the capsule with the aim of improving the thermal conductivity of the material for efficient heat transfer. The results indicated that the n -eicosane-Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @Cu microcapsule has excellent heat transfer ability owing to its high thermal conductivity and exhibits efficient thermal energy storage–release performance by suppressing supercooling. The n -eicosane-Fe 3 O 4 @SiO 2 @Cu microcapsule showed an encapsulation efficiency ( E en ) of 61.48\%, an energy storage efficiency ( E es ) of 61.47\%, and a thermal storage capacity ( C es ) of 99.99\%. Moreover, the multi-cycle differential scanning calorimetry scan showed excellent thermal reliability and shape stability, even in repetitive melting–cooling processes, suggesting that it is a promising PCM that can be used in industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Advances in manufacturing techniques may now realize virtually any imaginable microstructures, paving the way for architected materials with properties beyond those found in nature. This has lead to a quest for closing gaps in property-space by carefully designed metamaterials. Development of mechanical metamaterials has gone from open truss lattice structures to closed plate lattice structures with stiffness close to theoretical bounds. However, the quest for optimally stiff and strong materials is complex. Plate lattice structures have higher stiffness and (yield) strength but are prone to buckling at low volume fractions. Hence here, truss lattice structures may still be optimal. To make things more complicated, hollow trusses or structural hierarchy bring closed-walled microstructures back in the competition. Based on analytical and numerical studies of common microstructures from the literature, we provide higher order interpolation schemes for their effective stiffness and (buckling) strength. Furthermore, we provide a case study based on multi-property Ashby charts for weight-optimal porous beams under bending, that demonstrates the intricate interplay between structure and microarchitecture that plays the key role in the design of ultimate load carrying structures. The provided interpolation schemes may also be used to account for microstructural yield and buckling in multiscale design optimization schemes.},

This paper first investigates and describes the key parameters for the fabrication of ceramic foam based on a geopolymer mixture by impregnation using the replica technique. The influence of geopolymer mixture viscosity on total porosity, pore size and mechanical strength of leucite ceramic foams is evaluated. The accelerated solidification step at 70 °C was investigated using time-dependent viscoelastic parameters such as tan δ, G&#39; and G&quot;. For the fabrication of highly porous ceramics based on the geopolymer mixture, the optimum viscosity ranges between 9 and 15 Pa.s at 100 s −1 . Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated the crystallization of the main leucite phase at 1073.5 °C, during the thermal exposure up to 1300 °C. It has been revealed that ceramic foam with an open porosity of 76 to 79 vol\% can be fabricated using a replica technique. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) have confirmed interconnected macroporosity with an open pore size up to 2 mm.

Nature, however, has provided us with design strategies, through which many biological systems have overcome this conflict. Insect wings represent a striking example of such a combination. A key to this lies in the presence of vein joints . Here we 3D printed bio-inspired joints, akin to those of insect wings and tested their mechanical performance under both static and cyclic loadings. We used the so-called ‘flexible joints’, which had a high durability, and engineered them to further enhance their load-bearing capacity. We then implemented them into the design of the first 3D printed bio-inspired kite. The manufactured kite showed a stable flight and withstood loads induced by strong wind gusts without failure. The concept developed here can be applied to other engineering designs that pursue a compromise between load-bearing and durability. At the end, we used our data to better understand the complexities of insect wings with respect to their local and global deformations and fracture resistance .},

In this paper, a damage model is developed to describe the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of voids in additive manufacturing materials, revealing the nature of true stress drop. In order to characterize the defect morphology and depict the defect evolution, an in-situ tensile test with synchrotron radiation X-ray topography (SRXT) is carried out. Statistical reconstruction of the initial voids morphology are used as input for the established damage model. Furthermore, in light of the epistemic uncertainty in the process of defect reconstruction in SRXT, Bayesian framework is adopted for parameter estimation. Finally, the above model is verified by the data form 3D defect reconstruction and the uniaxial tensile test, where the constitutive behavior as well as its scatter are well captured. This work contributes to the depiction on damage evolution and the correspondingly affected deformation performance, which can be useful in material design and defect control for additive manufactured load-bearing structures.},

The plasma-spheroidized (PS) powder exhibited the highest flowability due to the excellent particle circularity of 0.94; however, its oxygen content was much higher than that of the gas-atomized (GA) powder. The GA powder exhibited an extremely low oxygen content of 390 ppm; however, its flowability was lowered because of many irregular-shaped particles. The consolidation of these powders by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) was completed, and a fully dense sample without any defects could be obtained for all the powders regardless of the flowability. The cross-sectional microstructures of the powder particles were largely varied depending on the powder fabrication methods , which resulted in the formation of different HIP microstructures. The high-temperature creep behavior was strongly dependent on the HIP microstructure.

The method is based on combining a calculated stress distribution and a surface full-field strain measurement in a custom short-beam shear specimen. As the in-plane shear strain exceeds 0.01, all unidirectional SBS specimens exhibited highly nonlinear shear stress-strain behavior. Shear delamination failure occurred at elevated temperatures up to 150 o C. Axial elastic modulus and in-plane shear modulus were determined from 2-mm-wide gage regions mid-way between the loading nose and lower support in a single experiment using the closed-form approximation and finite-element-model-updating method. The average axial moduli determined using two different methods are highly consistent. The variation of multiple mechanical properties for the composite material with the temperature rising to 150 o C has been obtained simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that the axial elastic modulus decreased by only 5.2\% at 100 o C and 7.8\% at 150 o C, respectively. However, the in-plane shear modulus decreased by 20.8\% at 150 o C. It indicates that the degradation of the in-plane shear behavior is sensitive to temperature rising since it is dominated by the matrix, which is sensitive to the glass transition temperature T g of epoxy resin.},

Smaller particle size promotes the leaching efficiency, but the increment narrows with increasing Ca/Mg ratio. Leaching kinetics of the studied alloys was found following the modified Kröger-Ziegler model based on a cracking-shrinking mechanism. The impurity purification efficiency increases with increasing Ca/Mg mixing ratio, but significantly reduced by rapid cooling.

The height difference between the liquidus isotherms in the airfoil and platform, which is induced by the difference between liquidus isotherm advancing velocity and withdrawal rate, provides undercooling for the nucleation and the growth of stray grains. The height range of liquidus isotherm is used for the first time to describe the asymmetric distribution of temperature and radiation, and to estimate the probability of stray grain formation. A real-time adjustment of withdrawal rate method is proposed to design the withdrawal rate-time curve aiming to fabricate superalloy single-crystal blades with complex geometry. The obtained withdrawal rate curve is then validated by numerical simulation and hence applied to the fabrication of single-crystal blades. The simulation results show that with obtained withdrawal rate curve the distribution of radiation and temperature are significantly improved and the undercooling in the platform is largely reduced. The observed macrostructure in the experiments proves that the stray grains in the platform can be avoided through the designed withdrawal rate curve. The proposed method for designing withdrawal rate can provide a reliable strategy for the research and manufacture of stray-grain-free single-crystal blades.},

The results showed that the total length of hot cracking on the 10.5 mm-length longitudinal section of the cladding zone reduces from 3.263 mm to 0.092 mm with the decline of DC from 80\% to 30\%. The intermittent occurrence of the laser beam induced the ripple microstructure in the cladding layer (CL). It is the high cooling rate in laser extinguishment process that caused the fine dendrite zone which provides more resistance for hot cracking propagation in the CL. The liquid film in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) mainly results from the M 5 B 3 /γ, γ′/γ, and MC/γ constitutional liquation successively among 1200–1300 °C. Heat input is the main factor affecting hot cracking in the HAZ. With the decrease of DC, the dendrite spacing of the fine dendrite zone decreases in the CL, and the depth of liquefaction zone decreases in the HAZ, as a result, the length of hot cracking in the CL and HAZ both decreases.},

  abstract     = {Origami technology is promising for the development of antennas operating in the microwave and terahertz regime. This study summarizes recent advances in origami antennas and their construction regarding frequency, patterns, and polarization switching capabilities for the microwave frequency band. However, there are some challenges of origami antennas related to stability, robustness, and self-deployment, which should be addressed to design more practical deployable origami antennas in the microwave frequency band. In this review, we explained the design principle of various reconfigurable origami antenna. The dielectric and conductive materials of previous origami antennas are discussed and provided the promission materials to satisfy both easy transformation and high robustness for origami antennas. In addition, various actuators are discussed to pave the way for the practical application. Origami technology has also been employed for nanoscale antennas working in the terahertz and optical regime for several applications, including single molecule detection and artificial light harvesting. Although DNA molecules provide a scaffold for the origami antennas at nanoscale size, various issues require attention for development of more advanced nanoscale origami antennas in the terahertz regime. The most pressing issues are the high cost of DNA and the probability of high error rates in self-assembly fabrication.},

  abstract     = {There has been recently a great progress in the development of dielectric capacitors for high temperature electronic applications. The design of lead-free ceramics with high dielectric permittivity, low dielectric loss and a limited variation of these parameters over a wide temperature range is still a big challenge. In this work, lead-free Bi 0.35 Na 0.65 – 0.5x Rb 0.5x Ti 0.7 Nb 0.3 O 3 (x = 0–0.05) bulk ceramics were prepared using the solid-state reaction method. Upon Rb substitution, the variation of the dielectric permittivity was reduced substantially, in particular, at high temperature (over 200 °C). In addition, a low temperature coefficient of capacitance (TCC ≤ 10\%) together with an ultra-low dielectric loss (tan δ ≤ 0.05) were achieved for the Bi 0.35 Na 0.63 Rb 0.02 Ti 0.7 Nb 0.3 O 3 sample in the temperature range from −43 °C to 292 °C. The new relaxor-type ferroelectrics also possess the outstanding stability of the dielectric properties under high DC bias voltage , which makes them promising materials for high-performance capacitors of the next generation.},

  abstract     = {The current research on bi-material diamond metamaterials, which can be used to program the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) over a wide range, mainly focuses on the theoretical design, while the corresponding experimental range of the CTEs is far narrower. In this study, a bi-material diamond metamaterial was additively manufactured using two polymers: nylon and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Without any need for extra processes such as bonding, welding, and mechanical fitting, the additively manufactured metamaterial integrated the nylon and PVA, providing an integrated fabrication process to ensure the expected programmable CTE. The experimentally measured CTEs agreed well with the theoretical predictions. When the material layout was selected as MAT-1 = PVA and MAT-2 = nylon, programmable CTEs ranging from 217.72 to 694.00 ppm/°C were obtained, which were larger than the CTEs of the nylon and PVA. When the material layout was MAT-1 = nylon and MAT-2 = PVA, even though both the nylon and the PVA had positive CTEs, a wide range of negative CTEs (varying from −25.02 to −369.01 ppm/°C) was obtained. The foregoing wide ranges of programmable CTEs are remarkably larger than the literature results, indicating the enhanced programmability of the bi-material metamaterial and stabilizing the foundation for the further design of multilevel and hierarchical metamaterials.},

  abstract     = {The application of Directed Energy Deposition (DED) when using new materials or new instruments, requires significant empirical testing to define a suitable or optimum process operation window. Determining the ideal DED parameters is challenging due to the complexity of the deposition process being dynamic in nature, with a multitude of parameters being highly influential on the resultant melt pool dimensions and the subsequent evolution of solidification. The present study seeks to rationalise the notion of a processing window by using artificial neural networks (ANN) to elucidate the complex interaction between the input parameters - specifically the relationship between the energy density of the laser and material deposition rate on the shape of single-track deposits. Herein, cross-sectional data was collected from single tracks of Inconel 625, Hastelloy X and stainless steel 316 L deposited onto mild steel substrates; whilst using a matrix of process parameters. The ANN was used to model the interplay between laser power, scan speed, laser beam diameter, material deposition rate and material type . The network was then used to visualize a theoretical relationship between the volumetric energy density and the energy required to melt a specific amount of the supplied powder.},

  abstract     = {Laser shock imprinting (LSI) is an emerging method for creating sub-micrometer and nanoscale reliefs on thin metal foils. This report proposes using underwater shockwaves , generated by detonating an explosive charge, for high-quality imprinting as an alternative to LSI. The nanoscale relief of a polycarbonate mold with 740 nm periodic grooves was replicated on an Al foil using an underwater shockwave. Underwater detonation of a high explosive creates a shockwave with pressure ≥ 1 GPa that lasts for more than 100 ns, significantly longer than that for LSI. This provides a relief depth equal to 90\% of the depth of the grooves on the mold. This mold filling efficiency is the best achieved by shock imprinting reported to date. In addition, underwater shockwaves can be used for imprinting over a large area in a single shot. Furthermore, the thickness of the Al foil can be increased in comparison to that for LSI. Using a simplified 1-D model of foil acceleration, we showed that increasing the foil thickness decreases the imprinting accuracy. This study paves new ways for large-area manufacturing of micro/nanopatterns on metals that would be especially beneficial for future applications in the fields of plasmonics and metasurfaces .},

  abstract     = {Mechanotransduction is the initiation of an electrochemical signal as a result of mechanical stimuli. It is found predominately in biological tissue and its mechanisms are well documented. In the gel like tissues of the body, such as articular cartilage and intervertebral discs, mechanotransduction regulates matrix building and degrading processes as well as keeping the tissues adequately hydrated, both with the aim of minimizing degradation. The electrochemical responses to mechanical loading at constant volume of an inanimate hydrogel could assist in the understanding of these processes. There is considerable evidence that the modulus of hydrated tissues and hydrogels depend explicitly on ionic concentration . By modeling the mechano-electrochemical relationship of a hydrogel, the coupling of the elastic and electrochemical energies can be quantified. In turn, the mechanisms that govern this phenomenon can be better understood. This study modifies the Flory-Rehner theory of gels, using material-specific experimental data as input. The results show up to a 11\% difference in equilibrium swelling magnitude compared to the Flory-Rehner model. Furthermore, under isochoric deformation , an increase in electrical potential is shown with increasing shear strain, something which is not possible with conventional Flory-Rehner and Donnan theory. This aligns the continuum model presented here more closely with both experiment and microscopic theories . The mechanosensing capabilities as well as varying swelling responses in different solution concentrations highlight the models potential applications in both biological and technological settings.},

  abstract     = {The plastic deformation of the AlSi10Mg alloy manufactured via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is incompatible at the microscale , which causes residual strains/stresses and dislocation pile-ups at the Al/Si interfaces and grain boundaries. Hence, it is of fundamental significance to clarify these microscopic properties during plastic deformation. Here, in-situ neutron diffraction is employed to explore the residual strains , stresses, and dislocation density in the LPBF AlSi10Mg during loading-unloading-reloading deformation. It is found that the maximum residual stresses of the Al and Si phases in the loading direction reach up to about −115 (compressive) and 832 (tensile) MPa, respectively. A notable dislocation annihilation phenomenon is observed in the Al matrix : the dislocation density decreases significantly during unloading stages, and the amplitude of this reduction increases after experiencing a larger plastic deformation. At the macroscale , this dislocation annihilation phenomenon is associated with the reverse strain after unloading. At the microscale, the annihilation phenomenon is driven by the compressive residual stress in the Al matrix. Meanwhile, the annihilation of screw dislocations during unloading stages contributes to the reduction in total dislocation density.},

The substrates could significantly affect the properties of graphene and related devices. In this work, we investigate the effect of surface morphology and roughness of patterned silicon nitride substrates on Raman scattering and stress of graphene. We find that the Raman scattering of graphene depend strongly on surface morphology and roughness of patterned substrates. It is concluded that the peak red-shifts in 2D and G bands was due to the strain induced by patterns with different surface morphology (holes and trenches) and roughness. Furthermore, the effects of morphology of patterned area are much greater than the role of surface roughness in the induced strain of graphene. Due to the larger surface area (about 1.65 times), the strain in the grooves is greater than in holes, in spite of greater surface roughness in holes. Our results also reveal that the effect of pattern depth should be taken into account to understand the Raman peak shift and the strain change of graphene. Our work is fundamentally important for understanding the graphene properties on dependence of surface morphology of substrates and enhancing the interfacial strength of graphene-based devices.},

A diacrylate polymer was mixed with 3\% yttria partially stabilized zirconia (3YZ) ceramic nanoparticles having different sizes and solids loadings to find formulations that meet the printing requirements of both AM techniques. Detailed rheological studies were used to determine optimal ink formulations to use for either printing method. The resulting 3YZ structures printed with DIW and PμSL have engineered macro cavities with span lengths greater than several millimeters, wall thicknesses of 200 to 540 μm, and porosity within the wall structure on the order of 100 nm.

Second, polymer polyethyleneimine (PEI) with different structure and molecular weight is used to reduce graphene oxide simultaneously in experiments. The results show that branched PEI helps to enhance DC values. In addition, the linear low molecular weight PEI assists in the mechanical and thermal performances, whereas linear high molecular weight PEI synchronously improves the dielectric, mechanical, and thermal performances. Subsequently, the combination of experiments and MD simulations provides in-depth insight into the mechanism and influencing factors for the ameliorative properties. The simulation results indicate that the meliorated dielectric, thermal, and mechanical properties of composites are mainly related to the interface behaviour, including interface compatibility, interface bonding strength , interface phonon vibration power spectrum, and interface hydrogen bonds .

Nevertheless, a critical barrier that limits the application of 3D printed PEEK components is their weak interfacial bonding strength . Herein, we propose a novel method to improve this unsatisfied situation via the interface plasticizing effect of benzene derivatives obtained from the thermal pyrolysis of trisilanolphenyl polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane (POSS). Based on this method, the bonding strength of the filaments and interlayers of 3D-printed POSS/PEEK components can reach 82.9 MPa and 59.8 MPa, respectively. Moreover, the enhancing mechanism of the pyrolysis products derived from the POSS is characterized using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray computed tomography (X-CT). Our proposed strategy broadens the novel design space for developing additional 3D-printed materials with satisfactory interfacial bonding strength.},

  abstract     = {Automated in-process Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) systems are rapidly gaining traction within the manufacturing industry as they reduce manufacturing time and costs. When considering calibration and verification of such systems, creating defects of known geometry and nature during the deposition of a weld can: (I) help examine the capability of the automated system to detect and characterise defects, (II) be used to form a database of signals associated with different defect types to train intelligent defect classification algorithms , and (III) act as a basis for in-process gain calibration during weld inspection at high temperatures, where the ultrasound beam can be skewed as a result of velocity gradients . In view of this, this paper investigates two unique methodologies for introducing: (a) lack of fusion weld defects by embedding tungsten in the weld and (b) creating artificial weld cracks by quenching to imitate the real cracking scenarios. According to the results of Phased Array Ultrasound Testing (PAUT) inspections, the methodologies used for embedding the artificial defects were successful. The validity of inspections was also verified by extracting micrographs from the defective sections of the welds, and model-based simulations were carried out to gain a better understanding of the wave propagation path and interaction with the generated defects.},

  abstract     = {Fused-filament fabrication (FFF) is an extrusion-based form of three-dimensional (3D) printing for manufacturing parts rapidly. Commercially available polypropylene (PP) filaments produce shrinkage and warpage, termed dimensional instabilities, or have poor mechanical properties . FFF can therefore only produce prototypes. Polypropylene is a promising material, considering its 3D printed mechanical properties are as high as those from traditional manufacturing, yet, still exhibiting dimensional instabilities. In this work, we solve this instability problem by reinforcing PP with microcapsules. These microcapsules comprise polylactic acid (PLA) and reduced graphene oxide , confirmed by x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy . By first encapsulating graphene with PLA, once melt-compounded, our scanning and transmitting electron microscopy shows that the PLA-graphene microcapsules are well dispersed throughout the PP main matrix. Our rheological analysis shows that our PP nanocomposites exhibit high melt elasticity, giving better support to printing constructs, and low viscosity, promoting printability, avoiding nozzle clogging and filament buckling. At 30\% volume fraction, our nanocomposites also outperform the neat PP in mechanical testing.},

  abstract     = {Asymmetric porous SiOC membranes with different pore characteristic and membrane morphology were produced for the first time by adapting the phase inversion tape casting technique to the polymer-derived ceramic route. Polymethyl siloxane (MK) was used as a ceramic precursor. The produced tapes were pyrolyzed under N 2 atmosphere. The structure and surface characteristics were tailored by changing the pyrolysis temperatures (600 and 1000 °C), polyvinylpyrrolidone and solid loading. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed the asymmetric morphology composed by a thin skin-layer (average pore size &lt;2 μm) and a sponge-like support. The differences in membranes porosity (33–47\%) and overall pore size distribution (1–10 μm) can be controlled by adjusting the slurry composition. The incorporation of particles improved the slurry processability , enhanced the mechanical flexural resistance of the membrane (20–48 MPa), and reduced the average pore size . Higher mechanical strengths and enhanced hydrophilic character are associated with higher pyrolysis temperatures (ceramization process). The water permeation of membranes pyrolyzed at 1000 °C were assessed in a dead-end configuration device under different pressures (1–3 bar). The obtained water permeation fluxes (6–55 m 3 /m 2 ·h, at 3 bar) indicates the advantages of the asymmetric structure which minimizes mass transport limitations.},

  abstract     = {Micromachining repair of surface defects on KH 2 PO 4 (KDP) optics is an emerging technique in the construction of Inertial Confinement Fusion facilities for obtaining clean nuclear fusion energy. However, this method is yet facing considerable challenges owing to the soft-brittle nature of single-crystal KDP, hence it is necessary to understand its ductile-regime cutting mechanism to generate crack-free surfaces. This paper seeks to investigate the evolution of different cutting mechanism with the change of uncut chip thickness (UCT) in KDP orthogonal cutting processes. A transition of cutting modes from plastic cutting to shear-crack cutting and then fracture cutting with the rise of UCT has been revealed. To explain these cutting phenomena, a novel theoretical model was proposed by calculating the specific energy dissipation for crack/fracture propagations during cutting processes based on fracture mechanics . This analytical model was well validated by the analysis of cutting forces and machined surface quality. Nevertheless, three kinds of surface defects have been observed, i.e. micro pits, micro craters and edge chipping. These surface defects were caused by tearing and spalling of materials with elastic recovery , crack propagation along cleavage planes with ploughing effect, and the peeling away of large-size fracture, respectively. The presented results of great significance for promoting the application of micromachining processes in future engineering repair of KDP optics.},

Both the chemical composition of low-alloy steel and environmental factors were used as input features, and the random forest algorithm was selected as the modeling algorithm. Feature reduction methods, including the gradient boosting decision tree, Kendall correlation analysis and principal component analysis, were first applied to select the dominating factors on the corrosion rate. Then, we proposed two feature creation methods to convert the chemical composition features into a set of atomic and physical property features. As a result, the feature creation method crafted a model no longer limited to materials with specific chemical compositions. The machine learning-based corrosion rate prediction model also showed good prediction accuracy of the corrosion rate. This study improved the generalization ability of the corrosion rate prediction model and proved the feasibility of machine learning in corrosion resistance evaluation.},

In this study, cold metal transfer wire and arc additive manufacturing (CMT-WAAM) process was used to fabricate 316 L stainless steel and initial well-aligned coarse austenitic columnar crystals with 〈100〉 texture along deposition direction were developed. Samples of as-built 316 L were subjected to dynamic compressions with various strain rates and strains by split hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). The as-built 316 L dynamically exhibits ~50\% higher yield strength and twice elastic modulus than quasi-static condition. Twinning acts as main deformation mode whereas strain induced martensitic transformation has not been found. Microstructure evolution upon progressive strains at similar high strain rates reveals continuously increase in the population of deformation twins associated with a gradual decrease in average twin thickness from 120 nm to 20 nm. Average twin thickness as the key physical parameter from evolving microstructures and flow behavior are well fitted using empirical equation. A careful texture analysis suggests a remarkable transition from initial 〈100〉 ||CD (compression direction) to the component 〈110〉 ||CD. Our findings provide the mechanistic insights into understanding the dynamic behavior of additively manufactured stainless steel.},

From conventional casting processes it is known that the δ–AlLi phase is detrimental to mechanical properties and corrosion resistance . All processing steps from the production of ingots free of contamination, oxidation and macrosegregation to the synthesis of fine spherical powders appropriate for additive manufacturing to the powder bed fusion routine using ultra short pulses have been investigated. In comparison with as–cast microstructures, the fast cooling rate after laser assisted powder bed fusion leads to a uniform Li distribution in the primary α phase rather than to the formation of δ–AlLi, contributing to comparably high hardness of the samples.},

Compared with the four-cell ML lattice structure, the nine-cell PL lattice structures improve the mean crushing force (MCF) and specific energy absorption (SEA) by 1.5 times, and can effectively suppress the growth rate of the initial peak force (PF). The improvements in the MCF and the SEA originate from the grain boundaries of the PL lattice structures which restrain the evolution of the shear bands and change the shear failure mode of the MC lattice structures into a layer-by-layer progressive crushing mode.},

The PMMs were deposited by a combination of pulsed DC and radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The structure was analyzed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and grazing incidence X-ray reflectometry. The formation of 0.35 nm-thick interlayers comprised of a mixture of molybdenum borides was observed at the Mo/B interfaces. Furthermore, a low interface roughness of 0.3–0.4 nm was reported. The temperature of the substrate increased due to the increase in the sputtering power. This resulted in an increase in the thickness of the interlayers and the interface roughness; subsequently, the optical properties of the PMM deteriorated. Theoretical calculations were performed based on the real structure of the PMM to predict the reflectivity at a working wavelength of 6.7 nm. The reflectivity of approximately 53\% was two times higher than that of the conventional B 4 C-based BEUV mirrors. Based on our study results, it can be concluded that the as-synthesized PMMs will perform better than the traditional mirrors and can be effectively used for the development of the next generation of BEUV lithography .},

The window covers the range of processing parameters that can lead to a good combination of part density, strength , ductility, and processability. The alloys fabricated within this optimized processing window of SLM have the material relative density more than 99.8\% with less porosity. Moreover, all these alloys have the yield strength exceeding 430 MPa and the ductility of over 17\%. Further microstructural examinations suggest that such excellent mechanical properties are associated with a bimodal grain architecture. Also, a high number density of intermetallic particles has been detected in these two-grain regions. They are confirmed to be Al 3 Sc and Mn(Fe)-rich quasicrystal . Most of these particles distributing along grain boundaries are expected to pin the grain boundaries and contribute to the high strength of this alloy. The findings will provide an essential basis for achieving exceptional mechanical performance and intricate geometry designs of the alloy using AM.},

  abstract     = {The commercial production of H 2 from water splitting requires highly efficient, low-cost, and stable earth-abundant electrocatalysts to speed up the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we proposed a concise and effective strategy for fabricating Ni S electrocatalysts on Ni foam (NF) substrate to serve as HER electrocatalysts during potentiostatic electrodeposition . The Ni S electrocatalyst shows a cauliflower-like surface morphology when the electrodeposition voltage is adjusted. The proposed electrocatalyst exhibits excellent HER performance with a low overpotential of 58 mV at 10 mA·cm −2 and a small Tafel slope of 81.6 mV·dec −1 in 1.0 M KOH solution. Such a high performance can be attributed to the amorphous phase structures, high conductivity, composition optimization, and the close combination between the electrocatalyst and NF. This study provides a facile, fast, and feasible avenue for developing highly efficient and affordable electrochemical catalysts for HER.},

Many existing highly alloyed steels already incorporate MPEA concepts and detailed research is readily available, which can be utilized for a more efficient design approach. Inspired by this consideration, Ni- and Co-additions to the Al 14.6 C 4.9 Fe 53.6 Mn 26.9 (at\%) high‑manganese steel were assessed to introduce B2-precipitates in addition to the κ-carbides to increase strength . Thermodynamic screening in the Al-C-Co-Fe-Mn-Ni system was performed with a custom calphad database and combined with experimental screening to identify novel MPEAs with enhanced mechanical properties . The selected MPEAs were produced by thermo-mechanical processing and the mechanisms active during annealing and deformation were investigated experimentally. The modification with Co did not result in the formation of B2-precipitates and improved mechanical properties. The Ni-added MPEA, Al 14.7 C 4.7 Fe 49.9 Mn 26.4 Ni 4.2 , revealed significant precipitation and dispersion hardening by nanoscale κ- and B2-phases combined with excellent strain hardening capacity due to slip band refinement-induced plasticity (SRIP). A combination of 1 to 1.2 GPa yield strength (21.3\% increase) with a total elongation of 20 to 10\% was achieved. The chosen methodology was efficient in the design of a novel MPEA with an improved strength-ductility synergy.},

To control the phase and quality of membrane-like structures, this study introduces a novel method of the pressure-engineered electrochemical process (PEEP). The isostatic pressure on the electrolyte was examined to have a critical effect on the phase of TiO 2 nanotubes (TNTs) and a distinctive difference in the quality of TNTs was observed under negative pressure condition (P n : 10 −2 mbar) compared with other pressures of ambient (P a : atmospheric) and positive pressure (P p : 5 bar). SAED showed at P a and P p on the surface of nanotubes crystallites grew on {101} planes owing to the lower surface free energy of these crystal planes. Similarly, the current density vs. time profile of the PEEP showed the current consumed at P n was more than P p or P a conditions. In respect of bubble mould theory, it could be concluded that the number of sucked oxygen molecules increased at P n , generating larger nanotubes in diameter. Ion chromatography (IC) test also proved that the fluorine ion (fluoride, F − ) in the electrolyte did not react with those elements leached from the substrate to form (TiF 6 ) 2− . A newly practiced method of PEEP is capable of the scalable fabricating high-quality membrane to be used in optoelectronics , photocatalytic, and photoelectrochemical platforms.},

Herein, we introduce a new 3D auxetic metamaterial that is mathematically generated from an implicit expression. Further, this metamaterial is fabricated by 3D printing using a flexible material, which allows it to recover from large deformations . The buckling-induced auxetic behavior of the metamaterial was first evaluated via compression tests and finite element analyses. A nickel layer was then plated onto the surface to enhance its stiffness, strength , and conductivity without loss of auxeticity and resilience. The integration of 3D printing and electroless plating enabled accurate control over the mechanical and conduction properties of the auxetic metamaterial; these properties are presented as contour maps for guidance in functional applications. We propose a novel 3D auxetic metamaterial derived from a mathematically defined triply periodic minimal surface. The stiffness, strength, and conductivity of the metamaterial are enhanced by nickel plating without loss of auxeticity and resilience. The effective mechanical and conduction properties were mapped against geometric parameters , including relative density and nickel layer thickness. These data maps provide insight for tuning its performance over a broad range.},

Porogen-templating method is an attractive approach for fabrication of macroporous hydrogels, however, the effect of shape and amount of template particles on imprinted structure has not yet been quantitatively established. We present a mathematical model for simulating the formation of paths percolating through distributed cubical particles as a function of the filling volume. The model was used to select the fraction of NaCl particles as templates for preparation of hydrogels with communicating pores. Hydrogels were prepared from 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) copolymerized with 2-ethoxyethyl methacrylate (EOEMA), [2-methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride (MOETACl) or ionizable methacrylic acid (MANa) to modulate swelling, surface and mechanical properties of gels. Micro-CT analysis of swollen samples proved a highly-interconnected pore structure . Charged hydrogels swelled more and their apparent elastic modulus G ′ was below 1 kPa. For PHEMA and P(HEMA/EOEMA) hydrogels, G ′ was 5 and 80 kPa, respectively. Within two-week in vitro studies, MG63 osteoblasts proliferated fastest on P(HEMA/EOEMA) showing the lowest swelling and the highest elastic modulus, whereas cell growth was impaired on positively charged P(HEMA/MOETACl). The mathematical simulation of cubical particle packing in hydrogels and micro-CT data in swollen state provided evidence of an extensive void communication in 3D.},

Here, a multi-approach for primary and metastatic tumors was developed by combining photothermal ablation-based in situ tumor vaccine with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy. Polyethyleimine modified golden nanorod (GNR-PEI) was prepared by conjugating of hyperbranched PEI to GNR via S Au bonds. The positive charged GNR-PEI could complex with cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) by electrostatic interaction . GNR-PEI/cGAMP complex was further utilized for near-infrared laser-triggered phototherapy of primary tumors, generating in situ tumor vaccine, recruiting dendritic cells (DCs) to capture tumor-associated antigens. In addition, cGAMP is a kind of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist that can stimulate the expansion and activation of DCs, arousing the specific immune killing effect of cytotoxic T cells . Furthermore, the combination of localized tumor vaccine and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody (anti-PD-1), that could achieve the checkpoint-blockade and reverse tumor immune tolerance microenvironment , thus improving T cells specific recognition and killing of remaining and metastasis tumor cells.

In other words, fatigue failure in the very-high-cycle regime may be related to the internal vacuum-like environment. Since magnesium alloy is more susceptible to the environmental effect, it is selected as the research carrier in this study. A magnesium alloy is investigated in ambient air and vacuum environments comparatively, and the vacuum loading environment offers a valuable reference to investigate the possible environmental effect. The results show that plastic deformation mechanism in different loading environments keeps the same at crack initiation site. However, the different loading environments not only change the fatigue life , but also the failure mode. At higher stress levels, surface failure dominates in air loading environment, whereas internal failure dominates in vacuum loading environment and presents longer fatigue life. It is considered that failure mode in vacuum loading environment is mainly affected by the critical grains, whereas that in air loading environment is mainly affected by the competition between the surface air acceleration effect and the critical grains. Fatigue life is mainly affected by the internal vacuum retarding effect and the surface air accelerating effect.},

The aim was to investigate phase transformations over a wide range of compositions, facilitating the designing of biomedical Ti alloys. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) investigations revealed that Nb-rich regions retained the β phase , surrounded by transition region consisting of the β and ω phases, while Nb-lean regions consisted of the α and β phases. The Nb concentration, above which formation of the ω phase occurs during cooling instead of the α phase, was determined to be 22 wt\%, an important parameter for the low-modulus alloy design. The paper validates the viability of using FAST to prepare heterogeneous Ti alloys permitting to study microstructure over a wide range of compositions. This technique could also be readily used as a high-throughput method for designing other alloy systems . The experimental results were supplemented by calculation of Gibbs energy curves and schematic phase diagrams, which allowed to explain a competition between α and ω formation depending on alloy composition .

The results showed that the NA of the Al-0.4 Mg-1.0Si alloy was suppressed by adding Sn. This suppression was ascribed to the suppression of the formation of clusters. The short NA time (less than 5 days) had a positive effect on the subsequent artificial aging (AA) in the Sn-added alloys, i.e., a fast AA-hardening rate was achieved. The positive effect of the NA on the AA in the Sn-added alloys increased as the amount of Sn increased, but decreased as the NA time increased. The AA was negatively affected by the NA when the NA time was increased to 14 days. The accelerated AA precipitation of the Sn-added alloys after a short NA time was responsible for the fast AA-hardening rate. This accelerated precipitation was related to the increased amount of retained quenched-in vacancies according to their NA resistivity curves and similarity of the chemical composition between the Sn-containing clusters and β&quot; phases.},

  abstract     = {Friction Stir Interlocking (FSI) has been applied for joining dissimilar materials with different physical, chemical and mechanical properties . The FSI process combines friction stir welding with mechanical interlocking where two dissimilar sheets are joined in a lap configuration using a third body interlock. In the present study, AZ31 magnesium alloy and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets with a thermoplastic matrix were lap joined through FSI with AZ31 interlocks. Microstructural characterization of the FSI joint showed that AZ31 magnesium sheet was mixed sufficiently with AZ31 interlocks, effectively joining CFRP to the AZ31 sheet. Lap shear tensile testing showed that the load capacity of FSI joints ranged from ~80–100 N/mm with fracture occurring within the CFRP around AZ31 interlocks. Finite element analysis was conducted to simulate the lap shear tensile testing for different FSI configurations. The simulation results are in good agreements with the experimental data and observations in terms of both load-displacement curve and CFRP fracture occurring path.},

The polymer jet via the electrohydrodynamic process has been used to direct-write ordered, 3D structures with the aspect-ratio (height/width) up to 25 for various patterns, such as rectangular grids and five-point stars.

A class of printed triangle-filled cellular structure composites was prepared to present the detail of the printing strategy. The effects of printing and structural parameters on the mechanical properties , as well as shape memory performance of printed CFRCs, were studied precisely, and thereafter, a Finite Element (FE) model was developed on the basis of the printing path to stimulate and analyze the tensile process. Experimental results showed that introducing only 3.8\% fiber content into the composite can significantly improve the tensile strength by more than 300\%. An increment of cell length was capable of strengthening tensile features compellingly due to changing orientation and alignment degree of fiber in the structure. By contrast, sizing the cell length and embedding further fiber have represented a reverse pattern against the composite&#39;s shape recovery ratio, which witnessed an adverse impact on shape-changing materials. A conclusion was given that the mechanical properties and shape memory effect of the 3D-printed continuous fiber-reinforced composite can be optimized by adjusting the geometric parameters and fiber content.},

Laminates with ply thicknesses of 0.3 mm and 0.03 mm comprising of CFRP and hybrid laminates were manufactured and characterized using tension, open hole tension and double lap bearing tests. A 25\% ply substitution was found to double the bearing load with extensive plastic deformation in the joint while maintaining high stress and maintaining constant cross-sectional thickness in the laminate. With a good agreement between the finite element predicted values and failure behaviour, the damage initiation and progression behaviour could be observed experimentally. We numerically captured (i) rapid failure of 0° plies in the thin ply CFRP hybrid and (ii) continuous delamination with significant plastic deformation for the thick ply CFRP hybrid. The numerical results significantly reduce future experimental work when designing hybrid laminates and could allow the laminate lay-up to be tailored for load cases. Both the experiments and numerical models underline the distinct size effects occurring with respect to the ply thicknesses when hybridising a very ductile metal with a brittle yet strong composite material.},

Three kinds of Hep@SF/PLCL nanofiber membranes containing different SF and heparin contents were produced by adjusting the spinning speed of a Hep@SF mixed solution. Compared to the other two nanofiber membranes, the 1.0Hep@SF/PLCL nanofiber membrane contained the most SF, resulting in suitable radial tensile property , optimal hydrophilicity , cytocompatibility and antithrombotic activity. Therefore, we then prepared a mono-layered artificial vascular scaffold using this design. Finally, orthotopic rabbit carotid artery transplantation was performed to evaluate remodeling effect in vivo. Three months after surgery, the 1.0Hep@SF/PLCL vascular scaffold exhibited satisfactory remodeling in vivo, resulting in a regenerated smooth muscle layer covered by a continuous endothelium.},

PP/COL I-pDA-Ca was electrospun from a collagen I-blended PLGA/PCL matrix and then modified by the chelation of Ca-ions via mussel-inspired polydopamine coating. PLGA/PCL, PLGA/PCL-polydopamine, PLGA/PCL-pDA chelated by Ca-ions were used as controls. Osteogenic effects of the scaffolds were examined using MC3T3-E1 cell culture. PP/COL I-pDA-Ca maintained 3D porous architecture with interconnected pores formed by randomly-oriented filamentous fibers and MC3T3-E1 cells cultured on it for 12 h or 24 h were more stretched and spread than those on the controls. PP/COL I-pDA-Ca significantly upregulated α10, α11 and β1 integrin expression after 48 h culture. ALP activity, OCN, OSX, BMP2 and RUNX2 expression of MC3T3-E1 cells cultured on PP/COL I-pDA-Ca scaffolds for 7 and 14 days were substantially enhanced when compared to controls ( p &lt; 0.05).

The large variations of cooling rate within the melt pool allow us to investigate the dependence of the selected microstructure on the concentration of the alloy and the solidification velocity. We find that the coupled zone, i.e. the temperature-dependent concentration interval within which the two-phase eutectic coupled growth takes place, drifts towards higher concentrations when the solidification velocity increases.

Previous research focused on the additive manufacturing of single-track thin-walled SX samples, while effective solutions to fabricate crack-free multi-track SX block samples are still limited. Directed energy deposition (DED) technique was used to fabricate multi-track block samples in this work. The effects of the overlapping ratio, scanning velocity, and laser power on the microstructure and cracking susceptibility were analyzed. The experimental results demonstrated that improper process parameters play significant roles in the formation of high-angle grain boundaries and large internal stress , both of which will increase the cracking susceptibility. Crack-free SX multi-track block was successfully fabricated after adjusting the process parameters. These findings provide a guide to reduce the cracking susceptibility by controlling the process parameters, which aids in fabrication of large-scale crack-free SX blocks through DED technique.},

First, a FE model has been made to predict and validate the residual stress field of the OSD due to welding. The validation of residual stresses is made comparing measured data at the surface of the OSD and over the thickness of the deck flange. The residual stresses are used to subsequently model for a crack propagation analysis based on extended finite element method (XFEM). The fatigue crack simulation including residual stress field shows good correlation compared to the experimental data, while the simulation without residual stress field shows less correlation. The effects of the residual stresses are relatively large as the tensile transversal residual stresses increase the crack propagation, while the tensile longitudinal residual stresses decrease the crack propagation rate. The optimal modelling of the component of residual stresses is investigated.},

This system was selected to illustrate reactions that may lead to severe and violent heat effect phenomena. Using idealized binary alloys , severe oxidation of magnesium- and lithium-rich aluminum alloy samples were shown to occur near 500 °C, a temperature range dangerously close to the operating temperature of solution heat treatment furnaces in manufacturing processes of heat treatable aluminum alloy sheets used in the aerospace industry. Commercial aluminum alloys AW257, 2198, 2024, and 1050 were also assessed with the same tools.

The structural integrity, microstructural evolution , compressive properties and failure mechanism of as-fabricated (AF) and vacuum annealing treated (VAT) samples were studied through both experiments and numerical modeling. The X-ray computed tomography analysis revealed that vacuum annealing had an insignificant effect on internal pore elimination and porosity reduction. For both the AF and VAT samples, larger pores exhibited more irregular shape than smaller pores. The microstructural analysis suggested that vacuum annealing was able to transform acicular α/α` martensites into uniformly distributed lamellar α + β phases and also to cause the formation of nano-particle precipitation and dislocation. The compressive test indicted that the lattice structure with confined top and bottom had much better compressive properties than those without. Also, vacuum annealing significantly improved the compressive strength by 26\% due to the synergistic effect of residual stress relief, nano-particle precipitation and dislocation strengthening. The ductility of the VAT sample was also improved as compared to the AF sample, which was mainly attributed to the formation of α + β phases.},

  abstract     = {A novel superimposed sine-wave (SSW) structure was designed and fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) in this work. The energy absorption performance , deformation modes , and fracture mechanism of heat-treated SSW components under compression were studied. The formability was analyzed and the results showed that the SLM fabricated SSW components possessed nearly dense microstructure and smooth surface morphology . The numerical simulation model was established to show the stress distribution and deformation mechanism during compression, and the fracture morphologies of SSW components were investigated. Experimental results indicated that the SSW components exhibited a maximum crush force efficiency ( CFE ) of 73.06\%, which was higher than most reported energy absorption structures. As the height of sinusoid 1 ( H 1 ) increased, the energy absorption ( EA ) and specific energy absorption ( SEA ) gradually increased to 37.73 J and 8.45 J/g, respectively. Simulation results revealed that the secondary trough had a large deformation during the compression process , which greatly enhanced the load uniformity of the structure. Fracture mode of SSW components was ductile fracture due to the post heat treatment. The SSW structures had the potential to be used in aerospace, protective armor, and automotive industries.},

Uniaxial tensile tests were conducted on specimens built using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technique for two different powder layer thicknesses. The specimens were built to have the lowest possible porosity, and tensile tests showed two stages of strain hardening. In stage I, the dislocation density increased, leading to a positive strain hardening rate . A negative strain hardening rate due to the necking effect was then followed in stage II. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses revealed a phase transformation through the deformation. Various analyses via electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) technique was then conducted with large scans over three different zones representing undeformed, deformed, and severely deformed close to the fracture area. The pole figures and orientation distribution functions (ODF) revealed a texture evolving through the deformation process in agreement with the kernel average misorientation (KAM) and grain boundary maps. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to detect the inclusions and segregated alloying elements adjacent to the fractured surfaces. Results indicated that the deformation led to diminishing the austenite (γ) phase, while the transformed austenite sourced the high dislocation density area at cell boundaries.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the occurrence of hot cracking during solidification and vaporization of solute elements during melting, beam-based additive manufacturing has encountered serious problems in printing high-strength, nonweldable Al alloys . After aging, the mechanical properties of these alloys are often substantially inferior to their wrought alloy counterparts. Here, a deformation-based additive process is used for printing high-strength 7075 Al alloy (i.e., AA7075), wherein frictional heating is leveraged to enable rapid plastic deformation . The as-printed material consists of a refined, equiaxed microstructure and shows no surface or interface porosity. After proper solution treatment and aging, the yield strength , ultimate tensile strength , and elongation of the printed AA7075 are measured as 477 MPa, 541 MPa, and 8.2\%, respectively. These values are a notable improvement from those published for beam-based additive manufacturing and are comparable to the typical properties of wrought alloy AA7075. With a comparison to the feed material, these values account for 95\% of the yield strength, 94\% of the ultimate tensile strength, and 78\% of the elongation of the wrought AA7075-T6 with the exact same composition. Additional printing and testing show that wrought-like mechanical properties can be consistently achieved using this approach without adding new elements or nanoparticles .},

Topology optimization is an effective tool for designing lightweight structures and truss-based designs. Graphic statics is also a powerful platform for truss-based designs and, more importantly, manipulation of such designs to satisfy pre-defined structural/load constraints. This work proposes coupling topology optimization and graphic statics in a sequential framework to take advantage of both methods in generating truss-based designs and offering a way to manipulate such structures without breaking the global equilibrium state and reducing truss forces. After post-processing and structural manipulation, results have shown structures with a uniform load distribution on all members. Optimized structures show an allowable load distribution manipulation and a significant reduction in member loads through form/force algorithms, presenting results with up to 4 and 100 times reduced maximum loads under the same state of global equilibrium. The work is essential in producing structures that avoid critical loads while having arbitrary load/boundary conditions that cannot be solved using existing methods.},

The microstructure and superconducting properties of the NbTi-Y 2 O 3 have been characterised after each processing step. After 40 h of ball milling , the Y 2 O 3 particles are dissolved into the nanostructured NbTi matrix formed by mechanical alloying of Nb and Ti. On annealing at temperatures above 800 °C the dissolved Y and O react with Ti from the matrix, and fine Y 2 Ti 2 O 7 particles (&lt;5 nm) are precipitated. These NbTi-Y 2 Ti 2 O 7 composites showed excellent superconducting performance, with J C of 5.2 kAmm −2 at 4.2 K, 5 T, considerably higher than Y 2 O 3 -free bulks manufactured using the same process and NbTi wires manufactured using the conventional thermomechanical process.

Isosorbide (ISB)-based amorphous poly(arylene ether sulfone)s (PAESs) derived from biomass feedstocks instead of harmful aromatic petrochemicals , such as bisphenol-A (BPA), are promising novel materials . To expand the range of eco-friendly products, ISB-PAES microfibers (ISU) along with BPA-PAES-based microfibers (PSU) have been fabricated through dry-jet wet spinning. ISU is mechanically 2.3 times stronger (247 MPa) than PSU (106 MPa), which may be ascribed to the compact and homogeneous structure of ISU compared to the porous structure of PSU. This structural superiority is due to the polar ISB moiety, which improves the phase stability of the ISU spinning dope in water (a role of the coagulant). For potential wig applications, the diameter, strength , and moduli of ISU are well matched to those of human hair. In addition, ISU is easily colored and endures high temperatures better than current wig filaments. It survives at high temperatures without breaking down during hair iron treatment (200 °C).},

In this study, we explore the effect of the electrospinning parameters — namely polymer concentration , voltage, tip-to-collector distance and flow rate — and salt addition on the diameter, morphology, and spinnability of electrospun PI nanofibers . Three different polyimides of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-PIs) with high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) ranging from 270 to 506 m 2 g −1 , and two microporous polyimides, were synthesized through the polycondensation of 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride (6FDA) and aromatic diamines. The addition of tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB) salt considerably increased the conductivity of all the PI solutions, significantly improved spinability, and resulted in thinner fibers. We also used molecular dynamic simulations to investigate the macromolecular mechanism of improved spinnability and fiber morphology in the presence of an ammonium salt. The small droplets detached from the parent droplet, followed by the rapid evaporation of the ions through the hydration effect, which facilitated the electrospinning. The resulting uniform nanofibers have great potential in environmental applications due to the presence of microporosity and hydrophobic pendant trifluoromethyl groups, which enhance the sorption performance of the fibers for hydrophobic species.},

A comprehensive multiscale model was developed to predict the submicron scale polymer flow, using a numerical model to analyze the polymer behavior in the mold macro cavity and determine the boundary conditions for the filling of the surface structures. The replication of the mold topography was modeled considering topographical parameters, polymer rheology and thermal behavior, and the mold surface energy, which was modified by depositing an atomic layer of alumina on the steel surface structures. The modeling approach was validated against injection molding experiments, in which the mold temperature was varied due to its well-known influence on replication. The sensitivity to polymer selection, mold surface properties, and mold temperature, was captured. A maximum error of 8\% showed the accuracy of the multi-scale model.},

Scanning electron microscopy measurements show an increase in grain size, decrease in texture, and the formation of twins in the RC compared to the as-built (AB) and direct-age (DA) hardened conditions. Transmission electron microscopy measurements of the RC condition revealed the formation of nano-precipitates in the gamma matrix. As a result, the compressive stress-strain behavior showed an increase in the yield strength of the RC specimens compared to the AB condition in the quasi-static and high-strain rate regimes despite having significantly larger grain sizes. Post-mortem in-plane ellipticity measurements show a statistically significant decrease in the deformation anisotropy of the RC specimens compared to the AB and DA conditions. Overall, the solutionizing RC heat-treatment, when compared to the AB condition, resulted in an increase in yield strength and decrease in deformation anisotropy, two desirable outcomes necessary to continue to provide path-ways to transitioning L-PBF parts from the research laboratory setting to commercial implementation.},

The approach integrates alloy theory for chemical and magnetic disorders with accessible experimental data for the equilibrium volume and ferromagnetic phase transition, and is adopted to predict the temperature-dependent elastic parameters of the body-centered cubic phase of three reduced activation steels, CLAM/CLF-1, F82H, EUROFER97, considered as high-temperature material in power reactors. The predictions are assessed based on available experimental data for a reduced activation steel and both experimental and theoretical data for pure Fe. Alloying effects on the elastic constants relative to pure Fe are found to differ in the magnetically ordered and disordered phases. Contributions due to loss of long-range magnetic order, volume expansion, and entropy are important in determining the temperature dependence of the elastic parameters in all investigated materials. A previously reported, peculiar magneto-volume phenomenon on the equation of state in pure Fe is gradually removed by alloying and magnetic disordering, which requires particular attention when describing the thermo-chemical effects derived from the equation of state in Fe-rich solid solutions.},

  abstract     = {A magnetoactive elastomer (MAE) consisting of single-domain La 0.6 Ag 0.2 Mn 1.2 O 3 nanoparticles with a Curie temperature close to room temperature ( T C = 308 K) in a silicone matrix has been prepared and comprehensively studied. It has been found that MAE particles are magnetized superparamagnetically with a low coercivity below 10 Oe at room temperature and above. The influence of magnetic anisotropy on the appearance of torque is justified. A coupling between magnetization and magnetoelasticity has also been established. The mechanisms of the appearance of magnetoelasticity, including the effect of MAE rearrangement and MAE compression by magnetized particles, have been revealed. It has been found that the magnetoelastic properties of MAE have critical features near T C . The magnetoelastic properties of MAE disappear at T &gt; T C and are restored at T &lt; T C . This makes it possible to use MAE at room temperature as a smart material for devices with self-regulating magnetoelastic properties.},

Under the experiment conditions, TA2/1060, 1060/5083, TA2/5083 interface welding energy are respectively 547.17 MJ, 1178.86 MJ and 1455.5 MJ.The use of 1060 interlayer improves energy utilization efficiency by 14\%. Numerical simulations and experiments showed that there was a continuous melting zone and a non-welded zone at the interface without interlayer. After the interlayer was used, the TA2/1060 interface was flat and the 1060/5083 interface showed a wave. There was no brittle intermetallic compound at the titanium‑aluminum composite interface. The use of interlayer reduces the welding energy of a single interface, and the constructed theoretical equation showed that the interface energy can be accurately designed by adjusting parameters of explosives, flyer plates, interlayers and base plates . The use of pure aluminum interlayer is an effective means to improve titanium‑aluminum explosive welding conditions},

Founded by the Romans in the 1st century B.C., this archaeological area represents one of the greatest evidences of Roman architecture and it includes ancient ruins whose structures range from maritime villas and imperial buildings. Several diagnostic tests were carried out in order to characterize the archaeological materials, their structure and properties, as well as the alteration and degradation products . Degradation forms in seawater imply not only a variation in the physico-mechanical and chemical properties of the material but also an aesthetic damage, due to superficial deposits, which can lead to the illegibility of the artefacts. In this context, it is crucial to determine to what extent these decay factors, mainly attributable to biological growth, could affect the durability of pottery and what are the effects of cleaning procedures. The work offers further elements to obtain new insights into the underwater cultural heritage field and in the function of ceramic matter, especially related to several applications in technology and in the adoption of strategies for suitable conservation procedures.},

Scaffolds with adjustable Poisson&#39;s ratio are more suitable in certain biological applications for mimicking the behavior of native tissue mechanics . However, it is still a challenging issue to tune the Poisson&#39;s ratio. In order to resolve this problem, a new method is proposed in the present study to design and fabricate tunable auxetic scaffolds through altering the printing configurations in the MEW. Patterns with thick fibers are designed using specific geometries and then these patterns are utilized to tune the Poisson&#39;s ratio based on the intended deformation mechanism . Moreover, the electrospun thin fibers are used to fill the unit cell of auxetic lattice structures for promoting the cell growth. Investigating the mechanical characteristics of the fabricated scaffolds demonstrates that the Poisson&#39;s ratio of the scaffold can be effectively tuned. Furthermore, cell sense and response to the fabricated scaffolds are studied. Obtained results indicate that the proposed approach can potentially be applied in a wide variety of biomedical applications .},

It is found that the addition of 0.2 wt\% Ti 3 C 2 T x leads to increased tensile strength and flexural strength by 51\% and 32\%, respectively. However, higher filler content of Ti 3 C 2 T x causes defects due to agglomeration, which decreases the mechanical properties of the composites. The addition of Ti 3 C 2 T x to the epoxy improves the storage modulus because of the reduction in the crosslinking density in the epoxy matrix . Moreover, the glass transition temperatures also decline monotonically with increasing MXene content. Moreover, Ti 3 C 2 T x is found to enhance the thermal and electrical conductivities of the epoxy composites , which arouses more enthusiasm for applications in coatings, supercapacitor packaging, 3D printing , and fabrication of multifunctional devices.},

It is demonstrated that the deformation behavior includes a near linear hardening stage, a discontinuous yielding stage, a hardening stage and a final softening stage. For the near linear hardening stage, the α precipitates are formed on the grain boundaries (α GB ). The hardening behavior of the alloy in this stage balanced by boundary hardening through the formation of α GB . For the discontinuous yielding stage, the softening of deformation behavior is originated from the fragmentation of the α GB and the generation and movement of mobile dislocation . For the hardening stage follow the discontinuous yielding, the massive β to α phase transformation were occurred and mainly contributed to the hardening behavior. For the final softening behavior stage, three activities: the formation of deformation bands, the spheroidization of α phase and the dislocation slips contribute to the softening behavior.

A long-term durability validation of a flexible cellulose nanofiber over a period of 10 years exposure under ambient condition validated their life-span over a long period of operating condition. Arresting quinoid oxidative reactions pathways and thermal degradation of lignin or lignin-less cellulose are demonstrated to be two fundamental routes to enhance thermal processing of cellulose nanofiber substrates and to achieve long service life of energy devices made from them. One of the main highlights of this work is the first time validation of a long operating service life for a light-emitting device made from a cellulose nanofibers substrate, while continuously illuminating the fabricated prototype under ambient condition for an equivalent of 10 years.

Locations of sensor areas were customized to form a whole piece of knitted garment popular for today&#39;s applications in elastic tight-fitting activewear. The sensor provides electrical resistance data as a wearable sensing device for detecting body motions. A new method of using a three-dimensional curved surface to evaluate the sensing performance of the knitted strain sensor was proposed. Compared with the method of two-dimensional test, the three-dimensional test method was closer to the actual human sensing situation when the knitted sensor is worn. The strain sensing range of the three-dimensional curved surface was 120\%, twice the sensing range of the two-dimensional surface.

Enhanced breakdown field and discharged energy density of 550 kV/mm and 5.1 J/cm 3 with the efficiency of about 70\% were achieved, while keeping a high thermal stability (500 kV/mm and 3.9 J/cm 3 at 100 °C).

One such inspiring development in nanomaterials is the design of the nanocomposite materials for multifunctional purposes from energy storage to biomedical applications . Magnetic hydroxyapatite [MHAp] nanoparticles have achieved considerable attention during the last two decades and possess exceptional prospects in the field of nanomedicine with improved multi-therapeutic approaches. The progress from controlled fabrication to advanced applications of MHAp nanocomposites is still in its infancy and few efforts have been devoted to this cause. The hybrid structure of MHAp is anticipated to be an auspicious platform for biomedical applications particularly in cancer theranostics because of good stability and biocompatibility. In this review, recent exciting features in the development of MHAp nanocomposite and promising applications in controlled drug/gene delivery and magnetic hyperthermia treatment, tissue engineering and bone regeneration, antimicrobial activity, heavy metals and toxic dyes removal, fire retardant behaviour, biosensors and the development of contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging are highlighted and explained in detail. In addition, this study provides a comprehensive assessment of the synthesis of MHAp nanocomposites by various preparation methods, the influence of reaction parameters on the morphology and structure-property relationships based on recent studies. Finally, novel perceptions are examined regarding the ability of MHAp nanoparticles to improve hybrid nanocarriers with homogeneous structure to enhance multifunctional biomedical applications.},

The relationship between the energy harvesting ability and excitation methods , the input voltage value, and frequency are obtained through analyses.

  abstract     = {Ti-17 is exposed to microstructural modifications during thermomechanical treatment . In this work, we focus on the characterisation, analysis and modelling of the modifications during plastic deformation in the one phase and two phases domain. Hot compression tests are carried out between 810 °C and 970 °C and at 0.001 s −1 to 10 s −1 up to 0.85 strain. Metallographic observations and quantifications are done using SEM-EBSD. A physically-based model is developed to describe the deformation mechanisms : dynamic recovery, followed by continuous dynamic recrystallisation , and dynamic globularization of the α-phase. Flow stresses, dislocation densities , and sizes of both phases are predicted as a function of strain rate and temperature for different starting microstructures. The thickness and aspect ratio of the α-phase is predicted as well as the globularization fraction. The flow softening in the α + β domain is attributed to a change in the load transfer mechanism between α and β-phases from isostrain to isostress due to the dynamic globularization of the α-phase. High strain rates promote the formation of finer subgrains of β and less globularization of α-phase. Moreover, cDRX starts at larger strains in the β-domain and is more advanced already at moderate strains for the deformation in the α + β domain.},

Appropriate solvents for precipitation have been identified by a screening approach based on solubility parameters. Feasible system compositions and solution and cloud point temperatures were determined. For the most promising solvent, cyclopentanone, a parameter study on the influence of stirring conditions during precipitation was performed. The obtained products were characterized with respect to their particle size distribution , particle shape, phase morphology, thermal properties and melt viscosity . Under optimized process conditions, PBT particles of high degree of crystallinity with narrow size distribution and a mean diameter of 36 μm were obtained; flowability was improved by dry coating. The initial PBF-LB/P processability was assessed by building single layers in a parameter study using a Formiga P110 machine. Dense single layers were obtained at laser power P L = 11.5 W, scanning speed v S = 4000 mm/s, hatch distance h S = 0.24 mm and layer thickness d S = 0.1 mm. Best to the authors&#39; knowledge, this is the first study in the open literature reporting on a PBT feedstock material obtained by liquid-liquid phase separation and crystallization.},

Special attention is paid to the description of non-equilibrium structures and compositional fields resulting from the ultrafast cooling of the LPBF process. Observations reveal the existence of a glass state in eutectic areas, wherein short-range ordering of the diamond-Si structure is observed. The apparent very fast solidification of eutectic regions is found to involve a local strain in adjacent Al cells, which extends up to 100 nm on average. In the supersaturated aluminium solid solution retained by the LPBF process, two populations of clusters are identified, for which the potential role of the selection of hardening phases is discussed. It is proposed that the microstructure of former melt pools outside heat-affected areas is described by the repetition of a periodic microstructural pattern consisting of eutectic regions /strain-hardened Al-crystals /strain-free Al-crystals with a high density of solute-rich clusters.},

In this paper, a heavy atom free tri-component semiconducting polymer PTVT has been designed and synthesized by a Stille coupling reaction. PTVT has a high singlet oxygen quantum yield ( 1 O 2 QY) of 42.2\% in DCM remains high 1 O 2 generation ability for the DSPE-PEG coated PTVT nanoparticles (NPs) obtained by a nanoprecipitation approach. Owing to the PDT and PTT synergistic therapy (photothermal conversion efficiency ~52.6\%), PTVT NPs show a low half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 5.9 μg/mL towards human lung cancer cells (A549) with laser irradiation . And simultaneously the dark toxicity of such NPs is almost negligible even at high concentrations. Furthermore, in vivo study demonstrates that the NPs are able to inhibit tumor proliferation with laser irradiation, compared with the control and dark group, suggesting the low dark toxicity and high phototoxicity of such NPs. The H&amp;E stained pictures of the normal tissues indicate the biosafety of PTVT NPs in that no obvious damage of heart, liver, lung, kidney and spleen was observed.

  abstract     = {Identifying phase information of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) can be helpful as it provides useful information such as anticipated mechanical properties . Recently, machine learning methods are attracting interest to predict phases of HEAs, which could reduce the effort for designing new HEAs. As research direction is in its infancy, there is still plenty of room to develop machine learning models to improve the prediction accuracy and further guide the design of HEAs. In this work, we employ deep learning-based methods regarding optimization, generation, and explanation, for enhancing the performance and identifying key design parameters for phase prediction of HEAs. We first establish regularized deep neural networks for predicting HEA phases and optimize hyper-parameters concerning model architecture, training, and regularization . To overcome data shortage of HEAs, we then focus on developing conditional generative adversarial network for generating additional HEA samples. We observe the augmentation from our generative model significantly improves model performance, achieving prediction accuracy of 93.17\%. Lastly, we concentrate on understanding contributions of design parameters to identifying solid solution (SS) phase as an example. Our work delivers guidance not only for developing a reliable deep learning-based phase prediction model, but for explaining significant design parameters to assist design of novel HEAs.},

Both growth and crystal orientations were consistent with those of the grains in the melt pool of the former layer. Enrichment of elements Nb and Ti occurred among the dendrites in these areas, leading to the formation of Laves phases. The crescent areas underwent great deformation together with the melt pools during tensile testing , which showed that they were of great plasticity and no gaps or cracks were found around these areas. In addition, the bright crescent areas possessed higher hardness than that of the surrounding regions. Furthermore, the simulated temperature field results showed that the incomplete re-melting of the formed dendrites and a large number of nucleated dendrites among them are the main reasons for the formation of the bright crescent areas.},

A combination method of DIC and AE technique is proposed to measure the fracture toughness J IC of polyethylene pipe material. DIC technique is used to obtain the deformation on specimen surface to calculate J-integral according to the rigorous definition, and AE technique is used to monitor the internal damage and capture the moment of crack initiation synchronously.

However, to achieve such large elastic strains in macro-forms suitable for applications has been a challenge. This paper reports an innovative approach to overcome this challenge by using a martensitic transforming substrate to induce ultra-large elastic lattice strains in metallic thin films deposited on it, as demonstrated in a Nb film-on-NiTi substrate system. This design is based on a novel concept of “lattice strain matching” between the uniform elastic lattice strain of the Nb film and the uniform crystallographic lattice strain of the martensitic transformation of the NiTi substrate. By this principle, the Nb film was able to exhibit reversible elastic lattice strains between −3.66\% in compression and+3.74\% in tension, for a total elastic strain span of +7.40\% (the maximum in one loading deformation) by mechanical deformation of the substrate. These elastic lattice strains are 10–20 times of what are possible for bulk Nb or metallic thin films on conventional substrates. The findings of this work offer a unique opportunity to use ultra-large elastic strains as a means to engineer and improve functional properties of thin film materials.},

The results show that the extra stress can accelerate the uniform precipitation of δ phase, and increase the dislocation substructures during stress aging treatment. But, in the stress-free aging process, δ phases easily concentrate around grain boundaries and randomly distribute within grains. During the stress aging, with the increase of extra stress or aging time, δ phase regularly and densely precipitates within grains, because the lattice distortion is affected by the extra stress. In addition, the basket-weave δ phases densely precipitate and mutually intersect to form enclosure spaces. The limited dislocations in the enclosure spaces can enhance the formation of subgrains and make the uniform nucleation of dynamic recrystallization grains. Meanwhile, the basket-weave δ phases caused by the extra stress significantly refine the deformed grains, and the uniform microstructures are obtained.},

Fabricated by 3D printing technology, a two-way spiral-shaped metamaterial and its two-dimensional array are designed in the study, which is capable to realize sound energy enhancement. Due to the impedance matching design, the meta-structure shows almost opposite transmission behaviors in orthogonal directions. The sound wave compression and resonance effects come from the high-refractive-index medium, leading to enlarged acoustic signals inside the waveguide . For the array with an inside point sound source, an energy enhancement phenomenon occurs in the wave emission area outside the structure. Through experimental results and numerical simulations, it is revealed that the sound intensity of the emission wave can be increased more than fifteen-fold compared with the insulation condition in the range of 4.8–5.8 kHz, when the anisotropic metamaterial array is applied. The flexibility of the anisotropic meta-structure and corresponding array designs enables versatile applications demanding excellent sound signal and broadband performance.},

  abstract     = {Lath martensite transformation in low carbon steel relates to the discontinuity of the transformation rate, which exhibits a series of martensite transformation rate maxima (peaks), especially in low cooling rates. In the present work, we put an emphasis on the influence of annealing twins in parent austenite grains (PAGs) and cooling rates on the discontinuity of lath martensite transformation rate in a low carbon reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steel. Lath martensite microstructure is hierarchical and the lath martensite transformation rate peaks are hierarchical during the cooling process. If the cooling rate was not high enough, the lath martensite transformation rate peaks will be divided into two groups by annealing twins in parent austenite. These transformation rate peaks in the first group were mainly caused by lath martensite transformation in the non–twin zones in the PAGs. Then, the second group mainly consisted of a single transformation rate peak, which was primarily caused by the martensite transformation in the twin zones in the PAGs. In the present work, a new “localized stress field” theory is proposed and successfully used for interpreting the classification mechanism of lath martensite transformation rate peaks and the evolution of these peaks with changing cooling rate.},

  abstract     = {To enhance the interfacial and mechanical properties of magnesium alloy based fiber-metal laminates , a novel of AZ31B magnesium alloy-based hybrid fiber metal laminates (Mg-FMLs) bonded with Mg-Zn-Al eutectic alloy solder based on carbon fiber woven/polymer (epoxy resin) prepregs (CFRP) and AZ31B alloy sheets were prepared by using ultrasonic vibration assisted hot pressing technology. Interlaminar performance of the hybrid composite laminates was measured using double cantilever beam (DCB) and three-point end notched flexure (3ENF) tests. The interface morphologies and tensile behavior of the Mg-FMLs were evaluated. Results show that metallurgically-bonded interfaces have been formed in the Mg alloy-based hybrid FMLs. The present Mg-FMLs bonded with Mg alloy solder exhibit higher interlaminar and tensile performance than traditional Mg-FMLs bonded with epoxy resin. The enhanced tensile properties of the present Mg-FMLs can be attributed to the synergistic effect from the Mg alloy sheet and CFRP layer because of high interlaminar properties. For the same reason, the tensile fracture of the novel Mg-FMLs exhibits matrix and CFRP dominated mixed-mode failure.},

The unbaked joints exhibited button pullout fracture mode, whereas the baked joints were severely weakened and demonstrated an interfacial fracture mode which is attributed to the baking process inducing thermal stress at the dissimilar material interface which cracked the semi-continuous oxide film inclusions at the edge of the solidified aluminum nugget to form a more continuous defect layer across the diameter of the aluminum nugget. These defects act as low energy crack paths under applied loads and reduce joint strength by promoting undesirable interfacial fracture in baked welds.},

Localization of TU at the resin-filler interface via silanization procedures may lead to more substantial stress reduction and clinical property enhancements. The objective of this study was to evaluate composite properties as a function of TU-functionalized filler concentration. TU oligomers were synthesized using click-chemistry techniques and subsequently silanized to barium glass filler. Resin-based composites were formulated using varying ratios of TU-functionalized filler and conventional methacrylate-silanized barium filler. Material property testing included thermogravimetric analysis , real-time polymerization kinetics and depth of cure, polymerization stress, stress relaxation and fracture toughness. Clinical property testing included water sorption/solubility, composite paste viscosity, and gloss and surface roughness measured before and after subjecting the samples to 6 h of continuous tooth brushing in a custom-built apparatus using a toothpaste/water mixture. Increasing TU-filler in the composite resulted in as much as a 78\% reduction in stress, coupled with an increase in fracture toughness. Conversion was similar for all groups. After simulated tooth brushing, gloss reduction was lower for TU-containing composites and surface roughness was less than or equal to the control.},

Traditional methods of alloy design, such as “trial and error” experiments, are costly and time-consuming, limiting the discovery of Cu alloys. Machine learning (ML)-based technology facilitates a better understanding on inter-relationships within massive experimental datasets, and shortens the development cycle of new alloy systems . Herein, we propose a method of material design based on ML to discover high-performance Cu alloys. The ML models are trained from “discarded” experimental data that show undesirable hardness and/or electrical conductivity. We constructed effective Gaussian process regression-based models successfully from limited training data by engaging additional features. The predicted Cu alloys were experimentally synthesized and characterized, exhibiting superior hardness or electrical conductivity with respect to original training data. The increase of hardness is due to precipitation of second-phase Co-Ti and Fe-Ti compounds during aging, while the rise of electrical conductivity is caused by a purification effect of the precipitates on Cu matrix. The impact of physical features on ML models was further evaluated by a genetic algorithm . Our findings suggest that ML holds great potential for developing high-performance Cu alloys.},

The new setup promoted the formation of stable annular pre-Taylor cones with high curvature. The finite element analysis indicated that the mushroom-spinneret avoided the appearance of competitive electric field and concentrated the surface charge of the solution on the pre-Taylor cones. Consequently, the spinneret exhibited an outstanding production capacity of 13.7 g/h and all electrospun membranes showed superior narrow diameter distributions (CV ~ 10\%).

  abstract     = {Inducing residual stress in metallic glasses (MGs) is recognized to be beneficial for plasticity but the mechanisms on how it affects shear band nucleation, propagation and multiplication remain poorly understood. With the aid of experimental and computational approaches, we address this issue by comparatively studying the deformation behavior of two types of MG samples, which were individually prepared by surface imprinting and photo-chemical etching but having similar surface patterns. Results showed that the imprinted MGs exhibit simultaneously enhanced plasticity and compressive strength , while the etched ones show limited plasticity improvement and reduced strength. The enhanced mechanical properties of the imprinted MGs are attributed to the compressive residual stresses generated near the surfaces, rather than the resultant geometrical pits. Finite element analysis revealed that the residual stress induces obvious stress gradient and inhomogeneous plastic deformation , which facilitate heterogeneous nucleation of multiple shear bands near the surfaces. Complementary atomistic simulations further revealed that the stress gradient resulting from the residual stress slows down the shear banding dynamics and causes deflection and branching, which consequently promotes shear band multiplication during propagation. This work uncovers the interactions between the residual stresses and shear bands, which are useful for processing MGs with desirable mechanical properties.},

It was followed by mapping the compressive creep behavior via nanoindentation along the composition arrays within the same Mg Ga couple sample. The compressive creep resistance of Mg Ga hcp alloys increased with the Ga content , and this enhancement was similar to the one found in Mg Zn alloys and superior to the one reported in Mg Al alloys though Al is a slower impurity diffuser in hcp-Mg than Zn and Ga.

This work presents a method for assessment of fiber-matrix interface strength in carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs). The method uses in-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging while pushing individual fibers out of 20–30 μm thick membranes. Femtosecond laser machining has been utilized to address standing challenges associated with manufacturing high-quality fiber push-out specimens. To ensure that the specimen preparation method used did not affect the properties of the composite, a thorough study has been conducted using benchmark specimens. The benchmark specimens are prepared using a conventional lapping/polishing process. Results for two CFRPs compare fiber-matrix interface shear strength generated using free-standing samples (conventional lapping/polishing preparation) and femtosecond laser-machined specimens. Both specimen types exhibit similar strength. However, load-displacement response of the free-standing samples is overly compliant, representing specimen response rather than fiber-matrix interface material behavior . The excessive compliance is caused by inherent imperfections in the contact of the sample and the test fixture . The femtosecond laser-machined samples are free of such imperfections. Finite element analysis has been accomplished to better understand the load-displacement response.},

Finite element simulation further verifies the improvement of the displacement and electrical breakdown strength of the composites. This high performance indicates that both of the centrosymmetric lattice nanodomains of NiMOF and the electrons introduced by Ag nanoparticle would help induce greater polarization in the nanocomposite. Furthermore, the Coulomb blockade effect exerted by the Ag nanoparticle with an appropriate particle size and a fractional concentration can significantly improve the electrical breakdown strength.

This article reports a study on the nanoindentation of PMMA thin films via instrumented indentation testing and numerical simulation to determine its constitutive behavior. It is found that both the loading curve and the unloading curve at any depth can be generated from one indentation depth for the indentation tests of PMMA thin films with Berkovich indenter. By coupling experimental investigation and finite element simulation, we investigated the possibility of applying the Oyen-Cook constitutive equation to nonlinear viscous-elastic-plastic PMMA thin films. The results of finite element analysis show that the time-dependent elastic-plastic deformation of the unloading curves becomes more conspicuous when the quadratic viscosity term of the Oyen-Cook constitutive equation is decreased. Finite element simulations using the Oyen-Cook constitutive model reproduce the experimentally-measured indentation load-displacement curves with reasonable accuracy.},

The fine-grained partially recrystallized microstructure in the stir zone gave rise to a high tensile yield strength of 920 MPa with an elongation of 37\%. By microstructural observation, the excellent mechanical properties of the stir zone material were attributed to the partially recrystallized heterogeneous structure, with which the synergetic strengthening improved the strength of the HEA with considerably less trade-off in its ductility. This unique phenomenon was unprecedented in any other friction-stir welded conventional alloys and was credited to the low stacking-fault energy and the high grain growth activation energy of the HEA. This work suggests that FSW can not only produce good HEA welds but serve as a special processing technique to enhance mechanical properties of HEAs.},

  abstract     = {In order to improve ductility and toughness, ductile Ti layer was introduced into TiB reinforced Ti-6.58Al-1.76Zr-0.89Mo-1.04V (TiB/TA15) composite and constructed a laminated structure . The bending ductility and toughness of the as-fabricated laminated composites were tripled compared with the TiB/TA15 composite. Elements diffusion between adjacent layers during sintering process strengthened the ductile Ti layer, and provided extra back stress strengthening effect . Crack blunting and crack deflection by the ductile Ti layer also contributed to the property enhancement. The laminated composite exhibited an interface bonding strength of 870 MPa. As a result, no interface delamination was observed, which ensured that the ductility of the introduced Ti layers were fully tapped. Increasing the TiB/TA15 layer thickness enhanced the bending strength but deteriorated the ductility and toughness. In addition, sandwich structured composites were also prepared, and the stacking sequence exhibited noticeable effect on the bending behaviors of these composites. This impact was mainly attributed to the altering of fracture sequence of layers in the specimen. For sandwich structured composites, the change of layer thickness ratio and stacking sequence resulted in various profiles of bending curves},

  abstract     = {A major concern with concrete durability is the penetration of ions that cause deterioration. One concern about alternative cementitious materials (ACMs) is the lack of information regarding their long-term resistance to ion penetration . This study compares the changes for the permeable porosity, apparent diffusion coefficient , surface concentration, and depth of penetration for three different ACMs and Portland cement , over one year. The work shows that the decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient for the mixtures with calcium sulfoaluminate cement, alkali-activated, and ordinary Portland cement after one year was equal to 66\%, 93\%, and 48\%, respectively. The diffusion coefficient for the calcium sulfoaluminate sample deteriorated over time. This is likely caused by the conversion of the hydration products . The work also shows that the permeable porosity is not a good indicator of the apparent diffusion coefficient for these materials. Finally, the binding capacity (the ratio of free ions to total ions) is similar for the Portland cement, calcium aluminate cement, and calcium sulfoaluminate cement and the alkali-activated material showed no binding capacity.},

This study comprehensively investigates the pretreatment of zincating and anodizing on 6061 aluminum alloy, and systematically discusses their influence on the electrodeposited Ni-P coatings. The crystal structure and elemental composition were investigated for interlayers and Ni-P coatings subsequently, while morphologies of the coating surface and cross-section were also determined. The results revealed similar phase composition for differently pretreated Ni-P coatings, while distinct nodule featured morphology was observed for anodized Ni-P coating. It was found that anodized Ni-P coatings had the best performance due to its superior coating adhesion, wear-resistance, and corrosion resistance . In contrast, severe wear damage was occurred to zincated Ni-P coatings due to its inferior microstructure and weak zinc interlayer. Lastly, the influence of anodizing pretreatment on the coating microstructure is discussed, and a model is proposed for Ni-P electrodeposition employing anodizing pretreatment.},

However, the complexity of hydrogel design, and the high cost and safety hazards of immunostimulating adjuvants have prevented the widespread applications of hydrogel vaccine. In this study, we developed a spontaneously formed and self-adjuvanted hydrogel (SSH) which had both adjuvant potential and the ability to sustained release antigen in situ. Unlike conventional hydrogel vaccine, our SSH was formed without requirement of radiant light sources or any crosslinking initiators. The adjuvant potency of hydrogel was evaluated and results confirmed that hydrogel promoted antigen uptake by dendritic cells (DCs) and induced DCs maturation. Moreover, SSH loaded with ovalbumin increased the accumulation of antigens in lymph nodes. Finally, subcutaneous administration of SSH-based vaccine increased antigen-specific IgG production by 12.5-fold compared with the clinically used aluminum , and delayed tumor growth in vivo. Thus, easily manufactured SSH may serve as a new and powerful antigen delivery platform with immune-stimulating capabilities to promote antitumor immune responses, and has great potential for immunotherapy against different diseases.},

  abstract     = {Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have attracted considerable attention in promoting osteogenic differentiation . However, little is known about their osteogenic effects on cells from various origins, and further in vivo investigation as a promising osteogenic agent upon hydrogel-conjugation is required. Herein, the effects of PEGylated GNPs with the sizes of 4, 18 and 45 nm on osteogenic differentiation in the pre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell line, human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) and rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) were comprehensively evaluated. The results showed that GNPs with all of three different sizes had excellent biocompatibility, and their effects on induction of osteogenic differentiation of various cell types were dependent on size. Specifically, 45-nm GNPs showed more pronounced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mineralized nodule formation and expression of osteogenic marker genes compared with the 18-nm group, while 4-nm GNPs reduced the above osteogenic effects. Meanwhile, β-catenin and p-GSK-3β were upregulated by GNPs-45 nm and GNPs-18 nm, but suppressed by GNPs-4 nm, indicating that Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway mighy play an important role in GNPs-induce osteogenic differentiation. In addition, specific blocking of Wnt/β-catenin signals by KYA1797K inhibited 45 nm GNPs-induced osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. Furthermore, 45-nm GNPs conjugated with PEG-hydrogel were chosen for in vivo bone regeneration testing in rabbits with 4-mm femur defects. The results demonstrated that the GNPs stimulated bone regeneration rapidly and effectively. Such comprehensive evaluation of GNPs&#39; effects on in vitro osteogenic differentiation and in vivo bone regeneration could promote their applications in clinical translation.},

In this study, thermal- and pH-sensitive nanoparticles loaded with two drugs were fabricated for controlled drug release. For synthesis of nanoparticles, we first prepared a PAMAM dendrimer cluster, which could provide large core space, and then sequentially loaded indocyanine green (ICG, a photothermal agent) and doxorubicin (DOX, a chemotherapeutic agent) premixed with polyacrylic acid (PAA) to the dendrimer cluster through ionic interactions. This self-assembling strategy yielded a high drug-loading content for both DOX (19.1 ± 0.4\%) and ICG (54 ± 1\%). Subsequently, PEG and Herceptin were covalently attached to nanoparticles to promote their bio-recognition by HER2-overexpressing cancer cells. DOX was released by changing pH from 7.4 to 5; DOX release was markedly enhanced by NIR (808 nm) laser irradiation . Conjugation with Herceptin could enhance specific attachment and accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor cells. Under NIR laser irradiation, ICG served as a remote-controlled trigger to generate considerable heat that caused severe physical damage and extensive cell apoptosis. Furthermore, after NIR laser irradiation, drug delivery and penetration of the nanoparticles into tumor spheroids were enhanced, indicating the potential therapeutic application of the newly developed nanoparticles.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we accomplished the crack-free directed energy deposition (DED) of a multi-layer Cobalt-Chromium alloy coating (Stellite 21) on Inconel 718 substrate. Stellite alloys are used as coating materials given their resistance to wear, corrosion, and high temperature. The main challenge in DED of Stellite coatings is the proclivity for crack formation during printing. The objective of this work is to characterize the effect of the input energy density and localized laser-based preheating on the characteristics of the deposited coating, namely, crack formation, microstructural evolution , dilution of the coating composition due to diffusion of iron and nickel from the substrate, and microhardness . It is observed that cracking is alleviated on preheating the substrate and depositing the coating at a moderate energy density (~200 J·mm −3 ). The main finding is that cracking of DED-processed Stellite 21 coating at higher levels of energy density is linked to the elemental segregation of chromium and molybdenum, which form hard and brittle phases in the inter-dendritic regions. Cracking in the inter-dendritic regions is caused by residual stresses resulting from the steep thermal gradients at higher input energy. Localized laser-based preheating and moderate energy density mitigate steep temperature gradients and thereby avoid thermally induced cracking of the Stellite coating along the inter-dendritic regions.},

In this research, we have synthesized water-soluble multifunctional polyhydroxylated POSS (POH-POSS) and characterized using FT-IR, TEM, 1 H NMR and 29 Si NMR. We hypothesize that incubation of human endothelial cells (HUVECs) with POH-POSS NPs could contribute to the modulation of angiogenesis and exosome biogenesis. As compared to the control group, the survival rate of cells incubated with 300 ppm POH-POSS significantly increased ( P &lt; 0.05).

The performance of MD simulation is poor once the model size is huge. To accelerate the computing of MD simulation, the Markov state model (MSM) can be applied because of the ability to predict a future state of a stochastic system . With the advantage of MSM and MD applied in material modelling, a good result could be expected where the time scale limitation of MD simulation is bridged by MSM method. In this research, an MSM method based on the MD microstates in which a nickel superalloy&#39;s atomic model arrangements and their microstructure evolution have been treated with the Markov properties is presented. This MSM is based and classified by a dislocation model which is a fundamental of the microstructural tessellation evolution. The results indicate that the microstructure evolution in a situation of energy minimisation favours the formation of new faults alongside existing ones. And dislocation accumulation on the grain boundary was observed during fatigue resolving. Some dislocations formatted and grown in the middle of coarse grain and penetrated through the grain.},

The homogenized and quenched single crystals were subjected to a heat treatment at 973 K for variable aging times. As a result, small and coherent nanometer-sized γ′ (Ni 3 Al-type) precipitates were formed. It was established that Fe-28Ni-17Co-11.5Al-2.5Ta-0.05B single crystals oriented along [001] direction exhibit the fully reversible superelastic behavior up to 14.3\% compression strain at 77 K reaching the maximum theoretical value. The boron addition suppressed completely the formation of the brittle β phase and reduced the average precipitate size of the γ′ precipitates. Using high-energy synchrotron radiation and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis the volume fraction and precipitate size of γ′ were determined indicating that both factors are critical in obtaining the largest superelastic reversibility . Boron addition counters the initial effect of mechanical stabilization which was detected in single crystals without boron. Unlike the thermally induced martensitic transformation , applied stresses produce a different austenite/martensite interface composed of interchanging austenite and martensite variants. It is also demonstrated that upon loading/unloading cycles the moving transformation front divides the material into three district regions i.e. single variant of austenite, austenite intermixed with martensite and single variant of martensite.},

Subsequent finite element simulations and experiments of nanoindentation jointly reveal co-existing microscopic plastic deformation and brittle fracture of 3C-SiC at different indentation depths, which significantly affect the observed macroscopic mechanical response and surface pile-up topography. In particular, the predicted morphology of surface cracks at an indentation depth of 500 nm agrees well with experimental observation, and the correlation of crack initiation and propagation with surface pile-up topography is theoretically analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Construction of segregated structures within conductive polymer composites (CPCs) is a prospective strategy to enhance electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (SE). However, the CPCs of segregated structures frequently experience worsened mechanical performances due to weak interface reactions between adjacent polymer domains, which are hindered by conductive fillers . Herein, 3D-printed segregated carbon nanotube (CNT)/polylactic acid (PLA) composite was firstly exploited to develop high mechanical properties while achieving good performance for electromagnetic interference shielding. Within the final 3D-printed CNT/PLA composite, CNTs coated on 3D-printed PLA scaffold were translated to interconnected conductive network after compression. Thus, EMI SE of composite was as high as 67.0 dB when 5.0 wt\% CNTs were loaded. Furthermore, 3D-printed PLA scaffold with a highly continuous structure also benefited the mechanical robustness of the segregated composite, revealing the bending strength (87.8 MPa) and Young&#39;s modulus (4.43 GPa), which were 101\% and 43\% higher than 43.7 MPa and 3.08 GPa for the conventional CNT/PLA composite. Moreover, the regulation of 3D-printed PLA scaffolds results in promising CNT/PLA composites with tunable EMI SE. This work suggests that 3D printing technology is an effective and easy approach to develop the outperformance of CPCs for different radiation source fields and electronic devices.},

The process conditions to achieve over 99.5\% ± 0.1\% relative planar density were obtained, and the mechanism of tunable mechanical properties was investigated by understanding the correlation between the microstructure and chemical composition according to the energy density. As the energy density increased, tensile properties were decreased with grain growth and the concentrations of light elements were increased by accelerating dissolution. As the concentrations of light elements increased, the mechanism of destructive behavior changed from ductile fracture to brittle fracture and it caused that the hardness was improved. Consequently, it was necessary to control the energy density from 9.34 to 23.98 J/mm 3 in order to fabricate SUS316L parts of high strength and high elongation characteristics by SLM method.},

They are also used as sacrificial templates to produce polymer-based microcarriers (capsules, beads) and polymer scaffolds for tissue engineering at biologically friendly conditions. However, fabrication of CaCO 3 crystals with the sizes beyond the conventional range without additives is still a challenge. There is a desperate need of sub-micrometre and sub-millimetre biocompatible and easily decomposable vectors for intracellular delivery and design of tailor-made polymer scaffolds, respectively. In this study, additive-free one-step fabrication of vaterite mesoporous crystals with sizes in the range from submicron (0.72 μm) up to tens of microns (55 μm) sizes is proposed. Crystals are grown by mixing of Ca 2+ and CO 3 2− salts in aqueous media . Internal structure and morphology of the crystals have been investigated.

Researching and determining the optimal factors for biological fixation between the tendon and prosthesis is the crux for restoring limb function. In order to increase the growth of tendon fibers into the scaffold and reduce the formation of cicatricial tissue, selective laser melting (SLM) three-dimensional (3D) printing was used to prepare four types of cylindrical scaffold. The actual pore sizes of cuboids, which were used as the monomers , were 657.65, 527.15, 348.68, and 169.20 μm. Cell experiments showed that the greatest number of fibroblasts became adhered to and grew into the scaffold with an actual pore size of 527.15 μm. Each group of scaffolds was surgically implanted into a rabbit model of acute injury to the supraspinatus tendon. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and hard tissue section staining were used to analyze the growth of tendon tissue in each group. We concluded that 527.15 μm is the best pore size for a titanium alloy surface to promote tendon ingrowth. The current study provides a reference for the clinical design of the pore size of tendon attachments onto the surfaces of tumor prostheses.},

This multi-interlayer acts as a ‘physical barrier’ to forbid the formation of Mg–Al Intermetallic compounds (IMCs) and engineer IMCs to improve the mechanical performance. The function of the Al interlayer is to form Al–Ni and Al-Mg-Zn products and reduce the excess dissolution of AZ31. Results show that adopting Al/Zn/Ni/Zn multi-interlayer helped to form a mixed IMCs layer composed of Mg 2 Ni, Al 3 Ni, Al 3 Ni 2 , and AlMg 4 Zn 11 to enhance the bonding between Ni interlayer and AZ31, which prohibits the lack of bonding using Zn/Ni/Zn multi-interlayer. The shear strength of the joints using Al/Zn/Ni/Zn multi-interlayer has been up to 95.3 MPa from 35.2 MPa with Zn/Ni/Zn multi-interlayer. The role of Al interlayer played during U-TLP bonding was discussed in detail, and the evolution of microstructure on both sides of the Ni interlayer was analyzed.},

However, no research has focused on how these parameters evolve throughout the transformation and how this evolution can affect the outcome. In this study, thermal and thermomechanical treatments have been performed in three selected steels. The treatments have been designed in such a way that all the mentioned parameters are comparable, aiming to obtain similar microstructures in terms of bainitic ferrite plate thickness. However, significant differences have been found among the microstructures, with variations in plate thickness larger than 100 nm. These results indicate that there might be other factors that take part in the scale of bainitic microstructures. To explain these differences and based on the kinetics of the transformation and on the carbon content of austenite at the end of the transformation, a possible explanation has been proposed.},

Model-based approaches for determining the fatigue behavior have presented a tangible step towards complementing and reducing the overall number of physical tests necessary to qualify a material for use in application. Yet, prior to the adoption of the model-based approaches, the model needs to be thoroughly validated, presenting challenges, including substantiating the model&#39;s ability to capture the correct physics for crack initiation, which is difficult provided the multiple length-scales of the problem. In this paper, a methodology and demonstration for validating the location of microstructure-sensitive fatigue crack initiation as predicted by crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) simulations, using high-energy X-ray diffraction and tomography experiments are presented. Realistic 3D microstructural models are created for the material of interest, IN718 (produced via additive manufacturing), with different twin instantiations , based on the experimental data for use in the CPFE simulations. The location of failure predicted using the extreme values of failure metrics (plastic strain accumulation and plastic strain energy density) resulted in an unambiguous one-to-one correlation with the experimentally observed location of crack-initiation for the models with statistical twin instantiations.},

Here, with micro-mechanics, it is demonstrated that machining-induced damage in bone extends beyond the necrotic region. Drilling with different conditions was performed on ex-vivo bovine cortical bone, inducing different damage degrees. Micro-pillar compression tests were performed in the machined sub-surface to identify changes in properties and failure modes caused by drilling. It was revealed that at high cutting temperatures, the bone near the machined surface suffers from lower modulus (−42\%), strength (−41\%) and brittle behaviour, whereas the bulk bone remains undamaged with pristine properties and ductile behaviour. Histology was also performed to evaluate necrosis and, surprisingly, it was found that the brittle and weaker bone layer is more than three times larger when compared to the necrotic layer, clearly showing that the drilling thermo-mechanical effect could affect not only biologically, but also micro-mechanically. Consequently, these results reveal another kind of bone damage that has so far been neglected.},

However, for the non-weldable superalloys like Inconel 738, cracking frequently occurs during DED and cannot be thoroughly controlled up to now. We propose a novel method to prevent the cracking during Inconel 738 DED, in which a small amount of Inconel 718 is in-situ doped between the deposited layers of Inconel 738. The obtained layered-gradient-material is found to be free of both macro- and micro-cracks. The microstructure shows that doping Inconel 718 cannot interrupt the epitaxial growth of grains, but can modify the precipitation of γ′. In Inconel 718 layers, nano γ′ particles are intensively precipitated only in the inter-dendrites, while in Inconel 738 layers, they are precipitated in both the inter- and inner-dendrites. This modification on γ′ precipitation can effectively decrease the inner stress and alleviate the stress concentration at the grain boundaries, thus the cracking is prevented. The tensile tests , which were conducted at room temperature, 600 °C and 800 °C respectively, demonstrate that the composite deposited workpieces possess promising strength and plasticity. The proposed method has great potential to improve the printability of un-weldable superalloys in additive manufacturing .},

  abstract     = {Local-gradient-based optimization approaches lack nonlocal exploration ability required for escaping from local minima in non-convex landscapes. A directional Gaussian smoothing (DGS) approach was proposed in our recent work and used to define a truly nonlocal gradient, referred to as the DGS gradient, in order to enable nonlocal exploration in high-dimensional black-box optimization. Promising results show that replacing the traditional local gradient with the nonlocal DGS gradient can significantly improve the performance of gradient-based methods in optimizing highly multi-modal loss functions. However, the current DGS method is designed for unbounded and unconstrained optimization problems, making it inapplicable to real-world engineering design optimization problems where the tuning parameters are often bounded and the loss function is usually constrained by physical processes. In this work, we propose to extend the DGS approach to the constrained inverse design framework in order to find a better design. The proposed framework has its advantages in portability and flexibility to naturally incorporate the parameterization, physics simulation, and objective formulation together to build up an effective inverse design workflow. A series of adaptive strategies for smoothing radius and learning rate updating are developed to improve the computational efficiency and robustness. To enable a clear binarized design, a dynamic growth mechanism is imposed on the projection strength in parameterization. The methodology is demonstrated by an example of wavelength demultiplexer . Our method shows superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. By incorporating volume constraints, the optimized design achieves an equivalently high performance but significantly reduces the amount of material usage.},

  abstract     = {Targeted drug delivery is currently emerging as a promising approach to overcome the limits of currently employed administration techniques. The most convenient methodology to control drug delivery is the application of stimuli-responsive materials, which can release drugs only when required, to remotely controlled microdevices able to navigate human body. Thanks to this synergy, release can be controlled both spatially and temporally. Spatial control is guaranteed by the maneuverability of the devices, which can be precisely guided to release in targeted locations. Temporal control, conversely, is guaranteed by the functionalization introduced in the stimuli-responsive material. In this context, the present work describes the coating of magnetically controlled microdevices with functionalized alginate-based hydrogels able to release drugs at pH values lower than 4.5. Hydrogels are functionalized binding the drug with either an azidoethyl ester bond or an amidic bond, following an innovative synthesis route. After fabrication, release from hydrogel coated microdevices as a function of the environmental pH is characterized. Finally, devices are magnetically actuated and the possibility to achieve spatially and temporally controlled release is demonstrated. The functional microtransporters described in the present work are particularly promising for in-vivo applications in environments where pH differences are present, like the digestive apparatus.},

  abstract     = {Transparent silica glass is an indispensable material for today&#39;s information technology society as an ultra-low loss optical fiber . Recently, further low-loss optical fibers are demanded due to rapidly expanding information. A small amount of fluorine doping is known to reduce the Rayleigh scattering further by reducing the density fluctuations of silica glass, even though the fluorine is an impurity for the pristine silica glass. This study devoted to answer the riddle of F-doping and an accurate force-matching potential optimized by machine-learning enables us to understand how fluorine remedies the disorders in silica glass. It was found that fluorine mainly replaces an oxygen in tetrahedral SiO 4 unit, but also forms five-fold Si, such as SiO 4 F and SiO 3 F 2 units. The former disrupts silica network, while the latter attenuates the network rigidity by loosening the five Si-O(F) bonds. Since the two local effects of fluorine spreads through the glass network, F-doping prompts silica glass to relax further even at temperature lower than the glass transition (fictive) temperature. Consequently, fluorine minimizes the density fluctuation (thus, Rayleigh scattering) of silica glass at around 1 wt\%, although fluorine itself is an impurity for silica glass.},

Due to the nature of the self-assembly process, it is difficult to control the size and morphology of the self-assembled nanomaterials. Multicomponent supramolecular self-assembly can be achieved to control the self-assembly process and provides the possibility to generate a wider and more complex structure, enhance modularity and provide spatiotemporal control of self-assembly. In this review, it is believed that multicomponent self-assembly may offer a new way to build tuning morphology and functionality materials. The tuning of morphology and functionality of multicomponent co-assembly was discussed according to the purpose of their mixing in the following three aspects separately: (1) one of the components can self-assemble individually, the other added components can tune the morphology and functionality of the assemblies, (2) all of the components can self-assemble individually, the mixture can strength the assemblies or generate new functionalities, (3) none of the components can self-assemble individually, but the mixtures can self-assemble into novel properties.},

  abstract     = {Mechanistic capabilities found in nature have influenced a variety of successful functional designs in engineering. However, the unique combinations of mechanical properties found in natural materials have not been readily adapted into synthetic materials, due to a disconnect between biological principles and engineering applications . Current biomimetic material approaches tend to involve mimicking nature&#39;s microstructure geometries or mimicking nature&#39;s adaptive design process through brute force element-by-element composite optimization techniques. While the adaptive approach promotes the generation of application-specific microstructure geometries, the element-by-element optimization techniques encompass a large design space that is directly related to the number of elements in the system. In contrast, a novel methodology is proposed in this paper that merges biological pattern generation mechanisms observed in the Gray-Scott model, with an evolutionary-inspired genetic algorithm to create adaptive bio-inspired composite geometries optimized for stiffness and toughness. The results reveal that this methodology significantly reduces the optimization parameter space from tens of thousands of parameters to only four or five. In addition, the resultant composite geometries improved upon the overall combination of stiffness and toughness by a factor of 13, when compared to published brute force element-by-element techniques.},

  abstract     = {A patient-specific titanium-reinforced calcium phosphate (CaP–Ti) cranial implant has recently shown promising clinical results. Currently, its mesh-type titanium structure is additively manufactured using laser beam powder bed fusion (L-PBF). Nevertheless, an electron-beam (E-PBF) process could potentially be more time efficient. This study aimed to compare the geometrical accuracy and mechanical response of thin titanium structures manufactured by L-PBF (HIPed) and E-PBF (as-printed). Tensile test (ø = 1.2 mm) and implant specimens were manufactured. Measurements by μCT revealed a deviation in cross-sectional area as compared to the designed geometry: 13–35\% for E-PBF and below 2\% for L-PBF. A superior mechanical strength was obtained for the L-PBF specimens, both in the tensile test and the implant compression tests. The global peak load in the implant test was 457 ± 9 N and 846 ± 40 N for E-PBF and L-PBF, respectively. Numerical simulations demonstrated that geometrical deviation was the main factor in implant performance and enabled quantification of this effect: 34–39\% reduction in initial peak force based on geometry, and only 11–16\% reduction based on the material input. In summary, the study reveals an uncertainty in accuracy when structures of sizes relevant to mesh-type cranial implants are printed by the E-PBF method.},

  abstract     = {An SEM in situ uniaxial tensile testing setup allowing HR-EBSD acquisition during deformation was used to study the extension twinning mechanism in magnesium (Mg) at the micron scale. Structures were fabricated with two different crystal orientations , respectively perfectly aligned with, and at 5° to, the [0001] axis. Limited { 10 1 ¯ 2 101¯2 } twin formation was identified in the former case, while twinning was found to largely accommodate the plastic deformation in the latter case. These two different mechanisms are explained by the activation of basal slip when loading at 5° to the c-axis, which triggers { 10 1 ¯ 2 101¯2 } twin nucleation and favors twin growth and propagation. The other orientation shows the activation of pyramidal slip together with only limited { 10 1 ¯ 2 101¯2 } twin growth. The critical resolved shear stress for { 10 1 ¯ 2 101¯2 } twinning has been determined to be ten times higher than in bulk material. 3D HR-EBSD mapping enabled reconstruction of the three dimensional twin structure after deformation. From this, the interaction between the dislocations located ahead of the incoming twin and a pre-existing twin boundary was investigated, where the GND distribution and the local shear stress were determined. The results show plastic accommodation up to ~11\% of strain, revealing higher ductility than usually reported for bulk materials.},

Whereas most previous efforts focused on developing new printing or material systems, we propose a new voxel design strategy of constructing digital materials to provide the additively manufactured polymeric structures with spatially customized thermomechanical properties . In our approach, a matrix-inclusion composite layout is adopted in the linearly patterned voxels that perform as building blocks to construct bulk material. Through rational design of voxel size and inclusion content, the printed polymeric digital material displays a tunable storage modulus up to three orders of magnitude and glass transition temperature ranging from 0 °C to 60 °C. By taking advantage of the design freedom, we demonstrate a sequential folding structure with spatially tunable actuation speed, and multi-stable configurations that trap elastic energy in deterministic collapse sequences. Overall, our approach provides an effective and convenient way of spatially customizing material properties for additive manufacturing and offers instructive inspirations to the realm of digital fabrication.},

The CrCoNiSi x MEAs are all single-phase face-centered cubic (FCC) structure. The recrystallization rate and average grain size obviously increase with the increase of Si. Compared to CrCoNi MEA, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and uniform elongation (UE) of CrCoNiSi 0.3 MEA were increased from 790 MPa to 960 MPa and 58\% to 92\%, respectively, and the product of UTS and total elongation (TE) increased up to 88 GPa\% (46 GPa\% for CoCrNi MEA), superior to most high strength-ductility alloys. The stacking-fault energy (SFE) in the Si-added MEAs decreases with Si addition, as proved by thermodynamic model . Therefore, the underlying strengthening mechanism is the reduction of SFE and increase in the lattice distortion via Si addition. More concentrated and thinner deformation twins and multiple twinning structures were observed in Si-added MEAs. Furthermore, a nanoscale diffusionless transformation from the FCC to the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) phase occurred at room-temperature tension in Si-added MEAs, which further increased the work hardening and uniform elongation. This work provides a new and significant approach to break through the strength-ductility trade-off in FCC MEAs/HEAs, especially serving as energy-absorbing materials.},

To interpret the model assumptions and findings, several local linear models were devised and analyzed to establish the link between process parameters and mechanical properties.

Two distinct types of hydrocolloids have been considered: a seaweed-derived biopolymer (alginate) and a plant-derived biopolymer (pectin). To attain nano-structured binary hydrogels, surface-functionalized cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) bearing carboxyl groups were employed. This study addresses a non-conventional approach of physical gelation that takes place in acidic conditions (pH &lt; 3) at ambiental temperature using citric acid as gelation-inducing additive in comparison with the typical Ca 2+ -crosslinked hydrogels. The use of a specific crosslinker directly determines the gross properties of the material because of different type and density of polymer junctions and chains assembly. Therefore, the final features of the bioinspired scaffolds such as moisture uptake, morphological and mechanical characteristics are strongly influenced by the type of gelling additive used and by the ratio between the employed vegetal polysaccharides . Citric acid-based hydrogels presented a higher stability when compared to the calcium-mediated controls and a significantly higher proliferation was detected when raising the hydrocolloid content and when citric acid was used for crosslinking. The newly adopted crosslinking strategy provides a more cell-interactive microenvironment than calcium-based crosslinking leading to improved viability and cytoskeleton development of stem cells.},

  abstract     = {Computational materials design has made significant progress lately. However, one underexploited opportunity lies in the combination of physically based modelling and machine learning (ML). In the present work we exploit this combination for modelling of strain-induced martensitic phase transformation (SIMT) in austenitic steels. A fully predictive model for SIMT, responsible for the TRIP effect in many steels, is devised. An experimental dataset correlating SIMT with composition, temperature and strain is collected from the open literature firstly. Secondly, the Olson-Cohen model is applied to make physically based predictions on temperature and strain dependence of SIMT in order to expand the database to the final size of 16,500 entries relating the features and the target. Thirdly, ensemble ML methods are applied to model the data and the final model is validated on a holdout dataset, including also dual-phase alloys. The final model provides accurate predictions of SIMT in a temperature range from −196 to 100 °C and from 0 to 1 in strain. The model can readily be extended to consider further factors such as strain rate and stress state. Moreover, it can be used together with thermodynamic and kinetic calculations, or thermomechanical simulations, for the design of steels and components, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the viability and benefits of building a computationally low-cost surrogate model relating the mechanical performance of micro-springs to crystallographic texture and single-crystal elastic constants. This task is accomplished by leveraging advances in (i) computationally-expensive finite element (FE) models that explicitly incorporates the constitutive response of individual grains in to simulate the overall mechanical response of the micro-spring, (ii) efficient parametrization of the extremely large space of textures using Fourier basis (i.e., generalized spherical harmonics), (iii) sequential design of FE simulations to maximize model fidelity while also minimizing the overall computational expense incurred in generating the data, and (iv) the use of Gaussian process models for incorporating uncertainty quantification into the development of the desired surrogate model. The strategy implemented in this work proved to be remarkably efficient in producing the desired surrogate model. The utility of the surrogate model established in this work is demonstrated with a case study addressing an inverse solution for the specific crystallographic texture that maximizes the micro-spring performance for a selected material.},

The present work demonstrates such approach to examine the variation in microstructure features on mechanical properties of paper materials. After the generation of a “big” dataset of fiber network samples, morphological feature data , including interfiber contact properties were extracted and statistically evaluated. By performing cohesive finite element simulations, the mechanical properties including failure strain, effective stiffness, and maximal stress of fiber networks under tensile test were determined and served along with structural feature data for the ML analysis. Gradient Boosting method achieved a performance score of approx. 0.9 for all mechanical properties of such complex fibrous structure . It was found that “disorderness” represented by the variation of fiber network orientation and the mean contact area size to be the most influential factors to the failure strain and effective stiffness. Whereas the failure strength was driven by the homogeneous distribution of the contact areas. The results validated the strong orientation dependence of fibrous materials in experimental observations and enlighten the importance of sensitivity as feature parameters and the striking potential of ML for material optimization .},

  abstract     = {3D printing of various polymers has attracted great attention and developed rapidly in recent years. Digital light processing (DLP) has recently emerged as a fast growing 3D printing technique due to its high resolution and high speed. However, the lack of printable high-performance materials limits its broad applications. In addition, with the increasing adoption of DLP 3D printing, the efficient recycling of printed thermosetting materials is highly desired. Herein, we proposed a two-stage curing approach involving dynamic reactions by using the acrylate-epoxy hybrid resin for the recyclable DLP 3D printing of high-performance thermosetting polymers . Bond exchange reactions (BERs) could establish covalent bonds between the acrylate network and the epoxy network, thus partially triggering the copolymerization . The resulting new polymers exhibited excellent mechanical properties . A small-molecule assisted BER method was then used to efficiently depolymerize the thermosetting printed parts into soluble oligomers , which were formulated with fresh photopolymers for the next round of printing. The reprinted samples still showed good mechanical properties comparable to the virgin ones. In addition, the new polymers demonstrated potential applications in 4D printing of smart actuators. This work opens a novel avenue for green manufacturing technologies .},

Here, we present a multi-method characterization approach to understand the impact of the morphology on the elastic as well as electrical behavior, which facilitates a strategy to design the relevant material parameters by tuning the morphology. Nano-SEM/FIB tomography and SEM/EBSD are applied to probe the morphology of three representative copper films. Nanoindentation and 4-point probe are used to extract the elastic modulus and specific electrical resistivity, respectively. The evaluated material parameters are compared with modeling results using the analyzed image data as an input. For the crucial image analysis, we develop a validated objective image analysis workflow. We obtain a quantified insight about the effect of the heterogeneous morphologies on the elastic modulus and specific electrical resistivity, thereby delivering important information about the necessary homogeneous copper morphology- and nano-scale pore-design.

To better tailor the mechanical properties to the functional needs, here we examined open-cell nanocrystalline tungsten nanofoams to provide fundamental insight into the correlations between cellular structures and mechanical properties. Depth-sensing nanoindentation tests were performed on tungsten nanofoams with independently varied relative densities and cellular structures to obtain foam mechanical properties. For tungsten nanofoams with self-similar and highly ordered cellular structures, the Young&#39;s modulus is insensitive to the ligament size, but varies with the relative density in a close way to the classical Gibson-Ashby scaling law. The flow strength of these regular nanofoams follows the classical scaling behavior only when properly taking into consideration the ligament size effect and corrections for the relative density. Contrarily, tungsten nanofoams with a certain relative density but varied cellular structures exhibit deterioration of both, Young&#39;s modulus and flow strength, with increasing structural disorders. This study emphasizes the importance of structural self-similarity when applying the established scaling laws to describe the foam mechanical properties. Meanwhile, it demonstrates that for optimized performance of the nanofoams, cellular architecture is the key factor of consideration.},

However, the explosion of design variables poses a stiff challenge to the design of layouts of such structures. In this study, a novel layout optimization method is proposed for curvilinearly stiffened panels based on deep learning-based models, which enables their intelligent design. Unlike traditional methods, the image-based structural layout, which is characteristic of curvilinear stiffener paths, is employed as a design variable, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to extract the layout features from the curvilinear stiffeners and construct a surrogate model between layout features and structural performance. Subsequently, sub-optimization is performed using the constructed CNN to obtain new designs and correspondingly update the dataset. As the trained CNN does not require input data to exhibit the same number of stiffeners present in the training data, the proposed optimization framework can be used to address layout designs of stiffeners with variable numbers. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed intelligent optimization framework significantly improves the optimization efficiency compared to traditional models. It also indicates the extraordinary promise of deep learning-based methods in the field of engineering optimization.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the durability performance of concrete subjected to sulfuric acid. Accelerated conditioning is conducted at a 5\% concentration employing concrete blocks bonded with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets, which are used for rehabilitating impaired structural members, and plain concrete blocks. After deteriorating the specimens for up to 9 weeks, various physical and mechanical tests are carried out such as digital microscopy , resonance frequency , porosity, thermogravimetry , and flexural loading. The initial uptake of sulfuric acid raises the mass of the concrete by 5.9\%, on average; however, with the increased exposure period, the mass decreases by 19.8\% because of the dissolved cement paste and enlarged pores. The presence of a CFRP layer partially hinders the ingress of sulfuric acid and improves the integrity of the concrete. Irreversible damage in the conditioned specimens reduces their resonant frequency and dynamic modulus as low as 20.3\% and 49.0\%, respectively. According to thermogravimetric results, the acid conditioning changes the microstructure of the concrete. While the flexural capacity of the blocks rises over 409\% after CFRP-bonding, the level of uncertainty increases owing to the irregular deterioration of the CFRP-concrete interface. Furthermore, the capacity reduction and flexural stiffness of the specimens, as well as the debonding characteristics of CFRP, are dependent upon exposure period. A probability-based analytical model is formulated to complement the experimental findings, including the quantification of hazard and reliability. By comprehending the unexplored degradation mechanisms of concrete with and without CFRP-bonding under the sulfuric acid environment, a link is established between material-level damage and sustainable rehabilitation systems.},
