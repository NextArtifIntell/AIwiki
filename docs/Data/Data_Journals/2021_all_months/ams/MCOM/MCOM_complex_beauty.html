  abstract     = {This paper reports on the computation of a discrete logarithm in the finite field $\mathbb {F}_{2^{30750}}$, breaking by a large margin the previous record, which was set in January 2014 by a computation in $\mathbb {F}_{2^{9234}}$. The present computation made essential use of the elimination step of the quasi-polynomial algorithm due to Granger, Kleinjung and Zumbrägel, and is the first large-scale experiment to truly test and successfully demonstrate its potential when applied recursively, which is when it leads to the stated complexity. It required the equivalent of about $2900$ core years on a single core of an Intel Xeon Ivy Bridge processor running at 2.6 GHz, which is comparable to the approximately $3100$ core years expended for the discrete logarithm record for prime fields, set in a field of bit-length $795$, and demonstrates just how much easier the problem is for this level of computational effort. In order to make the computation feasible we introduced several innovative techniques for the elimination of small degree irreducible elements, which meant that we avoided performing any costly Gröbner basis computations, in contrast to all previous records since early 2013. While such computations are crucial to the $L(\frac 1 4 + o(1))$ complexity algorithms, they were simply too slow for our purposes. Finally, this computation should serve as a serious deterrent to cryptographers who are still proposing to rely on the discrete logarithm security of such finite fields in applications, despite the existence of two quasi-polynomial algorithms and the prospect of even faster algorithms being developed.},

As from mid 70’ it has been known that the problem can be solved in $O(dn^2)$ time. An algorithm with running time $O(dn \log (dn))$, proposed in late 80’, does not work correctly on all input data. In this paper we solve the transitive simultaneous conjugacy problem in $O(n^2 \log d / \log n + dn\log n)$ time and $O(n^{3/ 2} + dn)$ space. Experimental evaluation on random instances shows that the expected running time of our algorithm is considerably better, perhaps even nearly linear in $n$ at given $d$.},

Moreover, based on the convergence theorem of nonnegative semimartingales, positive results about the ability of the explicit numerical scheme proposed to reproduce the well-known LaSalle-type theorem of SDEs are proved here, from which we deduce the asymptotic stability of numerical solutions.

It then picks such an equation and corrects $x_{k+1} = x_k + \lambda a_i$ where $\lambda$ is chosen so that the $i$-th equation is satisfied. Convergence rates are difficult to establish. Strohmer &amp; Vershynin established that if the order of equations is chosen randomly (with likelihood proportional to the size of $\|a_i\|^2_{\ell ^2}$), then $\mathbb {E}~ \|x_k - x\|_{\ell ^2}$ converges exponentially. We prove that if the $i$-th row is selected with likelihood proportional to $\left |\left \langle a_i, x_k \right \rangle - b_i\right |^{p}$, where $0&lt;p&lt;\infty$, then $\mathbb {E}~\|x_k - x\|_{\ell ^2}$ converges faster than the purely random method.

A regularized system is constructed in order to handle the degenerated integral operators. The semi-discrete and full-discrete schemes are studied for the boundary integral system by using the collocation method. Convergence is established for the numerical schemes in some appropriate Sobolev spaces. Numerical experiments are presented for both smooth and nonsmooth obstacles to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {We present an error analysis for the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method applied to the discrete-ordinate discretization of the steady-state radiative transfer equation with isotropic scattering. Under some mild assumptions, we show that the DG method converges uniformly with respect to a scaling parameter $\varepsilon$ which characterizes the strength of scattering in the system. However, the rate is not optimal and can be polluted by the presence of boundary layers. In one-dimensional slab geometries, we demonstrate optimal convergence when boundary layers are not present and analyze a simple strategy for balance interior and boundary layer errors. Some numerical tests are also provided in this reduced setting.},

  abstract     = {Local time-stepping methods permit to overcome the severe stability constraint on explicit methods caused by local mesh refinement without sacrificing explicitness. Diaz and Grote [SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 31 (2009), pp. 1985–2014] proposed a leapfrog based explicit local time-stepping (LF-LTS) method for the time integration of second-order wave equations. Recently, optimal convergence rates were proved for a conforming FEM discretization, albeit under a CFL stability condition where the global time-step, $\Delta t$, depends on the smallest elements in the mesh (see M. J. Grote, M. Mehlin, and S. A. Sauter [SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 56 (2018), pp. 994–1021]). In general one cannot improve upon that stability constraint, as the LF-LTS method may become unstable at certain discrete values of $\Delta t$. To remove those critical values of $\Delta t$, we apply a slight modification (as in recent work on LF-Chebyshev methods by Carle, Hochbruck, and Sturm [SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 58 (2020), pp. 2404–2433]) to the original LF-LTS method which nonetheless preserves its desirable properties: it is fully explicit, second-order accurate, satisfies a three-term (leapfrog like) recurrence relation, and conserves the energy. The new stabilized LF-LTS method also yields optimal convergence rates for a standard conforming FE discretization, yet under a CFL condition where $\Delta t$ no longer depends on the mesh size inside the locally refined region.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian process regression has proven very powerful in statistics, machine learning and inverse problems. A crucial aspect of the success of this methodology, in a wide range of applications to complex and real-world problems, is hierarchical modeling and learning of hyperparameters. The purpose of this paper is to study two paradigms of learning hierarchical parameters: one is from the probabilistic Bayesian perspective, in particular, the empirical Bayes approach that has been largely used in Bayesian statistics; the other is from the deterministic and approximation theoretic view, and in particular the kernel flow algorithm that was proposed recently in the machine learning literature. Analysis of their consistency in the large data limit, as well as explicit identification of their implicit bias in parameter learning, are established in this paper for a Matérn-like model on the torus. A particular technical challenge we overcome is the learning of the regularity parameter in the Matérn-like field, for which consistency results have been very scarce in the spatial statistics literature. Moreover, we conduct extensive numerical experiments beyond the Matérn-like model, comparing the two algorithms further. These experiments demonstrate learning of other hierarchical parameters, such as amplitude and lengthscale; they also illustrate the setting of model misspecification in which the kernel flow approach could show superior performance to the more traditional empirical Bayes approach.},

For that purpose, the kissing number is replaced by the kissing function $\kappa _H(n, r)$, resp. $\kappa _S(n, r)$, which depends on the dimension $n$ and the radius $r$. After we obtain some theoretical upper and lower bounds for $\kappa _H(n, r)$, we study their asymptotic behaviour and show, in particular, that $\kappa _H(n,r) \sim (n-1) \cdot d_{n-1} \cdot B(\frac {n-1}{2}, \frac {1}{2}) \cdot e^{(n-1) r}$, where $d_n$ is the sphere packing density in $\mathbb {R}^n$, and $B$ is the beta-function. Then we produce numeric upper bounds by solving a suitable semidefinite program, as well as lower bounds coming from concrete spherical codes. A similar approach allows us to locate the values of $\kappa _S(n, r)$, for $n= 3, 4$, over subintervals in $[0, \pi ]$ with relatively high accuracy.},

We describe a generation procedure for automizers of every subgroup of the $p$-group. This allows a computational check of saturation. These procedures have been implemented using Magma . We describe a computer program which searches for saturated fusion systems $\mathcal {F}$ on $p$-groups with $O_p(\mathcal {F})=1$ and $O^p(\mathcal {F})=\mathcal {F}$. Employing these computational methods we determine all such fusion systems on groups of order $p^n$ where $(p,n) \in \{(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(3,7),(5,4),(5,5),(5,6),(7,4),(7,5)\}$.

In this paper, first we propose a periodic representation, which we will call standard , for any quadratic irrational via $p$-adic continued fractions, even if it is not obtained by a specific algorithm. This periodic representation provides simultaneous rational approximations for a quadratic irrational both in $\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb Q_p$. Moreover given two primes $p_1$ and $p_2$, using the Binomial transform, we are also able to pass from approximations in $\mathbb {Q}_{p_1}$ to approximations in $\mathbb {Q}_{p_2}$ for a given quadratic irrational. Then, we focus on a specific $p$–adic continued fraction algorithm proving that it stops in a finite number of steps when processes rational numbers, solving a problem left open in a paper by Browkin [Math. Comp. 70 (2001), pp. 1281–1292]. Finally, we study the periodicity of this algorithm showing when it produces standard representations for quadratic irrationals.},

  abstract     = {The Gaussian kernel plays a central role in machine learning, uncertainty quantification and scattered data approximation, but has received relatively little attention from a numerical analysis standpoint. The basic problem of finding an algorithm for efficient numerical integration of functions reproduced by Gaussian kernels has not been fully solved. In this article we construct two classes of algorithms that use $N$ evaluations to integrate $d$-variate functions reproduced by Gaussian kernels and prove the exponential or super-algebraic decay of their worst-case errors. In contrast to earlier work, no constraints are placed on the length-scale parameter of the Gaussian kernel. The first class of algorithms is obtained via an appropriate scaling of the classical Gauss–Hermite rules. For these algorithms we derive lower and upper bounds on the worst-case error of the forms $\exp (-c_1 N^{1/d}) N^{1/(4d)}$ and $\exp (-c_2 N^{1/d}) N^{-1/(4d)}$, respectively, for positive constants $c_1 &gt; c_2$. The second class of algorithms we construct is more flexible and uses worst-case optimal weights for points that may be taken as a nested sequence. For these algorithms we derive upper bounds of the form $\exp (-c_3 N^{1/(2d)})$ for a positive constant $c_3$.},

However, to develop their full power, subdivision schemes should be incorporated into a multiresolution analysis that, mimicking wavelet analyses, provides a multi-scale decomposition of a function, a curve, or a surface. The ingredients needed to define a multiresolution analysis associated to a subdivision scheme are a decimation scheme and detail operators. Their construction is not straightforward as soon as the subdivision scheme is non-interpolatory. This paper is devoted to the construction of decimation schemes and detail operators compatible with general subdivision schemes, including non-linear ones. Analysis of the performances of the constructed analyses is carried out. Some numerical applications are presented in the framework of image approximation.},

We develop the theory and present examples of our approach, where we compute complete Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamical systems. A complete Lyapunov function characterizes the behaviour of a general dynamical system. In particular, the state space is divided into the chain-recurrent set, where the complete Lyapunov function is constant along solutions, and the part characterizing the gradient-like flow, where the complete Lyapunov function is strictly decreasing along solutions. We propose a new method to compute a complete Lyapunov function as the solution of a quadratic minimization problem, for which no information about the chain-recurrent set is required. The solutions to the discretized problems, which can be solved using quadratic programming, converge to the complete Lyapunov function.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we propose and analyze a finite difference numerical scheme for the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equation (PNP) system. To understand the energy structure of the PNP model, we make use of the Energetic Variational Approach (EnVarA), so that the PNP system could be reformulated as a non-constant mobility $H^{-1}$ gradient flow, with singular logarithmic energy potentials involved. To ensure the unique solvability and energy stability, the mobility function is explicitly treated, while both the logarithmic and the electric potential diffusion terms are treated implicitly, due to the convex nature of these two energy functional parts. The positivity-preserving property for both concentrations, $n$ and $p$, is established at a theoretical level. This is based on the subtle fact that the singular nature of the logarithmic term around the value of $0$ prevents the numerical solution reaching the singular value, so that the numerical scheme is always well-defined. In addition, an optimal rate convergence analysis is provided in this work, in which many highly non-standard estimates have to be involved, due to the nonlinear parabolic coefficients. The higher order asymptotic expansion (up to third order temporal accuracy and fourth order spatial accuracy), the rough error estimate (to establish the $\ell ^\infty$ bound for $n$ and $p$), and the refined error estimate have to be carried out to accomplish such a convergence result. In our knowledge, this work will be the first to combine the following three theoretical properties for a numerical scheme for the PNP system: (i) unique solvability and positivity, (ii) energy stability, and (iii) optimal rate convergence. A few numerical results are also presented in this article, which demonstrates the robustness of the proposed numerical scheme.},

  abstract     = {The shifted boundary method (SBM) is an approximate domain method for boundary value problems, in the broader class of unfitted/embedded/immersed methods. It has proven to be quite efficient in handling problems with complex geometries, ranging from Poisson to Darcy, from Navier-Stokes to elasticity and beyond. The key feature of the SBM is a shift in the location where Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied—from the true to a surrogate boundary—and an appropriate modification (again, a shift ) of the value of the boundary conditions, in order to reduce the consistency error. In this paper we provide a sound analysis of the method in smooth domains and in domains with corners, highlighting the influence of geometry and distance between exact and surrogate boundaries upon the convergence rate. We consider the Poisson problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions as a model and we first detail a procedure to obtain the crucial shifting between the surrogate and the true boundaries. Next, we give a sufficient condition for the well-posedness and stability of the discrete problem. The behavior of the consistency error arising from shifting the boundary conditions is thoroughly analyzed, for smooth boundaries and for boundaries with corners and edges. The convergence rate is proven to be optimal in the energy norm, and is further enhanced in the $L^2$-norm.},

Unlike prior works, however, we focus on convergence rates with respect to the overall computational costs. In explicit terms, the proposed adaptive strategy thus guarantees quasi-optimal computational time. In particular, our analysis covers linear problems, where the linear systems are solved by an optimally preconditioned CG method as well as nonlinear problems with strongly monotone nonlinearity which are linearized by the so-called Zarantonello iteration.},

The numerical approximation of the posterior expectation, given data, then amounts to a high- or infinite-dimensional numerical integration problem. We consider in particular so-called Besov priors on the admissible uncertain inputs. We extend the QMC convergence theory from the Gaussian case, and establish sufficient conditions on the uncertain inputs for achieving dimension-independent convergence rates greater than $1/2$ of QMC integration with randomly shifted lattice rules.

  abstract     = {A block FETI–DP/BDDC preconditioner for mixed formulations of almost incompressible elasticity is constructed and analyzed; FETI–DP (Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting Dual-Primal) and BDDC (Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraints) are two very successful domain decomposition algorithms for a variety of elliptic problems. The saddle point problems of the mixed problems are discretized with mixed isogeometric analysis with continuous pressure fields. As in previous work by Tu and Li (2015) for finite element discretizations of the incompressible Stokes system, the proposed preconditioner is applied to a reduced positive definite system involving only the pressure interface variable and the Lagrange multiplier of the FETI–DP algorithm. In this work, we extend the theory to a wider class of saddle point problems and we propose a novel block-preconditioning strategy, which consists in using BDDC with deluxe scaling for the interface pressure block as well as deluxe scaling for the FETI–DP preconditioner for the Lagrange multiplier block. A convergence rate analysis is presented with a condition number bound for the preconditioned operator which depends on the inf-sup parameter of the fully assembled problem and the condition number of a closely related BDDC algorithm for compressible elasticity. This bound is scalable in the number of subdomains, poly-logarithmic in the ratio of subdomain and element sizes, and robust with respect to material incompressibility. Parallel numerical experiments validate the theory, demonstrate robustness in the presence of discontinuities of the Lamé parameters, and indicate how the rate of convergence varies with respect to the spline polynomial degree and regularity and the deformation of the domain.},

  abstract     = {$L^2$ stable discontinuous Galerkin method with a family of numerical fluxes was studied for the one-dimensional wave equation by Cheng, Chou, Li, and Xing in [Math. Comp. 86 (2017), pp. 121–155]. Although optimal convergence rates were numerically observed with wide choices of parameters in the numerical fluxes, their error estimates were only proved for a sub-family with the construction of a local projection. In this paper, we first complete the one-dimensional analysis by providing optimal error estimates that match all numerical observations in that paper. The key ingredient is to construct an optimal global projection with the characteristic decomposition. We then extend the analysis on optimal error estimate to multidimensions by constructing a global projection on unstructured meshes, which can be considered as a perturbation away from the local projection studied by Cockburn, Gopalakrishnan, and Sayas in [Math. Comp. 79 (2010), pp. 1351–1367] for hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods. As a main contribution, we use a novel energy argument to prove the optimal approximation property of the global projection. This technique does not require explicit assembly of the matrix for the perturbed terms and hence can be easily used for unstructured meshes in multidimensions. Finally, numerical tests in two dimensions are provided to validate our analysis is sharp and at least one of the unknowns will degenerate to suboptimal rates if the assumptions are not satisfied.},

With this perspective, the phase space is naturally endowed with a Poisson manifold structure which encodes the physical properties, symmetries, and conservation laws of the dynamics. The goal is to design reduced basis methods for the general state-dependent degenerate Poisson structure based on a two-step approach. First, via a local approximation of the Poisson tensor, we split the Hamiltonian dynamics into an “almost symplectic” part and the trivial evolution of the Casimir invariants. Second, canonically symplectic reduced basis techniques are applied to the nontrivial component of the dynamics, preserving the local Poisson tensor kernel exactly. The global Poisson structure and the conservation properties of the phase flow are retained by the reduced model in the constant-valued case and up to errors in the Poisson tensor approximation in the state-dependent case. A priori error estimates for the solution of the reduced system are established. A set of numerical simulations is presented to corroborate the theoretical findings.},

The schemes developed so far in the classic works of Tadmor, Johnson and their collaborators start from an appropriate entropy conservative formulation of the system. Then entropy diminishing schemes are obtained by adding appropriate artificial diffusion terms. This program was based on the formulation of the HCL using the entropy variables. In this work we propose an alternative approach which has as a starting point a new mixed reformulation of the hyperbolic system which retains the original variables but still allows for conservative discretisation. The original variables are approximated directly and significant flexibility is allowed in the design of the corresponding computational algorithms. New finite element schemes are introduced and analysed. It is shown that the resulting approximations are consistent at the limit to an entropy weak and when appropriate to an entropy measure valued solution.},

It is then natural to look for numerical schemes that independently solve the scalar equations and couple the solutions at the boundary. The case of rigid boundary condition was treated by Burel [Ph.D. thesis, Université Paris Sud-Paris XI (2014)] and Burel et al. [Numer. Anal. Appl. 5 (2012), pp. 136–143]. However the case of traction free boundary condition was proven by Martinez et al. [J. Sci. Comput. 77 (2018), pp. 1832–1873] to be unstable if a straightforward approach is used. Then an adequate functional framework as well as a time domain mixed formulation to circumvent these issues was presented. In this work we first review the formulation presented by Martinez et al.

A trace FEM based on standard Taylor–Hood (continuous $\mathbf P_2$–$P_1$) bulk elements is proposed. A so-called volume normal derivative stabilization, known from the literature on trace FEM, is an essential ingredient of this method. The key result proved in the paper is an inf-sup stability of the trace $\mathbf P_2$–$P_1$ finite element pair, with the stability constant uniformly bounded with respect to the discretization parameter and the position of the surface in the bulk mesh. Optimal order convergence of a consistent variant of the FEM follows from this new stability result and interpolation properties of the trace FEM. Properties of the method are illustrated with numerical examples.},

An LP has order $m$ if it is divisible by $(x-1)^m$. The problem of finding the set $L_m$ of lengths of LPs of order $m$ is equivalent to finding the lengths of spectral-null codes of order $m$, and to finding $n$ such that $[n]$ admits a partition into two subsets whose first $m$ moments are equal. Extending the techniques and results initiated by Boyd, we completely determine $L_7$ and $L_8$, and prove that $\min L_9=192$ and $\min L_{10}=240$. Our primary tools are (a) symmetry, and (b) the use of carefully targeted searches using integer linear programming both to find LPs and to disprove their existence for specific $n$ and $m$. Symmetry plays an unexpected role and leads to the concept of regenerative pairs , which produce infinite arithmetic progressions in $L_m$. We prove for $m \le$ 8 (and conjecture later for all $m$) that whenever there is an LP of length $n$ and order $m$, there is one of length $n$ and order $m$ that is symmetric (resp. antisymmetric) if $m$ is even (resp. odd).},

  abstract     = {In the present paper we study quasi-Monte Carlo rules for approximating integrals over the $d$-dimensional unit cube for functions from weighted Sobolev spaces of regularity one. While the properties of these rules are well understood for anchored Sobolev spaces, this is not the case for the ANOVA spaces, which are another very important type of reference spaces for quasi-Monte Carlo rules. Using a direct approach we provide a formula for the worst case error of quasi-Monte Carlo rules for functions from weighted ANOVA spaces. As a consequence we bound the worst case error from above in terms of weighted discrepancy of the employed integration nodes. On the other hand we also obtain a general lower bound in terms of the number $n$ of used integration nodes. For the one-dimensional case our results lead to the optimal integration rule and also in the two-dimensional case we provide rules yielding optimal convergence rates.},

  abstract     = {Several convergent expansions are available for most of the special functions of the mathematical physics, as well as some asymptotic expansions [NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions, 2010]. Usually, both type of expansions are given in terms of elementary functions; the convergent expansions provide a good approximation for small values of a certain variable, whereas the asymptotic expansions provide a good approximation for large values of that variable. Also, quite often, those expansions are not uniform: the convergent expansions fail for large values of the variable and the asymptotic expansions fail for small values. In recent papers [Bujanda &amp; all, 2018-2019] we have designed new expansions of certain special functions, given in terms of elementary functions, that are uniform in certain variables, providing good approximations of those special functions in large regions of the variables, in particular for large and small values of the variables. The technique used in [Bujanda &amp; all, 2018-2019] is based on a suitable integral representation of the special function. In this paper we face the problem of designing a general theory of uniform approximations of special functions based on their integral representations. Then, we consider the following integral transform of a function $g(t)$ with kernel $h(t,z)$, $F(z)\coloneq \int _0^1h(t,z)g(t)dt$. We require for the function $h(t,z)$ to be uniformly bounded for $z\in \mathcal {D}\subset \mathbb {C}$ by a function $H(t)$ integrable in $t\in [0,1]$, and for the function $g(t)$ to be analytic in an open region $\Omega$ that contains the open interval $(0,1)$. Then, we derive expansions of $F(z)$ in terms of the moments of the function $h$, $M[h(\cdot ,z),n]\coloneq \int _0^1h(t,z)t^ndt$, that are uniformly convergent for $z\in \mathcal {D}$. The convergence of the expansion is of exponential order $\mathcal {O}(a^{-n})$, $a&gt;1$, when $[0,1]\in \Omega$ and of power order $\mathcal {O}(n^{-b})$, $b&gt;0$, when $[0,1]\notin \Omega$. Most of the special functions $F(z)$ having an integral representation may be cast in this form, possibly after an appropriate change of the integration variable. Then, special interest has the case when the moments $M[h(\cdot ,z),n]$ are elementary functions of $z$, because in that case the uniformly convergent expansion derived for $F(z)$ is given in terms of elementary functions. We illustrate the theory with several examples of special functions different from those considered in [Bujanda &amp; all, 2018-2019].},

These bounds are universal in the sense that they hold for a large class of potentials $h$ and in the sense of Levenshtein. Moreover, codes attaining the bounds are universally optimal in the sense of Cohn-Kumar. Referring to Levenshtein bounds and the energy bounds of the authors as “first level”, our results can be considered as “next level” universal bounds as they have the same general nature and imply necessary and sufficient conditions for their local and global optimality. For this purpose, we introduce the notion of Universal Lower Bound space (ULB-space), a space that satisfies certain quadrature and interpolation properties. While there are numerous cases for which our method applies, we will emphasize the model examples of $24$ points ($24$-cell) and $120$ points ($600$-cell) on $\mathbb {S}^3$. In particular, we provide a new proof that the $600$-cell is universally optimal, and in so doing, we derive optimality of the $600$-cell on a class larger than the absolutely monotone potentials considered by Cohn-Kumar.},

They allow to approximate (optimal) feasible solutions of continuous relaxations of mixed-integer control problems (MIOCPs) with integer controls arbitrarily close. To this end, they use compactness properties of the underlying state equation, a feature that is tied to the infinite-dimensional vantage point. In this work, we consider a class of MIOCPs that are constrained by pointwise mixed state-control constraints. We show that a continuous relaxation that involves so-called vanishing constraints has beneficial properties for the described approximation methodology. Moreover, we complete recent work on a variant of the sum-up rounding algorithm for this problem class. In particular, we prove that the observed infeasibility of the produced integer-valued controls vanishes in an $L^\infty$-sense with respect to the considered relaxation. Moreover, we improve the bound on the control approximation error to a value that is asymptotically tight.},

  abstract     = {We propose two approximate versions of the first-order primal-dual algorithm (PDA) to solve a class of convex-concave saddle point problems. The introduced approximate criteria are easy to implement in the sense that they only involve the subgradient of a certain function at the current iterate. The first approximate PDA solves both subproblems inexactly and adopts the absolute error criteria, which are based on non-negative summable sequences. Assuming that one of the PDA subproblems can be solved exactly, the second approximate PDA solves the other subproblem approximately and adopts a relative error criterion. The relative error criterion only involves a single parameter in the range of $[0, 1)$, which makes the method more applicable. For both versions, we establish the global convergence and $O(1/N)$ convergence rate measured by the iteration complexity, where $N$ counts the number of iterations. For the inexact PDA with absolute error criteria, we show the accelerated $O(1/N^2)$ and linear convergence rate under the assumptions that a part of the underlying functions and both underlying functions are strongly convex, respectively. Then, we prove that these inexact criteria can also be extended to solve a class of more general problems. Finally, we perform some numerical experiments on sparse recovery and image processing problems. The results demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed methods.},

The second-order temporal convergence can be recovered if almost all of time-step ratios $r_k\le 1+\sqrt {2}$ or some high-order starting scheme is used. Specially, for linear dissipative diffusion problems, the stable BDF2 method preserves both the energy dissipation law (in the $H^1$ seminorm) and the $L^2$ norm monotonicity at the discrete levels.

Three time discretizations are considered: the implicit-in-time scheme and two non-iterative pressure correction schemes. The two latter schemes differ by the discretization of the convection term: linearly implicit for the first one, so that the resulting scheme is unconditionally stable, and explicit for the second one, so that the scheme is stable under a CFL condition involving the material velocity only. We prove rigorously that these three variants are asymptotic preserving in the following sense: for a given mesh and a given time step, a sequence of solutions obtained with a sequence of vanishing Mach numbers tends to a solution of a standard scheme for incompressible flows. This convergence result is obtained by mimicking the proof of convergence of the solutions of the (continuous) barotropic Navier-Stokes equations to that of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation as the Mach number vanishes. Numerical results performed with a hand-built analytical solution show the behaviour that is expected from the analysis. Additional numerical results are obtained for the shock solutions of problems which are not in the scope of the present non dimensionalization but are nevertheless interesting to understand the behaviour of the scheme.},

By establishing weak linear independence of some subsets of zeros of the Riemann zeta function, we establish an effective proof of the lower bound, with significantly larger bounds on the constant compared to those obtained in prior work.

For $p$ in the range $1 \le p \le 2,$ we obtain Gaussian tail bounds for the corresponding probabilistic convergence. Our result for the case $p=\infty$ confirms a conjecture raised by the second and third authors. Monte Carlo simulations (presented at the end of the article) show that the stochastic Bernstein approximation scheme studied herein achieves comparable computational goals to the classical Bernstein approximation, and indicate strongly that the Gaussian tail bounds proved for $1 \le p \le 2$ also hold true for the cases $2&lt; p \le \infty$.},

The construction led to an error bound that achieves the best possible rate of convergence for lattice algorithms. Previously available literature covered only weights of a simple form commonly known as product weights . In this paper we address the computational aspect of the construction. We develop fast CBC construction of lattice algorithms for special forms of weight parameters, including the so-called POD weights and SPOD weights which arise from PDE applications, making the lattice algorithms truly applicable in practice. With $d$ denoting the dimension and $n$ the number of lattice points, we show that the construction cost is $\mathcal {O}(d n\log (n) + d^2\log (d) n)$ for POD weights, and $\mathcal {O}(d n\log (n) + d^3\sigma ^2 n)$ for SPOD weights of degree $\sigma \ge 2$. The resulting lattice generating vectors can be used in other lattice-based approximation algorithms, including kernel methods or splines.},

Several discretizations of this problem have been proposed, leading to computations on flat spaces as well as Riemannian manifolds, with extensions to mean field games and gradient flows in the Wasserstein space. In this paper, we provide a framework which guarantees convergence under mesh refinement of the solutions of the space-time discretized problems to the one of the infinite-dimensional problem for quadratic optimal transport. The convergence holds without condition on the ratio between spatial and temporal step sizes, and can handle arbitrary positive measures as input, while the underlying space can be a Riemannian manifold. Both the finite volume discretization proposed by Gladbach, Kopfer, and Maas, as well as the discretization over triangulations of surfaces studied by the present author in collaboration with Claici, Chien, and Solomon, fit in this framework.},

Getting a numerical approximate solution of these problems is a challenging issue of practical importance. In this work, we investigate the relaxation of the OT problem when the marginal constraints are replaced by some moment constraints. Using Tchakaloff’s theorem, we show that the moment constrained optimal transport problem (MCOT) is achieved by a finite discrete measure. Interestingly, for multimarginal OT problems, the number of points weighted by this measure scales linearly with the number of marginal laws, which is encouraging to bypass the curse of dimension. This approximation method is also relevant for Martingale OT problems. We show the convergence of the MCOT problem toward the corresponding OT problem. In some fundamental cases, we obtain rates of convergence in $O(1/n)$ or $O(1/n^2)$ where $n$ is the number of moments, which illustrates the role of the moment functions. Last, we present algorithms exploiting the fact that the MCOT is reached by a finite discrete measure and provide numerical examples of approximations.},

  abstract     = {For a matrix $X\in \mathbb {R}^{n\times p}$, we provide an analytic formula that keeps track of an orthonormal basis for the range of $X$ under rank-one modifications. More precisely, we consider rank-one adaptations $X_{new} = X+ab^T$ of a given $X$ with known matrix factorization $X = UW$, where $U\in \mathbb {R}^{n\times p}$ is column-orthogonal and $W\in \mathbb {R}^{p\times p}$ is invertible. Arguably, the most important methods that produce such factorizations are the singular value decomposition (SVD), where $X=UW=U(\Sigma V^T)$, and the QR-decomposition, where $X = UW = QR$. We give a geometric description of rank-one adaptations and derive a closed-form expression for the geodesic line that travels from the subspace $\mathcal {S}= \textrm {{ran}}(X)$ to the subspace $\mathcal {S}_{new} =\textrm {{ran}}(X_{new}) =\textrm {{ran}}(U_{new}W_{new})$. This leads to update formulas for orthogonal matrix decompositions, where both $U_{new}$ and $W_{new}$ are obtained via elementary rank-one matrix updates in $\mathcal {O}(np)$ time for $n\gg p$. Moreover, this allows us to determine the subspace distance and the Riemannian midpoint between the subspaces $\mathcal {S}$ and $\mathcal {S}_{new}$ without additional computational effort.},

To solve this type of problems, implicit-explicit (IMEX) multistep methods have been widely used and their performance is understood well in the non-stiff regime ($\varepsilon =O(1)$) and limiting regime ($\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$). However, in the intermediate regime (say, $\varepsilon =O(\Delta t)$), uniform accuracy has been reported numerically without a complete theoretical justification (except some asymptotic or stability analysis). In this work, we prove the uniform accuracy – an optimal a priori error bound – of a class of IMEX multistep methods, IMEX backward differentiation formulas (IMEX-BDF), for linear hyperbolic systems with stiff relaxation. The proof is based on the energy estimate with a new multiplier technique. For nonlinear hyperbolic and kinetic equations, we numerically verify the same property using a series of examples.},

  abstract     = {The focus of this work is a posteriori error estimation for stochastic Galerkin approximations of parameter-dependent linear elasticity equations. The starting point is a three-field partial differential equation model with the Young modulus represented as an affine function of a countable set of parameters. We introduce a weak formulation, establish its stability with respect to a weighted norm and discuss its approximation using stochastic Galerkin mixed finite element methods. We motivate an a posteriori error estimation scheme and establish upper and lower bounds for the approximation error. The constants in the bounds are independent of the Poisson ratio as well as the spatial and parametric discretisation parameters. We also discuss proxies for the error reduction associated with enrichments of the approximation spaces and we develop an adaptive algorithm that terminates when the estimated error falls below a user-prescribed tolerance. The error reduction proxies are shown to be reliable and efficient in the incompressible limit case. Numerical results are presented to supplement the theory. All experiments were performed using open source (IFISS) software that is available online.},

The scheme is energy-stable, only involves physically motivated quantities in its definition, and is able to handle general unstructured grids. Its convergence is rigorously proven thanks to compactness arguments, under very general assumptions. Although the scheme is based on Lagrange finite elements of degree 1, it is locally conservative after a local postprocess giving rise to an equilibrated flux. This also allows to derive a guaranteed a posteriori error estimate for the approximate solution. Numerical experiments are presented in order to give evidence of a very good behavior of the proposed scheme in various situations involving strong anisotropy and drift terms.},

  abstract     = {The Canham-Helfrich-Evans models of biomembranes consist of a family of geometric constrained variational problems. In this article, we compare two classes of numerical methods for these variational problems based on piecewise linear (PL) and subdivision surfaces (SS). Since SS methods are based on spline approximation and can be viewed as higher order versions of PL methods, one may expect that the only difference between the two methods is in the accuracy order. In this paper, we prove that a numerical method based on minimizing any one of the ‘PL Willmore energies’ proposed in the literature would fail to converge to a solution of the continuous problem, whereas a method based on minimization of the bona fide Willmore energy, well-defined for SS but not PL surfaces, succeeds. Motivated by this analysis, we propose also a regularization method for the PL method based on techniques from conformal geometry. We address a number of implementation issues crucial for the efficiency of our solver. A software package called Wmincon accompanies this article, and provides parallel implementations of all the relevant geometric functionals. When combined with a standard constrained optimization solver, the geometric variational problems can then be solved numerically. To this end, we realize that some of the available optimization algorithms/solvers are capable of preserving symmetry, while others manage to break symmetry; we explore the consequences of this observation.},

First, a smoothing Newton-type algorithm is proposed for the TEiCP based on the CHKS smoothing function. Its global convergence is established under some mild conditions. Numerical experiments are reported to show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and could detect more solutions than some existing methods. Second, we apply the proposed algorithm to solve the eigenvalue problem of nonnegative tensors. We analyze the relationship between the TEiCP and the H-eigenpair and Z-eigenpair problems of an irreducible nonnegative tensor. We show that the TEiCP with an irreducible nonnegative tensor and unit tensor has a unique solution, which is just the unique positive H-eigenpair of the irreducible nonnegative tensor. We also show that the solution set of the TEiCP with an irreducible nonnegative tensor and identity tensor is nonempty and its solutions are positive. Moreover, we can obtain positive Z-eigenpairs of the irreducible nonnegative tensor from these solutions. Finally, we also apply the proposed algorithm to find the unique positive H-eigenpair and a positive Z-eigenpair of an irreducible nonnegative tensor; the numerical results indicate its efficiency and promising performance.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider the numerical integration of the nonlinear Dirac equation and the Dirac–Poisson system (NDEs) under rough initial data. We propose an ultra low-regularity integrator (ULI) for solving the NDEs which enables optimal first-order time convergence in $H^r$ for solutions in $H^{r}$, i.e., without requiring any additional regularity on the solution. In contrast to classical methods, a ULI overcomes the numerical loss of derivatives and is therefore more efficient and accurate for approximating low regular solutions. Convergence theorems and the extension of a ULI to second order are established. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and underline the favourable error behaviour of the new method at low regularity compared to classical integration schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we provide a detailed convergence analysis for a first order stabilized linear semi-implicit numerical scheme for the nonlocal Cahn–Hilliard equation, which follows from consistency and stability estimates for the numerical error function. Due to the complicated form of the nonlinear term, we adopt the discrete $H^{-1}$ norm for the error function to establish the convergence result. In addition, the energy stability obtained by Du et al., [J. Comput. Phys. 363 (2018), pp. 39–54] requires an assumption on the uniform $\ell ^\infty$ bound of the numerical solution, and such a bound is figured out in this paper by conducting the higher order consistency analysis. Taking the view that the numerical solution is indeed the exact solution with a perturbation, the error function is $\ell ^\infty$ bounded uniformly under a loose constraint of the time step size, which then leads to the uniform maximum-norm bound of the numerical solution.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the three concepts of consistency, stability and convergence in the context of compact finite volume schemes for systems of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. The treatment utilizes the framework of “balance laws”. Such laws express the relevant physical conservation laws in the presence of discontinuities. Finite volume approximations employ this viewpoint, and the present paper can be regarded as being in this category. It is first shown that under very mild conditions a weak solution is indeed a solution to the balance law. The schemes considered here allow the computation of several quantities per mesh cell (e.g., slopes) and the notion of consistency must be extended to this framework. Then a suitable convergence theorem is established, generalizing the classical convergence theorem of Lax and Wendroff. Finally, the limit functions are shown to be entropy solutions by using a notion of “Godunov compatibility”, which serves as a substitute to the entropy condition.},

  abstract     = {Analysis of Galerkin-mixed FEMs for incompressible miscible flow in porous media has been investigated extensively in the last several decades. Of particular interest in practical applications is the lowest-order Galerkin-mixed method, in which a linear Lagrange FE approximation is used for the concentration and the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas FE approximation is used for the velocity/pressure. The previous works only showed the first-order accuracy of the method in $L^2$-norm in spatial direction, which however is not optimal and valid only under certain extra restrictions on both time step and spatial mesh. In this paper, we provide new and optimal $L^2$-norm error estimates of Galerkin-mixed FEMs for all three components in a general case. In particular, for the lowest-order Galerkin-mixed FEM, we show unconditionally the second-order accuracy in $L^2$-norm for the concentration. Numerical results for both two- and three-dimensional models are presented to confirm our theoretical analysis. More important is that our approach can be extended to the analysis of mixed FEMs for many strongly coupled systems to obtain optimal error estimates for all components.},

An L2-type discrete fractional-derivative operator of order $3-\alpha$ is considered on nonuniform temporal meshes. Sufficient conditions for the inverse-monotonicity of this operator are established, which yields sharp pointwise-in-time error bounds on quasi-graded temporal meshes with arbitrary degree of grading. In particular, those results imply that milder (compared to the optimal) grading yields optimal convergence rates in positive time. Semi-discretizations in time and full discretizations are addressed. The theoretical findings are illustrated by numerical experiments.},
