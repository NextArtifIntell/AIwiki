  abstract     = {We prove two new results on the $K$-polystability of $\mathbb {Q}$-Fano varieties based on purely algebro-geometric arguments. The first one says that any $K$-semistable log Fano cone has a special degeneration to a uniquely determined $K$-polystable log Fano cone. As a corollary, we combine it with the differential-geometric results to complete the proof of Donaldson-Sun’s conjecture which says that the metric tangent cone of any point appearing on a Gromov-Hausdorff limit of Kähler-Einstein Fano manifolds depends only on the algebraic structure of the singularity. The second result says that for any log Fano variety with the torus action, $K$-polystability is equivalent to equivariant $K$-polystability, that is, to check $K$-polystability, it is sufficient to check special test configurations which are equivariant under the torus action.},

A construction first considered by Kontsevich and Soibelman produces from this data a rigid analytic space $Y$, which can be considered as a variant of the $T$-dual introduced by Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow. We prove that the Fukaya category of tautologically unobstructed graded Lagrangians in $X$ embeds fully faithfully in the derived category of (twisted) coherent sheaves on $Y$, under the technical assumption that $\pi _2(Q)$ vanishes (all known examples satisfy this assumption). The main new tool is the construction and computation of Floer cohomology groups of Lagrangian fibres equipped with topological infinite rank local systems that correspond, under mirror symmetry, to the affinoid rings introduced by Tate, equipped with their natural topologies as Banach algebras.},

First we prove that the properness of $K$-energy in terms of $L^1$ geodesic distance $d_1$ in the space of Kähler potentials implies the existence of cscK metrics. We also show that the weak minimizers of the $K$-energy in $(\mathcal {E}^1, d_1)$ are smooth cscK potentials. Finally we show that the non-existence of cscK metric implies the existence of a destabilized $L^1$ geodesic ray where the $K$-energy is non-increasing, which is a weak version of a conjecture by Donaldson. The continuity path proposed by Xiuxiong Chen [Ann. Math. Qué. 42 (2018), pp. 69–189] is instrumental in the above proofs.},

These series are parametrized by subsets of spherical roots which determine the fine geometry of $Z$ at infinity. In particular, we obtain a generalization of the Maass-Selberg relations. As a corollary we obtain a partial geometric characterization of the discrete spectrum: $L^2(Z)_{\mathrm {disc}}\neq \emptyset$ if $\mathfrak {h}^\perp$ contains elliptic elements in its interior. In case $Z$ is a real reductive group or, more generally, a symmetric space our results retrieve the Plancherel formula of Harish-Chandra (for the group) as well as that of Delorme and van den Ban-Schlichtkrull (for symmetric spaces) up to the explicit determination of the discrete series for the inducing datum.},

This disproves a recent conjecture of Church, Farb, and Putman as well as an older, more general conjecture of Kontsevich.

In this paper, we obtain the first complete results for solutions to general linear difference equations associated with the shift operator $x\mapsto x+h$ ($h\in \mathbb {C}^*$), the $q$-difference operator $x\mapsto qx$ ($q\in \mathbb {C}^*$ not a root of unity), and the Mahler operator $x\mapsto x^p$ ($p\geq 2$ integer). The only restriction is that we constrain our solutions to be expressed as (possibly ramified) Laurent series in the variable $x$ with complex coefficients (or in the variable $1/x$ in some special case associated with the shift operator). Our proof is based on the parametrized difference Galois theory initiated by Hardouin and Singer. We also deduce from our main result a general statement about algebraic independence of values of Mahler functions and their derivatives at algebraic points.},

We give a simple necessary and sufficient condition for this, whose proof relies on the Decomposition Theorem and Saito’s theory of mixed Hodge modules. We use it to generalize the theorem of Greb-Kebekus-Kovács-Peternell to complex spaces with rational singularities, and to prove the existence of a functorial pull-back for reflexive differentials on such spaces. We also use our methods to settle the “local vanishing conjecture” proposed by Mustaţă, Olano, and Popa.},

  abstract     = {A new approach to stable motivic homotopy theory is given. It is based on Voevodsky’s theory of framed correspondences. Using the theory, framed motives of algebraic varieties are introduced and studied in the paper. They are the major computational tool for constructing an explicit quasi-fibrant motivic replacement of the suspension $\mathbb P^1$-spectrum of any smooth scheme $X\in Sm/k$. Moreover, it is shown that the bispectrum \begin{equation*} (M_{fr}(X),M_{fr}(X)(1),M_{fr}(X)(2),\ldots ), \end{equation*} each term of which is a twisted framed motive of $X$, has the motivic homotopy type of the suspension bispectrum of $X$. Furthermore, an explicit computation of infinite $\mathbb P^1$-loop motivic spaces is given in terms of spaces with framed correspondences. We also introduce big framed motives of bispectra and show that they convert the classical Morel–Voevodsky motivic stable homotopy theory into an equivalent local theory of framed bispectra. As a topological application, it is proved that the framed motive $M_{fr}(pt)(pt)$ of the point $pt=\operatorname {Spec} k$ evaluated at $pt$ is a quasi-fibrant model of the classical sphere spectrum whenever the base field $k$ is algebraically closed of characteristic zero.},
