Rubin’s conjecture underlies Iwasawa theory of the anticyclotomic deformation of a CM elliptic curve over the CM field at primes $p$ of good supersingular reduction, notably the Iwasawa main conjecture in terms of the $p$-adic $L$-function.   As a consequence, we prove an inequality in the $p$-adic Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for Rubin’s $p$-adic $L$-function. Rubin’s conjecture is also an essential tool in our exploration of the arithmetic of Rubin’s $p$-adic $L$-function,    which includes a Bertolini–Darmon–Prasanna type formula.},

This proves part of the Beilinson–Bloch conjecture for Chow groups and $L$-functions, which generalizes the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Moreover, assuming the modularity of Kudla’s generating functions of special cycles, we explicitly construct elements in a certain $\pi $-nearly isotypic subspace of the Chow group by arithmetic theta lifting, and compute their heights in terms of the central derivative $L&#39;(1/2,\pi )$ and local doubling zeta integrals. This confirms the conjectural arithmetic inner product formula proposed by one of us, which generalizes the Gross–Zagier formula to higher dimensional motives.},

Erdős and Rado proved the sunflower lemma: for any fixed $r$, any family of sets of size $w$, with at least about $w^w$ sets, must contain a sunflower with $r$ petals. The famous sunflower conjecture states that the bound on the number of sets can be improved to $c^w$ for some constant $c$. In this paper, we improve the bound to about $(\log\, w)^w$. In fact, we prove the result for a robust notion of sunflowers, for which the bound we obtain is sharp up to lower order terms.},

The Threshold Theorem asserts that topologically trivial solutions with energy below twice the ground state energy are global and scatter. The Dichotomy Theorem applies to solutions in arbitrary topological class with large energy, and provides two exclusive alternatives: Either the solution is global and scatters, or it bubbles off a soliton in either finite time or infinite time. Using the caloric gauge developed in the first paper, the continuation/scattering criteria established in the second paper, and the large data analysis in an arbitrary topological class at optimal regularity in the third paper, here we perform a blow-up analysis that shows that the failure of global well-posedness and scattering implies either the existence of a soliton with at most the same energy bubbling off, or the existence of a non-trivial self-similar solution. The proof is completed by showing that the latter solutions do not exist.},

These conjectures predict the dimension and an explicit basis $\mathcal{T}_w$ of the span of characteristic $p$ multiple zeta values of fixed weight $w$ which were introduced by Thakur as analogues of classical multiple zeta values of Euler. In the present paper we first establish the algebraic part of these conjectures which states that the span of characteristic $p$ multiple zeta values of weight $w$ is generated by the set $\mathcal{T}_w$. As a consequence, we obtain upper bounds for the dimension. This is the analogue of Brown’s theorem and also those of Deligne-Goncharov and Terasoma. We then prove two results towards the transcendental part of these conjectures. First, we establish the linear independence for a large subset of $\mathcal{T}_w$ and yield lower bounds for the dimension. Second, for small weights we prove the linear independence for the whole set $\mathcal{T}_w$ and completely solve Zagier-Hoffman’s conjectures in positive characteristic. Our key tool is the Anderson-Brownawell-Papanikolas criterion for linear independence in positive characteristic.},

  abstract     = {We prove that dynamical degrees of rational self-maps on projective varieties can be interpreted as spectral radii of naturally defined operators on suitable Banach spaces. Generalizing Shokurov’s notion of $b$-divisors, we consider the space of $b$-classes of higher codimension cycles, and endow this space with various Banach norms. Building on these constructions, we design a natural extension to higher dimensions of the Picard-Manin space introduced by Cantat and Boucksom-Favre-Jonsson in the case of surfaces. We prove a version of the Hodge index theorem, and a surprising compactness result in this Banach space. We use these two theorems to infer a precise control of the sequence of degrees of iterates of a map under the assumption $\lambda _1^2&gt;\lambda _2$ on the dynamical degrees. As a consequence, we obtain that the dynamical degrees of an automorphism of the affine $3$-space are all algebraic numbers.},

It has at most finitely many rational points by the Mordell Conjecture, a theorem of Faltings. We show that the number of rational points is bounded only in terms of $g$, $d$, and the Mordell–Weil rank of the curve’s Jacobian, thereby answering in the affirmative a question of Mazur. In addition we obtain uniform bounds, in $g$ and $d$, for the number of geometric torsion points of the Jacobian which lie in the image of an Abel–Jacobi map. Both estimates generalize our previous work for one-parameter families. Our proof uses Vojta’s approach to the Mordell Conjecture, and the key new ingredient is the generalization of a height inequality due to the second- and third-named authors.},

A similar statement is proven for the $\lambda \phi^4$ fields over $\mathbb{R}^4$ with a lattice ultraviolet cutoff, in the limit of infinite volume and vanishing lattice spacing. The proofs are enabled by the models’ random current representation, in which the correlation functions’ deviation from Wick’s law is expressed in terms of intersection probabilities of random currents with sources at distances that are large on the model’s lattice scale. Guided by the analogy with random walk intersection amplitudes, the analysis focuses on the improvement of the so-called tree diagram bound by a logarithmic correction term, which is derived here through multi-scale analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we analyze the local and global boundary rigidity problem for general Riemannian manifolds with boundary $(M,g)$. We show that the boundary distance function, i.e., $d_g|_{\partial M\times \partial M}$, known near a point $p\in \partial M$ at which $\partial M$ is strictly convex, determines $g$ in a suitable neighborhood of $p$ in $M$, up to the natural diffeomorphism invariance of the problem. We also consider the closely related lens rigidity problem which is a more natural formulation if the boundary distance is not realized by unique minimizing geodesics. The lens relation measures the point and the direction of exit from $M$ of geodesics issued from the boundary and the length of the geodesic. The lens rigidity problem is whether we can determine the metric up to isometry from the lens relation. We solve the lens rigidity problem under the assumption that there is a function on $M$ with suitable convexity properties relative to $g$. This can be considered as a complete solution of a problem formulated first by Herglotz in 1905. We also prove a semi-global results given semi-global data. This shows, for instance, that simply connected manifolds with strictly convex boundaries are lens rigid if the sectional curvature is non-positive or non-negative or if there are no focal points. The key tool is the analysis of the geodesic X-ray transform on 2-tensors, corresponding to a metric $g$, in the normal gauge, such as normal coordinates relative to a hypersurface, where one also needs to allow weights. This is handled by refining and extending our earlier results in the solenoidal gauge.},

In this paper, we prove sharp filling inequalities for (arithmetic) lattices in higher rank semisimple Lie groups. When $n$ is less than the rank of the associated symmetric space, we show that the $n$-dimensional filling volume function of the lattice grows at the same rate as that of the associated symmetric space, and when $n$ is equal to the rank, we show that the $n$-dimensional filling volume function grows exponentially.

  abstract     = {A group $G$ is said to be $\frac {3}{2}$-generated if every nontrivial element belongs to a generating pair. It is easy to see that if $G$ has this property, then every proper quotient of $G$ is cyclic. In this paper we prove that the converse is true for finite groups, which settles a conjecture of Breuer, Guralnick and Kantor from 2008. In fact, we prove a much stronger result, which solves a problem posed by Brenner and Wiegold in 1975. Namely, if $G$ is a finite group and every proper quotient of $G$ is cyclic, then for any pair of nontrivial elements $x_1,x_2 \in G$, there exists $y \in G$ such that $G = \langle x_1, y \rangle = \langle x_2, y \rangle $. In other words, $s(G) \geqslant 2$, where $s(G)$ is the spread of $G$. Moreover, if $u(G)$ denotes the more restrictive uniform spread of $G$, then we can completely characterise the finite groups $G$ with $u(G) = 0$ and $u(G)=1$. To prove these results, we first establish a reduction to almost simple groups. For simple groups, the result was proved by Guralnick and Kantor in 2000 using probabilistic methods, and since then the almost simple groups have been the subject of several papers. By combining our reduction theorem and this earlier work, it remains to handle the groups with socle an exceptional group of Lie type, and this is the case we treat in this paper.},

In such cases, there is a filtration of the singular set, $S^0\subset S^1\cdots S^{n-1}:= S$, where $S^k:= \{x\in X:\text{ no tangent cone at $x$ is }(k+1)\text{-symmetric}\}$. Equivalently, $S^k$ is the set of points such that no tangent cone splits off a Euclidean factor $\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$. It is classical from Cheeger-Colding that the Hausdorff dimension of $S^k$ satisfies $\mathrm{dim}\, S^k\leq k$ and $S=S^{n-2}$, i.e., $S^{n-1}\setminus S^{n-2}=\emptyset$. However, little else has been understood about the structure of the singular set $S$. Our first result for such limit spaces $X^n$ states that $S^k$ is $k$-rectifiable for all $k$. In fact, we will show for $\mathcal H^k$-a.e. $x\in S^k$ that every tangent cone $X_x$ at $x$ is $k$-symmetric, i.e., that $X_x= \mathbb{R}^k\times C(Y)$ where $C(Y)$ might depend on the particular $X_x$. Here $\mathcal{H}^k$ denotes the $k$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. As an application we show for all $0\lt \epsilon\lt \epsilon(n,\mathrm{v})$ there exists an $(n-2)$-rectifiable closed set $S^{n-2}_\epsilon$ with $\mathcal{H}^{n-2}(S_{\epsilon}^{n-2}) &lt; C(n,\mathrm{v},\epsilon)$, such that $X^n\setminus S^{n-2}_\epsilon$ is $\epsilon$-bi-Hölder equivalent to a smooth Riemannian manifold. Moreover, $S=\bigcup_\epsilon S^{n-2}_\epsilon$. As another application, we show that tangent cones are unique $\mathcal H^{n-2}$-a.e. In the case of limit spaces $X^n$ satisfying a $2$-sided Ricci curvature bound $|\mathrm{Ric}_{M^n_i}|\leq n-1$, we can use these structural results to give a new proof of a conjecture from Cheeger-Colding stating that $S$ is $(n-4)$-rectifiable with uniformly bounded measure. We can also conclude from this structure that tangent cones are unique $\mathcal H^{n-4}$-a.e. Our analysis builds on the notion of quantitative stratification introduced by Cheeger-Naber, and the neck region analysis developed by Jiang-Naber-Valtorta. Several new ideas and new estimates are required, including a sharp cone-splitting theorem and a geometric transformation theorem, which will allow us to control the degeneration of harmonic functions on these neck regions.},

  abstract     = {We study log canonical thresholds (also called global log canonical threshold or $\alpha $-invariant) of $\mathbb R$-linear systems. We prove existence of positive lower bounds in different settings, in particular, proving a conjecture of Ambro. We then show that the Borisov-Alexeev-Borisov conjecture holds; that is, given a natural number $d$ and a positive real number $\epsilon $, the set of Fano varieties of dimension $d$ with $\epsilon $-log canonical singularities forms a bounded family. This implies that birational automorphism groups of rationally connected varieties are Jordan which, in particular, answers a question of Serre. Next we show that if the log canonical threshold of the anti-canonical system of a Fano variety is at most one, then it is computed by some divisor, answering a question of Tian in this case.},

  abstract     = {Let $k$ be a non-archimedean local field with residual characteristic $p$. Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over $k$ that splits over a tamely ramified field extension of $k$. Suppose $p$ does not divide the order of the Weyl group of $G$. Then we show that every smooth irreducible complex representation of $G(k)$ contains an $\mathfrak {s}$-type of the form constructed by Kim–Yu and that every irreducible supercuspidal representation arises from Yu’s construction. This improves an earlier result of Kim, which held only in characteristic zero and with a very large and ineffective bound on $p$. By contrast, our bound on $p$ is explicit and tight, and our result holds in positive characteristic as well. Moreover, our approach is more explicit in extracting an input for Yu’s construction from a given representation.},

In analogy with Quillen’s results in the rational case, we prove that this $v_n$-periodic homotopy theory is equivalent to the homotopy theory of Lie algebras in $T(n)$-local spectra. We also compare it to the homotopy theory of commutative coalgebras in $T(n)$-local spectra, where it turns out there is only an equivalence up to a certain convergence issue of the Goodwillie tower of the identity.},

  abstract     = {Consider a Riemannian manifold with bounded Ricci curvature $|\mathrm{Ric}|\leq n-1$ and the noncollapsing lower volume bound $\mathrm{Vol}(B_1(p))&gt;\mathrm{v}&gt;0$. The first main result of this paper is to prove that we have the $L^2$ curvature bound $⨏_{B_1(p)}|\mathrm{Rm}|^2(x)\, dx &lt; C(n,\mathrm{v})$,which proves the $L^2$ conjecture. In order to prove this, we will need to first show the following structural result for limits. Namely, if $(M^n_j,d_j,p_j) \longrightarrow (X,d,p)$ is a $\mathrm{GH}$-limit of noncollapsed manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature, then the singular set $\mathcal{S}(X)$ is $n-4$ rectifiable with the uniform Hausdorff measure estimates $H^{n-4}(\mathcal{S}(X)\cap B_1) &lt; C(n,\mathrm{v})$ which, in particular, proves the $n-4$-finiteness conjecture of Cheeger-Colding. We will see as a consequence of the proof that for $n-4$ a.e. $x\in \mathcal{S}(X)$, the tangent cone of $X$ at $x$ is unique and isometric to $\mathbb{R}^{n-4}\times C(S^3/\Gamma_x)$ for some $\Gamma_x\subseteq O(4)$ that acts freely away from the origin.},

For smaller classes, we give solutions among solvable groups of exponential volume growth. As corollaries, we prove a recent conjecture of Amir on joint evaluation of speed and entropy exponents and we obtain a new proof of the existence of uncountably many pairwise non-quasi-isometric solvable groups, originally due to Cornulier and Tessera.
