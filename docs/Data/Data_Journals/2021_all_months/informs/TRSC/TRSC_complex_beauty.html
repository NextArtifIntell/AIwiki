This is when a deterministic fraction of the low-fare customer class that cannot book early are willing to book the higher fare later. This simple model with dependent demands is difficult to analyze. Some well-known publications, such as Talluri and van Ryzin ( 2004 ) and Phillips ( 2005 ), treat this model incorrectly. In this note, we correct an erroneous formula for the modified fare ratio with the proper probabilistic interpretation. The correction was established previously by Brumelle et al. ( 1990 ). Numerical examples reveal that the corrected modified fare ratio provides a lower optimal booking limit, resulting in a higher expected revenue than those obtained by using the incorrect modified fare ratio.},

  abstract     = {Competition between one-way car-sharing operators is currently increasing. Fleet relocation as a means to compensate demand imbalances constitutes a major cost factor in a business with low profit margins. Existing decision support models have so far ignored the aspect of a competitor when the fleet is rebalanced for better availability. We present mixed-integer linear programming formulations for a pickup and delivery orienteering problem under different business models with multiple (competing) operators. Structural solution properties, including existence of equilibria and bounds on losses as a result of competition, of the competitive pickup and delivery problem under the restrictions of unit-demand stations, homogeneous payoffs, and indifferent customers based on results for congestion games are derived. Two algorithms to find a Nash equilibrium for real-life instances are proposed. One can find equilibria in the most general case; the other can only be applied if the game can be represented as a congestion game, that is, under the restrictions of homogeneous payoffs, unit-demand stations, and indifferent customers. In a numerical study, we compare different business models for car-sharing operations, including a merger between operators and outsourcing relocation operations to a common service provider (coopetition). Gross profit improvements achieved by explicitly incorporating competitor decisions are substantial, and the presence of competition decreases gross profits for all operators (compared with a merger). Using a Munich, Germany, case study, we quantify the gross profit gains resulting from considering competition as approximately 35\% (over assuming absence of competition) and 12\% (over assuming that the competitor is omnipresence) and the losses because of the presence of competition to be approximately 10\%.},

  abstract     = {Ride-sourcing services play an increasingly important role in meeting mobility needs in many metropolitan areas. Yet, aside from delivering passengers from their origins to destinations, ride-sourcing vehicles generate a significant number of vacant trips from the end of one customer delivery trip to the start of the next. These vacant trips create additional traffic demand and may worsen traffic conditions in urban networks. Capturing the congestion effect of these vacant trips poses a great challenge to the modeling practice of transportation planning agencies. With ride-sourcing services, vehicular trips are the outcome of the interactions between service providers and passengers, a missing ingredient in the current traffic assignment methodology. In this paper, we enhance the methodology by explicitly modeling those vacant trips, which include cruising for customers and deadheading for picking up them. Because of the similarity between taxi and ride-sourcing services, we first extend previous taxi network models to construct a base model, which assumes intranode matching between customers and idle ride-sourcing vehicles and thus, only considers cruising vacant trips. Considering spatial matching among multiple zones commonly practiced by ride-sourcing platforms, we further enhance the base model by encapsulating internode matching and considering both the cruising and deadheading vacant trips. A large set of empirical data from Didi Chuxing is applied to validate the proposed enhancement for internode matching. The extended model describes the equilibrium state that results from the interactions between background regular traffic and occupied, idle, and deadheading ride-sourcing vehicles. A solution algorithm is further proposed to solve the enhanced model effectively. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the model and solution algorithm. Although this study focuses on ride-sourcing services, the proposed modeling framework can be adapted to model other types of shared use mobility services.},

A two-stage stochastic program is formulated to minimize the expected operating cost of ZBFBS, in which the zonal visit sequences of vehicles are determined in stage 1, whereas in stage 2, service requests are assigned to either regular routes determined in stage 1 or ad hoc services that incur additional costs. Demand volume reliability and detour time reliability are introduced to ensure quality of the services and separate the problem into two phases for efficient solutions. In phase 1, given the reliability requirements, we minimize the cost of operating the regular services. In phase 2, we optimize the passenger assignment to vehicles to minimize the expected ad hoc service cost. The reliabilities are then optimized by a gradient-based approach to minimize the sum of the regular service operating cost and expected ad hoc service cost. We conduct numerical studies on vehicle capacity, detour time limit and demand volume to demonstrate the potential of ZBFBS, and apply the model to Chengdu, China, based on real data to illustrate its applicability.},

  abstract     = {When demand for transportation is low or sparse, traditional transit cannot provide efficient and good-quality service, because of its fixed structure. For this reason, mass transit is evolving toward some degree of flexibility. Although the extension of Dial-a-Ride systems to general public meets such need of adaptability, it presents several drawbacks mostly related to the their extreme flexibility. Consequently, new transportation alternatives, such as demand-adaptive systems (DASs), combining characteristics from both the traditional transit and Dial-a-Ride, have been introduced. For their twofold nature, DASs require careful planning. We focus on tactical aspects of the planning process by formalizing the single-line DAS design problem with stationary demand and proposing two alternative hierarchical decomposition approaches for its solution. The main motivation behind this work is to provide a general methodology suitable to be used as a tool to build the tactical DAS plan in real-life conditions. We provide an experimental study where the two proposed decomposition methods are compared and the general behavior of the systems is analyzed when altering some design parameters. Furthermore, we test the versatility of our methods on a variety of situation that may be encountered in real-life conditions.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces robust stochastic models for profit -maximizing capacitated hub location problems in which two different types of uncertainty, including stochastic demand and uncertain revenue, are simultaneously incorporated into the problem. First, a two-stage stochastic program is presented in which demand and revenue are jointly stochastic. Next, robust stochastic models are developed to better model uncertainty in the revenue while keeping the demand stochastic. Two particular cases are studied based on the dependency between demand and revenue. In the first case, a robust stochastic model with a min-max regret objective is developed assuming a finite set of scenarios that describes uncertainty associated with the revenue under a revenue-elastic demand setting. For the case when demand and revenue are independent, robust stochastic models with a max-min criterion and a min-max regret objective are formulated considering both interval uncertainty and discrete scenarios, respectively. It is proved that the robust stochastic version with max-min criterion can be viewed as a special case of the min-max regret stochastic model. Exact algorithms based on Benders decomposition coupled with a sample average approximation scheme are proposed. Exploiting the repetitive nature of sample average approximation, generic acceleration methodologies are developed to enhance the performance of the algorithms enabling them to solve large-scale intractable instances. Extensive computational experiments are performed to consider the efficiency of the proposed algorithms and also to analyze the effects of uncertainty under different settings. The qualities of the solutions obtained from different modeling approaches are compared under various parameter settings. Computational results justify the need to solve robust stochastic models to embed uncertainty in decision making to design resilient hub networks.},

Tugboats assist a vessel by pushing or towing the vessel’s tug points, and the vessel can moor (or unmoor) successfully only if each of the tug points is operated with sufficient horsepower. For a busy port where vessels frequently require the service of tugboats, effectively scheduling tugboats for serving incoming and outgoing vessels is a key to successful execution of the vessels’ berth plans. In this paper, we study a tugboat scheduling problem in a busy port, where incoming and outgoing vessels frequently require the assistance of tugboats, but the number of available tugboats is limited. We make use of a network representation of the problem and develop an integer programming formulation, which takes into account the berth plans of vessels, the tug points of vessels for different move types, and the horsepower requirements of the tug points, to minimize the weighted sum of the berthing and departure tardiness of vessels, the operating cost of tugboats, and the number of vessels that cannot be served successfully. We analyze the computational complexity of the problem and develop a novel iterative solution method, which combines Lagrangian relaxation and Benders decomposition, for generating near-optimal solutions. Computational performance of the proposed solution method is evaluated on problem instances generated from the operational data of a container port in Shanghai.},

Between informing the train drivers and start of operations, trip demand changes due to cancellations, new bookings, and reroutings of trains, which might result in mismatches between train driver capacity at a location and demand. We analyze an approach that incorporates uncertain trip demand as scenarios, such that the start and end times and locations of the duties of a crew schedule are recoverable robust against deviations in trip demand. We develop a column generation solution method that dynamically aggregates trips to duties and decomposes the subproblems into smaller, computationally tractable instances. Our model determines duty frames that cover duties in many scenarios, creating recoverable robust crew schedules. We test our model on three real data sets of a major European freight railway operator. Our results show that our schedules are considerably more recoverable robust than those of the nominal solution, resulting in smaller mismatches between train driver capacity and demand.},

Those pairings are assigned to crew members in a subsequent crew-rostering step. In this paper, we propose a new integral column-generation algorithm for the CPP, called improved integral column generation with prediction ( I 2 C G p ), which leaps from one integer solution to another until a near-optimal solution is found. Our algorithm improves on previous integral column-generation algorithms by introducing a set of reduced subproblems. Those subproblems only contain flight connections that have a high probability of being selected in a near-optimal solution and are, therefore, solved faster. We predict flight-connection probabilities using a deep neural network trained in a supervised framework. We test I 2 C G p on several real-life instances and show that it outperforms a state-of-the-art integral column-generation algorithm as well as a branch-and-price heuristic commonly used in commercial airline planning software, in terms of both solution costs and computing times.

  abstract     = {Many distribution centers use expensive, conveyor-based sorting systems that require large buildings to house them. In areas with tight space, robotic sorting systems offer a new type of solution to sort parcels by destination. Such systems are highly flexible in throughput capacity and are now gradually being introduced, particularly in express companies. This paper studies robotic sorting system with two layouts. The first layout has two tiers: robots drive on the top tier and sort parcels by destination on spiral conveyors connected to roll containers at the lower tier. The second layout has a single tier with input and output points located at the perimeter, connected by robots. For each layout, we consider both the shortest path topology via dual-lane aisles and the detour path topology via single-lane aisles. We build closed queueing networks for performance estimation, design an iterative procedure to investigate robot congestion in the two-tier layout, and use a traffic flow function to estimate robot congestion in the single-tier layout. Random, closest, dedicated, and shortest-queue robot-to-loading-station assignment rules are examined. We validate analytical models by both simulation and a real case of Deppon Express and analyze the optimal system size and operating policies for throughput capacity and operating cost. The results show that the system throughput capacity is significantly affected by robot congestion in the single-tier layout with the detour path topology, but it is only slightly affected in the other systems. A square layout fits the shortest path and a rectangular layout fits the detour path. Both the random assignment rule and the shortest-queue assignment rule are superior for a large number of robots, whereas the dedicated assignment rule is superior for a small number of robots. We apply these insights at Deppon Express for different allocations in peak and off-peak hours. Our analysis shows that a robotic sorting system typically has lower overall annual cost than a traditional cross-belt sorting system when the required throughput capacity is not too large.},

The rhythm enables vehicles to proceed at a constant speed without any stop. The RC is capable of breaking the limitation that right-of-way can only be allocated to nonconflicting movements at a time. It significantly improves the performance of intersection control for automated traffic. Moreover, the RC with a predetermined rhythm does not require intensive computational efforts to dynamically control vehicles, which may possibly lead to frequent accelerations or decelerations. Assuming stationary vehicle arrivals, we conduct a theoretical investigation to show that RC can considerably increase intersection capacity and reduce vehicle delay. Finally, the performance of RC is tested in the simulations with both stationary and nonstationary vehicle arrivals at both symmetric and asymmetric intersections.},

  abstract     = {Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology is providing urban transportation managers tremendous opportunities for better operation of urban mobility systems. However, there are significant challenges in real-time implementation as the computational time of the corresponding operations optimization model increases exponentially with increasing vehicle numbers. Following the companion paper (Chen et al. 2021), which proposes a novel automated traffic control scheme for isolated intersections, this study proposes a network-level, real-time traffic control framework for CAVs on grid networks. The proposed framework integrates a rhythmic control method with an online routing algorithm to realize collision-free control of all CAVs on a network and achieve superior performance in average vehicle delay, network traffic throughput, and computational scalability. Specifically, we construct a preset network rhythm that all CAVs can follow to move on the network and avoid collisions at all intersections. Based on the network rhythm, we then formulate online routing for the CAVs as a mixed integer linear program, which optimizes the entry times of CAVs at all entrances of the network and their time–space routings in real time. We provide a sufficient condition that the linear programming relaxation of the online routing model yields an optimal integer solution. Extensive numerical tests are conducted to show the performance of the proposed operations management framework under various scenarios. It is illustrated that the framework is capable of achieving negligible delays and increased network throughput. Furthermore, the computational time results are also promising. The CPU time for solving a collision-free control optimization problem with 2,000 vehicles is only 0.3 second on an ordinary personal computer.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a simulation-based optimization technique for high-dimensional toll optimization problems of large-scale road networks. We formulate a novel analytical network model. The latter is embedded within a metamodel simulation-based optimization (SO) algorithm. It provides analytical and differentiable structural information of the underlying problem to the SO algorithm. Hence, the algorithm no longer treats the simulator as a black box. The analytical model is formulated as a system of nonlinear equations that can be efficiently evaluated with standard solvers. The dimension of the system of equations scales linearly with network size. It scales independently of the dimension of the route choice set and of link attributes such as link length. Hence, it is a scalable formulation suitable for the optimization of large-scale networks. For instance, the model is used in the case study of the paper for toll optimization of a Singapore network with more than 4,050 OD (origin-destination) pairs and 18,200 feasible routes. The corresponding analytical model is implemented as a system of 860 nonlinear equations. The analytical network model is validated based on one-dimensional toy network problems. It captures the main trends of the simulation-based objective function and, more importantly, accurately locates the global optimum for all experiments. The proposed SO approach is then used to optimize a set of 16 tolls for the network of expressways and major arterials of Singapore. The proposed method is compared with a general-purpose algorithm. The proposed method identifies good quality solutions at the very first iteration. The benchmark method identifies solutions with similar performance after 2 days of computation or similarly after more than 30 points have been simulated. The case study indicates that the analytical structural information provided to the algorithm by the analytical network model enables it to (i) identify good quality solutions fast and (ii) become robust to both the quality of the initial points and to the stochasticity of the simulator. The final solutions identified by the proposed algorithm outperform those of the benchmark method by an average of 18\%.},

  abstract     = {Oligopolistic competition occurs in various transportation markets. In this paper, we introduce a framework to find approximate equilibrium solutions of oligopolistic markets in which demand is modeled at the disaggregate level using discrete choice models, according to random utility theory. Compared with aggregate demand models, the added value of discrete choice models is the possibility to account for more complex and precise representations of individual behaviors. Because of the form of the resulting demand functions, there is no guarantee that an equilibrium solution for the given market exists, nor is it possible to rely on derivative-based methods to find one. Therefore, we propose a model-based algorithmic approach to find approximate equilibria, which is structured as follows. A heuristic reduction of the search space is initially performed. Then, a subgame equilibrium problem is solved using a mixed integer optimization model inspired by the fixed-point iteration algorithm. The optimal solution of the subgame is compared against the best responses of all suppliers over the strategy sets of the original game. Best response strategies are added to the restricted problem until all ε -equilibrium conditions are satisfied simultaneously. Numerical experiments show that our methodology can approximate the results of an exact method that finds a pure equilibrium in the case of a multinomial logit model of demand with a single-product offer and homogeneous demand. Furthermore, it succeeds at finding approximate equilibria for two transportation case studies featuring more complex discrete choice models, heterogeneous demand, a multiproduct offer by suppliers, and price differentiation for which no analytical approach exists.},

In fact, many freight vehicles in cities spend more time parked than they are moving. Moreover, part of the public parking space is shared with passenger vehicles, especially cars. Both arrival processes and parking and delivery processes are stochastic in nature. In order to develop a framework for analysis, we propose a queueing model for an urban parking system consisting of delivery bays and general on-street parking spaces. Freight vehicles may park both in the dedicated bays and in general on-street parking, whereas passenger vehicles only make use of general on-street parking. Our model allows us to create parsimonious insights into the behavior of a delivery bay parking stretch as part of a limited length of curbside. We are able to find explicit expressions for the relevant performance measures, and formally prove a number of monotonicity results. We further conduct a series of numerical experiments to show more intricate properties that cannot be shown analytically. The model helps us shed light onto the effects of allocating scarce urban curb space to dedicated unloading bays at the expense of general on-street parking. In particular, we show that allocating more space to dedicated delivery bays can also make passenger cars better off.},

We develop “restricted fragments,” which are select segments of routes that can represent any DARP route. We show how to enumerate these restricted fragments and prove results on domination between them.

The algorithm is benchmarked on existing and new instances, solving nine existing instances to optimality for the first time.

The SSWPLD algorithms proposed so far are based on the enumeration of all regions of ℜ 2 defined by a given set of n intersecting circumferences. Early algorithms require O ( n 3 ) time for the enumeration, but they were recently shown to be incorrect in case of degenerate intersections, that is, when three or more circumferences pass through the same intersection point. This problem was fixed by a modified enumeration algorithm with complexity O ( n 4 ) , based on the construction of neighborhoods of degenerate intersection points. In this paper, it is shown that the complexity for correctly dealing with degenerate intersections can be reduced to O ( n 2 log n ) so that existing enumeration algorithms can be fixed without increasing their O ( n 3 ) time complexity, which is due to some preliminary computations unrelated to intersection degeneracy. Furthermore, a new algorithm for enumerating all regions to solve the SSWPLD is described: its worst-case time complexity is O ( n 2 log n ) . The new algorithm also guarantees that the regions are enumerated only once.},

  abstract     = {Although urban transit systems (UTS) often have fixed vehicle capacity and relatively constant departure headways, they may need to accommodate dramatically fluctuating passenger demands over space and time, resulting in either excessive passenger waiting or vehicle capacity and energy waste. Therefore, on the one hand, optimal operations of UTS rely on accurate modeling of passenger queuing dynamics, which is particularly complex on a multistop transit corridor. On the other hand, capacities of transit vehicles can be made variable and adaptive to time-variant passenger demand so as to minimize energy waste, especially with the emergence of modular vehicle technologies. This paper investigates operations of a multistop transit corridor in which vehicles may have different capacities across dispatches. We specify skewed time coordinates to simplify the problem structure while incorporating traffic congestion. Then, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model that determines the optimal dynamic headways and vehicle capacities over the study time horizon to minimize the overall system cost for the transit corridor. In particular, the proposed model considers a realistic multistop first-in, first-out (MSFIFO) rule that gives the same boarding priority to passengers arriving at a station in the same time interval yet with different destinations. A customized dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is proposed to solve this model efficiently. To circumvent the rapid increase of the state space of a typical DP algorithm, we analyze the theoretical properties of the investigated problem and identify upper and lower bounds to a feasible solution. The bounds largely reduce the state space during the DP iterations and greatly improve the efficiency of the proposed DP algorithm. The state dimensions are also reduced with the MSFIFO rule such that all queues with different destinations at the same origin can be tracked with a single boarding position state variable at each stage. A hypothetical example and a real-world case study show that the proposed DP algorithm greatly outperforms a state-of-the-art commercial solver (Gurobi) in both solution quality and time.},

This tolerance function is then applied to an optimization problem for the planning design of platform downtime protection and bus-bridging services given budget constraints. In particular, our implementation of platform downtime protection strategy relaxes standard assumptions of robust protection made in network fortification and interdiction literature. The resulting optimization problem can be regarded as a special variation of a two-stage distributionally robust optimization model. In order to achieve computational tractability, optimality conditions of the model are identified. This allows us to obtain a linear mixed-integer reformulation that can be solved efficiently by solvers like CPLEX.

  abstract     = {Demand management aiming to optimize system cost while ensuring user compliance in an urban traffic network is a challenging task. This paper introduces a cooperative demand redistribution strategy to optimize network performance through the retiming of departure times within a limited time window. The proposed model minimizes the total time spent in a two-region urban network by incurring minimal disruption to travelers’ departure schedules. Two traffic models based on the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) are jointly implemented to redistribute demand and analyze travelers’ reaction. First, we establish equilibrium conditions via a day-to-day assignment process, which allows travelers to find their preferred departure times. The trip-based MFD model that incorporates individual traveler attributes is implemented in the day-to-day assignment, and it is conjugated with a network-level detour ratio model to incorporate the effect of congestion in individual traveler route choice. This allows us to consider travelers with individual preferences on departure times influenced by desired arrival times, trip lengths, and earliness and lateness costs. Second, we develop a nonlinear optimization problem to minimize the total time spent considering both observed and unobserved demand—that is, travelers opting in and out of the demand management platform. The accumulation-based MFD model that builds on aggregated system representation is implemented as part of the constraints in the nonlinear optimization problem. The results confirm the resourcefulness of the model to address complex two-region traffic dynamics and to increase overall performance by reaching a constrained system optimum scenario while ensuring the applicability at both full and partial user compliance conditions.},

  abstract     = {In the future, road traffic will incorporate a random mix of manual vehicles and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) vehicles, where a CACC vehicle will degrade to an adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicle when vehicle-to-vehicle communications are not available. This paper proposes a generalized framework of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model for such mixed vehicular flow under different CACC penetration rates. In this approach, the kinematic wave speed propagating through the mixed platoon was theoretically proven to be the slope of mixed fundamental diagram. In addition, the random degradation from CACC to ACC was captured in mathematical expectation for traffic scenarios where the CACC only monitors one vehicle ahead. Three concrete car-following models, the intelligent driver model (IDM) and CACC/ACC models validated by Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways (PATH) program, were selected as examples to investigate the propagation of small perturbations and shock waves. Numerical simulations were also performed based on the selected car-following models. Moreover, the derived mixed LWR model was applied to solve some traffic flow problems. It indicates that the proposed LWR model is able to describe the propagation properties of both small perturbations and shock waves. The mixed LWR model can also be used to solve some practical problems, such as the queue caused by a traffic accident and the impact of a moving bottleneck. More importantly, the proposed generalized framework admits other CACC/ACC/regular car-following models, including those developed from further experiments.},

  abstract     = {A moving walkway (also denoted as moving sidewalk, travelator, autowalk, pedestrian conveyor, or skywalk) is a slow moving conveyor that transports standing or walking people horizontally over a short to medium distance. Constantly moving walkways have a long-lasting tradition especially inside large buildings, such as airport terminals and railway stations. Novel technological developments allow to accelerate walkways in their middle sections up to 12 km/h, while still providing a safe and much slower entrance and exit. Furthermore, first applications of moving walkways as environmentally friendly and space-efficient alternatives for urban public transport exist. In this context, our paper aims to support the layout design of moving walkways with optimization. Given a straight corridor (e.g., an airport terminal) and the passenger flows within the corridor (e.g., among gates), we aim to optimally place bidirectional walkway segments. We show that the resulting optimization problem is efficiently solvable by dynamic programming even if multiple relevant extensions, such as multiple objectives, budget constraints, and minimum safety distances, among subsequent segments are relevant. We apply our algorithm to explore the impact of constantly moving and accelerating walkways on total travel times and benchmark solutions without walkway support in a real-world case study. Our results reveal that wrongly placed walkways may considerably slow down passenger transport, but a very simple design rule leads to near-optimal results.},

Based on a grid of squares in which we rasterize the ground plot, this paper presents mixed-integer programs based on three different resolutions for orthogonal parking. Our computational study explores the tradeoff between the additional parking spaces promised by a higher resolution and the increased computational effort because of the larger solution space (and vice versa).

Conventional delay-performance metrics reflect only the magnitude of incurred flight delays at airports; in this work, we show that it is also important to characterize the spatial distribution of delays across a network of airports. We analyze graph-supported signals, leveraging techniques from spectral theory and graph-signal processing to compute analytical and simulation-driven bounds for identifying outliers in spatial distribution. We then apply these methods to the case of airport-delay networks and demonstrate the applicability of our methods by analyzing U.S. airport delays from 2008 through 2017. We also perform an airline-specific analysis, deriving insights into the delay dynamics of individual airline subnetworks. Through our analysis, we highlight key differences in delay dynamics between different types of disruptions, ranging from nor’easters and hurricanes to airport outages. We also examine delay interactions between airline subnetworks and the system-wide network and compile an inventory of outlier days that could guide future aviation operations and research. In doing so, we demonstrate how our approach can provide operational insights in an air-transportation setting. Our analysis provides a complementary metric to conventional aviation-delay benchmarks and aids airlines, traffic-flow managers, and transportation-system planners in quantifying off-nominal system performance.},

Typically, the calibration problem is solved using gradient free optimization. In this work, the gradient of the optimization problem is derived analytically using the adjoint method. The computational cost of the adjoint method does not scale with the number of model parameters, which makes it more efficient than evaluating the gradient numerically using finite differences.

  abstract     = {In numerous practical vehicle-routing applications, larger vehicles are employed as mobile depots to support a fleet of smaller vehicles that perform certain tasks. The mobile depots offer the possibility of keeping the task vehicles operational by supplying them en route with certain resources. For example, in two-echelon distribution systems, small task vehicles are used to navigate narrow streets and to deliver/collect goods or to collect waste, and larger vehicles serve as mobile depots to replenish the goods to be delivered or to receive collected goods or waste at the outskirts of the urban area. Accessibility constraints may also be imposed by regulations on emissions, which make some areas only accessible for environmentally friendly vehicles such as, for example, battery-powered electric vehicles. Especially if the respective refueling infrastructure is sparse, mobile refueling stations seem to be an interesting alternative. In this paper, we introduce the vehicle-routing problem with time windows and mobile depots (VRPTWMD) to capture the routing decisions of the described applications in a generalized fashion. The VRPTWMD is characterized by fleets of task vehicles (TVs) and support vehicles (SVs). The SVs may serve as mobile depots to restore either the load or the fuel capacity of the TVs that are used to fulfill the customer requests. We present a mixed-integer program for the VRPTWMD with which small instances can be solved using a commercial solver. Moreover, we develop a high-quality hybrid heuristic composed of an adaptive large neighborhood search and a path relinking approach to provide solutions on larger problem instances. We use a newly generated set of large VRPTWMD instances to analyze the effect of different problem characteristics on the structure of the identified solutions. In addition, our approach shows very convincing performance on benchmark instances for the related two-echelon multiple-trip VRP with satellite synchronization, which can be viewed as a special case of the VRPTWMD. Our heuristic is able to significantly improve a large part of the previous best-known solutions while spending notably less computation time than the comparison algorithm from the literature.},

The only additional constraint is that the set of required edges, that is, the streets to be serviced, is partitioned into clusters, and feasible routes must respect the soft-cluster constraint, that is, all required edges of the same cluster must be served by the same vehicle. In this article, we design an effective branch-price-and-cut algorithm for the exact solution of the SoftCluCARP. Its new components are a metaheuristic and branch-and-cut-based solvers for the solution of the column-generation subproblem, which is a profitable rural clustered postman tour problem. Although postman problems with these characteristics have been studied before, there is one fundamental difference here: clusters are not necessarily vertex-disjoint, which prohibits many preprocessing and modeling approaches for clustered postman problems from the literature. We present an undirected and a windy formulation for the pricing subproblem and develop and computationally compare two corresponding branch-and-cut algorithms. Cutting is also performed at the master-program level using subset-row inequalities for subsets of size up to five. For the first time, these nonrobust cuts are incorporated into MIP-based routing subproblem solvers using two different modeling approaches. In several computational studies, we calibrate the individual algorithmic components. The final computational experiments prove that the branch-price-and-cut algorithm equipped with these problem-tailored components is effective: The largest SoftCluCARP instances solved to optimality have more than 150 required edges or more than 50 clusters.},

Studies on time-dependent routing followed this model and therefore defined the speed functions on the complete graph. We argue that this model is often inadequate, in particular for arc routing problems involving services on edges of a road network. To fill this gap, we formally define the time-dependent capacitated arc routing problem (TDCARP), with travel and service speed functions given directly at the network level. Under these assumptions, the quickest path between locations can change over time, leading to a complex problem that challenges the capabilities of current solution methods. We introduce effective algorithms for preprocessing quickest paths in a closed form, efficient data structures for travel time queries during routing optimization, and heuristic and exact solution approaches for the TDCARP. Our heuristic uses the hybrid genetic search principle with tailored solution-decoding algorithms and lower bounds for filtering moves. Our branch-and-price algorithm exploits dedicated pricing routines, heuristic dominance rules, and completion bounds to find optimal solutions for problems counting up to 75 services. From these algorithms, we measure the benefits of time-dependent routing optimization for different levels of travel-speed data accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Scheduling the availability of order pickers is crucial for effective operations in a distribution facility with manual order pickers. When order-picking activities can only be performed in specific time windows, it is essential to jointly solve the order picker shift scheduling problem and the order picker planning problem of assigning and sequencing individual orders to order pickers. This requires decisions regarding the number of order pickers to schedule, shift start and end times, break times, as well as the assignment and timing of order-picking activities. We call this the order picker scheduling problem and present two formulations. A branch-and-price algorithm and a metaheuristic are developed to solve the problem. Numerical experiments illustrate that the metaheuristic finds near-optimal solutions at 80\% shorter computation times. A case study at the largest supermarket chain in The Netherlands shows the applicability of the solution approach in a real-life business application. In particular, different shift structures are analyzed, and it is concluded that the retailer can increase the minimum compensated duration for employed workers from six hours to seven or eight hours while reducing the average labor cost with up to 5\% savings when a 15-minute flexibility is implemented in the scheduling of break times.},

  abstract     = {Over the last few years, optimization models for the energy-efficient operation of railway traffic have received more and more attention, particularly in connection with timetable design. In this work, we study the effect of load management via timetabling. The idea is to consider trains as time-flexible consumers in the railway power supply network and to use slight shifts in the departure times from the stations to avoid too many simultaneous departures. This limits peak consumption and can help to improve the stability of the power supply. To this end, we derive efficient formulations for the problem of an optimal timetable adjustment based on a given timetable draft, two of which even allow for totally unimodular polyhedral descriptions. The proper choice of the objective function allows the incorporation of the priorities of either the train operating companies or the infrastructure manager. These include the avoidance of large peaks in average or instantaneous consumption and the improved use of recuperated braking energy. To solve the arising optimization models efficiently, we develop specially tailored exact Benders decomposition schemes that allow for the computation of high-quality solutions within a very short time. In an extensive case study for German railway passenger traffic, we show that our methods are capable of solving the problem on a nationwide scale. We see that the optimal adjustment of timetables entails a tremendous potential for reducing energy consumption.},

However, the impact that timetabling has on the number of required vehicles, which directly translates to operator costs, is rarely considered. Therefore, in this paper, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing the timetable and the vehicle circulation schedule, which specifies the cyclic sequences of trips that vehicles perform. In order to obtain high-quality solutions to realistic instances, we improve an earlier proposed formulation by contraction techniques, three new valid inequalities, and symmetry-breaking constraints. Ultimately, this allows us to explore the trade-off between the number of vehicles and the attractiveness of the timetable from the passengers’ perspective. An extensive computational study demonstrates the effectiveness of the improved formulation. Moreover, using this approach, we are able to find timetables requiring substantially fewer vehicles at the cost of minimal increases of the average travel time of passengers.},

  abstract     = {For foreseen natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes or floods), the uncertainties faced in relief logistics primarily stem from evacuation activities. We present a strategic planning problem to supply relief items by considering uncertainties in disaster location, intensity, duration, and evacuee compliance. To ensure time- and cost-effectiveness in relief distribution, we develop a robust optimization model to determine centralized supply locations, and supply quantities for different transportation modes in a five-tier network. In doing so, we consider the interaction between evacuation and supply-side activities and capture the inherent uncertainties using a combination of event and box uncertainty representations. Our model provides a decision maker with the flexibility of including or excluding the time dependency of evacuation-related uncertainties. Accordingly, it suggests a threshold time window for relief distribution, beyond which either the system cost increases or the benefits of early distribution diminish. Although the model primarily aids a policymaker in strategic preparedness, its tactical variant can aid the efficient distribution. We devise an enhanced Benders decomposition-based efficient solution method to solve realistic-size problems. In a case study using geographic information system data, we highlight the complex dynamics among various system components and discuss the resulting time-cost trade-offs that also influence the network structure.},

We evaluate the benefit of the model using two case studies, a value of the stochastic solution approach, and a simulation analysis.

  abstract     = {This study analyzes the performance of a credit-based mobility management scheme considering travelers’ budgeting behaviors for credit consumption under uncertainty. In the scheme, government agencies periodically distribute a certain number of credits to travelers; travelers must pay a credit charge for driving to complete their trips. Otherwise, they can take public transit free of credit charge. Consequently, within a credit-releasing cycle, travelers must budget their credit consumption to fulfill their mobility needs. Such budgeting behaviors can be viewed as a multistage decision-making process under uncertainty. Considering a transportation system with a credit scheme, we propose parsimonious models to investigate how the uncertainty associated with individual mobility needs and the subsequent travelers’ credit-budgeting behavior influence the multistage equilibrium of the transportation system, as well as the performance of the credit scheme on managing the transportation system. Both analytical and numerical results suggest that travelers tend to restrict their credit consumption in the early stage of a credit-releasing cycle to hedge against the risks associated with using up all credits, which compromises the performances of credit-based schemes. Moreover, a negative attitude toward risk aggravates the discrepancy between the credit consumption of the early and late stages. Last, we propose a contingency credit scheme to mitigate the negative impact incurred by travelers’ budgeting behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Efficiently handling last-mile deliveries becomes more and more important nowadays. Using drones to support classical vehicles allows improving delivery schedules as long as efficient solution methods to plan last-mile deliveries with drones are available. We study exact solution approaches for some variants of the traveling salesman problem with drone (TSP-D) in which a truck and a drone are teamed up to serve a set of customers. This combination of truck and drone can exploit the benefits of both vehicle types: the truck has a large capacity but usually low travel speed in urban areas; the drone is faster and not restricted to street networks, but its range and carrying capacity are limited. We propose a compact mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for several TSP-D variants that is based on timely synchronizing truck and drone flows; such an MILP is easy to implement but nevertheless leads to competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art MILPs. Furthermore, we introduce dynamic programming recursions to model several TSP-D variants. We show how these dynamic programming recursions can be exploited in an exact branch-and-price approach based on a set partitioning formulation using ng -route relaxation and a three-level hierarchical branching. The proposed branch-and-price can solve instances with up to 39 customers to optimality outperforming the state-of-the-art by more than doubling the manageable instance size. Finally, we analyze different scenarios and show that even a single drone can significantly reduce a route’s completion time when the drone is sufficiently fast.},

In this problem, we do not make the standard assumption of one-to-one pickup and delivery problems (PDPs) that each location has only one transportation request. Instead we assume there are multiple requests per location that may be performed individually. This may result in multiple visits to a location. We provide a new compact arc-based integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for the PDPDPD by deriving time-consistency constraints that identify the order in which selected outgoing arcs from a node are actually traversed. The formulation can also easily be applied to the one-to-one PDP by restricting the number of times that a node can be visited. Numerical results on standard one-to-one PDP test instances from the literature show that our compact formulation is almost competitive with tailor-made solution methods for the one-to-one PDP. Moreover, we observe that significant cost savings of up to 15\% on average may be obtained by allowing divisible pickups and deliveries in one-to-one PDPs. It turns out that divisible pickups and deliveries are not only beneficial when the vehicle capacity is small, but also when this capacity is unrestrictive.},

In contrast to the classical IRP in which delivery routes are arbitrary, the FPP-IRP partitions customers into mutually exclusive clusters that are fixed throughout the optimization horizon, and distribution is performed separately for each cluster. By restricting the flexibility inherent in the classical IRP, the FPP-IRP attains many potential advantages. First, partitioning reduces the operational complexity of the system and allows a simpler organization of the distribution service. Second, it improves the robustness of the system by isolating disruptions to affected clusters. Third, it can fit the needs and requirements of specific applications in which consistency in the distribution policy, such as familiarity between customers and drivers and route invariance, is required. We present two fixed-partition policies for the IRP together with mathematical formulations and valid inequalities. We also present a worst-case analysis on the performance of these policies. Extensive computational results are presented to show the behavior of these policies and glean insights into their potential benefits.},

We consider a knapsack-constrained uncertainty set stipulating a nominal and a peak travel time for each arc and an upper bound Δ on the sum of all deviations from the nominal times. Viewing the difference between the peak time and its nominal value as the maximum delay possibly incurred when traversing the corresponding arc, the problem we consider is thus to find a tour that remains feasible for up to Δ units of delay. This differs from previous studies on robust routing under travel time uncertainty, which have relied on cardinality-constrained sets and only allow for an upper bound on the number of arcs with peak travel time. We propose an exact algorithm based on column generation and dynamic programming that involves effective dominance rules and an extension of the n g -tour relaxation proposed in the literature for the classical TSPTW. The algorithm is able to solve the robust TSPTW under both knapsack- and cardinality-constrained travel time uncertainty. Extensive computational experiments show that the algorithm is successful on instances with up to 80 customers. In addition, we study the impact of the two uncertainty sets on the trade-off between service quality and cost exhibited by the resulting solutions.},

These companies face uncertain travel times and service times that have to be taken into account when determining the time windows and routes prior to departure. The objective of the proposed robust vehicle routing problem with time window assignments (RVRP-TWA) is to simultaneously determine routes and time window assignments such that the expected travel time and the risk of violating the time windows are minimized. We assume that the travel time probability distributions are not completely known but that some statistics, such as the mean, minimum, and maximum, can be estimated. We extend the robust framework based on the requirements’ violation index, which was originally developed for the case where the specific requirements (time windows) are given as inputs, to the case where they are also part of the decisions. The subproblem of finding the optimal time window assignment for the customers in a given route is shown to be convex, and the subgradients can be derived. The RVRP-TWA is solved by iteratively generating subgradient cuts from the subproblem that are added in a branch-and-cut fashion. Experiments address the performance of the proposed solution approach and examine the trade-off between expected travel time and risk of violating the time windows.},

In this study, we develop a deterministic queueing model of network traffic flow, in which traffic on each link is considered as a queue. In the link queue model (LQM), the demand and supply of a link queue are defined in the queue size (number of vehicles), and its in- and out-flows are computed from junction flux functions corresponding to macroscopic merging and diverging rules. The new model is a system of ordinary differential equations that is mathematically tractable and computationally efficient and can capture queue spillbacks and interactions among links. We further demonstrate that the LQM is fundamentally different from the cell transmission model (CTM) and link transmission model (LTM) for a road segment, a signalized ring road, and a diverge-merge network, with respect to the shock and rarefaction waves, network fundamental diagram, and stability property. In a sense, the new model is a space-continuous approximation of the kinematic wave model and can be a useful addition to the multiscale modeling framework of network traffic flow.

The traffic states on roads can be attributed to the longitudinal heterogeneity in vehicles. Vehicles slower than prevailing vehicles are defined as moving bottlenecks. On a multilane road section with multiple vehicle types, slower vehicles create moving bottlenecks and induce overtaking by faster vehicles so as to maintain their higher desired speed. The influence of single-class moving bottlenecks has been studied in the past. However, the impacts of multiple classes of moving bottlenecks have not yet been fully explored. This paper categorizes vehicles into passenger cars, medium trucks, and heavy trucks. By defining medium trucks and heavy trucks as moving bottlenecks, we develop analytical formulas for the fundamental diagram on a multilane road section with heterogeneous moving bottlenecks. The formula confirms that the composition of traffic and the longest truck platoon length influence the fundamental diagram. We then conduct simulations using a first-order kinematic wave model in Lagrangian coordinates to validate the fundamental diagram developed with the analytical formula and obtain promising results.

  abstract     = {Previous studies have shown traffic oscillations can be induced by special network topology. In the simplest case, a network of two intersections connected by two parallel roads would produce oscillatory traffic, when the split of drivers between the two roads falls into certain range. To understand how traffic information may affect such oscillations, a subset of drivers is allowed to be “reactive” in this study; that is, their route choice varies according to information about prevailing traffic conditions on the roads. We show that, depending on the ratio of reactive drivers, the system displays six new decaying, periodic oscillatory, or stable patterns. All solutions are obtained analytically in closed form and validated by macroscopic traffic simulation. Of all the solutions discovered, only one both is stable and fully utilizes the road space between the two intersections, and hence it is more desirable than the other solutions. The findings reveal the link between information provision and topology-induced oscillations, which may help practitioners design strategies that contribute to mitigating the adverse impact of such oscillations.},

  abstract     = {Air emissions from ships have become an important issue in sustainable shipping because of the low quality of the marine fuel consumed by ships. To reduce sulfur emissions from shipping, the International Maritime Organization has established emission control areas (ECAs) where ships must use low-sulfur fuel with at most 0.1\% sulfur or take equivalent emission-reduction measures. The use of low-sulfur fuel increases the costs for liner shipping companies and affects their operations management. This study addresses a holistic liner shipping service planning problem that integrates fleet deployment, schedule design, and sailing path and speed optimization, considering the effect of ECAs. We propose a nesting algorithmic framework to address this new and challenging problem. Semianalytical solutions are derived for the sailing path and speed optimization problem, which are used in the schedule design. A tailored algorithm is applied to solve schedule design problems, and the solutions are used in fleet deployment. The fleet deployment problem is then addressed by a dynamic programming-based pseudo-polynomial time algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that considering the effect of ECAs in liner shipping operations management can reduce over 2\% of the costs, which is significant considering that the annual operating cost of a shipping company’s network can be as high as several billion dollars.},

In this paper, we study a general version of the locomotive assignment problem encountered at the tactical level by one of the largest railroads in North America: the Canadian National (CN) Railway Company. We present a modeling framework with two integer linear programming formulations and contribute to the state of the art by allowing decisions on each train’s operating mode (distributed power or not) over the whole (weekly) planning horizon without partitioning it winto smaller time windows. Given the difficulty in solving the problem, one of the formulations is enhanced through various refinements, such as constraint relaxations, preprocessing, and fixed cost approximations. We thus achieve a significant reduction in the required computational time to solve instances of realistic size. We also present two versions of a Benders decomposition–based algorithm to obtain feasible solutions. On average, it allows a reduction of the associated computational time by two hours. Results from an extensive computational study and a case study with data provided by CN confirm the potential benefits of the model and solution approach.},

The empirical approach decomposes their domestic network-building rationales into the ones adopted by virtual archetypical carriers. We consider the previously conceived low-cost, full-service, and regional carrier archetypes. Our main contribution is the development of a model that allows airlines’ networks to be strategically designed in a time-evolving pattern, reflecting a dynamically chosen blend of these archetypes. Moreover, we also consider the effects that mergers and acquisitions may have had in inducing changes in these blends. Our results suggest that all analyzed airlines have repositioned themselves through their trajectories to adopt a hybrid configuration, aiming at the intersection of at least two archetypical network-design rationales. Besides, the effects of consolidations point to certain diversions of the acquiring airlines’ domestic network-building rationales toward the ones of the acquired carriers, providing evidence that the consolidations may have served as stepping stones for market-repositioning moves.},

The proposed algorithm can be especially beneficial for vehicle routing instances with large vehicle capacity and/or with time window constraints. Computational experiments were performed on instances from the distance-constrained vehicle routing problem, including multidepot and site-dependent variants, on the vehicle routing problem with time windows, and on the “nightmare” instances of the heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem.

  abstract     = {Less-than-truckload carriers rely on the consolidation of freight from multiple shippers to achieve economies of scale. Collected freight is routed through a number of transfer terminals at each of which shipments are grouped together for the next leg of their journeys. We study the service network design problem confronted by these carriers. This problem includes determining (1) the number of services (trailers) to operate between each pair of terminals and (2) a load plan , which specifies the sequence of transfer terminals that freight with a given origin and destination will visit. Traditionally, for every terminal and every ultimate destination, a load plan specifies a unique next terminal. We introduce the p -alt model, which generalizes traditional load plans by allowing decision makers to specify a desired number of next-terminal options for terminal–destination pairs using a vector p . We compare a number of exact and heuristic approaches for solving a two-stage stochastic variant of the p -alt model. Using this model, we show that, by explicitly considering demand uncertainty and by merely allowing up to two next-terminal options for terminal–destination pairs in the load plans, carriers can generate substantial cost savings that are comparable to the ones yielded by adopting load plans that allow for any next terminal to be a routing option for terminal–destination pairs. Moreover, by using these more flexible load plans, carriers can generate savings on the order of 10\% over traditional load plan designs obtained by deterministic models.},

The objective is to dynamically control a fleet of drivers in a way that avoids delays with respect to customers’ deadlines. There are two sources of uncertainty in the problem. First, the customers are unknown until they place an order. Second, the time at which the food is ready at the restaurant is unknown. To address these challenges, we present an anticipatory customer assignment (ACA) policy. To account for the stochasticity in the problem, ACA postpones the assignment decisions for selected customers, allowing more flexibility in assignments. In addition, ACA introduces a time buffer to reduce making decisions that are likely to result in delays. We also consider bundling, which is the practice of assigning multiple orders at a time to a driver. Based on real-world data, we show how ACA is able to improve service significantly for all stakeholders compared with current practice.},

  abstract     = {In many routing applications, it is necessary to place limits on the duration of the individual routes. When demands are stochastic and restocking during route execution is allowed, the durations of the resulting routes are also stochastic. In this paper, we consider the vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands and probabilistic duration constraints (VRPSD-PDC). We assume optimal restocking, which means that, during the route execution, replenishment trips to the depot are performed in an optimal way. The resulting optimization problem calls for a set of routes with minimal total expected cost for visiting all customers, such that the duration of each route, with a given probability, does not exceed a prescribed limit. We solve the VRPSD-PDC with a novel branch-and-price algorithm. An orienteering-based completion bound is proposed to control the growth of labels in the pricing algorithm. Feasibility of a priori routes is verified by applying Chebyshev’s bounds, by Monte Carlo simulation and statistical inference, or by analytically deriving the distribution of the route duration. Consistency checks are incorporated into the branch-and-price framework to detect statistical errors. Computational experiments are performed with demands following binomial, Poisson, or negative binomial probability distributions and with duration constraints enforced at the levels of 90\%, 95\%, and 98\%. Optimal solutions to the VRPSD-PDC may contain routes that serve an expected demand that is larger than the capacity of the vehicle. These solutions actively employ optimal restocking to reduce traveling costs and the number of required vehicles. Sensitivity analyses indicate that high demand variability negatively impacts the solution, both in terms of total expected cost and the number of routes employed.},

Cameras may be exposed to difficult weather conditions and typically require frequent maintenance. When deciding the order in which maintenance should be performed, one has to consider both the traveling times between the cameras and the traffic flow that each camera is supposed to monitor. In this paper, we study the problem of routing a set of technicians to repair cameras by minimizing the total weighted latency, that is, the sum of the weighted waiting times of each camera, where the weight is a parameter proportional to the monitored traffic. The resulting problem, called the weighted k -traveling repairman problem (wkTRP), is a generalization of the well-known traveling repairman problem and can be used to model a variety of real-world applications. To solve the wkTRP, we propose an iterated local search heuristic and an exact branch-and-cut algorithm enriched with valid inequalities. The effectiveness of the two methods is proved by extensive computational experiments performed both on instances derived from a real-world case study and on benchmark instances from the literature on the wkTRP and on related problems.},

We propose an exact Benders’ decomposition approach to solve the MVPRP, which decomposes the problem as a master problem and a slave problem. The master problem decides whether to produce the product, the quantity to be produced, and the customers to be replenished for every period of the planning horizon. The resulting slave problem decomposes into a capacitated vehicle routing problem for each period of the planning horizon where each problem is solved using an exact algorithm based on the set partitioning model, and the identified feasibility and optimality cuts are added to the master problem to guide the solution process. Valid inequalities and initial optimality cuts are used to strengthen the linear programming relaxation of the master formulation. The exact method is tested on MVPRP instances and on instances of the multivehicle vendor-managed inventory routing problem, a special case of the MVPRP, and the good performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative transportation can significantly reduce transportation costs as well as greenhouse gas emissions. However, allocating the cost to the collaborating companies remains difficult. We consider the cost-allocation problem, which arises when companies, each with multiple delivery locations, collaborate by consolidating demand and combining delivery routes. We model the corresponding cost-allocation problem as a cooperative game: the joint network vehicle routing game (JNVRG). We propose a row generation algorithm to either determine a core allocation for the JNVRG or show that no such allocation exists. In this approach, we encounter a row generation subproblem, which we model as a new variant of a vehicle routing problem with profits. Moreover, we propose two main acceleration strategies for the row generation algorithm. First, we generate rows by relaxing the row generation subproblem, exploiting the tight linear programming (LP) bounds for our formulation of the row generation subproblem. Secondly, we propose to also solve the row generation subproblem heuristically and to only solve it to optimality when the heuristic fails. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed row generation algorithm and the acceleration strategies by means of numerical experiments for both the JNVRG as well as the traditional vehicle routing game, which is a special case of the JNVRG. We create instances based on benchmark instances of the capacitated vehicle routing problem from the literature. We are able to either determine a core allocation or show that no core allocation exists, for instances ranging from 5 companies with a total of 79 delivery locations to 53 companies with a total of 53 delivery locations.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal carriers are third-party logistics providers who utilize multiple modes of transportation to deliver timely door-to-door services to their customers. Notwithstanding frequent service disruptions, customers have ever-increasing expectations for on-time deliveries, posing significant challenges to tactical planning. Inspired by the operations of actual carriers, we study the tactical decision planning of multimodal freight networks, considering operational disruptions, timetabling restrictions, and explicit customer service requirements. Despite our focus on tactical planning, our models integrate long-term commitments by penalizing deviations from strategic goals with last-minute operational planning decisions, which are recourse actions aiming to accommodate service disruptions. After improving the dual bound of our initial formulation, we provide reduced-sized models for the special cases of nonpropagating delays and nonreactive last-minute decisions. This latter formulation is utilized to construct scenario-based and trip-based heuristics, which we combine in a hybrid search loop. Our computational study illustrates that our approach attains high-quality solutions for real-sized instances that are otherwise unsolvable by off-the-shelf optimization software, and a significant improvement over a nontrivial rolling horizon benchmark.},

  abstract     = {The hypercube model is a useful descriptive tool to evaluate emergency services such as firefighters, police, and emergency medical services where geographically distributed vehicles and personnel serve users in emergencies. This study proposes an extension of the hypercube model to represent a dispatch policy in which advanced equipped servers serve solely life-threatening calls (called dedicated servers). The proposed approach is applied to two case studies of public medical emergency services in two different cities in Brazil and validated with discrete-event simulations. The computational experiments show the proposed model as more sensitive to respond to more life-threatening requests than other hypercube models in the literature, serving more of these requests under increased demand. In addition, to reduce the number of equilibrium equations and, consequently, the computational effort of the hypercube model, an aggregate model is shown based on the grouping of homogeneous servers located in the same station. The aggregation policy does not generate additional losses in the accuracy of the model, as shown through several experiments.},

  abstract     = {Freight distribution with electric vehicles (EVs) is a promising alternative to reduce the carbon footprint associated with city logistics. Algorithms for planning routes for EVs should take into account their relatively short driving range and the effects of traffic congestion on the battery consumption. This paper proposes new methodology and illustrates how it can be applied to solve an electric vehicle routing problem with stochastic and time-dependent travel times where battery recharging along routes is not allowed. First, a new method for generating network-consistent (correlated in time and space) and time-dependent speed scenarios is introduced. Second, a new technique for applying branch and price on instances defined on real street networks is developed. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for finding optimal or near-optimal solutions in instances with up to 133 customers and almost 1,500 road links. With a high probability, the routes in the obtained solutions can be performed by EVs without requiring intermediate recharging stops. An execution time control policy to further reduce the chances of stranded EVs is also presented. In addition, we measure the cost of independence , which is the impact on solution feasibility when travel times are assumed statistically independent. Last, we give directions on how to extend the proposed framework to handle recourse actions.},

  abstract     = {Reducing fuel consumption is a unifying goal across the aviation industry. One fuel-saving opportunity for airlines is reducing contingency fuel loading by dispatchers. Many airlines’ flight planning systems (FPSs) provide recommended contingency fuel for dispatchers in the form of statistical contingency fuel (SCF). However, because of limitations of the current SCF estimation procedure, the application of SCF is limited. In this study, we propose to use quantile regression–based machine learning methods to account for fuel burn uncertainties and estimate more reliable SCF values. Utilizing a large fuel burn data set from a major U.S.-based airline, we find that the proposed quantile regression method outperforms the airline’s FPS. The benefit of applying the improved SCF models is estimated to be in the range $19 million–$65 million in fuel expense savings as well as 132 million–451 million kilograms of carbon dioxide emission reductions per year, with the lower savings being realized even while maintaining the current, extremely low risk of tapping the reserve fuel. The proposed models can also be used to predict benefits from reduced fuel loading enabled by increasing system predictability, for example, with improved air traffic management.},
