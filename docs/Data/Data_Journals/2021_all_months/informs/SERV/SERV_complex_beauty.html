Before 2020, there were many profound challenges to human life that had been well documented by efforts such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be a “last straw” crisis that has destabilized modern human civilization. This article diagnoses various crises of human service systems (e.g., COVID-19, inequality, and climate change) and proposes the metaphor of service ecosystem health for reimagining service science in a postpandemic world. Service ecosystem health is defined as the interdependent state of private, public, and planetary well-being necessary for sustaining life. This article reimagines service science, broadens transformative service research, builds the service ecosystem health metaphor, outlines the Goldilocks Civilization thought experiment, and explores designing for a Goldilocks civilization. Because service is for humans, the ultimate objective is to elevate service science to uplift human well-being.},

Philanthropic service providers are unable to cope with the increased demand caused by the social, economic, and operational challenges induced by the pandemic. For-profit service providers offering no-pay services to customers, allowing them to self-select a service option, is becoming a popular strategy in various settings. Obtaining insights into how to efficiently balance societal and financial goals is critical for a for-profit service provider. We develop and analyze a quantitative model of customer utilities, vertically differentiated product assortment, pricing, and market size to understand how service providers can effectively use customer segmentation and serve the poor in the lowest economic strata. We identify conditions under which designing the service delivery to be accessible to the poor can simultaneously benefit the for-profit service provider, customers, and the entire society. Interestingly, we observe that the increasing customer valuation of the no-pay option because of a superior quality service offered by a service provider need not benefit customers. Our work provides a framework to obtain operational, economic, and strategic insights into socially responsible service delivery strategies.},

A pressing concern for both businesses and policymakers is whether the sudden peak in customer interest in e-commerce can be sustained in the future. This research seeks to address this concern by considering whether and how customers’ motivations to participate in e-commerce activities have changed. We collected primary data from a self-administered survey to empirically examine how health and safety concerns influence customers’ online shopping behavior during the pandemic, alongside other known determinants for e-commerce participation, namely technology readiness and connectedness. The results confirm that health and safety concerns have a positive influence on customers’ usage of e-commerce after controlling for technology readiness and connectedness. Furthermore, customers in age groups with higher risks of severe COVID-19 symptoms and mortality are more likely to increase e-commerce usage during the social distancing and isolation period. Our results support the idea that the customer base for e-commerce and digital services have expanded beyond the typical tech-savvy and young customers in their twenties. These are promising signs for postpandemic recovery and even expansion, as firms may leverage the momentum of change in customers’ motivations and start tailoring their public relation campaigns to address a wider age range of potential consumers.},

For 26 U.S. hotel brands, productivity changes over 10 quarters from the first quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2020 were analyzed. After the COVID-19 outbreak, the investigated hotels’ productivity deteriorated. Decomposition revealed that, whereas technical efficiency change (EC) improved, technological change (TC) regressed, resulting in deterioration of the MPI. The investigated hotels’ EC-related practices included enhanced cleaning operations, partnering with a hygiene brand, cutting the workforce, and pay cuts. Practices related to TC included the adoption of new hygiene technology and setting a new standard at the organizational level through the formation of a global council and accreditation related to disinfection and hygiene. Our results show that though U.S. hotels are trying to improve their productivity by efficiently utilizing resources, frontier technology’s regress is decreasing productivity. Our results support the importance of investment in technology for productivity management.

Qualitative support from various sources supplements the surveys. The results indicate a movement toward deinstitutional care options, which began prepandemic but intensified during the outbreak. Care organizations confirm this development, reporting more occupancy-related concerns. Findings also suggest that telehealth and digital communication tools have substantially expanded.

Although the consequences of the pandemic on hotel operations have been widely examined, the question of how hotel businesses can revive, innovate, and transform in order to survive and recover remains vastly under-researched. This study aims to provide insights on this important topic by analyzing 312 news articles between December 1, 2019, and March 1, 2021, published by global news media, which report hotels’ strategies and tactics to deal with the pandemic. Grounded on chaos theory, behavioral learning theory, and an integrated crisis management model, a global pandemic crisis management framework is developed. Practically, the paper reveals best practices applied by hoteliers to deal with the pandemic (e.g., service transformation, smart marketing, strategic collaboration/alliance, mergers and acquisitions, and digitalization) and suggests ways for hotel services providers to adapt to the “new travel” age.},

  abstract     = {We analyze a congested healthcare delivery setting resulting from emergency treatment of a chronic disease on a regular basis. A prominent example of the problem of interest is congestion in the emergency room (ER) at a publicly funded safety net hospital resulting from recurrent arrivals of uninsured end-stage renal disease patients needing dialysis (a.k.a. compassionate dialysis). Unfortunately, this is the only treatment option for un/under-funded patients (e.g., undocumented immigrants) with ESRD, and it is available only when the patient’s clinical condition is deemed as life-threatening after a mandatory protocol, including an initial screening assessment in the ER as dictated and communicated by hospital administration and county policy. After the screening assessment, the so-called treatment restrictions are in place, and a certain percentage of patients are sent back home; the ER, thus, serves as a screening stage. The intention here is to control system load and, hence, overcrowding via restricting service (i.e., dialysis) for recurrent arrivals as a result of the chronic nature of the underlying disease. In order to develop a deeper understanding of potential unintended consequences, we model the problem setting as a stylized queueing network with recurrent arrivals and restricted service subject to the mandatory screening assessment in the ER. We obtain analytical expressions of fundamental quantitative metrics related to network characteristics along with more sophisticated performance measures. The performance measures of interest include both traditional and new problem-specific metrics, such as those that are indicative of deterioration in patient welfare because of rejections and treatment delays. We identify cases for which treatment restrictions alone may alleviate or lead to severe congestion and treatment delays, thereby impacting both the system operation and patient welfare. The fundamental insight we offer is centered around the finding that the impact of mandatory protocol on network characteristics as well as traditional and problem-specific performance measures is nontrivial and counterintuitive. However, impact is analytically and/or numerically quantifiable via our approach. Overall, our quantitative results demonstrate that the thinking behind the mandatory protocol is potentially naive. This is because the approach does not necessarily serve its intended purpose of controlling system-load and overcrowding.},

Such within- and across-chain substitution effects are enhanced as store-level product assortment information becomes increasingly available to consumers. It is important for scholars and practitioners to understand the effect of sister-store presence and market competition on retail product assortment strategies. In this paper, we obtain store-level product assortment data from a nationwide bookstore chain and study how sister-store presence and market competition can have an impact on the retail chain’s product assortment. In addition, we explore how this impact differs for niche and popular products. Our results show that having at least one sister store nearby reduces product assortment and such effects are stronger for niche products although having a competing store nearby increases product assortment and such effects are stronger for popular products.},

We build a stochastic mixed-integer program to minimize the operational cost plus expected penalty cost of customers’ waiting time, vehicles’ idleness, and overtime. Furthermore, to handle real-time arrived service requests, we develop K-means clustering-based algorithms to dynamically update planned routes and schedules. The algorithms assign customers to vehicles based on similarities and then plan schedules on each vehicle separately. We conduct numerical experiments based on diverse instances generated from census data and data from the Ford Motor Company’s GoRide service, to evaluate result sensitivity and to compare the in-sample and out-of-sample performance of different approaches.

In this paper, we focus on “free-to-play” online games in which a game provider offers players an option to purchase game-specific virtual goods (items) for improving their winning chances before the game begins. Because selling virtual items is the main revenue stream in free-to-play games, it is important for game providers to find ways to entice players to purchase virtual items. We observe that some game providers disclose the opponent’s skill level before the game begins by using a “transparent selling” mechanism to sell virtual items, whereas others conceal this information from the players. This observation motivates us to examine whether and when game providers should adopt transparent selling. By analyzing a game-theoretical model that involves one game provider and two competitive players, we obtain the following results. First, when the price of the virtual goods is endogenously determined by the game provider, we find that transparent selling is not effective: it is optimal for the provider to adopt “opaque selling” by concealing the opponent’s skill level information from players. However, opaque selling hurts the player’s welfare. Second, when the selling price is exogenously given, transparent selling dominates opaque selling when the given price is high. Our results identify the conditions under which transparent selling dominates opaque selling.},

This paper examines the compensating wage differential that cashiers require to handle payments in cash. First, a multicountry panel data study shows that cashier wages increase with retail cash usage, which is consistent with cashiers requiring compensation to handle cash. Second, in a discrete choice experiment where supermarket cashiers chose between collecting card and cash payments, eight of 10 cashiers preferred card to cash. Among those who preferred card, the median cashier required a wage premium of S$37.50 (US$27) a month to handle cash. The premium was lower among cashiers who are local, less risk averse, and younger. Third, in a laboratory study, subjects traded off earnings against stress. With higher frequency of cash payments, high earners experienced greater physiological stress than low earners. Earnings also increased with abilities in arithmetic and coping with stress. Collectively, these studies show that cashiers require higher wages to handle cash payments, in part due to higher stress. We offer policy, managerial, and research implications for job design, payment systems, and workplace stress.},

  abstract     = {SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, began infecting humans in late 2019 and has since spread to over 57 million people and caused over 1.75 million deaths, as of December 27, 2020. In response to reduced demand and travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19, airlines experienced a 94\% reduction in passenger capacity worldwide in April and an estimated 60\% reduction in passengers transported for all of 2020. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to spread on airplanes by infected passengers, so minimizing the risk of secondary infections aboard aircraft may save lives. We present the airplane seating assignment problem (ASAP) to minimize transmission risks on airplanes, and we provide two models to solve ASAP. We show that both models can be effectively solved using a standard commercial solver and that seating assignments provided by these models have lower aggregate risk than the strategy of blocking the middle seats, given the same number of passengers. The available risk models for aircraft are based on influenza data, and hence risk models based on SARS-CoV-2 should be developed to maximize the benefits of our research.},

  abstract     = {Amid population aging, the senior living industry has become an important sector of the service industry, especially in China. Population control throughout the past four decades has led to the quintessential “sandwich” family, wherein a young couple faces pressure to care for four elderly parents as well as their own child(ren). A lack of proper home care for older adults in China has thus accelerated social and economic demand for senior living institutions (SLIs). Although a growing number of SLIs are being built in the country, occupancy rates remain low. It is therefore crucial to explore why older adults are not accepting SLIs as a solution to their needs. This study broaches this topic by investigating the mechanism underlying the impact of family support for choosing an SLI on older adults’ attitudes toward these institutions. Specifically, a mediation model was proposed to investigate the roles of life satisfaction and older adults’ subjective knowledge of SLIs among 1,723 older Chinese adults. Multigroup path analysis was also carried out to test applicable sociodemographic differences. Findings revealed a significant suppressing effect of life satisfaction and a partial mediating effect of subjective knowledge along with group differences. Overall, this study provides meaningful implications for SLI marketing.},
