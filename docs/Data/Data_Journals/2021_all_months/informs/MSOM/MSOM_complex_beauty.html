  abstract     = {Problem definition : Tasks sequentially arrive, and their values to the workers who are going to perform them are independent random variables. The common way to allocate tasks to workers is according to the first-in, first-out order. But this method both is inefficient and seems unfair to those who receive a low-valued task after a long wait. We are looking for a better allocation method. Academic/practical relevance : Finding a fair and efficient task allocation method is an aspiration of manpower firms that employ a pool of workers, such as salespersons, technicians, emergency medical stuff, nurses, or taxi drivers. We present many more implementations, such as turn taking and load management. Methodology : We propose a self-selected task allocation method and discuss its importance and implementations. The proposed method is defined as a cyclic queueing game with a fixed number of players. Every unit of time a prize with a random value is offered to the players according to their order in the queue, and a player who accepts a prize moves to the end of the queue. The process of choosing which prizes to accept in each position is presented as a noncooperative multiplayer game. We analyze strategies and symmetric equilibria for three variations. Results : We provide closed-form solutions and suggest a novel intuitive interpretation to find equilibria via calculating maximum-profit strategies. We complement the theoretical results by conducting a numerical study. Managerial implications : The proposed method is natural and easy to implement, its outcome is better than the common allocation by seniority, and the ratio of the expected value obtained under the two methods is unbounded.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Difficulties in healthcare delivery in developing economies arise from poor road infrastructure of rural communities, where the bulk of the population resides. Although motorcycles are an effective means for delivering healthcare products, governments in developing economies lack expertise in proper maintenance, resulting in frequent vehicle breakdowns. Riders for Health, a nonprofit social enterprise (SE), has developed specialized capabilities that enable significant enhancements in vehicle maintenance. Riders for Health has engaged with the governments and provided its services using different contracting approaches. However, the effect of such practice on improving vehicle availability—the main social mission of Riders for Health—is not well understood. Academic/practical relevance : This paper presents one of the first rigorous analyses of how SEs achieve their goals through innovations in operations. Our analysis highlights the relationship between a social mission objective and a service contract choice, contrasting it with the choice by a profit-maximizing organization traditionally assumed in the service contracting literature in operations management. Methodology : We construct and analyze a stylized model that combines the elements of reliability theory and contract theory, explicitly accounting for the SE’s social mission in her objective function. Results : We find that the “total solution” approach of providing all aspects of vehicle maintenance, including fleet ownership, is a preferred choice for an SE that prioritizes improving vehicle availability; by contrast, an organization that focuses on profit maximization would find this approach less attractive. Moreover, we show that the total solution approach induces the SE to exert more efforts on failure prevention and repair lead time reduction in equilibrium. Our analysis also suggests that the SE could further improve vehicle availability by the total solution approach if it manages a large fleet that consists of vehicles with high resale values. Managerial implications : Our findings provide theoretical support for Riders for Health’s recent move toward the total solution approach as it expands its service into wider rural areas in many countries. The insights obtained from our analysis offer actionable guidelines to other SEs operating in developing economies.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Shipment consolidation (i.e., shipping multiple orders together instead of shipping them separately) is commonly used to decrease total shipping costs. However, when the delivery of some orders is delayed, so they can be consolidated with future orders, a more expensive expedited shipment may be needed to meet shorter deadlines. In this paper, we study the optimal consolidation policy focusing on the trade-off between economies of scale due to combining orders and expedited shipping costs, in the setting of two warehouses. Academic/practical relevance : Our work is motivated by the application of fulfillment consolidation in e-commerce and omni-channel retail, especially with the rise of so-called on-demand logistics services. Sellers have the flexibility to take advantage of consolidation by deciding when to ship the orders and from which warehouse to fulfill the orders, as long as the orders’ deadlines are met. Methodology : We use Dynamic Programming to study the optimal policy and its structure. We also conduct extensive simulation tests to evaluate the performance of heuristics that are based on structures of the optimal policies. Results : The optimal policies and their structures are characterized. Using the insights of these structural properties, we propose two easily implementable heuristics that perform within 1%–2% of the optimal solution and outperform other benchmark consolidation methods in numerical tests. Managerial implications : Consolidation is shown to significantly reduce the outbound shipping costs. Retailers can take advantage of it to effectively improve the standard policies by simply applying the threshold-form heuristics we propose.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In each period of a planning horizon, an online retailer decides how much to replenish each product and how to allocate its inventory to fulfillment centers (FCs) before demand is known. After the demand in the period is realized, the retailer decides on which FCs to fulfill it. It is crucial to optimize the replenishment, allocation, and fulfillment decisions jointly such that the expected total operating cost is minimized. The problem is challenging because the replenishment allocation is done in an anticipative manner under a push strategy, but the fulfillment is executed in a reactive way under a pull strategy. We propose a multiperiod stochastic optimization model to delicately integrate the anticipative replenishment allocation decisions with the reactive fulfillment decisions such that they are determined seamlessly as the demands are realized over time. Academic/practical relevance : The aggressive expansion in e-commerce sales significantly escalates online retailers’ operating costs. Our methodology helps boost their competency in this cutthroat industry. Methodology : We develop a two-phase approach based on robust optimization to solve the problem. The first phase decides whether the products should be replenished in each period (binary decisions). We fix these binary decisions in the second phase, in which we determine the replenishment, allocation, and fulfillment quantities. Results : Numerical experiments suggest that our approach outperforms existing methods from the literature in solution quality and computational time and performs within 7% of a benchmark with perfect information. A study using real data from a major fashion online retailer in Asia suggests that the two-phase approach can potentially reduce the retailer’s cumulative cost significantly. Managerial implications : By decoupling the binary decisions from the continuous decisions, our methodology can solve large problem instances (up to 1,200 products). The integration, robustness, and adaptability of the decisions under our approach create significant value.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The existing literature on probabilistic or opaque selling has largely focused on understanding why it is attractive to firms. In this paper, we intend to answer a follow-up question: How should opaque selling be managed in a firm’s operations over time? Academic/practical relevance : Answering this question is relevant yet complex, because in practice (i) the profitability of opaque selling depends on how customers respond to the firm’s product-offering strategies and (ii) the firm’s strategies have to be responsive to customers’ purchasing decisions to maximize its total profit. Methodology : We develop a simple game-theoretic framework to capture the dynamic nature of the problem in multiple periods when customers boundedly rationally expect the firm’s strategies through anecdotal reasoning. We characterize the firm’s optimal pricing and product-offering policy. Results : We find that offering the high-value product with a high probability followed by a lower probability is typically optimal over time. We finally analyze several model extensions, such as different numbers of customers, multiple anecdotes, infinitely many periods, and limited inventory, and show the robustness of our results. Managerial implications : We demonstrate the value of using a dynamic probabilistic selling policy and prove that our dynamic policy can double the firm’s profit compared with using the static policy proposed in the existing literature. In a dynamic programming model, we prove that a cycle policy oscillating between two product-offering probabilities is typically optimal in the steady state over infinitely many periods.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Brick-and-mortar (B&amp;M) retailers must enhance the customer in-store experience to better compete with online retailers. Fitting rooms in B&amp;M stores play a critical role in the customer experience as a venue to experience products and examine alternatives. High traffic in fitting rooms, however, obstructs the customer’s ability to choose a product. In this paper, we (1) examine the impact of fitting room traffic on store performance using archival data, (2) identify phantom stockouts as a plausible mechanism for this impact, and (3) provide a potential solution and quantify the magnitude of its impact using two field experiments. Academic/practical relevance : The consumer purchase decision process framework has been widely used in disciplines such as marketing and information systems. We consider the impact of high traffic in fitting rooms on customer’s purchase decision process. We show that high traffic in fitting rooms affects store sales negatively as it can obstruct customers’ ability to perform information search , evaluation of alternatives , or both. Methodology : We use archival data analysis, a field study, and a field experiment to demonstrate our findings. Results : We demonstrate an inverted-U relationship between fitting room traffic and sales using archival data analysis. Our field study reveals that high traffic in fitting rooms exacerbates phantom stockouts, which could contribute to the decline in sales. Finally, through field experiments at two retailers, we show that a timely backend recovery operation through a dedicated fitting room associate reduces phantom stockouts and increases sales by 22.4%–22.7%. Managerial implications : First, contrary to conventional wisdom that traffic drives sales, we identify that fitting room traffic beyond a certain point can hurt store sales. Second, we find a large magnitude of phantom stockouts in fitting rooms. Finally, we show that dedicated fitting room labor can significantly boost store sales by alleviating phantom stockouts. Our proposed solution was adopted by both retail organizations that we worked with.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : How should retail staffing levels be set? While cost of labor is well understood, the revenue implications of having the right staffing level are hard to estimate. Moreover, these implications vary by store; hence, staffing levels should vary as well. Academic/practical relevance : We provide a novel method for setting store associate staffing at the individual store level. We discuss a field implementation that tested this methodology. Methodology : We use historical data on revenue and planned and actual staffing levels by store to estimate how revenue varies with the staffing level at each store. We disentangle the endogeneity between revenue and staffing levels by focusing on randomly occurring deviations between planned and actual labor. Using historical analysis as a guide, we validate these results by changing the staffing levels in a few test stores. We implement the results chain-wide and measure the impact in a large specialty retailer. Results : We find that the implementation validates predictions of the historical analysis. The implementation in 168 stores over six months produces a 4.5% revenue increase and a nearly $7.4 million annual profit increase. The impact of staffing level on revenue varies greatly by store. Managerial implications : Our paper makes three contributions to academic literature and to retail practice. First, we describe a process by which retailers can improve the most common industry practice: set store labor to be proportional to forecasted store revenue. Our proposed approach systematically sets the labor level in each store. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of that process via a field test and then via chain-wide implementation over a six-month time period. Finally, most retailers set store labor at the same level across stores, proportionate to revenue. We show that this is not the best approach because the revenue impact of store labor varies by store. The stores in our study that could benefit from relatively more labor were those with high potential demand, closely located competition for that demand, and experienced store managers. Overall, we provide the first simple but rigorous, field-tested approach that any retailer can use to increase revenue and profitability through better labor management.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Project outsourcing has been a pronounced trend in many industries but is also recognized as a major cause for project delays. We study how companies can coordinate outsourced projects with uncertain completion times through bilateral contract negotiations. Academic/practical relevance : Misaligned subcontractor incentives may result in substantial losses to both project clients and subcontractors. Coordinating subcontractors’ efforts through proper contracts is imperative to the success of project outsourcing. Most previous studies on project contracting have not addressed subcontractors’ bargaining powers or the dynamic bargaining process in negotiations. We fill in this gap by studying bilateral bargaining between the client and subcontractors, which better reflects real-world negotiations. Methodology : We model project contract negotiations as a multiunit bilateral bargaining game. We derive the conditions such that bilateral negotiations can achieve system coordination and characterize the equilibrium negotiation outcomes. We then compare the conditions and equilibria under various model settings to study their impact on project contracting. Results : Our study uncovers how the coordination of project outsourcing is impacted by the contract form, bargaining power structure, precedence network topology, payment timing, external opportunities, and negotiation protocols. For single-task projects, the widely used fixed-price (cost-plus) contract can achieve system coordination only when the subcontractor (client) possesses full bargaining power. Cost-sharing and time-based incentive contracts, which perform well for single-task projects, may not be effective for projects with parallel tasks when any subcontractor’s bargaining power is sufficiently high. Projects with serial tasks can be coordinated only under certain extreme bargaining power structures. Delaying payments always exacerbates the incentive misalignment. Managerial implications : Our analysis provides insights and guidelines to companies regarding how to select proper contract forms and payment timing schemes, based on the characteristics of the projects and subcontractors, to ensure the effectiveness of project outsourcing. Our results also highlight the importance of bargaining modeling in project contracting.},

  abstract     = {The (relative) cost of the customer’s waiting time has long been used as a key parameter in queuing models, but it can be difficult to estimate. A recent study introduced a new queue characteristic, the value of the customer’s waiting time, which measures how an increase in the total customer waiting time reduces the servers’ idle time. This paper connects and contrasts these two fundamental concepts in the queuing literature. In particular, we show that the value can be equal to the cost of waiting when the queue is operated at optimal. In this case, we can use the observed queue length to compute the value of waiting, which helps infer the cost of waiting. Nevertheless, these two measures have very different economic interpretations, and in general, they are not equal. For nonoptimal queues, comparing the value with the cost helps shed light on the underlying causes of the customer’s waiting. Although it is tempting to conclude that customers in a queue with a lower value of waiting expect to wait longer, we find that the value of waiting in general does not have a monotonic relationship with the expected waiting time, nor with the expected queue length.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We examine the effect of financial cross-ownership—a situation in which a retailer holds stocks in a competitor—on two crucial operational decisions in a supply chain with competing retailers sourcing from a single supplier: information acquisition and production output. Academic/practical relevance : Financial interconnectedness between competing retailers raises fundamental questions regarding the way information is managed in such markets and the way it affects consumer welfare. Thus, in addition to the relevance to operations management scholars, this subject is of potential interest to policy makers and regulators. Although financial cross-ownership has mainly been unchallenged by regulators, the European Commission has recently called for a deeper understanding of the competitive aspects of this investment tool. Methodology : We develop a game-theoretic model, in which we analyze a supply chain comprised of an incumbent retailer holding stocks in an entrant and both retailers source from a mutual supplier. The incumbent can obtain costless demand information, and the supplier decides whether to leak this information if it is available to him or her. Results : We demonstrate that holding stocks in a rival better aligns the incentives of the rival retailers and results in a lower competition level during the production stage. However, financial cross-ownership can also result in an increased incentive for information acquisition, even when the information is later leaked to the entrant. The acquisition of information benefits not only the retailers but can also make the consumers better off. Managerial implications : Our work contributes to the heated policy debate regarding the competitive effects of financial cross-ownership. In addition, we are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to study the way financial cross-ownership affects operational decisions. Specifically, we show that financial cross-ownership provides incentives to acquire demand information even under the threat of information leakage.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Firms developing novel and innovative products regularly face a canonical product development and introduction problem: introduce a proven and immediately available product or delay product introduction until the successful development of an advanced version. Academic/practical relevance : Limited access to resources for the development of an advanced version adds another wrinkle to this problem, particularly for cash-constrained start-ups. For such start-ups, the introduction of an on-hand product can generate additional funds to support the development of an advanced product. However, the lower performance of the on-hand product can negatively impact the perception of the firm’s future products and lower future profitability. Methodology : We study the trade-off between revenues that an on-hand product generates for research and development funding and the negative effect it has on future profits. We characterize the optimal introduction timing of the on-hand product as a function of the financial resource constraints, the interdependence between these sequential products and the cost of development. Results : We identify important differences between the optimal product introduction strategies of a start-up and an established firm. Specifically, although it is always optimal for an established firm to accelerate the launch of a better-quality on-hand product, a start-up might find it optimal to delay its launch. The impact of technological failure and different forms of learning on the optimal strategy of the start-up are also explored. We translate our analytical findings into a managerial framework and illustrate these results using examples from the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Many healthcare providers and payers offer teletriage, a telemedicine service where concerned patients can get advice about their health condition. In theory, teletriage should help patients with an acute illness choose an appropriate provider, reducing unnecessary and duplicate provider visits, yet no study has assessed the overall costs and benefits of teletriage at a system level. Academic/practical relevance : We model the use of teletriage in managing healthcare demand and determine in which cases teletriage is efficient and effective. Our model extends the academic literature on service operations and provides practical suggestions for healthcare payers. Methodology : We use a Markov decision process to model a patient’s choices during an acute illness episode, where the illness severity is partially observable to the patient and triage is subject to errors. We parameterize the model using data from the literature and provide both structural and numerical results. Results : Patients with high uncertainty about their state would use the teletriage service, which may improve their cost outcomes. However, when teletriage is added, the rate of arrivals to the emergency department (ED) may increase when the overtriage rate is above 5%, the lowest value observed in the literature. Patient’s choices and the copayment of other services affect the cost-effectiveness of teletriage. Managerial implications : There are several reasons why adding teletriage to the healthcare system could produce a negative cost outcome. Teletriage should not necessarily be free, which would encourage use by patients with low levels of uncertainty and actually increase the payer’s total cost. The overtriage rate is a key driver of performance and must be managed carefully.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In this paper, we consider a supply chain with a manufacturer and two retailers who are contracted through wholesale prices or two-part tariffs. We depart from the existing literature by assuming that contract terms between the manufacturer and a retailer are not observed by the rival retailer. Academic/practical relevance : Although the existing literature typically assumes that they are common knowledge in the market, contract terms may not be observed by rival retailers under certain circumstances. This paper contributes to the literature by studying the effect of contract unobservability on supply chain performance. Methodology : We use game-theoretical methods to find the equilibrium. When there are multiple equilibria, we adopt passive beliefs as an equilibrium-refinement criterion. Results : We find that certain established results regarding observable supply chain contracts do not always apply when those contracts become unobservable to competing retailers. In particular, compared with when using two-part tariff contracts, the manufacturer may benefit from using wholesale-price contracts when contract terms are unobservable. Moreover, the total industry profit may increase under wholesale-price contracts. Managerial implications : Our results offer an alternative explanation for the popularity of wholesale-price contracts and suggest that members of the supply chain must take unobservability into account when selecting the right contracts. We also offer new insights into buyback contracts and downstream mergers under unobservable contracts.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We conduct a controlled human-subjects experiment in a two-tier supply chain where a supplier’s per-unit production cost may be private information while bargaining with a buyer. Academic/practical relevance : Academically, supply chain studies often assume full-information or highly structured bargaining. We consider private information with dynamic, unstructured bargaining. In practice, a buyer may not know its supplier’s cost exactly and interact with its supplier in a back-and-forth bargaining environment. Thus, understanding how a supplier’s private cost information affects both supply chain outcomes and bargaining is new to the literature and relevant to practice. Methodology : We employ insights from mechanism design to generate restrictions on the space of agreements and solve for a specific bargaining solution under private information to generate precise predictions. These predictions are then tested through a human-subjects experiment. Results : In our experiment, theory predicts that all supplier types should earn at least 50% of total profits when their cost information is private. However, we find that high-cost suppliers earn a disproportionately low share of total profits under private information, 20.16%. We show that this is because buyers, under private information, act as if they are bargaining with the lowest-cost supplier and suppliers do not appear to blame buyers for behaving this way. Based on these findings, we conduct an additional experiment where suppliers have the ability to communicate their private costs to buyers and observe that verifiable disclosure significantly increases profits for high-cost suppliers. Managerial implications : High-cost suppliers actually suffer from having their costs as private information, which runs counter to theory. However, if high-cost suppliers can credibly disclose their costs to buyers, they can significantly increase profits. Lastly, although private information does not lead to more disagreements, negotiations do take longer, which can be costly to firms.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider dual sourcing in a distribution network for spare parts consisting of one central warehouse and multiple local warehouses. Each warehouse keeps multiple types of repairable parts to maintain several types of capital goods. The repair shop at the central warehouse has two repair options for each repairable part: a regular repair option and an expedited repair option. Irrespective of the repair option, each repairable part uses a certain resource for its repair. In the design of these inventory systems, companies need to decide on stocking levels and expedite thresholds such that total stock investments are minimized while satisfying asset availability and expediting constraints. Academic/practical relevance : Although most companies have the possibility to expedite the repair of parts in short supply, no contributions have been made that incorporate such dynamic expediting policies in repairable investment decisions. Anticipating expediting decisions that will be made later leads to substantial reductions in repairable investments. Methodology : We use queueing theory to determine the performance of the central warehouse and subsequently find the performance of all local warehouses using binomial disaggregation. For the optimization problem, we develop a greedy heuristic and a decomposition and column generation based algorithm. Results : Both solution approaches perform very well with average optimality gaps of 2.38 and 0.27%, respectively, across a large test bed of industrial size. The possibility to expedite the repair of failed parts is effective in reducing stock investments with average reductions of 7.94% and even reductions up to 19.61% relative to the state of the art. Managerial implications : Based on a case study at Netherlands Railways, we show how managers can significantly reduce the investment in repairable spare parts when dynamic repair policies are leveraged to prioritize repair of parts whose inventory is critically low.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the sales planning problem of a producer who sells new and remanufactured versions of a durable good over a finite life cycle. We investigate whether slowing down product diffusion by choosing to partially satisfy demand might be profitable for the producer. Academic/practical relevance : We provide new insights into sales management in closed-loop supply chains by uncovering the role key market characteristics play in profitability of partial demand fulfillment as well as its optimal timing and magnitude. Methodology : We develop a dynamic model in which demand arrives as a slightly modified Bass diffusion process, and end-of-use products required for remanufacturing are constrained by earlier sales. Results : The optimal sales plan involves partial demand fulfillment when the product diffusion rate is high, the profit margin from remanufacturing is large, and the remanufactured item is in limited demand. Partial demand fulfillment extends to earlier stages of the life cycle as the diffusion rate grows, the demand for remanufactured items shrinks, or the number of consumers who return their end-of-use items increases. It is profitable to backlog more customers when the word-of-mouth effect dominates the diffusion process or when the demand for remanufactured items is lower. Finally, the benefit of delaying product diffusion tends to increase with diffusion rate. Managerial implications : Our findings suggest that deliberately backlogging some customers may be an effective lever (in the absence of flexibility to dynamically adjust prices) for durable-good producers in fast-clockspeed industries to improve their total profits from the jointly optimized sales of new and remanufactured items.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Pediatric vaccine markets in the United States are vulnerable to the development of monopolies due to few manufacturers and high research and development costs. This work addresses how the government can ensure the cost-effective procurement of pediatric vaccines by all U.S. children from private manufacturers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) significant patronage of pediatric vaccines affords them leverage in negotiating public-sector prices that prevent the formation of monopolies, but existing vaccine pricing literature excludes the CDC as a rational player. Academic/practical relevance : We combine optimization and game theoretic techniques to address cost-effective immunization of all U.S. children. Methodology : Our optimization model from the CDC’s perspective minimizes negotiated government costs while ensuring adequate national vaccination levels, linking dynamics in public and private sectors, and incorporating competitive manufacturer behavior. The optimization model embeds an extant game theoretic price model to capture competitive interactions among manufacturers in the private sector, where they compete independently of the CDC. The model is validated in an extended case study of the Infanrix–Daptacel vaccine duopoly. Results : The study indicates that dissimilar products advantageously segment markets with asymmetric manufacturers. Furthermore, markets are at lower risk when high-capacity manufacturers have moderate target profits, especially in cases of high demand and asymmetry. We demonstrate that our model can help restabilize a market that experiences a vaccine shortage and that the CDC might mitigate the same shortage using strategies that depend on which manufacturer is limited. We also underline scenarios in which the CDC may be able to prevent monopolies through financial incentives to manufacturers. The results support a paradigm shift from annual contracts to ongoing negotiations, which would enable the CDC to exercise control over high-risk markets. Managerial implications : Our study demonstrates an analytical approach for managerial government officials to influence pediatric vaccine prices via the procurement of public-sector goods.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We examine the importance of expert services in online materials and waste exchanges (OMWEs), which are online business-to-business markets for coordinating transactions of industrial surplus, by-products, and waste. Academic/practical relevance : OMWEs face unique challenges because of their product mix and market characteristics. Many OMWEs have traditionally relied on a combination of routine services (online aggregation, filtered search, etc.) and expert services (selective and spatial matching, contract facilitation, etc.). Although OMWEs employ varying levels of expert services, the ultimate value of expert services in promoting transactions is not fully understood. From a managerial perspective, our study provides insights into the importance of balancing routine and expert services, offering guidance on when expert services offer the most benefits. From an academic perspective, we expand on the type of product and market attributes that should be considered in tailoring OMWE designs. Methodology : We use transactional data from a unique OMWE setting (MNExchange.org), which consists of approximately 3,500 product listings from 700+ supplier firms, collected during 2001–2007. We use various econometric techniques (survival analysis, regression discontinuity, etc.) to examine the changes in performance, including transaction rates and time to market, attributable to an operational policy change that occurred in 2004. We further conduct a detailed examination of mechanisms, alternative explanations, and counterfactual analysis. Results : The results show that eliminating expert services in OMWEs can adversely affect transaction outcomes in OMWEs. In particular, the results show that OMWEs should consider their product mix and market characteristics when making decisions about the appropriate use of expert services. Managerial implications : The study provides insights for improving the potential of online reuse marketplaces in the circular economy. From a broader perspective, the paper contributes to the debate on the role of technology in sustainable development and technology substitution for human tasks.},

Furthermore, understanding how elements of service quality contribute to the performance of service providers continues to be a concern in the service industry. In this paper, we address these challenges in the restaurant sector, a vital component of the service industry. Academic/practical relevance : Our work provides a scalable methodology for measuring the quality of service providers using the vast amount of text in social media. The quality metrics proposed are associated with economic outcomes for restaurants and can help predict future restaurant performance. Methodology : We use text present in online reviews on Yelp.com to identify and extract service dimensions using nonnegative matrix factorization for a large set of restaurants located in a major city in the United States. We subsequently validate these service dimensions as proxies for service quality using external data sources and a series of laboratory experiments. Finally, we use econometrics to test the relationship between these dimensions and restaurant survival as additional validation. Results : We find that our proposed service quality dimensions are scalable, match industry standards, and are correctly identified by subjects in a controlled setting. Furthermore, we show that specific service dimensions are significantly correlated with the survival of merchants, even after controlling for competition and other factors. Managerial implications : This work has implications for the strategic use of text analytics in the context of service operations, where an increasingly large text corpus is available.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We examine a dynamic assignment problem faced by a large wireless service provider (WSP) that is a Fortune 100 company. This company manages two warranties: (i) a customer warranty that the WSP offers its customers and (ii) an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) warranty that OEMs offer the WSP. The WSP uses devices refurbished by the OEM as replacement devices, and hence their warranty operation is a closed-loop supply chain. Depending on the assignment the WSP uses, the customer and OEM warranties might become misaligned for customer-device pairs, potentially incurring a cost for the WSP. Academic/practical relevance : We identify, model, and analyze a new dynamic assignment problem that emerges in this setting called the warranty matching problem . We introduce a new class of policies, called farsighted policies , which can perform better than myopic policies. We also propose a new heuristic assignment policy, the sampling policy , which leads to a near-optimal assignment. Our model and results are motivated by a real-world problem, and our theory-guided assignment policies can be used in practice; we validate our results using data from our industrial partner. Methodology : We formulate the problem of dynamically assigning devices to customers as a discrete-time stochastic dynamic programming problem. Because this problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality, we propose and analyze a set of reasonable classes of assignment policies. Results : The performance metric that we use for a given assignment policy is the average time that a replacement device under a customer warranty is uncovered by an OEM warranty. We show that our assignment policies reduce the average uncovered time and the expected number of out-of-OEM-warranty returns by more than 75% in comparison with our industrial partner’s current assignment policy. We also provide distribution-free bounds for the performance of a myopic assignment policy and of random assignment, which is a proxy for the WSP’s current policy. Managerial implications : Our results indicate that, in closed-loop supply chains, being completely farsighted might be better than being completely myopic. Also, policies that are effective in balancing short-term and long-term costs can be simple and effective, as illustrated by our sampling policy. We describe how the performance of myopic and farsighted policies depend on the size and length of inventory buildup.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : When sourcing through a procurement service provider (PSP), the PSP often collects rebates from unethical manufacturers in developing countries (as referral fees) that are “hidden” from the retailers. Recognizing that a PSP has a strong incentive to solicit quotes from unethical manufacturers, we examine a situation in which the retailer insists on soliciting a quote from a manufacturer designated by the retailer and a separate quote from an unethical manufacturer selected by the PSP. However, when the designated manufacturer is ethical, the PSP has an incentive to inflate the quote from this ethical manufacturer in order to help the unethical manufacturer to win. Facing this situation, is there a mechanism for the retailer to control hidden rebates? Academic/practical relevance : The issue of hidden rebates is a “known secret” in global supply chain practice. Also, hidden rebates increase the customs duty for U.S. importers because of the first sales rule for customs valuation of U.S. imports. Therefore, there is a need to understand the implications of hidden rebates and to control this unethical practice. Methodology : To circumvent the issue of hidden rebates and quote inflations, we develop a deterministic, incentive-compatible mechanism that is based on a simple selection rule (for selecting a manufacturer) and a contingent service fee (as a reward for the service provided by the PSP). Results : Our optimal mechanism creates incentives to (1) deter the PSP from inflating the quote submitted from the ethical manufacturer, (2) reduce the incidence of hidden rebates, and (3) reduce the retailer’s procurement cost and the corresponding import tax significantly. More importantly, relative to the “lowest quote wins” selection rule, the optimal mechanism is Pareto-improving for the retailer and the service provider when the hidden rebate is below a certain threshold. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the case in which (1) the retailer is not sure whether the designated manufacturer is ethical or not, (2) the retailer does not know the exact value of hidden rebate (but it follows a two-point distribution), and (3) the retailer may verify the quote with its designated manufacturer before a formal contract. We also explore the stochastic incentive-compatible mechanism for the cases in which the penalty is unenforceable or enforceable. Managerial implications : When law enforcement is inconsistent in developing countries, retailers should beware of the existence and implications of hidden rebates. We provide a simple mechanism that a retailer can consider as a practical way to deter the PSP from inflating certain quotes and put hidden rebates under control.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We analyze a contract in which a supplier who is exposed to disruption risk offers a supply-flexibility contract comprising of a wholesale price and a minimum-delivery fraction (“flexibility” fraction) to a buyer facing random demand. The supplier is allowed to deviate below the order quantity by at most the flexibility fraction. The supplier’s regular production is subject to random disruption, but she has access to a reliable expedited supply source at a higher marginal cost. Academic/practical relevance : Despite the prevalence of supply-flexibility contracts in practice, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous academic literature examining the optimal design of supply-flexibility contracts. As such, the level of flexibility in practice is usually set on an ad-hoc basis, with buyers typically reluctant to share risk with suppliers. Our analysis of supply-flexibility contracts informs practice in two ways: First, using analytically supported arguments, it educates managers on the effects of their decisions on the economic outcomes. Second, it shows that the supply-flexibility contract benefits both the supplier and the buyer, regardless of which player chooses how supply risk is allocated in the supply chain. Methodology : Non-cooperative game theory, non-convex optimization. Results : We derive the supplier-led optimal contract and show that supply chain efficiency improves relative to the price-only contract. More interestingly, even though the buyer lets the supplier decide how the two share supply risk, profits of both the players increase by the introduction of flexibility into the contract. Further, supply flexibility may be even more valuable for the buyer compared with the supplier. Interestingly, the flexibility fraction is not monotone in supplier reliability and a more reliable supplier may even prefer to transfer more risk to the buyer. The robustness of these findings is established on two extensions: one where we study a buyer-led contract (i.e., the buyer chooses the flexibility fraction) and the other where the expedited supply option is available to both the supplier and the buyer. Managerial implications : The supply-flexibility contract is mutually beneficial for both players and yet retains all the advantages of the price-only contract—it is easy to implement, it requires minimal operational and administrative burden, and there is evidence of the use of such contracts in practice. While our focus is not on supply chain coordination, we note that the combination of two mechanisms—the supply-flexibility contract derived in this paper to share supply risk and a buyback contract to share demand risk—yields a coordinating contract.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Recently, there has been a rapid rise of on-demand ride-hailing platforms, such as Uber and Didi, which allow passengers with smartphones to submit trip requests and match them to drivers based on their locations and drivers’ availability. This increased demand has raised questions about how such a new matching mechanism will affect the efficiency of the transportation system—in particular, whether it will help reduce passengers’ average waiting time compared with traditional street-hailing systems. Academic/practical relevance : The on-demand ride-hailing problem has gained much academic interest recently. The results we find in the ride-hailing system have a significant deviation from classic queueing theory where en route time does not play a role. Methodology : In this paper, we shed light on this question by building a stylized model of a circular road and comparing the average waiting times of passengers under various matching mechanisms. Results : We discover the inefficiency in the on-demand ride-hailing system when the en route time is long, which may result in nonmonotonicity of passengers’ average waiting time as the passenger arrival rate increases. After identifying key trade-offs between different mechanisms, we find that the on-demand matching mechanism could result in lower efficiency than the traditional street-hailing mechanism when the system utilization level is medium and the road length is long. Managerial implications : To overcome the disadvantage of both systems, we further propose adding response caps to the on-demand ride-hailing mechanism and develop a heuristic method to calculate a near-optimal cap. We also examine the impact of passenger abandonments, idle time strategies of taxis, and traffic congestion on the performance of the ride-hailing systems. The results of this research would be instrumental for understanding the trade-offs of the new service paradigm and thus enable policy makers to make more informed decisions when enacting regulations for this emerging service paradigm.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Transshipment/inventory sharing has been used in practice because of its risk-pooling potential. However, human decision makers play a critical role in making inventory decisions in an inventory sharing system, which may affect its benefits. We investigate whether the opportunity to transship inventory influences decision makers’ inventory decisions and whether, as a result, the intended risk-pooling benefits materialize. Academic/practical relevance : Previous research in transshipment, which is focused on finding optimal stocking and sharing decisions, assumes rational decision making without any systematic bias. As one of the first to study inventory sharing from a behavioral perspective, we demonstrate a persistent stocking-decision bias relevant for inventory sharing systems. Methodology : We develop a behavioral model of a multilocation inventory system with transshipments. Using four behavioral studies, we identify, test, estimate, and mitigate a demand-side underweighting bias: although inventory sharing brings both a supply-side benefit and a demand-side benefit, players underestimate the latter. We show analytically that such bias leads to underordering. We also explore whether reframing the inventory sharing decision reduces this bias. Results : Our results show that subjects persistently reduce their order quantities when transshipments are allowed. This underordering, which persists even when a decision-support system suggests optimal quantities, causes insufficient inventory in the system, in turn reducing the risk-pooling benefits of inventory sharing. Underordering is evidently caused by an underweighting bias; although players correctly estimate the supply-side potential from transshipment, they only estimate 20% of the demand-side potential. Managerial implications : Although inventory sharing can profitably reduce inventory, too much underordering undermines its intended risk-pooling benefits. The demand-side benefits of transshipment need to be emphasized when implementing inventory sharing systems.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : A major task in retail operations is to optimize the assortments exhibited to consumers. To this end, retailers need to understand customers’ preferences for different products. Academic/practical relevance : This is particularly challenging when only sales and product-availability data are recorded, and not all products are displayed in all periods. Similarly, in revenue management contexts, firms (airlines, hotels, etc.) need to understand customers’ preferences for different options in order to optimize the menu of products to offer. Methodology : In this paper, we study the estimation of preferences under a multinomial logit model of demand when customers arrive over time in accordance with a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. This model has recently caught important attention in both academic and industrial practices. We formulate the problem as a maximum-likelihood estimation problem, which turns out to be nonconvex. Results : Our contribution is twofold: From a theoretical perspective, we characterize conditions under which the maximum-likelihood estimates are unique and the model is identifiable. From a practical perspective, we propose a minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm to ease the optimization of the likelihood function. Through an extensive numerical study, we show that our algorithm leads to better estimates in a noticeably short computational time compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Managerial implications : The theoretical results provide a solid foundation for the use of the model in terms of the quality of the derived estimates. At the same time, the fast MM algorithm allows the implementation of the model and the estimation procedure at large scale, compatible with real industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study how to optimally control a multistage supply chain in which each location can initiate multiple flows of product, including the reverse flow of orders. We also quantify the resulting value generated by reverse logistics and identify the drivers of that value. Academic/practical relevance : Reverse logistics has been gaining recognition in practice and theory for helping companies better match supply with demand, and thus reduce costs in their supply chains. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of clarity in practice and the research literature regarding precisely what in reverse logistics is so important, exactly how reverse logistics creates value, and what the drivers of that value are. Methodology : We first formulate a multistage inventory model to jointly optimize ordering decisions pertaining to regular, reverse, and expedited flows of product in a logistics supply chain , where the physical transformation of the product is completed at the most upstream location. With multiple product flows, the feasible region for the problem acquires multidimensional boundaries that lead to the curse of dimensionality. Next, we extend our analysis to product-transforming supply chains , in which product transformation is allowed to occur at each location. In such a system, it becomes necessary to keep track of both the location and stage of completion of each unit of inventory; thus, the number of state and decision variables increases with the square of the number of locations. Results : To solve the reverse logistics problem in logistics supply chains, we develop a different solution method that allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the feasible region and identify the structure of the optimal policy. We refer to this policy as a nested echelon base stock policy , as decisions for different product flows are sequentially nested within each other. We show that this policy renders the model analytically and numerically tractable. Our results provide actionable policies for firms to jointly manage the three different product flows in their supply chains and allow us to arrive at insights regarding the main drivers of the value of reverse logistics. One of our key findings is that, when it comes to the value generated by reverse logistics, demand variability (i.e., demand uncertainty across periods) matters more than demand volatility (i.e., demand uncertainty within each period). To analyze product-transforming supply chains, we first identify a policy that provides a lower bound on the total cost. Then, we establish a special decomposition of the objective cost function that allows us to propose a novel heuristic policy. We find that the performance gap of our heuristic policy relative to the lower-bounding policy averages less than 5% across a range of parameters and supply chain lengths. Managerial implications : Researchers can build on our methodology to study more complex reverse logistics settings, as well as tackle other inventory problems with multidimensional boundaries of the feasible region. Our insights can help companies involved in reverse logistics to better manage their orders for products, and better understand the value created by this capability and when (not) to invest in reverse logistics.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a special form of group buying: the group buying succeeds only if the number of sign-ups reaches a preset threshold, with no duration constraint. Customers with heterogeneous valuations arrive sequentially and decide between signing up for the group buying or purchasing a regular product. To decide whether to join the group buying, customers need to estimate their expected waiting time, which varies depending on the cumulative sign-ups by the time of their arrival. The firm decides on the prices for the group-buying product and regular product, with the product quality levels and group-buying size exogenously determined. Academic/practical relevance : This type of group buying is often adopted for a special edition of the product and offered alongside a constantly available regular product. Methodology : We study the product line design with the group-buying sign-up behavior of customers characterized by the rational expectations equilibrium in a random pledging process. Results : We show that group buying with flexible duration can result in intertemporal customer segmentation, as different segments might be admitted at different times in the dynamic sign-up process. Such intertemporal segmentation is a natural discrimination scheme and has nontrivial implications. First, the efficiency loss due to waiting for enough sign-ups may decrease when a larger batch size is required for economic production. Second, as valuation heterogeneity in the market increases, the firm may not always benefit from offering group buying along with the regular product. Third, group buying can achieve a win-win-win situation for both high-end and low-end customers as well as the firm. Managerial implications : In addition to demonstrating the profitability of flexible-duration group buying, we show that the firm can strengthen its profitability by contingently setting prices or concealing sign-up information in group buying. We also confirm the robustness of our main insights by considering customers’ heterogeneous patience levels and horizontally differentiated products, among other factors.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper studies the optimal design of referral priority programs, in which customers on a waiting list can jump the line by inviting their friends to also join the waiting list. Academic/practical relevance : Recent years have witnessed a growing presence of referral priority programs as a novel customer-acquisition strategy for firms that maintain a waiting list. Different variations of this scheme are seen in practice, raising the question of what should be the optimal referral priority mechanism. Methodology : I build an analytical model that integrates queuing theory into a mechanism design framework in which the objective of the firm is to maximize the system throughput, that is, accelerate customer acquisition as much as possible. Results : My analysis shows that the optimal mechanism has one of the following structures: full priority; partial priority; first in, first out (FIFO); and strategic delay. A full-priority (partial-priority) scheme enables referring customers to get ahead of all (only some) nonreferring ones. A FIFO scheme does not provide any priority-based referral incentive. A strategic-delay scheme grants full priority to referring customers but artificially inflates the delay of nonreferring ones. I show that FIFO is optimal if either the base-market size or the referral cost is large. Otherwise, partial priority is optimal if the base-market size is above a certain threshold; full priority is optimal at the threshold base-market size; strategic delay is optimal if the base-market size is below the threshold. I also find that referrals motivate the firm to maintain a larger capacity and therefore can surprisingly shorten the average delay, even though more customers sign up and strategic delay is sometimes inserted. Managerial implications : My paper provides prescriptive guidance for launching an optimal referral priority program and rationalizes common referral schemes seen in practice.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider a revenue-generating call center with inbound and outbound calls, where service and sales activities are blended. For maximizing the call center’s revenue, the call center manager exercises two levels of control: agent reservation for inbound calls and call outsourcing. Given the influence of waits on purchase probability, we investigate the strategy of outsourcing customers who have waited already as opposed to outsourcing customers directly at arrival. Academic/practical relevance : The main novelty of this article arises from the use of a single framework to investigate both the combination of agent reservation with outsourcing decisions, and a waiting time–based outsourcing strategy. The existing literature only considers these two strategies in isolation and is restricted to quantity-based decisions. From a practical viewpoint, our results aim to provide decision support tools that are directly implementable in a call center’s routing software. Methodology : We apply a Markov decision process approach to optimize the manager’s decisions. The particularity of our approach is that we use the experienced waiting time as a decision variable. Results : We prove that the optimal policy for reservation and outsourcing is of threshold type. Our main conclusion is that outsourcing customers after letting them wait in-house generates higher revenue than outsourcing calls at arrival. However, it is also detrimental to service quality. In addition, we identify contexts in which the difference between the two outsourcing strategies is significant. Managerial implications : Contrary to standard call center practices, which either consist of specialized teams for one type of call or only exercise one specific level of decision-making (reservation or outsourcing), we demonstrate the potential of partial outsourcing with partial reservation. Our study shows that the benefits of implementing our results are greatest in small congested call centers.},

Academic/practical relevance : Previous research has found price discrimination in business-to-consumer markets, in which buyers are end customers. There is limited research on suppliers’ price-quoting behaviors and price discrimination in business-to-business (B2B) markets. It is unclear whether certain characteristics of B2B buyers, who are often representatives of firms and not end customers, would influence suppliers’ pricing decisions. Methodology : We collaborate with a global trading company that runs a field experiment on a B2B platform. Results : We find that there is no significant difference in the wholesale prices quoted to buyers selling in U.S. and South African markets. We also find that suppliers quote significantly higher wholesale prices to white buyers than to Asian and black buyers regardless of country. However, price discrimination disappears when buyers present market information to suppliers, providing the lowest wholesale price offered by other suppliers in the market, whereas price discrimination remains when buyers present social information to suppliers, thereby indicating the buyer is referred by a previous customer. In addition, we show that market information can help buyers obtain a lower wholesale price because it signals a lower willingness to pay. Social information, however, can reduce price quotes for only black and white buyers but not for Asian (particularly Chinese) buyers.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the problem of designing a dynamic invitation policy for proactive service systems with finite customer patience under scarce capacity. In such systems, prior knowledge regarding customer value or importance is used to decide whether the company should offer service or not. Academic/practical relevance : Proactive service systems are becoming more popular, as data availability and machine-learning techniques are developed to forecast customer needs. However, very little is known about the efficient use of such tools to promote and manage service systems. Methodology : We use fluid approximation and the Filippov convex method to analyze system dynamics and develop approximations for important performance measures. Results : We show that whereas prioritizing customers in descending order of their r-μ ranking (as long as there are idle servers in the system) is optimal on the fluid level, refinements are necessary in the presence of abandonment on the stochastic level. We propose an r-μ-N policy to account for customer patience. Managerial implications : Our policy can be used to promote service effectivenes and allow decision makers the means to trade off service level against costs in such systems explicitly.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper studies an online retailer’s problem of choosing fulfillment centers in which to place items. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer program that models thousands or millions of items to be placed in dozens of fulfillment centers and shipped to dozens of customer regions. The objective is to minimize the sum of shipping and fixed costs over one planning period. Academic/practical relevance : A good placement plan can significantly reduce the operational cost, which is crucial for online-retail businesses because they often have a low profit margin. The placement problem can be difficult to solve with existing techniques or off-the-shelf software because of the large number of items and the fulfillment center fixed costs and capacity constraints. Methodology : We propose a large-scale optimization framework that aggregates items into clusters, solves the cluster-level problem with column generation, and disaggregates the solution into item-level placement plans. We develop an a priori bound on the optimality gap, and we also apply the framework to a numerical example that consists of 1,000,000 items. Results : The a priori bound provides insights on how to select the appropriate aggregation criteria. For the numerical example, our framework produces a near-optimal solution in a few hours, significantly outperforming a sequential placement heuristic that approximates the status quo. Managerial implications : Our study provides a computationally efficient approach for solving online-retail inventory placement as well as similar large-scale optimization problems in practice.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper explores the impact of competition between platforms in the sharing economy. Examples include the cases of Uber and Lyft in the context of ride-sharing platforms. In particular, we consider competition between two platforms that offer a common service (e.g., rides) through a set of independent service providers (e.g., drivers) to a market of customers. Each platform sets a price that is charged to customers for obtaining the service provided by a driver. A portion of that price is paid to the driver who delivers the service. Both customers’ and drivers’ utilities are sensitive to the payment terms set by the platform and are also sensitive to congestion in the system (given by the relative number of customers and drivers in the market). We consider two possible settings. The first one, termed “single-homing,” assumes that drivers work through a single platform. In the second setting, termed “multihoming” (or “multiapping,” as it is known in practice), drivers deliver their service through both platforms. Academic/practical relevance : This is one of the first papers to study competition and multihoming in the presence of congestion effects typically observed in the sharing economy. We leverage the model to study some practical questions that have received significant press attention (and stirred some controversies) in the ride-sharing industry. The first involves the issue of surge pricing. The second involves the increasingly common practice of drivers choosing to operate on multiple platforms (multihoming). Methodology : We formulate our problem as a pricing game between two platforms and employ the concept of a Nash equilibrium to analyze equilibrium outcomes in various settings. Results : In both the single-homing and multihoming settings, we study the equilibrium prices that emerge from the competitive interaction between the platforms and explore the supply and demand outcomes that can arise at equilibrium. We build on these equilibrium results to study the impact of surge pricing in response to a surge in demand and to examine the incentives at play when drivers engage in multihoming. Managerial implications : We find that raising prices in response to a surge in demand makes drivers and customers better off than if platforms were constrained to charge the same prices that would arise under normal demand levels. We also compare drivers’ and customers’ performance when all drivers either single-home or multihome. We find that although individual drivers may have an incentive to multihome, all players are worse off when all drivers multihome. We conclude by proposing an incentive mechanism to discourage multihoming.},

Researchers have studied the extent to which an increase in staffing levels translates into greater revenues, without emphasizing the underlying mechanisms that generate this potential improvement, such as assisting customers. Methodology : We use econometric methods, including survival-analysis techniques, to analyze data gathered from in-store video recordings of customer visits to stores of a women’s apparel chain. Results : We find that, under average store conditions, a 25% increase in labor yields a 16% increase in store revenues. An increase in the assistance of customers while searching, browsing, or trying products mediates approximately 50% of this increase, while the remainder originates from other activities, such as helping customers at the checkout counter. Moreover, we find that this form of assistance has a significant and positive impact on both conversion and ticket size. Managerial implications : Our approach can be used to explain heterogeneity in employee productivity across stores, to monitor and detect unexpected deviations in customer-assistance levels, and to measure the productivity of multitasking agents for the different functions that they perform.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Is teamwork better than working alone for creating breakthrough inventions? We challenge the widely accepted affirmative answer to this question. Academic/practical relevance : Extant research has consistently found that lone inventors significantly underperform teams in creating breakthroughs; thus it extols the benefits of teamwork while neglecting the role of single inventors. This paper offers an important counterweight to those empirical results by identifying a fundamental contingency under which teams might or might not outperform lone inventors: the degree of decomposability of the invention. By ignoring this contingency, past literature has systematically underestimated the role that lone inventors can play for companies. Methodology : We use utility and design patent data for 1985–2009 to compare the effect—on the probability of creating a breakthrough—of working alone versus working with a team. Results : For utility patents, we do find that working alone reduces the likelihood of achieving a breakthrough. Yet this disadvantage of lone inventors is not evident for design patents. We theorize that the nearly nondecomposable nature of design is a major factor contributing to lone designers’ relative efficacy of achieving breakthroughs. This theory is then tested in the context of utility patents, where we can observe variation in inventions’ decomposability. We find that technology inventions that are difficult to decompose also relatively advantage lone inventors compared with teams, and we demonstrate that this finding reflects greater coordination costs when such inventions are attempted by teams. If one takes a myopic view of collaboration’s role, then our results suggest that working with others does not help develop outstanding nondecomposable inventions. Yet taking a long-term view reveals that lone inventors benefit more than do teams from having collaborated with others in the past. In fact, we find that past collaborations can help lone inventors outperform teams with regard to developing nondecomposable inventions. Managerial implications : Past research has suggested that collaboration is universally beneficial in creating breakthrough inventions. However, such efforts have ignored crucial contingencies: we show why inventors should explicitly consider both the targeted invention’s decomposability and their own history of collaboration when deciding whether or not to work with a team on a given innovation.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider a service system in which customers must travel to the queue to be served. In our base model, customers observe the queue length and then decide whether to travel. We also consider alternative information models and investigate how the availability of queue-length information affects customer-equilibrium strategies, throughput, and social welfare. Academic/practical relevance : A common assumption in queueing models is that once a customer decides to join the queue, joining is instantaneous. This assumption does not fit real-life settings, where customers possess online information about the current wait time at the service, but while traveling to the service, its queue length may change. Motivated by this realistic setting, we study how queue-length information prior to traveling affects customers’ decision to travel. Methodology : We prove that a symmetric equilibrium exists in our base model. We perform the calculation numerically as a result of the model complexity, which is due to the fact that the arrival rate to the traveling queue depends on the current state of the service queue, and vice versa. The alternative models are tractable, and we present their analytical solution. Results : When customers can observe the service-queue length prior to traveling, their probability of traveling is monotonically nonincreasing with the observed queue length. We find that customers may adopt a generalized mixed-threshold equilibrium strategy: Travel when observing short queue lengths, avoid traveling when observing long queue lengths, and mix between traveling and not traveling when observing intermediate queue lengths, with a decreasing probability of traveling. Managerial implications : Our results imply that when system congestion is high, the provider can increase throughput by disclosing the queue-length information, whereas at low congestion, the provider benefits from concealing the information. With respect to social welfare, queue-length information prior to departure is beneficial when congestion is at intermediate to high levels and yields the same social welfare otherwise.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Trustworthy partners in procurement and service relationships are an asset. How can organizations discern trustworthy from untrustworthy partners, especially early on, so as to not waste time or resources on bad relationships? Academic/practical relevance : Like prior studies, we take the perspective that organizations rarely know whether a partner is trustworthy, but also that organizations often have some evidence of a partner’s trustworthiness, even before interacting. We argue a qualitative study is needed to understand how people discern a partner’s trustworthiness and the consequences of initial perceptions on the relationship trajectory. Methodology : We conduct an interview-based study of how people discern trustworthy partners in a setting where doing so is challenging: the education sector. Kindergarten-through-12th-grade schools must choose outside partners to rely on for resources or services the school cannot afford. Potential partners are numerous and of variable trustworthiness. Results : We find people use contextual factors as evidence of a potential partner’s trustworthiness, such as the partner’s institutional affiliations, physical proximity, and relationships with other schools. Sometimes the evidence indicates that a partner acts intrinsically trustworthily, regardless of these contextual factors. In other cases, the evidence indicates a partner acts contextually trustworthily, meaning partners follow through in some conditions but not others. Intrinsically trustworthy partners provide valuable but standardized resources or services. Contextually trustworthy partners provide the competitive advantage: customized resources that are not easily accessible by other schools. Managerial implications : People in organizations identify trustworthy partners via contextual factors, which helps them determine whether a partner acts trustworthily independent of context or conditional on context. The value of intrinsically trustworthy partners derives from their low risk and high quality, whereas the value of contextually trustworthy partners derives from their willingness to customize resources or services to some—but not all—organizations.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Misconduct, such as theft, is a major problem in operational settings, and staffing decisions can either amplify or mitigate this problem as workers influence their peers’ behavior. Peers are known to influence coworker productivity and likely also affect counterproductive behaviors. Academic/practical relevance : Many studies have shown how mechanisms such as helping, knowledge transfer, teaching, and social pressure generate productivity peer effects in service and other settings. Yet few papers empirically examine these effects in counterproductive behaviors. We argue that while the same mechanisms driving productivity spillovers also generate peer effects in misconduct, an additional effect—strategic peer response—reflects how coworkers, under managerial monitoring, adjust misconduct in response to peers’ daily behavior. An additional contribution of this paper is to identify the effect of peers on operational performance in a firm setting. Methodology : We use transaction and theft data from 83,153 servers at 1,049 restaurants across 46 states in the United States. We employ instrumental variable (IV) models to account for both reflection problems and correlated error terms in same-day peer theft. We use Monte Carlo simulations to present how biases identified by a combination of ordinary least squares (OLS) and IV models suggest that managerial oversight might generate negative correlation in the same-day error terms of peers that reflects strategic peer responses. Results : Our results show that although servers are more likely to steal when working with high-theft peers, they steal less as peers steal more on a given day . We also show that this negative correlation in daily peer theft is higher under an information technology system that increases managerial oversight by reporting likely theft to managers. Importantly, we demonstrate how reflection effects can significantly amplify even small peer-effect coefficients to have large organizational implications. Our parameter estimates indicate that doubling a single worker’s average theft amount will increase total theft in an average restaurant by 76%. Doubling all workers’ theft amounts increases totals by 550%. Finally, we show that the positive peer effect from high-theft coworkers only exists for new workers in their first three to five months on the job, consistent with imprinting mechanisms that include knowledge transfer and norms. Managerial implications : The results show that the costs of employing unethical workers is higher than the direct cost of those workers’ misconduct because their behavior spills over into coworkers’ actions and amplifies through reflection effects. Yet our results also suggest that this contagion can be mitigated by managerial oversight. So long as there is sufficient monitoring of misconduct, workers will strategically limit such behavior in response to peers.},

  abstract     = {Problem description : A recent trend in personnel operations is to reduce hierarchy and allow employee teams to self-manage tasks, responsibilities, and rewards. Yet, we know little about how this arrangement relates to worker productivity and fairness. Academic/practical relevance : We provide the first firm-based evidence that when service teams are allowed to allocate compensation internally, the ensuing peer-bargaining process can generate inequitable outcomes for women. Methodology : We demonstrate this using fixed-effect models to identify productivity and peer-bargaining traits in 932 workers at 32 large Chinese beauty salons. We measure individual productivity through service and prepaid card sales and measure bargaining through the division of team-based commissions. We also build a parsimonious bargaining model to explain our empirical results. Results : Although productivity and bargaining outcomes are positively correlated, female workers consistently receive bargaining outcomes below their productivity level, whereas men are consistently overcompensated. Importantly, we provide evidence that our results can only be explained by a combination of higher prosociality and lower bargaining power in women. We also demonstrate that the resulting inequity is positively correlated with shorter tenure. Managerial implications : Our findings provide unique organizational evidence on how bargaining among peers relates to productivity in service operations. We show that the discriminatory social dynamics observed throughout society are evident in operational designs that delegate decision rights to teams and that the magnitude in these systems is at least as large as that observed in traditional hierarchical pay systems. Managers must anticipate and mitigate this gender-based inequity because it is in and of itself an operational performance issue, and because of the myriad of productivity, retention, and ethical implications that can result from peer-based bargaining.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In service operations settings where the difficulty of jobs is unpredictable, workers can encounter critical incidents (CIs)—jobs that are sufficiently disturbing to challenge workers’ coping mechanisms. We examine the impact of encountering CIs on subsequent operational performance of workers. Academic/practical relevance : Prior work has examined the effects of CIs on the long-term psychological health of workers. We demonstrate that encountering CIs has a practically meaningful impact on operational performance. We also examine the time-dependency and process-dependency of the effect and analyze whether it is mitigated by individual characteristics such as age or experience. Methodology : We use data on 902,002 ambulance activations conducted by paramedics at the London Ambulance Service (LAS). We define CIs as incidents where patients have a high probability of dying at the scene and examine the impact of such events on the paramedics’ performance for the remainder of their shifts. Our outcomes are the completion time of the ambulance activation and each of its five subprocesses. The exogenous assignment of CIs to paramedic crews allows a clean identification of our effect using a shift-level difference-in-differences specification. Results : Crews who have encountered one prior CI (two prior CIs) spend on average 2.6% (7.5%) more time completing each remaining ambulance activation in the shift. The impact is strongest for the jobs immediately following a CI but persists throughout the shift. The largest effects come from the subprocesses that are least standardized and where paramedics cannot rely on standard operating procedures. The duration effect is larger for teams of older paramedics but is simultaneously mitigated by experience. Managerial implications : Our results show that CIs increase subsequent job duration and that more than one CIs have a compounding, negative effect on operational performance. As a result, managers in settings where performance consistency is key would be advised not to assign new jobs to teams with recent CI experiences.},

We investigate if adding female directors to a firm’s board of directors changes whether and how quickly the firm recalls defective products. Academic/practical relevance : By demonstrating a relationship between an increase in female directors and more rule-conscious, customer-focused recall decisions, we highlight that adding female directors may enable more societally beneficial operational decisions. Methodology : We analyze 4,271 medical product recalls from 2002 to 2013 across 92 publicly traded firms regulated by the Food and Drug Administration using negative binomial and ordinary least squares fixed effect regression models. In robustness checks, we include an instrumental variable analysis, propensity score matching models, and reverse causality regression models. Results : As boards add female directors, recall decisions change. Firms initiate more medical product recalls that are low in severity and hence easier for firms to avoid initiating, highlighting the increased rule-following brought to bear by adding female directors. Firms also make faster recall decisions for the most serious defects that are high in severity and dangerous for customers, highlighting the increased stakeholder responsiveness resulting from adding female directors. Managerial implications : Firms may more closely align recall decisions with regulatory rules and become more sensitized to customer health and safety by adding female directors. Further, at least two female directors may be required to speed up recall decisions for the most serious, life-threatening defects.},

Although it is plausible that increasing an SA’s product knowledge will increase sales, training is not without cost and turnover is high in retail, so most retailers provide little product-knowledge training. Methodology : We partner with two firms and collect data on more than 50,000 SAs who had access to training.

Results : For SAs who engaged in training, the sales rate increases by 1.8% for every online module taken, which is a much higher benefit than the direct or indirect costs associated with this training. Brand-specific training has a larger effect on the focal brand; however, there is a positive effect on other brands the SA sells. We also assess how the training benefit varies depending on the SA’s tenure, sales rate prior to training, and number of modules taken. Managerial implications : We present evidence of a novel training mechanism that can be extremely attractive to retailers. Online training tools, such as the one we study, have two characteristics that should not be overlooked. First, it is the brands, not the retailers, that create, develop, and pay for the training content. Second, the incentives are such that SAs invest their own time, rather than time on the job, to train, and this makes the retailer’s investment in the training a profitable proposition.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Research in operations management has focused mainly on system-level load, ignoring the fact that service agents and customers express a variety of emotions that may impact service processes and outcomes. We introduce the concept of emotional load —the emotional demands that customer behaviors impose on service agents—to analyze how customer emotions affect service worker’s behavior. Academic/practical relevance : Most theories in organizational behavior literature predict that emotions expressed by customers reduce agent’s cognitive abilities and therefore, should reduce the agent’s speed (e.g., by increasing the service time required to serve an angry customer). We aim to shed light on the magnitude of that phenomenon while addressing important econometric challenges. We also investigate an important mechanism that drives this relation, namely agent effort. We discuss practical opportunities that arise from measuring emotional load and how it can be used to enhance productivity. Methodology : We measure the emotional load of agents using sentiment analysis tools that quantify positive/negative customer emotion expressions in an online chat-type contact center and link it to agent behavior: response time (RT) and the length and number of messages required to complete a service request. Identifying a causal effect of customer emotion on agent behavior using observational data is challenging because there are confounding factors associated with the complexity of service requests, which are related to both customer emotions and agent behavior. Our identification strategy uses panel data and exploits the variation across messages within a focal request using fixed effects to control for unobserved factors associated with case complexity. Instrumental variables are also used to address issues of measurement error and other endogeneity problems; the instruments are based on exogenous shocks to agent performance indicators that have been studied in the service operations literature. Results : Analyses show that emotional load created by negative customer emotions increases agent RT, the length of the agent messages (a measure of effort), and the required number of messages needed to complete a service request. Emotional load and agent RT reciprocally affect each other, with long agent RTs and a high number of messages producing more negative customer emotion. Managerial implications : We suggest that the emotional content in customer communications should be an important factor to consider when assigning workload to agents in a service system. Our study provides a rigorous methodology to measure the emotional content from customer text messages and objectively evaluate its associated workload. We discuss how this can be used to improve staffing decisions and dynamic workload routing through real-time monitoring of emotional load.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Mobile and internet-of-things (IoT) devices increasingly enable tracking of user behavior, and they often provide real-time or immediate feedback to consumers in an effort to improve their conduct. Growing adoption of such technologies leads to an important question: “Does reviewing immediate feedback improve user behavior?” We study immediate (close to real-time) feedback in the context of automotive telematics, which has been recognized as the most disruptive technology in the automotive insurance industry. Academic/practical relevance : Numerous automotive telematics providers claim unsubstantiated benefits from immediate feedback, while we still barely understand the implications of such feedback on user behavior. Given the high adoption of these technologies in automotive applications, it is important to study the effect of such feedback on behavior. This understanding is important, given that other attempts to make driving safer have led to unintended consequences in the past. Methodology : Using proprietary data on driving behavior, as measured by several parameters, such as harsh braking, speeding, and steep acceleration, we investigate the impact of the driver’s decision to review immediate feedback on driving behavior. We use instrumental variable regression to estimate the effect. Results : Contrary to the claims from multiple telematics providers, we find that, on average, users’ driving performance after they review detailed feedback is nearly 14.9% worse than that of users who do not review their detailed feedback. This impairment in performance translates to 6.9%, or a one-year reduction in interaccident time. Strong negative feedback (e.g., a sharp deterioration in performance) exerts a positive effect on short-term performance, but this only happens for very large drops in performance (3% of cases). Furthermore, we demonstrate that drivers just below the insurance-incentive thresholds exert greater effort following immediate feedback. Managerial implications : Our results provide a key message to firms employing immediate feedback—specifically, that such technology can yield unintended consequences. Furthermore, we show that drivers should receive only strong negative (but not positive) feedback to improve their performance. Finally, our results suggest that insurance incentives should be continuous rather than a step function.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the impact of service facility layout on how service workers organize their tasks. We focus on the hospital emergency department (ED) as a service setting in which nurses (servers) have discretion over how they interact with patients (customers) in a facility that introduces significant heterogeneity in necessary walking distance. Academic/practical relevance : Prior studies on facility layout in operations have largely focused on the direct effect of transit times on reduced productivity. We extend this work to show how skilled service workers such as nurses adapt their work behavior to enhance their productivity in response to facility layout constraints. Methodology : To study this empirically, we utilize a unique data set consisting of infrared nurse location tracking data, patient electronic medical record data, bedside patient call data, and the architectural floor plan of a large academic ED. Results : Nurses working in a busy ED appear to reduce their walking distance by batching their tasks to distant patient rooms. Although the patients in these rooms receive the same amount of care time, this behavior results in longer wait times between nurse visits and more nurse call button activations, but it does not compromise the overall quality of care delivered. Nurse call button use is linked with poor patient satisfaction and interrupts nurse workflow. Managerial implications : These findings show that even in services, facility layout can lead to servers using task timing discretion in ways that help the server but lead to a additional waiting time for the customer. We propose countering the negative effects of distance-based task batching through proactive nurse rounding and operational transparency.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In the modern workplace, it is increasingly common for workers to concurrently attend to tasks across multiple physical locations. However, frequent site switching can lead to increased setup and overhead costs. Specifically, workers expend significant time and cognitive effort getting reoriented with personnel, operating processes, tools, and resources whenever they switch sites. In this paper, we look at the productivity and quality implications of multisite work. Academic/practical relevance : Although multisite workplace deployment is increasingly common, its impact on people operations has not been examined in the operations management literature. We contribute to the literature by studying the effect of multisiting on individual worker productivity and quality of output. Methodology : To estimate the effect of multisite operations on performance, we turn to a setting where multisite worker assignment is common—that of physicians who have admitting privileges at multiple hospitals. We collected detailed data on individual physicians practicing in 83 hospitals between 1999 and 2010. Our extensive data set includes detailed operational and clinical factors associated with more than 950,000 patient encounters. Our empirical analysis takes the form of a panel, where we follow a given physician over time and link short-term multisiting to patient-level outcomes. Results : We find that multisiting negatively impacts productivity. Specifically, for each additional site at which a physician works, we observe a 2% increase in patient length of stay. For each site served, the likelihood of a patient developing a complication increases by 3%. Greater travel distance between sites and lack of focus at a given site explain the performance declines due to multisiting. In addition, we find that the performance declines resulting from multisite operation are reduced among low-complexity patients and among highly experienced physicians. Managerial implications : Multisite performance losses need to be traded off against the potential benefits. The negative effects of multisiting can be mitigated by limiting multisite deployment to simpler tasks and among highly experienced physicians. Managers can decrease switching costs of multisite work by standardizing workflows, processes, and tools across sites. In addition, the practice of multisite work can be limited to sites that are physically proximate to avoid the overhead costs associated with excessive travel.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : As trust in government reaches historic lows, frustration with government performance approaches record highs. Academic/practical relevance : We propose that in coproductive settings such as government services, people’s trust and engagement levels can be enhanced by designing service interactions to allow them to see the often-hidden work—via increasing operational transparency—being performed in response to their engagement. Methodology and results : Three studies, conducted in the field and laboratory, show that surfacing the submerged state through operational transparency impacts citizens’ attitudes and behavior. Study 1 leveraged proprietary data from a mobile phone application developed by the City of Boston, Massachusetts, through which residents submit service requests; the city’s goal was to increase engagement with the app. Users who received photographs of government addressing their service requests submitted 60% more requests and in 38% more categories over the ensuing 13 months than users who did not receive photographs. These significant increases in engagement persisted for 11 months following users’ initial exposure to operational transparency and were highest for users who had experienced government to be at least moderately responsive to their requests in the past. In study 2, residents of Boston who interacted with a website that visualized both service requests (e.g., potholes and broken street lamps) and efforts by the city’s government to address those requests became 14% more trusting and 12% more supportive of government. Moreover, residents who received additional transparency into the growing backlog of service requests that government was failing to fulfill, revealing government to be less responsive, were no more nor less trusting and supportive of government than residents who received no transparency. Study 3 replicated findings from the first two studies and documented underlying mechanisms: operational transparency increases trust and engagement by two causal pathways—through consumers’ increased perceptions of effort by the government and through increased perceptions that engaging with it is impactful. Responsiveness increases feelings of personal efficacy, which boosts willingness to engage both directly and indirectly through the other causal paths. Managerial implications : Taken together, our results suggest that showing more work performed by government—via operational transparency—encourages people to do more work themselves. These results have implications for the design of a broad array of coproductive services where operations are hidden and consumer trust and engagement are critical.},

Methodology : We study supplier diversification through a behavioral lens and test theoretically derived predictions under controlled laboratory conditions. Results : Our data provide strong evidence for under-diversification . We posit that this pattern is partly because of the fact that investing in supplier diversification involves an upfront cost to achieve a delayed, and rarely encountered, benefit. Managerial implications : Under-diversification bias is costly, and its causes are difficult to overcome, presenting firms with the daunting task of devising debiasing mechanisms that reinforce a supplier diversification strategy when the rarity of disruptions almost always render supplier consolidation the ex post preferred strategy.},

This motivates our study of how intermediaries should bid on behalf of their customers in the mechanism of an upstream intermediary and how the structure of the intermediation network affects the profits of its participants. Methodology : We provide a game-theoretic model to study the mechanisms offered by the ad exchange and intermediaries within a practically relevant class of mechanisms. Results : We characterize a subgame perfect equilibrium of the game among the intermediaries and the seller, and show that the equilibrium mechanisms have a simple and appealing structure: intermediaries bid the virtual value associated with the maximum downstream report in the upstream intermediary’s mechanism, whenever this quantity is positive. Managerial implications : We show that economic incentives are not necessarily aligned along the network and that the position in the intermediation network has a significant impact on the profits of the intermediaries. That is, when advertisers’ value distribution has a “light tail,” upstream intermediaries profit more (relative to downstream ones). Moreover, as the tail of the advertisers’ value distribution gets heavier, downstream intermediaries profit more, and their profits eventually exceed those of upstream ones. In addition, we show that a horizontal merger may not be profitable for intermediaries, and we analyze the impact of market size on the profits of intermediaries.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We have witnessed a rapid rise of on-demand platforms, such as Uber, in the past few years. Although these platforms allow workers to choose their own working hours, they have limited leverage in maintaining availability of workers within a region. As such, platforms often implement various policies, including offering financial incentives and/or communicating customer demand to workers in order to direct more workers to regions with shortage in supply. This research examines how behavioral biases such as regret aversion may influence workers’ relocation decisions and ultimately the system performance. Academic/practical relevance : Studies on on-demand platforms often assume that workers are rational agents who make optimal decisions. Our research investigates workers’ relocation decisions from a behavioral perspective. A deeper understanding of workers’ behavioral biases and their causes will help on-demand platforms design appropriate policies to increase their own profit, worker surplus, and the overall efficiency of matching supply with demand. Methodology : We use a combination of behavioral modeling and controlled laboratory experiments. We develop analytical models that incorporate regret aversion to produce theoretical predictions, which are then tested and verified via a series of controlled laboratory experiments. Results : We find that regret aversion plays an important role in workers’ relocation decisions. Regret-averse workers are more willing to relocate to the supply-shortage zone than rational workers. This increased relocation behavior, however, is not sufficient to translate to a better system performance. Platform interventions, such as demand information sharing and dynamic wage bonus, can help further improve the system. We find that workers’ regret-aversion behavior may lead to an increased profit for the platform, a higher surplus for the workers, and an improved demand-supply matching efficiency, thus benefiting the entire on-demand system. Managerial implications : Our research emphasizes the importance and necessity of incorporating workers’ behavioral biases such as regret aversion into the policy design of on-demand platforms. Policies without considering the behavioral aspect of workers’ decision may lead to lost profit for the platform and reduced welfare for workers and customers, which may ultimately hurt the on-demand business.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Crowdfunding, a relatively new approach for raising capital for early-stage ventures, has grown by leaps and bounds in the past few years. Entrepreneurs launch a campaign on a web platform and solicit contributions from many potential backers. A primary way that entrepreneurs affect fundraising is by leveraging their social networks to drive traffic to their campaign. We address the following question: When should an entrepreneur send out referral links to impel traffic to the campaign web page? Academic/practical relevance : Prior capital accumulation serves as social proof of the project’s “quality,” which can result in herding. However, prior capital accumulation can also lead to crowding out and bystander effects. Entrepreneurs’ social networks strongly affect their chances of success, but they often do not know when to solicit contacts’ involvement. We investigate this question via a combination of empirical and analytical methods, providing guidance for platform owners and entrepreneurs. Methodology : The social proof/herding mechanism leads to a convex-shaped effect of current accumulation on future contributions, the crowding out scenario leads to a concave-shaped effect, and the initial dominance of herding giving way to the later dominance of crowding out leads to a sigmoidal effect (S-shaped curve). We use a Markov decision process model to derive three alternative optimal referral policies, which we fit to proprietary data from a large crowdfunding platform. We explore heterogeneity in relative model fit across different subsamples of our data, demonstrating that our conclusion is stable over a range of scenarios. Results : Using mathematical models, we identify optimal referral strategies under the concave, convex, and S-curve assumptions. Estimating these models on the proprietary data, we show that the S-curve model exhibits the best fit. Based on estimated model parameters, our simulations show that a nonoptimal (e.g., myopic) expenditure of referrals can lead to a substantially smaller accumulation of funds. Managerial implications : The results of this paper help inform both platform owners and entrepreneurs. Platform owners can perform this sort of analysis to provide guidance to entrepreneurs about referral strategy. The entrepreneurs, in turn, learn that in an environment similar to that represented in our data, they will benefit from concentrating their referrals earlier in the fundraising process, while retaining some portion for the final stages of fundraising. The mix of this early versus late referral allocation within the campaign duration may vary depending on the entrepreneurs’ social capital and referral cost.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study the contest duration and the award scheme of an innovation contest where an organizer elicits solutions to an innovation-related problem from a group of agents. Academic/practical relevance : Our interviews with practitioners at crowdsourcing platforms have revealed that the duration of a contest is an important operational decision. Yet, the theoretical literature has long overlooked this decision. Also, the literature fails to adequately explain why giving multiple unequal awards is so common in crowdsourcing platforms. We aim to fill these gaps between the theory and practice. We generate insights that seem consistent with both practice and empirical evidence. Methodology : We use a game-theoretic model where the organizer decides on the contest duration and the award scheme while each agent decides on her participation and determines her effort over the contest duration by considering potential changes in her productivity over time. The quality of an agent’s solution improves with her effort, but it is also subject to an output uncertainty. Results : We show that the optimal contest duration increases as the relative impact of the agent uncertainty on her output increases, and it decreases if the agent productivity increases over time. We characterize an optimal award scheme and show that giving multiple (almost always) unequal awards is optimal when the organizer’s urgency in obtaining solutions is below a certain threshold. We also show that this threshold is larger when the agent productivity increases over time. Finally, consistent with empirical findings, we show that there is a positive correlation between the optimal contest duration and the optimal total award. Managerial implications : Our results suggest that the optimal contest duration increases with the novelty or sophistication of solutions that the organizer seeks, and it decreases when the organizer can offer support tools that can increase the agent productivity over time. These insights and their drivers seem consistent with practice. Our findings also suggest that giving multiple unequal awards is advisable for an organizer who has low urgency in obtaining solutions. Finally, giving multiple awards goes hand in hand with offering support tools that increase the agent productivity over time. These results help explain why many contests on crowdsourcing platforms give multiple unequal awards.},

We aim to fill this gap by offering an empirically validated model to generate insights for the provision of information at contest launch. Methodology : We develop a game-theoretic model featuring different types of information (categorized as “conceptual objectives” or “execution guidelines”) in problem specifications and assess their impact on design processes and submission qualities. Real-world data are used to empirically test hypotheses and policy recommendations generated from the model, and a quasi-natural experiment provides further empirical validation. Results : We show theoretically and verify empirically that with more conceptual objectives disclosed in the problem specification, the number of participants in a contest eventually decreases; with more execution guidelines in the problem specification, the trial effort provision by each participant increases; and the best solution quality always increases with more execution guidelines but eventually decreases with more conceptual objectives. Managerial implications : To maximize the best solution quality in crowdsourced design problems, seekers should always provide more execution guidelines and only a moderate number of conceptual objectives.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Participants in matching markets face search and screening costs when seeking a match. We study how platform design can reduce the effort required to find a suitable partner. Practical/academic relevance : The success of matching platforms requires designs that minimize search effort and facilitate efficient market clearing. Methodology : We study a game-theoretic model in which “applicants” and “employers” pay costs to search and screen. An important feature of our model is that both sides may waste effort: Some applications are never screened, and employers screen applicants who may have already matched. We prove existence and uniqueness of equilibrium and characterize welfare for participants on both sides of the market. Results : We identify that the market operates in one of two regimes: It is either screening - limited or application - limited . In screening-limited markets, employer welfare is low, and some employers choose not to participate. This occurs when application costs are low and there are enough employers that most applicants match, implying that many screened applicants are unavailable. In application-limited markets, applicants face a “tragedy of the commons” and send many applications that are never read. The resulting inefficiency is worst when there is a shortage of employers. We show that simple interventions—such as limiting the number of applications that an individual can send, making it more costly to apply, or setting an appropriate market-wide wage—can significantly improve the welfare of agents on one or both sides of the market. Managerial implications : Our results suggest that platforms cannot focus exclusively on attracting participants and making it easy to contact potential match partners. A good user experience requires that participants not waste effort considering possibilities that are unlikely to be available. The operational interventions we study alleviate congestion by ensuring that potential match partners are likely to be available.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper studies the information-sharing strategy for a retail platform on which multiple competing sellers distribute their products. Academic/practical relevance : Because of the rapid growth of retail platforms in recent years, information sharing has become an increasingly important issue because retail platforms can gather an enormous amount of consumer information that may not be visible to the sellers. Understanding how to share such information with those sellers will provide useful implications from both the theoretical and practical perspectives. Methodology : We develop a game-theoretic model where multiple sellers engage in Cournot competition on a retail platform by selling substitutable products, and the platform charges a commission fee for each transaction. The platform owns superior demand information and can control the accuracy level when sharing the information with the sellers. Results : We find that the platform has incentives to share the information, and such sharing is beneficial both to the platform and to all sellers. Under the asymmetric information-sharing format, the optimal strategy for the platform is to select a subgroup of sellers and truthfully share information with them. Under the symmetric sharing format, the platform must use the same accuracy level and the same set of information for all sellers, and thus has incentives to reduce the accuracy of the shared information. Moreover, we identify a simple pricing mechanism that can achieve the optimal information-sharing outcome. Managerial implications : This research highlights the importance of considering the impact of information sharing for a retail platform with competing sellers. It also proposes a simple, single-price mechanism to implement the optimal sharing strategy. These results could provide useful guidelines for platform managers to better design their information-sharing services.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Platforms critically rely on rating systems to learn the quality of market participants. In practice, however, ratings are often highly inflated and therefore, not very informative. In this paper, we first investigate whether the platform can obtain less inflated, more informative ratings by altering the meaning and relative importance of the levels in the rating system. Second, we seek a principled approach for the platform to make these choices in the design of the rating system. Academic/practical relevance : Platforms critically rely on rating systems to learn the quality of market participants, and so, ensuring these ratings are informative is of first-order importance. Methodology : We analyze the results of a randomized, controlled trial on an online labor market in which an additional question was added to the feedback form. Between treatment conditions, we vary the question phrasing and answer choices; in particular, the treatment conditions include several positive-skewed verbal rating scales with descriptive phrases or adjectives providing specific interpretation for each rating level. We then develop a model-based framework to compare and select among rating system designs and apply this framework to the data obtained from the online labor market test. Results : Our test reveals that current inflationary norms can be countered by reanchoring the meaning of the levels of the rating system. In particular, positive-skewed verbal rating scales yield substantially deflated rating distributions that are much more informative about seller quality. Further, we demonstrate that our model-based framework for scale design and optimization can identify the most informative rating system and substantially improve the quality of information obtained over baseline designs. Managerial implications : Our study illustrates that practical, informative rating systems can be designed and demonstrates how to compare and design them in a principled manner.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider a platform that charges commission rates and subscription fees to sellers and buyers for facilitating transactions but does not directly control the transaction prices, which are endogenously determined. Buyers and sellers are divided into types, and we represent the compatibility between different types using a bipartite network. Traders are heterogeneous in terms of their valuations, and different types have possibly different value distributions. Buyers may have additional value for trading with some seller types. The platform chooses commissions/subscriptions to maximize its revenues. Academic/practical relevance : Two salient features of most online platforms are that they do not dictate the transaction prices, and they use commissions/subscriptions for extracting revenues. We shed light on how these commissions/subscriptions should be set in networked markets. Methodology : Using tools from convex optimization and combinatorial optimization, we obtain tractable methods for computing the optimal commissions/subscriptions and provide insights into the platform’s revenues, buyer/seller surplus, and welfare. Results : We provide a tractable convex optimization formulation to obtain the revenue-maximizing commissions/subscriptions, and establish that, typically, different types should be charged different commissions/subscriptions depending on their network positions. We establish that the latter result holds even when the traders on each side have identical value distributions, and in this setting we provide lower and upper bounds on the platform’s revenues in terms of the supply-demand imbalance across the network. Motivated by simpler schemes used in practice, we show that the revenue loss can be unbounded when all traders on the same side are charged the same commissions/subscriptions, and bound the revenue loss in terms of the supply-demand imbalance across the network. Charging only buyers or only sellers leads to at least half of the optimal revenues, when different types on the same side can be charged differently.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Mobile communications technologies and online platforms have enabled large-scale consumer-to-consumer (C2C) sharing of their underutilized products. This paper studies a manufacturer’s optimal entry strategy in the product-sharing market and the economic implications of its entry. Academic/practical relevance : Sharing of products or services among consumers has experienced dramatic growth in recent years. The impact of C2C sharing on traditional firms can be very significant. In response to C2C product sharing, many manufacturers (e.g., General Motors and BMW) have entered the product-sharing market to provide business-to-consumer (B2C) rental services in addition to outright sales to consumers. Methodology : We employ a game-theoretic analytical model for our analysis. Results : Our analysis shows that when C2C sharing has a low transaction cost and the manufacturer’s marginal cost of production is not very high, the manufacturer will find it not optimal to offer its own rental services to consumers. In contrast, when the C2C sharing transaction cost is high or the manufacturer’s marginal cost of production is high, the manufacturer should offer enough units of the products for rental to squeeze out C2C sharing (in expectation). When the C2C-sharing transaction cost and the manufacturer’s marginal cost are both in the middle ranges, the manufacturer’s rental services and the C2C sharing will coexist, in which case the manufacturer’s entry in the sharing market may reduce the total number of units of the product in the whole market, but increase the consumer surplus and the social welfare. This reduced number of products due to the manufacturer’s B2C rental service also suggests less environmental impact from production. Managerial implications : The production cost and the C2C sharing transaction cost play critical roles in determining the manufacturer’s optimal quantity to use for its B2C rental services and the equilibrium outcome. In some situations, the manufacturer’s entry in the sharing market provides not only economic benefits to the firm and consumers, but also environmental benefits to the society as a whole.},

Not knowing the customer choice parameters a priori and subjecting to a display capacity constraint, we dynamically determine the subset of products for display and the selling prices to maximize the expected total revenue over a selling horizon. Academic/practical relevance : Assortment and pricing are important decisions for firms such as online retailers and have received enormous attention in the operations literature. In this paper, we present the first learning algorithm for the dynamic joint assortment optimization and pricing problem (based on the MNL choice model) when the firm has limited prior knowledge about customer demand. Methodology : We design a learning algorithm that balances the trade-off between demand learning and revenue extraction, and we evaluate the performance of the algorithm using Bayesian regret. This algorithm uses the method of random sampling to simultaneously learn the demand and maximize the revenue on the fly. Results : An instance-independent upper bound for the Bayesian regret of the algorithm is obtained, and numerical results show that it performs very well. Managerial implications : Our work is the first to develop an effective learning algorithm for the joint assortment and pricing optimization problem when customer demand information is not known a priori. The algorithm concurrently learns customer demand while making adaptive assortment and pricing decisions, and it is an effective approach for revenue maximization.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study how a new development in entrepreneurship—crowdfunding—interacts with more traditional financing sources such as venture capital investors (VCs) and bank financing. Academic/practical relevance : Although extant literature has mainly focused on predicting crowdfunding campaign outcomes and optimal campaign design, the broader questions of how crowdfunding affects entrepreneurs and how crowdfunding platforms fit in with traditional startup financing sources, such as banks and VCs, have received relatively little attention. Methodology : We model a bargaining game with a moral-hazard problem between an entrepreneur and a bank, and a double-sided moral-hazard problem between the entrepreneur and a VC with respect to their noncontractible efforts. Results : We decompose the economic value of crowdfunding into cash gains or losses, costs of bad investments avoided, and project-payoff probability update. This economic value is generally shared between entrepreneurs and investors, benefiting both. Moreover, crowdfunding can help to overcome the agency problems. However, crowdfunding can also harm the entrepreneur and the VC. Competition from other investors reduces value to VCs, who may walk away from the deal entirely. This can hurt entrepreneurs who lose out on valuable VC operational expertise (operational support, access to supplier networks, etc.). Managerial implications : The model provides a theoretical underpinning for recent empirical observations that some projects lose VC financing after successful crowdfunding campaigns. Our results complement earlier studies in operations management by demonstrating that the entrepreneurs’ objectives are more complex than simply maximizing the payoffs from crowdfunding campaigns.},

Academic/practical relevance : The problem involves complex planning and operational decisions, as well as multiple sources of uncertainties. The related optimization models impose significant computational challenges. The potential value of V2G integration may have far-reaching impacts on EV sharing and sustainability. Methodology : We formulate the problem as a two-stage stochastic integer linear program. In the first stage, we optimize decisions related to service planning, the capacity of parking and charging facilities, EV battery capacities, and EV allocation in each zone under uncertain time-dependent trip demand and electricity prices. In the second stage, for a realized demand–price scenario, we construct a time-and-charging-status expanded transportation network and optimize operations of the shared vehicle fleet, EV battery charging, and V2G selling. We develop Benders decomposition and scenario decomposition approaches to improve computational efficiency. A linear-decision-rule-based approximation approach is also provided to model dynamic operations. Results : Via testing instances based on real-world and synthetic data, we demonstrate the computational efficacy of our approaches and study the benefits of integrating V2G in EV sharing from the service provider, consumer, and socioenvironmental aspects. Managerial implications : V2G integration can significantly increase the profitability of EV sharing and the quality of service. It results in the preference of larger EV fleets and battery capacities, which further leads to various socioenvironmental benefits. The benefit of V2G can still prevail, even with more severe battery degradation and can be more significant when combined with (i) more stringent service levels, (ii) more traffic congestion, or (iii) urban spatial structures with concentrated business/residential areas. V2G integration (complemented by fast charging technology) can also benefit carshare users through improvement in the quality of service.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Many cities worldwide are embracing electric vehicle (EV) sharing as a flexible and sustainable means of urban transit. However, it remains challenging for the operators to charge the fleet because of limited or costly access to charging facilities. In this paper, we focus on answering the core question—how to charge the fleet to make EV sharing viable and profitable. Academic/practical relevance : Our work is motivated by the setback that struck San Diego, California, where car rental company car2go ceased its EV-sharing operations. We integrate charging infrastructure planning and vehicle repositioning operations that were often considered separately. More interestingly, our modeling emphasizes the operator-controlled charging operations and customers’ EV-picking behavior, which are both central to EV sharing but were largely overlooked. Methodology : Supported by the real data of car2go, we develop a queuing network model that characterizes how customers endogenously pick EVs based on energy levels and how the operator implements a charging-up-to policy. The integrated queuing-location model leads to a nonlinear optimization program. We then propose both lower and upper bound formulations as mixed-integer second-order cone programs, which are computationally tractable and result in a small optimality gap when the fleet size is adequate. Results : We learn lessons from the setback of car2go in San Diego. We find that the viability of EV sharing can be enhanced by concentrating limited charger resources at selected locations. Charging EVs either in a proactive fashion or at the 40% recharge threshold (rather than car2go’s policy of charging EVs only when their energy level drops below 20%) can boost the profit by more than 15%. Moreover, sufficient charger availability is crucial when collaborating with a public charger network. Increasing the charging power relieves the charger resource constraint, whereas extending per-charge range or adopting unmanned repositioning improves profitability. Finally, we discuss how EV sharing operations depend on the urban spatial structure, compared with conventional car sharing. Managerial implications : We demonstrate a data-verified and high-granularity modeling approach. Both the high-level planning guidelines and operational policies can be useful for practitioners. We also highlight the value of jointly managing demand fulfillment and EV charging.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This article explores the incentive issues and gaming behaviors of firms under risk-sharing partnerships in a project management setting motivated by real-life examples. Academic/practical relevance : Collaboration prevails in projects within diverse industries. The risk-sharing partnership, in which each partner pays for its own cost and shares the outcome (either reward or loss) on project completion, is one of the most popular ways to manage collaborations in practice. However, the risk-sharing partnership may lead to project failure in the forms of excessive delays and cost overruns, but the driving forces (for example, incentives) and mechanisms (for example, gaming behaviors) in project management settings are not yet fully understood. Methodology : Relative to the one-firm-does-all strategy, we studied how risk-sharing partnerships may affect firms’ incentives in project execution and thus, project metrics (duration and cost) for various project networks (serial versus parallel), risk levels (deterministic versus stochastic duration), and information status (symmetry versus asymmetry). Results : We found that risk-sharing partnerships may encourage deliberate delays and cost overruns through various mechanisms, such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma, the Supplier’s Dilemma, and the Coauthor’s Dilemma. Counterintuitively, information asymmetry may outperform information symmetry on project metrics for both deterministic and stochastic duration, contingent on the network structure, cost parameters, and partners’ beliefs. Managerial implications : By connecting theory to practice, we provide insights into the incentive issues of some real-life projects and justifications for several mitigation strategies to avoid such gaming behaviors in practice.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Agricultural innovation can help farmers improve their productivity; reduce their environmental impact; and address the challenges associated with ever-changing soil, weather, and market conditions. Promoting innovation often requires government support as a way to incentivize producers to experiment with (and then eventually adopt) cutting-edge practices. We investigate the effectiveness of a number of policy instruments (i.e., taxes and subsidies) in terms of their impact on the adoption of innovative production methods, producers’ profits, consumer surplus, and return on government expenditure. Academic/practical relevance : We contribute to the existing literature by investigating not only the policy maker’s role in encouraging innovation but also the role of consumer preferences and learning-by-doing benefits of new production methods. Methodology : Our setting features producers with access to traditional and innovative production methods and consumers that have a higher valuation for the output of the innovative method. We develop a model to analyze producers’ decisions of whether to experiment with a new production method when facing uncertainty about their production yield as well as the benefits associated with learning-by-doing. Results : Our findings indicate that using only taxes encourages experimentation with new production methods but decreases social welfare. Utilizing only subsidies outperforms policies that involve both taxes and subsidies in achieving higher social welfare but the converse is true in achieving a higher experimentation rate. We show that zero-expenditure policies result in a decline in social welfare unless producers face financial barriers when making the costly transition to new methods. Managerial implications : The insights we generate can help policy makers design policies to achieve specific objectives (e.g., target experimentation/adoption rates). We illustrate their applicability by conducting a numerical study using data on conventional and organic egg production in Denmark. The study generates concrete policy recommendations to achieve the organic production goal set by the Danish government.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : New technology enables firms to recognize customers from their purchase histories and then provide different quality levels of product features or services for repeat and new customers. Extant research has examined behavior-based price discrimination (BBP)—that is, how firms set different prices for repeat and new customers. This research extends the literature by investigating behavior-based quality discrimination to reveal the unique effects of quality discrimination beyond the effects of BBP. Academic/practical relevance : This research is relevant to the marketing-OM research/practice community because product feature or service provision is critical for firms. As technology advances, firms could offer product features or services with different quality levels and prices based on consumers’ purchase histories. Researchers need to understand whether, how, and why behavior-based quality discrimination differs from BBP. Managers need to know whether they should reward repeat or new customers with higher quality (product features or services) or lower prices. Methodology : We use a two-period dynamic game-theoretic model. In the first period, firms collect consumers’ purchase history data. In the second period, they use these data for quality and price discrimination. Results : We find that behavior-based quality discrimination is fundamentally different from BBP. BBP intensifies competition in the second period but softens competition in the first period. By contrast, we find that behavior-based quality discrimination reduces competition in the second period but intensifies competition in the first period. We show two new mechanisms: First, firms use quality discrimination to soften second-period price competition by making competitive poaching more costly. Second, quality discrimination increases repeat purchase and customer retention. Anticipating this effect, firms reduce prices in the first period to attract more customers. Managerial implications : We show that managers should reward new customers on the price dimension by offering them a discount and reward repeat customers on the quality dimension by providing them with higher-quality product features or services. Managers should also understand that customer retention will increase with quality discrimination. Therefore, they need to reduce first-period prices to acquire customers and build up their customer base.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Given the variety of urgency levels in highly utilized operating rooms, capacity allocation decisions can have a major impact on how wait times are rationed. We examine a longer-term sequential capacity planning problem in which a hospital allocates operating room time to different surgical specialties. We seek to minimize an urgency-weighted wait-time metric. Academic/practical relevance : Our data set on patient selection patterns revealed considerable noise in the queuing discipline. We apply an urn model to generate a probabilistic queuing discipline, which validates well against the selection patterns observed in practice. We believe that this model may prove to be useful for representing noisy queuing disciplines in other settings. Also, our validated simulation model, in combination with our proposed solution approach, demonstrates a substantial reduction in urgency-weighed wait times. Methodology : For representing the noisy queuing discipline, we fit a Wallenius noncentral hypergeometric distribution. We formulate the capacity allocation problem as a Markov decision process. The large state space and detailed system dynamics lead us to simulation-based dynamic programming approaches for finding good capacity allocation decisions. Rather than approximate the expected cost-to-go function, we propose a limited look-ahead policy and embed this in a rolling-horizon framework. Results : Our baseline model-based allocation policy yields a 14.3% reduction in urgency-weighed wait time compared with current practice. It also results in a 21.0% improvement in the number of patients treated within their urgency-based recommended wait-time limits. Managerial implications : In elective surgery settings, it may be important to ration capacity in a way that considers the different urgency levels of patients. We propose a flexible modeling approach for achieving this.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In this paper, we study a reliable hub location model, the objective of which is to minimize the associated costs plus the penalty for unserved demands. The model assigns to each origin–destination pair a primary path and a backup path to hedge against the risk of random disruptions. Aside from the fixed costs of locating hubs, the fixed costs incurred by hub-connecting arcs that exhibit economies of scale in transportation are considered. Academic/practical relevance : The widely adopted hub-and-spoke architecture in the network designs can trigger cascading effects during and in the aftermath of disruption events and lead to further losses. By incorporating a general specification of disruptions, our model helps firms improve network reliability while inheriting the benefits of routing via hubs. Therefore, this work extends the literature on hub location problems by considering reliability under disruptions. Methodology : We present a path-based model and formulate a combinatorial optimization problem. By exploiting the structural properties of the problem, we introduce a tractable mixed-integer linear program reformulation and develop a constraint generation method to accelerate the solution procedure. We further construct two effective heuristics. Results : We demonstrate the necessity of considering disruptions and the profound benefits of employing backup paths. Moreover, we show via numerical studies that the path-based model delivers efficient and effective reliable hub-and-spoke designs. Managerial implications : We find that establishing backup paths according to the proposed model barely escalates network costs yet significantly enhances service levels, and that exploiting disruption correlation helps reduce the expected total cost especially when the underlying disruption correlation is strong. We also discover that the decisions of our model on the locations of hubs and hub arcs are relatively robust compared with those on path assignments. We summarize key insights as observations that can be used directly as rules of thumb to guide designs in practice.},

How do operational levers under a manufacturer’s control affect return rates? Academic/practical relevance : Consumer returns raise major questions for manufacturers and retailers because losses related to returns are substantial. However, levers commonly used to discourage returns, such as strict return policies, can dampen sales, which is a significant drawback. The literature on consumer returns has focused on retailer and purchase attributes but has ignored whether manufacturers can take a proactive role to influence returns. Manufacturers and retailers have an interest in understanding how operational levers influence return rates. Methodology : This work attempts to answer questions about the influence of manufacturing on return rates by using detailed operational data from a leading U.S. manufacturer of automotive accessories. We study the impact of key operational levers on return rates by using a logistic regression model, while controlling for retailer return policies and numerous product, purchase, and consumer attributes. Results : We find that increased task-level worker specialization has a significant and U-shaped impact on return rates. Increased workload levels in production leads to a significant increase in return rates, whereas product personalization leads to lower return rates. Managerial implications : We provide an empirical estimate of the effect of operational variables on return rates that are useful in evaluating managerial trade-offs.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Buyers can encourage competition among multiple suppliers of goods or services by redistributing their shares of the business based on recent observable performances. This is usually needed because actual efforts or investments by suppliers are typically unobservable, a moral hazard issue. This poses the problem: How should such redistribution be linked to the suppliers’ recent performances to motivate the best supplier performance? Academic/practical relevance : Such performance-based allocations of business are a common practice in supply management when a buyer sources from multiple suppliers. But there is little research on the structural characteristics of the optimal allocation rule in the presence of moral hazard. Methodology : We apply principal-agent theory to model the buyer’s incentive design problem. We analytically derive the optimal allocation rule and conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of several simple heuristics against the optimal rule. Results : Our key result is that the buyer should divide the purchase among suppliers based on their relative performance deviations from the targets set by the buyer. A ratio rule is used for positive deviations, whereas a winner-take-all may be applied when some suppliers underperform. Our result generalizes to a range of environments with different cost structures, distributions of performance outcomes, correlated performance, etc. When the optimal rule is used to benchmark several more practical heuristics, the only really poorly performing heuristic is one that does not use the relative performance deviations. Managerial implications : Buyers’ allocations should reflect suppliers’ relative performance deviations from the desired targets, not absolute performances. Performance deviations can be weighted in some way, but this is a second-order gain. A ratio rule is needed to reward good performance, whereas a winner-take-all rule with more extreme allocations is used for penalizing poor performance.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Merchant commodity and energy production assets operate in markets with volatile prices and exchange rates. Plant closures adversely affect societal entities beyond the specific plant being shut down, such as the parent company and the local community. Motivated by an aluminum producer, we study if mitigating these hard-to-assess broader impacts of a shutdown is financially viable using the plant’s operating flexibility. Academic/practical relevance : Our social commerce perspective toward managing shutdown decisions deviates from the commonly used asset value maximization objective in merchant operations. Identifying operating policies that delay or decrease the likelihood of a shutdown without incurring a significant asset value loss supports socially responsible plant shutdown decisions. Methodology : We formulate a constrained Markov decision process to manage shutdown decisions and limit the probability of future plant closures. We provide theoretical support for approximating this intractable model using unconstrained stochastic dynamic programs with modified shutdown costs and explore two classes of operating policies. Our first policy leverages anticipated regret theory, and the second policy generalizes, using machine learning, production-margin heuristics used in practice. We compute the former and latter policies using a least squares Monte Carlo method and combining this method with binary classification, respectively. Results : Anticipated-regret policies possess desirable asymptotic properties absent in classification-based policies. On instances created using real data, anticipated-regret and classification-based policies outperform practice-based production-margin strategies. Significant reductions in shutdown probability and delays in plant closures are possible while incurring small asset value losses. Managerial implications : A plant’s operating flexibility provides an effective lever to balance the social objective to reduce closures and the financial goal to maximize asset value. Adhering to both objectives requires combining short-term commitments with external stakeholders to avoid shutdown with longer-term internal efforts to reduce the probability of plant closures.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In a supply network consisting of a buyer, a purchasing agent, and a supplier, the buyer can procure the component from the supplier directly and rely on the purchasing agent for complementary services (named direct sourcing ( DS )) or authorize the purchasing agent to conduct both procurement and complementary services (named agent sourcing ( AS )). When parties bargain pairwisely, how do their bargaining powers influence the equilibrium procurement outsourcing structure? Academic/practical relevance : Both outsourcing structures, DS and AS are commonly observed in practice, whereas the literature has rarely answered the questions that we ask. Methodology : We adopt the generalized Nash bargaining framework to model the negotiations among the parties and derive the corresponding equilibrium outcomes under both outsourcing structures by taking into consideration the existence of a component spot market. Results : When two parties negotiate directly, we define their direct negotiation coefficient as the ratio of their exogenous bilateral relative bargaining powers. If they negotiate indirectly through a third party, we define their indirect negotiation coefficient as the quotient of their respective direct negotiation coefficients with respect to the third party. We show that when parties negotiate over both wholesale prices and quantities, the buyer’s preference for DS and AS solely depends on the comparison result of the buyer’s direct negotiation coefficient versus the indirect one with respect to the supplier. When the quantity is determined by the buyer and parties negotiate over wholesale prices, the equilibrium outsourcing structure hinges critically upon the magnitude of the purchasing agent’s relative bargaining power over the supplier. Interestingly, the preferences of the three parties for DS and AS may be aligned with each other. We also show that it is in the best interest of the buyer to negotiate prices only. Managerial implications : Our research identifies the endogenous bargaining powers among parties that dictate the equilibrium outsourcing structure. It indicates that the buyer needs to adjust procurement outsourcing decisions accordingly when the bargaining powers of the buyer’s upstream partners are altered, especially when the buyer’s bargaining power is sufficiently large: we analytically show that the buyer’s preference is very sensitive to the relative bargaining powers of the purchasing agent and the supplier. This might help explain why Walmart switched from AS with Li &amp; Fung to DS within just three years.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In this paper, we identify the unique challenges and trade-offs in hydro system development for developing countries and provide a supply chain perspective to expand these countries’ hydro networks for energy, irrigation, and flood control. Academic/practical relevance : The interconnected issues of water, energy, food, and flood are among the most formidable challenges faced by developing countries worldwide. The development of hydro systems has the potential to address all these issues simultaneously and thus has been prioritized in the international community to reduce poverty and promote sustainable economic development. Methodology : We develop a new integrated and dynamic modeling framework to capture the conflicts of these issues, explore the synergy among different sectors, and maximize overall benefits. The framework integrates hydro plant location and distribution decisions for both power and water; it endogenizes the budget and thus captures the dynamic interaction between water resource development and economic growth. Results : We derive analytical results in stylized models to develop general insights on the key driving forces and build a decision support model to solve large-scale problems in practice. By applying the model to the case of Pakistan, we provide solutions that outperform common practices in all aspects of energy, irrigation, and flood control. Managerial implications : Our results, both analytical and numerical, provide robust insights into the optimal development strategies on the location, sequence, and mix of hydro projects for developing countries.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a fundamental online resource allocation problem in service operations in which a heterogeneous stream of arrivals that varies in service times and rewards makes service requests from a finite number of servers/providers. This is an online adversarial setting in which nothing more is known about the arrival process of customers. Each server has a finite regular capacity but can be expanded at the expense of overtime cost. Upon arrival of each customer, the system chooses both a server and a time for service over a scheduling horizon subject to capacity constraints. The system seeks easy-to-implement online policies that admit a competitive ratio (CR), guaranteeing the worst-case relative performance. Academic/practical relevance : On the academic side, we propose online algorithms with theoretical CRs for the problem described above. On the practical side, we investigate the real-world applicability of our methods and models on appointment-scheduling data from a partner health system. Methodology : We develop new online primal-dual approaches for making not only a server-date allocation decision for each arriving customer, but also an overtime decision for each server on each day within a horizon. We also derive a competitive analysis to prove a theoretical performance guarantee. Results : Our online policies are (i) robust to future information, (ii) easy-to-implement and extremely efficient to compute, and (iii) admitting a theoretical CR. Comparing our online policy with the optimal offline policy, we obtain a CR that guarantees the worst-case performance of our online policy. Managerial implications : We evaluate the performance of our online algorithms by using real appointment scheduling data from a partner health system. Our results show that the proposed online policies perform much better than their theoretical CR, and outperform the pervasive First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) and nested threshold policies (NTPO) by a large margin.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : To alleviate farmer poverty, governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are developing different mechanisms for disseminating market information to farmers in developing countries. This paper examines whether a wider dissemination of information will always benefit farmers. Academic/practical relevance : The characterization of the farmers’ equilibrium production decisions and the implications of information provision provide practical guidance for governments and NGOs when developing agricultural information services. Methodology : We develop an “asymmetric” two-stage game to analyze a base model in which n ≥ 4 heterogeneous farmers need to determine their production quantities when the underlying market condition is uncertain. Our base model relies on four key modeling assumptions: (1) farmers engage in Cournot (quantity) competition, (2) the social planner cares about farmers’ total income, (3) yields are deterministic, and (4) information service is publicly funded so that information access is free. We further examine alternative market environments by relaxing or changing these modeling assumptions separately. Results : Through the analysis of our base model, we find that providing information to only one farmer is optimal but providing information to all n farmers can be detrimental. In alternative market environments, we obtain the following results. First, when the information service is self-financed, we find that the “exclusivity” result no longer holds when farmers are heterogeneous (even though it holds for the case when farmers are homogeneous). Second, when yield rates are uncertain, we find it is optimal to disseminate to more farmers when the yield rates become more uncertain (in terms of coefficient of variation). Third, when the central planner only cares about creating economic value for those farmers with information access, it is optimal for the social planner to disseminate information to more farmers. Fourth, when farmers engage in Bertrand (price) competition, it is optimal to disseminate information to all n farmers. Managerial implications : By combining different results obtained under different market environments, we conclude that the optimal information provision policy depends on the competition type (Cournot or Bertrand competition), yield uncertainty, source of funding, and the social planner’s ultimate goal.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This study extends the literature on consumer returns by assessing the impact of return period policy change on a multichannel retailer performance. Academic/practical relevance : Many retailers have recently sought to tighten their return policy by decreasing the return period window. We investigate the impact of such a policy change on sales, returns, and profitability for a multichannel retailer. Methodology : We conduct a multimethodology research in which we (1) develop theoretical predictions using an analytical model, (2) empirically test analytical predictions using data from a jewelry retailer that changed its return policy from 100 days to 60 days, and (3) extend the empirical analysis to estimate the impact of the policy change on profitability. Results : We find that the return period policy change does not have any statistically significant effect on sales and return rates for online stores, whereas it decreases sales by 8%, return rate by 2.7 percentage points, and profit by 7.3% per brick-and-mortar store, corresponding to a 2.7% decrease in annual sales for the retailer. The two likely explanations for the insignificant effect for online stores are (1) the low proportion of online customers affected by the policy change and (2) the return displacement effect—in response to the policy change, some affected customers likely accelerate their product evaluation to return within the restrictive policy period. Our analysis also demonstrates that a return period policy change may increase retail profitability if a majority of retail stores operates under high sales volume and high return rates. Managerial implications : Our study suggests that managers of multichannel retailers that consider a change in their return period policies should carefully assess their operational structures and evaluate consumer return behavior at each channel, particularly over the time window between the proposed policy period and the existing policy period.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The recent surge in demand for cloud services has posed a significant capacity-expansion problem for cloud infrastructure providers. Although the growth of demand for capacity attributes—for example, CPU and RAM—is disproportionate, these attributes are often provided in preconfigured packages (cluster-types), and the fixed ratio of attributes in a package does not match with the time-varying ratio of demand. We analyze a class of expansion policies to determine the timing and magnitude of expansions, using preconfigured cluster-types, and we examine the optimal configurations of the cluster-types. Academic/practical relevance : Cloud computing is a major technological advance that is influencing businesses significantly, giving rise to an emerging industry but also posing the above-noted capacity-expansion problem. To our knowledge, this is a new issue that has not been studied in the literature. Methodology : We consider growing demand for two attributes and analyze a class of policies that consist of capacity expansion cycles (CECs), whereby capacities are added through sequential or simultaneous replenishments of two configured cluster-types. Results : We first derive the optimal timing and magnitude of expansions for every CEC, and then we devise two algorithms, the dynamic-programming-based (DP) algorithm and the forward-looking (FL) heuristic, to determine the optimal cycle lengths. We also propose a cluster-selection heuristic for choosing the optimal configurations of the cluster-types. Managerial implications : The FL-heuristic is effective, easy to communicate, and can be used as an excellent starting point for the search of the DP-algorithm. Moreover, because there is a desire in practice to reduce the variety of cluster-types, we find conditions under which the employment of only two cluster-types is as efficient as the employment of many cluster-types. Finally, we provide useful guidelines for the optimal configurations of these two cluster-types.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : In 1992, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) instituted the accelerated approval pathway (AP) to allow promising drugs to enter the market based on limited evidence of efficacy, thereby permitting manufacturers to verify true clinical benefits through postmarket studies. However, most postmarket studies have not been completed as promised. We address this noncompliance problem. Academic/practical relevance : The prevalence of this noncompliance problem poses considerable public health risk, thus compromising the original purpose of a well-intentioned AP initiative. We provide an internally consistent and implementable solution to the problem through a comprehensive analysis of the myriad complicating factors and trade-offs facing the FDA. Methodology : We adopt a Stackelberg framework in which the regulator, which cannot observe the manufacturer’s private cost information or level of effort, leads by imposing a postmarket study deadline. The profit-maximizing manufacturer then follows by establishing its level of effort to invest in its postmarket study. In establishing its deadline, the regulator optimizes the trade-off between providing public access to potentially effective drugs and mitigating public health risks from ineffective drugs. Results : We develop a deadline-dependent user fee menu as a screening mechanism that establishes an incentive for manufacturer compliance. We show that its effectiveness in inducing compliance depends fundamentally on the enforceability of sanction, a drug-specific measure that indicates how difficult it is to withdraw an unproven drug from the market, and the drug’s success probability: The higher either is, the higher is the probability that the mechanism induces compliance. Managerial implications : We synthesize and distill the salient trade-offs and nuances facing the FDA’s noncompliance problem and provide an implementable solution. We quantify the value of the solution as a function of a drug’s success probability and enforceability. From a public policy perspective, we provide guidance for the FDA to increase the viability and effectiveness of AP.},

We study how the entrepreneur can signal quality to backers via the design of the crowdfunding campaign, including the price of the reward and the funding target. Academic/practical relevance : Crowdfunding is a new and popular way of funding innovative products. Despite numerous advantages, there are challenges to this model, one of the most significant being credibly signaling information about product quality to a pool of small, uninformed investors. We explore how an entrepreneur might accomplish this and overcome a key obstacle to crowdfunding. Methodology : We employ a game theoretic model of signaling between an entrepreneur and campaign backers. Results : We find that the entrepreneur should signal high quality by setting a high target that is distorted above the full information optimal level. While a separating equilibrium always exists, a pooling equilibrium can only occur under very specific circumstances. We show that the high target affects the quality choice of entrepreneurs and may deter unique, high-quality projects. In addition, we discuss how the entrepreneur should modify the signaling strategy when a high target potentially deters backers from pledging because of the cost of participating in a failed campaign. Managerial implications : We show how entrepreneurs can effectively design their crowdfunding campaign to signal high quality, thus providing guidance to creators listing products on crowdfunding websites. We also show information asymmetry and signaling affect product quality decisions by creators, which in turn is of interest to platform designers seeking to solicit high-quality products for their platforms.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The shortage of inpatient beds is a major cause of delays and cancellations in many hospitals. It may also lead to patients being admitted to inappropriate wards, resulting in a lower quality of care and a longer length of stay. Academic/practical relevance : Investment in additional beds is not always feasible. Instead, new and creative solutions for a more efficient use of existing resources must be sought. Methodology : We propose a new configuration of inpatient beds, which we call the clustered overflow configuration . In this configuration, patients who are denied admission to their primary wards as a result of beds being fully occupied are admitted to overflow wards, with each designated to serve overflows from a certain subset of specialties and providing the same quality of care as in primary wards. We propose two different formulations for partitioning and bed allocation in the proposed configuration: one minimizing the sum of average daily costs of turning patients away and nursing teams, and another minimizing the numbers turned away subject to nursing cost falling below a given threshold. We heuristically solve instances from both formulations. Results : Applying the models to real data shows that the configurations obtained from our models compare very well with the other configurations proposed in the literature, provided that patients’ willingness to wait is relatively short. Managerial implications : The proposed configuration provides the combined advantages of the dedicated configuration, wherein patients are only admitted to their primary wards, and the flexible configuration, in which all specialties share a single ward. On the other hand, it restricts the adverse impacts of pooling and minimizes cross-training costs through appropriate partitioning and bed allocation. As such, it serves as a viable alternative to existing inpatient configurations.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : With the development of the internet and e-commerce, retailers often offer preorders for new, to-be-released products. To encourage preorders, retailers such as Amazon offer preorder price guarantee (PG). That is, if the product price drops before or on the release date, preorder consumers automatically receive a refund for the difference between the preorder price and the new price. Should retailers offer PG for preorders? If so, how should they decide the prices and inventory level? Academic/practical relevance : Both advance selling and price matching have been observed in practice and studied in literature. However, the combination of these two is a new phenomenon in practice and receives very limited attention in academic. So our study is closely related to both academic and practical communities. Methodology : Dynamic pricing and game theory. Results : We find that, if preorder demand uncertainty is high, a firm should adopt PG in advance selling. If preorder demand uncertainty is low, then a firm should adopt PG if and only if the percentage of high-valuation consumers is high. Furthermore, we find that a firm&#39;s optimal profit under PG monotonically increases in preorder demand uncertainty while the firm&#39;s optimal profit without PG stays unchanged. That is, PG enables a firm to profit from preorder demand uncertainty. In addition, we show that price commitment is dominated by dynamic pricing when the retailer can optimally decide whether to offer PG under dynamic pricing. We also demonstrate that a retailer should sell in advance if a product&#39;s marginal cost is less than a certain threshold, which is higher than the traditional threshold in the advance selling literature without consideration of PG. Managerial implications : Our results provide guidance for retailers on whether or not they should offer PG and how to design the prices under PG.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Unoccupied waiting feels longer than it actually is. Service providers operationalize this psychological principle by offering entertainment options in waiting areas. A service cluster with a common space provides firms with an opportunity to cooperate in the investment for providing entertainment options while competing on other service dimensions. Academic/practical relevance : Our paper contributes to the literature by being the first to examine co-opetition in a service setting, in addition to developing a novel model of waiting-area entertainment. It also sheds new light on the emerging practice of service clusters and small-footprint retailing. Methodology : Using a queueing theoretic approach, we develop a parsimonious model of co-opetition in a service cluster with a common space. Results : By comparing the case of co-opetition with two benchmarks (monopoly and duopoly competition), we demonstrate that a service provider that would otherwise be a local monopolist can achieve higher profitability by joining a service cluster and engaging in co-opetition. Achieving such benefits, however, requires a cost-allocation scheme that properly addresses an efficiency-fairness tradeoff—the pursuit of fairness may backfire and lead to even lower profitability than under pure competition. Managerial implications : We show that as much as co-opetition facilitates resource sharing in a service cluster, it heightens price competition. Furthermore, as the intensity of price competition increases, surprisingly, service providers may opt to charge higher service fees, albeit while providing a higher entertainment level.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We examine how the presence of capital market frictions influences the decision to invest in production cost reduction and the resultant production volume. This investment can increase the firm’s cash flow by increasing the profit margin, but it can also decrease the firm’s risk-free cash reserves and thus affect its exposure to capital market frictions. Academic/practical relevance : Process improvement aimed at production cost reduction has generated myriad of theoretical questions about efficient investment options and capacity choices. From a managerial perspective, process improvement is a fundamental concern in operations strategy. Nevertheless, its analysis typically excludes financial constraints by assuming a perfect capital market. Methodology : We formulate a two-stage profit maximization model in which a capital-constrained firm commits to a cost-reduction investment in the first stage in anticipation of its production decision in the second stage of this two-stage decision process. The firm considers capital market frictions when making decisions at each stage, while considering uncertainty in demand for its offering and in reducing its unit production cost. Results : When a firm faces small initial capital and low preinvestment unit production costs, it can benefit from investing in production cost reduction in the presence of capital market frictions more so than in their absence. Moreover, uncertainty in the production cost reduction mitigates the impact of market frictions on the net benefit (i.e., additional profit), whereas demand uncertainty decreases the feasible parameter space, where investing in production cost reduction is optimal. Managerial implications : A firm’s decision to invest in production cost reduction affects its operational and financial capabilities. Managers should thus consider this investment as an operational hedge not only against the uncertainty of matching supply and demand but also against exposure to capital market frictions and the resultant financial risk.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study a service setting where the provider has information about some customers’ future service needs and may initiate service for such customers proactively, if they agree to be flexible with respect to the timing of service delivery. Academic/practical relevance : Information about future customer-service needs is becoming increasingly available through remote monitoring systems and data analytics. However, the literature has not systematically examined proactive service as a tool that can be used to better match demand to service supply when customers are strategic. Methodology : We combine (i) queueing theory, and in particular a diffusion approximation developed specifically for this problem that allows us to derive analytic approximations for customer waiting times, with (ii) game theory, which captures customer incentives to adopt proactive service. Results : We show that proactive service can reduce customer waiting times, even if only a relatively small proportion of customers agree to be flexible, the information lead time is limited, and the system makes occasional errors in providing proactive service—in fact, we show that the system’s ability to tolerate errors increases with (nominal) utilization. Nevertheless, we show that these benefits may fail to materialize in equilibrium because of economic frictions: Customers will underadopt proactive service (due to free-riding) and overjoin the system (due to negative congestion-based externalities). We also show that the service provider can incentivize optimal customer behavior through appropriate pricing. Managerial implications : Our results suggest that proactive service may offer substantial operational benefits, but caution that it may fail to fulfill its potential due to customer self-interested behavior.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider the incentive design problem of a retailer that delegates stocking decisions to its store managers who are privately informed about local demand. Academic/practical relevance : Shortages are highly costly in retail, but are less of a concern for store managers, as their exact amounts are usually not recorded. In order to align incentives and attain desired service levels, retailers need to design mechanisms in the absence of information on shortage quantities. Methodology : The headquarters knows that the underlying demand process at a store is one of J possible Wiener processes, whereas the store manager knows the specific process. The store manager creates a single order before each period. The headquarters uses an incentive scheme that is based on the end-of-period leftover inventory and on a stock-out occasion at a prespecified inspection time before the end of a period. The problem for the headquarters is to determine the inspection time and the significance of a stock-out relative to leftover inventory in evaluating the performance of the store manager. We formulate the problem as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem in the single period setting and a dynamic program in the multiperiod setting. Results : We show that the proposed “early inspection” scheme leads to perfect alignment when J equals two under mild conditions. In more general cases, we show that the scheme performs strictly better than inspecting stock-outs at the end and achieves near-perfect alignment. Our numerical experiments, using both synthetic and real data, reveal that this scheme can lead to considerable cost reductions. Managerial implications : Stock-out-related measures are typically not included in store managers’ performance scorecards in retail. We propose a novel, easy, and practical performance measurement scheme that does not depend on the actual amount of shortages. This new scheme incentivizes the store managers to use their private information in the retailer’s best interest and clearly outperforms centralized ordering systems that are common practice.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Deceased-donor kidney transplant candidates in the United States are ranked according to characteristics of both the donor and the recipient. We seek the ranking policy that optimizes the efficiency–equity tradeoff among all such policies, taking into account patients’ strategic choices. Academic/practical relevance : Our approach considers a broad class of ranking policies, which provides approximations to the previously and currently used policies in practice. It also subsumes other policies proposed in the literature previously. As such, it facilitates a unified way of characterizing good policies. Methodology : We use a fluid model to approximate the transplant waitlist. Modeling patients as rational decision makers, we compute the resulting equilibria under a broad class of ranking policies, namely the achievable region. We then develop an algorithm that optimizes the system performance over the achievable region. Results : We show analytically that it suffices to restrict attention to priority scores that are affine in the patient’s waiting time. We also show through a numerical study that the total quality-adjusted life-years can be increased substantially by allowing patient rankings to depend on the kidney quality. Last, we observe that there is almost no improvement if only the healthier patients are prioritized for certain kidney types. Managerial implications : Our results verify that ranking patients differently for kidneys of different quality can reduce the survival mismatch and the kidney wastage significantly. Consequently, the policy change in 2014, that implemented prioritizing the healthiest patients when allocating the highest 20% quality organs, is a step in the right direction. For further improvement, one may consider revising the new policy by also prioritizing the least healthy patients on the waitlist for the lowest-quality organs.},

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Nanostores are traditional, small and independent retailers that are present in large numbers in the megacities of the developing world. Consumer packaged goods (CPG) manufacturers can choose to deliver to nanostores either directly—visiting thousands of stores per day—or via wholesalers—saving on distribution cost but forfeiting the direct access to the store owners to develop demand. We study a manufacturer’s channel strategy within a finite time horizon. Academic / practical relevance : The channel strategy in emerging markets has both marketing and operational elements, which lead to a newly formulated problem with novel characteristics. High costs are involved in the nanostore distribution, and the difference in wholesale price, logistics cost, product availability, and market growth leads to a multidimensional problem that is not trivial to analyze. Methodology : We develop an analytical model to derive the optimal channel policy. We conduct a numerical study with parameters tuned by field data. We develop managerial insights based on our formal results and our numerical analysis. Results : The optimal channel policy structure depends mainly on two channel metrics: the gross profitability , which is the gross margin at a particular moment in time; and the growth-adjusted profitability , which includes the growth potential of a particular channel strategy to develop the market and realize future profits. With demand growth over time, we show that, in the optimal policy, there is at most one switch between the wholesale and direct-channel strategies within the time horizon. Managerial implications : Depending on the two metrics, it may be optimal to first expand the market by using the direct channel and then switch to the wholesale channel to exploit the expanded market. In other cases, it may be optimal to first expand the market slowly by using the wholesale channel and then switch to the direct channel to benefit from high demand growth. The optimal channel strategy is also dependent on the time horizon, with a longer time horizon leading to relatively longer use of the direct channel.},

  abstract     = {We study the impact of grocery-store density on the food waste generated at stores and by households. Food waste is a major contributor to carbon emissions (as big as road transport). Identifying and influencing market conditions that can decrease food waste is thus important to combat global warming. We build and calibrate a stylized two-echelon perishable-inventory model to capture grocery purchases and expiration at competing stores and households in a market. We examine how the equilibrium waste in this model changes with store density. An increase in store density decreases consumer waste due to improved access to groceries, whereas increasing retail waste due to decentralization of inventory increased variability propagation in the supply chain (cycle truncation) and diminished demand by customers. Higher density also induces more competition which further increases (decreases) waste when stores compete on prices (service levels). Overall, consumer waste reductions compete with store waste increases and the effects of increased competition. Our analysis shows that higher density reduces food waste up to a threshold density; it leads to higher food waste beyond this threshold . Put differently, in so far as food waste is concerned, there exists an optimal store density. Calibration using grocery industry, economic, and demographic data reveals that actual store density in most American cities is well below this threshold/optimal level, and modest increases in store density substantially reduce waste; for example, in Chicago, just 3–4 more stores (per 10 sq km) can lead to a 6%–9% waste reduction, and a 1%–4% decrease in grocery expenses. These results arise from the principal role of consumer waste, suggesting that activists and policy makers’ focus on retail waste may be misguided. Store operators, urban planners, and decision makers should aim to increase store densities to make grocery shopping more affordable and sustainable.},
