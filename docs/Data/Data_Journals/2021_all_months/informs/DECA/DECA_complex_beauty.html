  abstract     = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, staying home proved to be an effective way to mitigate the spread of the virus. Stay-at-home orders and guidelines were issued by governments across the globe and were followed by a large portion of the population in the early stages of the outbreak when there was a lack of COVID-specific medical knowledge. The decision of whether to stay home came with many trade-offs, such as risking personal exposure to the virus when leaving home or facing financial and mental health burdens when remaining home. In this research, we study how individuals make strategic decisions to balance these conflicting outcomes. We present a model to study individuals’ decision making based on decision and prospect theory, and we conduct sensitivity analysis to study the fluctuations in optimal strategies when there are changes made to the model’s parameters. A Monte Carlo simulation is implemented to further study the performance of our model, and we compare our simulation results with real data that captures individuals’ stay-at-home decisions. Overall, this research models and analyzes the behaviors of individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic and can help support decision making regarding control measures and policy development when public health emergencies appear in the future.},

Our characterization is based on two key concepts: a weaker notion of continuity called “mild continuity” (strict preference order between any two alternatives that are different with respect to every attribute is preserved around their small neighborhoods) and an “unhappy set” (any alternative outside such a set is preferred to all alternatives inside). Three key aspects of our characterization are as follows: (i) we use continuity arguments; (ii) we use the stepwise approach of looking at two attributes at a time; and (iii) in contrast with the previous literature, we do not impose noncompensation on the preference and consider an alternative weaker condition.},

Methods such as logistic regression or the naïve Bayes algorithm produce a score related to the likelihood that a record belongs to a particular class. A cutoff threshold is then defined to delineate the prediction of one class over another. This paper derives analytic results for the selection of an optimal cutoff threshold for a classification algorithm that is used to inform a two-action decision in the cases of risk aversion and risk neutrality. The results provide insight to how the optimal cutoff thresholds relate to the associated costs and the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for both the risk neutral and risk averse decision makers. The optimal risk averse threshold is not reliably above or below the optimal risk neutral threshold, but the relation depends on the parameters of a particular application. The results further show the risk averse optimal threshold is insensitive to the size of the data set or the magnitude of the costs, but instead is sensitive to the proportion of positive records in the data and the ratio of costs. Numeric examples and sensitivity analysis derive further insight. Results show the percent value gap from a misspecified risk attitude increases as the specificity of the classification algorithm decreases.},

  abstract     = {Fueled by the widespread use of the internet, more and more ordinary people have now become merchandise sellers who sell their own possessions, such as antique collections and limited souvenirs, to buyers who are interested in such goods via online auctions. This study examines the decision making related to the bidding strategies used in online auctions by both sellers and buyers. When selling goods for which there is a limited supply, sellers consider whether to sell the single homogenous items in multiple, simultaneous auctions or all the items in a single auction. Moreover, when selling heterogeneous but associated goods, sellers may decide to bundle the items for sale or not with an aim of increasing the potential buyers’ willingness to make a purchase. We investigate the effects that various factors related to the bidding strategies used in online auctions, such as the base price and duration of the auction determined by the seller and the bidding price decided by the buyer, have on the seller’s profit, and the utilities of both parties are considered to derive the equilibrium solutions. This study contributes to the literature by proposing an online auction framework that focuses more on individual sellers selling a limited quantity of items with an aim to establish a favorable online auction for both sellers and buyers and earn more profits for sellers. The results show that the base prices and direct purchase prices should be unestablished to achieve the most attractive characteristics of online auctions, which would encourage more buyers to freely place bids. As a result, the bidding items would have more chances to be eventually obtained by the buyer who places the highest bid, which, thus, maximizes the seller’s profit.},

  abstract     = {Whereas automated driving technology has made tremendous gains in the last decade, significant questions remain regarding its integration into society. Given its revolutionary nature, the use of automated driving systems (ADSs) is accompanied by myriad novel quandaries relating to both operational and ethical concerns that are relevant to numerous stakeholders (e.g., governments, manufacturers, and passengers). When considering any such problem, the ADS’s decision-making calculus is always a central component. This is true for concerns about public perception and trust to others regarding explainability and legal certainty. Therefore, in this manuscript, we set forth a general decision-analytic framework tailorable to multitudinous stakeholders. More specifically, we develop and validate a generic tree of ADS management objectives, explore potential attributes for their measurement, and provide multiattribute utility functions for implementation. Given the contention surrounding numerous ethical concerns in ADS operations, we explore how each of the aforementioned components can be tailored in accordance with the stakeholder’s desired ethical perspective. A simulation environment is developed upon which our framework is tested. Within this environment we illustrate how our approach can be leveraged by stakeholders to make strategic trade-offs regarding ADS behavior and to inform policymaking efforts. In so doing, our framework is demonstrated as a practical, tractable, and transparent means of modeling ADS decision making.},

This paper develops a framework for analyzing weather-sensitive decisions with a focus on the less-familiar strategic decisions that determine how forecasts are produced and what operational alternatives are available so that decision makers can extract value from forecasts. We tell the story of the decisions made in the months before D-Day regarding how to set up the forecasting process and the myriad decisions implicating nation-level resources that prepared Allied forces not just to invade, but to hold open that decision until the last possible hour so that Eisenhower and his staff could use the critical forecasts. Finally, we overview the current state of the weather-forecasting enterprise, the current challenges of interest to decision analysts, and what this means for decision analysts seeking opportunities to help the weather enterprise improve forecasts and to help operational decision makers extract more value from modern weather forecasts.},

Consequently, our approach differs from prevailing numerical methods that consider a system of poorly behaved differential equations.

  abstract     = {Rank aggregation is widely used in group decision making and many other applications, where it is of interest to consolidate heterogeneous ordered lists. Oftentimes, these rankings may involve a large number of alternatives, contain ties, and/or be incomplete, all of which complicate the use of robust aggregation methods. In particular, these characteristics have limited the applicability of the aggregation framework based on the Kemeny-Snell distance, which satisfies key social choice properties that have been shown to engender improved decisions. This work introduces a binary programming formulation for the generalized Kemeny rank aggregation problem—whose ranking inputs may be complete and incomplete, with and without ties. Moreover, it leverages the equivalence of two ranking aggregation problems, namely, that of minimizing the Kemeny-Snell distance and of maximizing the Kendall-τ correlation, to compare the newly introduced binary programming formulation to a modified version of an existing integer programming formulation associated with the Kendall-τ distance. The new formulation has fewer variables and constraints, which leads to faster solution times. Moreover, we develop a new social choice property, the nonstrict extended Condorcet criterion, which can be regarded as a natural extension of the well-known Condorcet criterion and the Extended Condorcet criterion. Unlike its parent properties, the new property is adequate for handling complete rankings with ties. The property is leveraged to develop a structural decomposition algorithm, through which certain large instances of the NP-hard Kemeny rank aggregation problem can be solved exactly in a practical amount of time. To test the practical implications of the new formulation and social choice property, we work with instances constructed from a probabilistic distribution and with benchmark instances from PrefLib, a library of preference data.},

Based on theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, we further study a preferences aggregation model in the group decision-making context based on the proposed axiomatic distance function. In this model, the group preference is defined as a preference–approval structure that minimizes the sum of its distances to all preference–approval structures of individuals in the group under consideration. Particularly, we show that the group preference defined by the axiomatic distance–based aggregation model has close relationships with the simple majority rule and Cook and Seiford’s ranking.},

The classical normative model predicts that a decision maker discounts a later payment relative to an earlier one by an exponential function of the time between them. Descriptive models use nonexponential functions to fit observed behavioral phenomena, such as preference reversal. Here we propose a model of discounting, consistent with standard axioms of choice, in which decision makers maximize the growth rate of their wealth. Four specifications of the model produce four forms of discounting—no discounting, exponential discounting, hyperbolic discounting, and a hybrid of exponential and hyperbolic discounting—two of which predict preference reversal.

A good forecaster (model or human expert) is measured as one who allows the user to bet profitably against the market consensus. By asking forecasts to beat the market, forecasters are discouraged from herding and motivated to obtain better information than rival forecasters. We illustrate and prove that each trader’s personal incentive to hedge or fudge disappears when the number of forecasts in the market is sufficiently large. Our score exhibits the forecaster’s ability to assist economically profitable action and reveals how the user’s profits depend strongly on the accuracy of the forecasts and the decision rule (boldness) with which they are acted upon.},

Based on the number of defective units observed, a decision is made on whether to stop the process and repair an assignable cause of variation. The model has no requirement to maintain the history of sample results and corrective actions taken in previous sampling periods. Despite the limited memory of process history, the nature of the decision rule and solution algorithm result in quality-related costs that are comparable to those of existing methods for Bayesian quality control with information on number of defectives. When sampling interval and sample size can be selected as design parameters for a system with a fixed time between scheduled maintenance, the limited memory influence diagram model can be constructed to provide similar costs with reduced computational requirement as compared with a partially observed Markov decision process technique.},

  abstract     = {We study sequential shortest path interdiction, where in each period an interdictor with incomplete knowledge of the arc costs blocks at most k arcs, and an evader with complete knowledge about the costs traverses a shortest path between two fixed nodes in the interdicted network. In each period, the interdictor, who aims at maximizing the evader’s cumulative cost over a finite time horizon, and whose initial knowledge is limited to valid lower and upper bounds on the costs, observes only the total cost of the path traversed by the evader, but not the path itself. This limited information feedback is then used by the interdictor to refine knowledge of the network’s costs, which should lead to better decisions. Different interdiction decisions lead to different responses by the evader and thus to different feedback. Focusing on minimizing the number of periods it takes a policy to recover a full information interdiction decision (that taken by an interdictor with complete knowledge about costs), we show that a class of greedy interdiction policies requires, in the worst case, an exponential number of periods to converge. Nonetheless, we show that under less stringent modes of feedback, convergence in polynomial time is possible. In particular, we consider different versions of imperfect randomized feedback that allow establishing polynomial expected convergence bounds. Finally, we also discuss a generalization of our approach for the case of a strategic evader, who does not necessarily follow a shortest path in each period.},

  abstract     = {The definition of best response for a player in the Nash equilibrium is based on maximizing the expected utility given the strategy of the rest of the players in a game. In this work, we consider stochastic games, that is, games with random payoffs, in which a finite number of players engage only once or at most a limited number of times. In such games, players may choose to deviate from maximizing their expected utility. This is because maximizing expected utility strategy does not address the uncertainty in payoffs. We instead define a new notion of a stochastic superiority best response. This notion of best response results in a stochastic superiority equilibrium in which players choose to play the strategy that maximizes the probability of them being rewarded the most in a single round of the game rather than maximizing the expected received reward, subject to the actions of other players. We prove the stochastic superiority equilibrium to exist in all finite games, that is, games with a finite number of players and actions, and numerically compare its performance to Nash equilibrium in finite-time stochastic games. In certain cases, we show the payoff under the stochastic superiority equilibrium is 70\% likely to be higher than the payoff under Nash equilibrium.},

In this paper, we consider price forecasts and discount rates in an integrated framework. We calibrate the risk premiums in a two-factor stochastic price process with a capital asset pricing model-based discount rate. Together with the analysts’ long-term prices forecasts, the suggested method improves consistency in valuation and decision making.},

However, because the probability of obtaining their preferred items is determined by the retailer, consumers must search for related information and rely on their own subjective judgments to reduce the risk of not obtaining them. This study investigates the effects that consumer risk attitudes and word of mouth have on consumers’ purchase decisions regarding probabilistic goods and develops a pricing model for probabilistic selling in which a retailer offers probabilistic goods to heterogeneous consumers with different risk attitudes and possible social interactions. The analytical results show that a retailer’s profit decreases as the degree of risk aversion increases under the probabilistic selling strategy. In addition, word of mouth affects consumers’ purchasing decisions regarding different degrees of belief that they will obtain their preferred items. When the word-of-mouth effect decreases, the consumers’ perceived probability of obtaining their preferred items also decreases, which, consequently, reduces the retailer’s profits.},

  abstract     = {In portfolio decision analysis, features comprise the objectives, alternatives, physics, and information that define a decision context. By modeling features, decision analysts forecast the expected utilities of the alternatives. A model is complete if it contains all the features. A model is well-calibrated if it correctly predicts the probability distributions of each alternative’s utility, whereas ill-calibrated models, like those that suffer the optimizer’s curse, do not. Friction identifies qualities of a situation that prevent decision analysts from creating complete, well-calibrated models. When friction is significant, can maximizing expected utility be a suboptimal decision rule? Is satisfying decision theory’s axioms a necessary or sufficient condition for good decision making? Can rules that violate the axioms outperform rules that satisfy them? A simulation study of how unbiased, imprecise forecasts of payoffs affect project selection finds that, for the example tested, the answers are yes, no, and yes, which suggests that further studies of friction may be worthwhile. Discussions of friction bookend the study, starting the paper by defining friction and concluding by presenting three frameworks, each one from a different field of study, that provide mathematical tools for studying friction.},

Our experiments find underconfidence of the 50\% prediction intervals, which is primarily driven by overestimation of the 75th percentiles. We further perform exploratory analyses to disentangle sampling errors and judgmental biases in the overall miscalibration. Finally, we show that the correlations of log-transformed judgments between subjects are smaller than is justified by the information overlapping structure. It leads to overconfident aggregate predictions using the Bayes rule if we treat the low correlations as an indicator for independent information.},

  abstract     = {Many studies have spotlighted significant applications of expected utility theory (EUT), cumulative prospect theory (CPT), and mean-variance in assessing risks. We illustrate that these models and their extensions are unable to predict risk behaviors accurately in out-of-sample empirical studies. EUT uses a nonlinear value (utility) function of consequences but is linear in probabilities, which has been criticized as its primary weakness. Although mean-variance is nonlinear in probabilities, it is symmetric, contradicts first-order stochastic dominance, and uses the same standard deviation for both risk aversion and risk proneness. In this paper, we explore a special case of geometric dispersion theory (GDT) that is simultaneously nonlinear in both consequences and probabilities. It complies with first-order stochastic dominance and is asymmetric to represent the mixed risk-averse and risk-prone behaviors of the decision makers. GDT is a triad model that uses expected value, risk-averse dispersion, and risk-prone dispersion. GDT uses only two parameters, z and zX; these constants remain the same regardless of the scale of risk problem. We compare GDT to several other risk dispersion models that are based on EUT and/or mean-variance, and identify verified risk paradoxes that contradict EUT, CPT, and mean-variance but are easily explainable by GDT. We demonstrate that GDT predicts out-of-sample empirical risk behaviors far more accurately than EUT, CPT, mean-variance, and other risk dispersion models. We also discuss the underlying assumptions, meanings, and perspectives of GDT and how it reflects risk relativity and risk triad. This paper covers basic GDT, which is a special case of general GDT of Malakooti [Malakooti (2020) Geometric dispersion theory of decision making under risk: Generalizing EUT, RDEU, &amp;amp; CPT with out-of-sample empirical studies.
