We show that asymptotic learning holds for every utility function if and only if signals are totally unbounded, that is, the support of the private posterior probability of every event contains both zero and one. For the case of finitely many actions, we provide a sufficient condition for asymptotic learning depending on the given utility function. Finally, we establish that for the important class of simple utility functions with finitely many actions and states, pairwise unbounded signals, which generally are a strictly weaker notion than unbounded signals, are necessary and sufficient for asymptotic learning.},

To do so, we first focus on a related insurance risk model, for which we determine the ruin probability at an exponentially distributed epoch jointly with the corresponding undershoot and overshoot, given that the capital level at time 0 is exponentially distributed as well. The obtained results for this insurance risk model can be translated in terms of two types of storage models, in one of those two cases by exploiting a duality relation. Many well-studied models are shown to be special cases of our insurance risk and storage models. We conclude by showing how the exponentiality assumptions can be greatly relaxed.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with finding an optimal algorithm for minimizing a composite convex objective function. The basic setting is that the objective is the sum of two convex functions: the first function is smooth with up to the d th-order derivative information available, and the second function is possibly nonsmooth, but its proximal tensor mappings can be computed approximately in an efficient manner. The problem is to find—in that setting—the best possible (optimal) iteration complexity for convex optimization. Along that line, for the smooth case (without the second nonsmooth part in the objective), Nesterov proposed an optimal algorithm for the first-order methods ( d = 1 ) with iteration complexity O ( 1 / k 2 ) , whereas high-order tensor algorithms (using up to general d th-order tensor information) with iteration complexity O ( 1 / k d + 1 ) were recently established. In this paper, we propose a new high-order tensor algorithm for the general composite case, with the iteration complexity of O ( 1 / k ( 3 d +1 ) / 2 ) , which matches the lower bound for the d th-order methods as previously established and hence is optimal. Our approach is based on the accelerated hybrid proximal extragradient (A-HPE) framework proposed by Monteiro and Svaiter, where a bisection procedure is installed for each A-HPE iteration. At each bisection step, a proximal tensor subproblem is approximately solved, and the total number of bisection steps per A-HPE iteration is shown to be bounded by a logarithmic factor in the precision required.},

The distribution of the consumers’ valuations is given by one of two possible demand distributions/states. The consumers are uncertain about the demand state, and they update their beliefs after observing their own valuation for the good. The firm is uncertain about the demand state but infers it from the consumers’ reported valuations. The firm’s problem is to maximize profits by choosing an optimal mechanism among the class of anonymous, deterministic, direct revelation mechanisms that satisfy interim incentive compatibility and ex post individual rationality. We show that, under certain sufficient conditions, the firm’s optimal mechanism is to set the monopoly price in each demand state. Under these conditions, Segal’s optimal ex post mechanism is robust to relaxing ex post incentive compatibility to interim incentive compatibility.},

We show that such extensions exist for translation invariant dominance relations on a large class of topological vector spaces. Translation invariance or a vector structure are no longer needed when X is locally compact and second countable. In decision theoretic exercises, our extension theorems help construct monotonic utility functions on the universal space X starting from compact subsets. To illustrate, we prove several representation theorems for revealed or exogenously given preferences that are monotonic with respect to a dominance relation.},

In this work, we consider the situation in which the sequence comes in random order. We look at both a nonadaptive and an adaptive version of the problem. In the former case, the gambler sets a threshold for every random variable a priori, whereas, in the latter case, the thresholds are set when a random variable arrives. For the nonadaptive case, we obtain an algorithm achieving an expected reward within at least a 0.632 fraction of the expected maximum and prove that this constant is optimal. For the adaptive case with independent and identically distributed random variables, we obtain a tight 0.745-approximation, solving a problem posed by Hill and Kertz in 1982. We also apply these prophet inequalities to posted price mechanisms, and we prove the same tight bounds for both a nonadaptive and an adaptive posted price mechanism when buyers arrive in random order.},

In this paper, we prove lower bounds on the size of linear programs that approximate the positive semidefinite cone. Let D be the set of n × n positive semidefinite matrices of trace equal to one. We prove two results on the hardness of approximating D with polytopes. We show that if 0 0 is a constant that depends on ε. Second, we show that any polytope P such that D ⊂ P and such that the Gaussian width of P is at most twice the Gaussian width of D must have extension complexity at least exp ( c n 1 3 ) . Our bounds are both superpolynomial in n and demonstrate that there is no generic way of approximating semidefinite programs with compact linear programs. The main ingredient of our proofs is hypercontractivity of the noise operator on the hypercube.},

The models under study arise as optimizers of appropriate idleness-based criteria within a suitable family of fluid models for a given resource-sharing network. The class of minimal fluid models is fairly general, corresponding to efficient service protocols in which transmission on each route takes place in the earliest deadline first (EDF) order. For such a model, the distribution of the current lead times of the fluid mass on each route coincides with the fluid arrival measure for this route, truncated below on the current frontier level. Locally edge minimal fluid models may be regarded, in some sense, as fluid counterparts of EDF resource-sharing networks. Under mild assumptions, a locally edge minimal fluid model is uniquely determined by its data. We also show stability of such models in the strictly subcritical case. More generally, each such a subcritical model converges to the invariant manifold in finite time.},

To assess the relevance of this nonexistence, we consider games where the payoffs are drawn at random. In particular, we focus on games where a large number of players can each choose one of two possible strategies and the payoffs are independent and identically distributed with the possibility of ties. We provide asymptotic results about the random number of pure Nash equilibria, such as fast growth and a central limit theorem, with bounds for the approximation error. Moreover, by using a new link between percolation models and game theory, we describe in detail the geometry of pure Nash equilibria and show that, when the probability of ties is small, a best-response dynamics reaches a pure Nash equilibrium with a probability that quickly approaches one as the number of players grows. We show that various phase transitions depend only on a single parameter of the model, that is, the probability of having ties.},

First-order sufficient optimality conditions are obtained by estimating the tangent cone to the feasible set of the bilevel program in terms of initial problem data. This is done by exploiting several different reformulations of the hierarchical model as a single-level problem. To obtain second-order sufficient optimality conditions, we exploit the so-called value function reformulation of the bilevel optimization problem, which is then tackled with the aid of second-order directional derivatives. The resulting conditions can be stated in terms of initial problem data in several interesting situations comprising the settings where the lower level is linear or possesses strongly stable solutions.},

  abstract     = {A set function is called XOS if it can be represented by the maximum of additive functions. When such a representation is fixed, the number of additive functions required to define the XOS function is called the width. In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing XOS functions in the value oracle model. The problem is trivial for the XOS functions of width 1 because they are just additive, but it is already nontrivial even when the width is restricted to 2. We show two types of tight bounds on the polynomial-time approximability for this problem. First, in general, the approximation bound is between O ( n ) and Ω ( n / l o g n ) , and exactly θ ( n / l o g n ) if randomization is allowed, where n is the ground set size. Second, when the width of the input XOS functions is bounded by a constant k ≥ 2, the approximation bound is between k − 1 and k − 1 − ɛ for any ɛ &gt; 0. In particular, we give a linear-time algorithm to find an exact maximizer of a given XOS function of width 2, whereas we show that any exact algorithm requires an exponential number of value oracle calls even when the width is restricted to 3.},

MaxWeight is a greedy policy that does not depend on knowledge of arrival rates and is straightforward to implement. These properties and its simple formulation suggest MaxWeight as a serious candidate for implementation in the setting of switched queueing networks; MaxWeight has been extensively studied in the context of communication networks. However, a fluid model variant of MaxWeight was previously shown not to be maximally stable. Here, we prove that MaxWeight itself is not in general maximally stable. We also prove MaxWeight is maximally stable in a much more restrictive setting, and that a weighted version of MaxWeight, where the weighting depends on the traffic intensity, is always stable.},

  abstract     = {We study the dynamic assortment planning problem, where for each arriving customer, the seller offers an assortment of substitutable products and the customer makes the purchase among offered products according to an uncapacitated multinomial logit (MNL) model. Because all the utility parameters of the MNL model are unknown, the seller needs to simultaneously learn customers’ choice behavior and make dynamic decisions on assortments based on the current knowledge. The goal of the seller is to maximize the expected revenue, or, equivalently, to minimize the expected regret. Although dynamic assortment planning problem has received an increasing attention in revenue management, most existing policies require the estimation of mean utility for each product and the final regret usually involves the number of products N . The optimal regret of the dynamic assortment planning problem under the most basic and popular choice model—the MNL model—is still open. By carefully analyzing a revenue potential function, we develop a trisection-based policy combined with adaptive confidence bound construction, which achieves an item-independent regret bound of O ( T ) , where T is the length of selling horizon. We further establish the matching lower bound result to show the optimality of our policy. There are two major advantages of the proposed policy. First, the regret of all our policies has no dependence on N . Second, our policies are almost assumption-free: there is no assumption on mean utility nor any “separability” condition on the expected revenues for different assortments. We also extend our trisection search algorithm to capacitated MNL models and obtain the optimal regret O ˜ ( N T ) (up to logrithmic factors) without any assumption on the mean utility parameters of items.},

The two mechanisms trade off between their applicability and their computational and informational requirements.

To this end, we introduced the so-called bounded workload condition, which requires the workload process be bounded by a free process plus the initial workload. This condition is for a derived process, the workload, as opposed to primitives such as arrival processes and service requirements; as such, it could be difficult to verify. In this paper, we establish the interchange of limits under a moment condition of suitable order on the primitives directly: the required order is p ∗ &gt; 2 ( p + 2 ) on the moments of the primitive processes so as to bound the p th moment of the workload. This moment condition is trivial to verify, and indeed automatically holds in networks where the primitives have moments of all orders, for instance, renewal arrivals with phase-type interarrival times and independent and identically distributed phase-type service times.},

The value is characterized as the fixed point of an optimal control problem with periodic initial and terminal conditions. We prove the regularity and uniqueness of the corresponding dynamic programming equation and the convergence of an efficient numerical algorithm that we use to study the problem. The model enables us to find the loss caused by infrequent dividend payments. We show that under realistic parameter values, this loss varies from around 1\%–24\% depending on the state of the system and that using the optimal policy from the continuous problem further increases the loss.},

We show that well-known and popular first-order iterative methods can be implemented using only statistical queries. For many cases of interest, we derive nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the estimation (sample) complexity, including linear optimization in the most general setting. We then present several consequences for machine learning, differential privacy, and proving concrete lower bounds on the power of convex optimization–based methods.

Our algorithms are based on simple iterative methods for the minimum-norm problem, such as the conditional gradient and Fujishige–Wolfe algorithms. We exhibit two techniques to turn simple iterative methods into polynomial-time algorithms. First, we adapt the geometric rescaling technique, which has recently gained attention in linear programming, to SFM and obtain a weakly polynomial bound O ( ( n 4 · EO + n 5 ) log ⁡ ( n L ) ) . Second, we exhibit a general combinatorial black box approach to turn ε L -approximate SFM oracles into strongly polynomial exact SFM algorithms. This framework can be applied to a wide range of combinatorial and continuous algorithms, including pseudo-polynomial ones. In particular, we can obtain strongly polynomial algorithms by a repeated application of the conditional gradient or of the Fujishige–Wolfe algorithm. Combined with the geometric rescaling technique, the black box approach provides an O ( ( n 5 · EO + n 6 ) log ⁡ 2 n ) algorithm. Finally, we show that one of the techniques we develop in the paper can also be combined with the cutting-plane method of Lee et al., yielding a simplified variant of their O ( n 3 log ⁡ 2 n · EO + n 4 log ⁡ O ( 1 ) n ) algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The notion of “tail risk” has been a crucial consideration in modern risk management and financial regulation, as very well documented in the recent regulatory documents. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the tail risk, we carry out an axiomatic study for risk measures that quantify the tail risk, that is, the behaviour of a risk beyond a certain quantile. Such risk measures are referred to as tail risk measures in this paper. The two popular classes of regulatory risk measures in banking and insurance, value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall, are prominent, yet elementary, examples of tail risk measures. We establish a connection between a tail risk measure and a corresponding law-invariant risk measure, called its generator, and investigate their joint properties. A tail risk measure inherits many properties from its generator, but not subadditivity or convexity; nevertheless, a tail risk measure is coherent if and only if its generator is coherent. We explore further relevant issues on tail risk measures, such as bounds, distortion risk measures, risk aggregation, elicitability, and dual representations. In particular, there is no elicitable tail convex risk measure other than the essential supremum, and under a continuity condition, the only elicitable and positively homogeneous monetary tail risk measures are the VaRs.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new notion of conditional nonlinear expectation under probability distortion. Such a distorted nonlinear expectation is not subadditive in general, so it is beyond the scope of Peng’s framework of nonlinear expectations. A more fundamental problem when extending the distorted expectation to a dynamic setting is time inconsistency , that is, the usual “tower property” fails. By localizing the probability distortion and restricting to a smaller class of random variables, we introduce a so-called distorted probability and construct a conditional expectation in such a way that it coincides with the original nonlinear expectation at time zero, but has a time-consistent dynamics in the sense that the tower property remains valid. Furthermore, we show that in the continuous time model this conditional expectation corresponds to a parabolic differential equation whose coefficient involves the law of the underlying diffusion. This work is the first step toward a new understanding of nonlinear expectations under probability distortion and will potentially be a helpful tool for solving time-inconsistent stochastic optimization problems.},

It was pointed out by Sven Jäger from Technische Universität Berlin that this upper bound may fail to hold. We here present a modified greedy algorithm and analysis, which leads to a performance guarantee of 7.216 instead. Correspondingly, also the claimed performance guarantee of ( 6 + 3 Δ ) h ( Δ ) in theorem 4 of Gupta et al. for the stochastic online problem has to be corrected.

A matching M is popular if there is no matching N such that the number of vertices that prefer N to M outnumber those that prefer M to N . Each edge is associated with a utility and we consider the problem of matching vertices in a popular and utility-optimal manner. It is known that it is NP-hard to compute a max-utility popular matching. So we consider mixed matchings : a mixed matching is a probability distribution or a lottery over matchings. Our main result is that the popular fractional matching polytope P G is half-integral and in the special case where a stable matching in G is a perfect matching, this polytope is integral. This implies that there is always a max-utility popular mixed matching which is the average of two integral matchings. So in order to implement a max-utility popular mixed matching in G , we need just a single random bit. We analyze the popular fractional matching polytope whose description may have exponentially many constraints via an extended formulation with a linear number of constraints. The linear program that gives rise to this formulation has an unusual property: self-duality . The self-duality of this LP plays a crucial role in our proof. Our result implies that a max-utility popular half-integral matching in G and also in the roommates problem (where the input graph need not be bipartite) can be computed in polynomial time.},

As opposed to the standard definition, which involves a derivative-type operation, the new definition parallels how a discrete-time equilibrium is defined and allows for unambiguous economic interpretation. The terms “strong equilibria” and “weak equilibria” are coined for controls under the new and standard definitions, respectively. When the state process is a time-homogeneous continuous-time Markov chain, a careful asymptotic analysis gives complete characterizations of weak and strong equilibria. Thanks to the Kakutani–Fan fixed-point theorem, the general existence of weak and strong equilibria is also established under an additional compactness assumption. Our theoretic results are applied to a two-state model under nonexponential discounting. In particular, we demonstrate explicitly that there can be incentive to deviate from a weak equilibrium, which justifies the need for strong equilibria. Our analysis also provides new results for the existence and characterization of discrete-time equilibria under infinite horizon.},

Given scalar signals submitted by all users, such a mechanism decides the fraction of the resource that each user will receive and a payment that will be collected from her. Users are self-interested and aim to maximize their utility (defined as their value for the resource fraction they receive minus their payment). Starting with the seminal work of Johari and Tsitsiklis, a long list of papers studied the price of anarchy (in terms of the social welfare—the total users’ value) of resource allocation mechanisms for a variety of allocation and payment rules. Here, we further assume that each user has a budget constraint that invalidates strategies that yield a payment that is higher than the user’s budget. This subtle assumption, which is arguably more realistic, constitutes the traditional price of anarchy analysis meaningless as the set of equilibria may change drastically and their social welfare can be arbitrarily far from optimal. Instead, we study the price of anarchy using the liquid welfare benchmark that measures efficiency taking budget constraints into account. We show a tight bound of 2 on the liquid price of anarchy of the well-known Kelly mechanism and prove that this result is essentially best possible among all multiuser resource allocation mechanisms. This comes in sharp contrast to the no-budget setting where there are mechanisms that considerably outperform Kelly in terms of social welfare and even achieve full efficiency. In our proofs, we exploit the particular structure of worst-case games and equilibria, which also allows us to design (nearly) optimal two-player mechanisms by solving simple differential equations.},

  abstract     = {Reflected Brownian motion (RBM) in a convex polyhedral cone arises in a variety of applications ranging from the theory of stochastic networks to mathematical finance, and under general stability conditions, it has a unique stationary distribution. In such applications, to implement a stochastic optimization algorithm or quantify robustness of a model, it is useful to characterize the dependence of stationary performance measures on model parameters. In this paper, we characterize parametric sensitivities of the stationary distribution of an RBM in a simple convex polyhedral cone, that is, sensitivities to perturbations of the parameters that define the RBM—namely the covariance matrix, drift vector, and directions of reflection along the boundary of the polyhedral cone. In order to characterize these sensitivities, we study the long-time behavior of the joint process consisting of an RBM along with its so-called derivative process, which characterizes pathwise derivatives of RBMs on finite time intervals. We show that the joint process is positive recurrent and has a unique stationary distribution and that parametric sensitivities of the stationary distribution of an RBM can be expressed in terms of the stationary distribution of the joint process. This can be thought of as establishing an interchange of the differential operator and the limit in time. The analysis of ergodicity of the joint process is significantly more complicated than that of the RBM because of its degeneracy and the fact that the derivative process exhibits jumps that are modulated by the RBM. The proofs of our results rely on path properties of coupled RBMs and contraction properties related to the geometry of the polyhedral cone and directions of reflection along the boundary. Our results are potentially useful for developing efficient numerical algorithms for computing sensitivities of functionals of stationary RBMs.},

The aggregator observes the experts’ forecasts only. At the end of each period, the realized state is observed by the aggregator. We focus on the question of whether the aggregator can learn to optimally aggregate the forecasts of the experts, where the optimal aggregation is the Bayesian aggregation that takes into account all the information in the system. We consider the class of partial evidence information structures, where each expert is exposed to a different subset of conditionally independent signals.

  abstract     = {In the ordinal matroid secretary problem (MSP), candidates do not reveal numerical weights, but the decision maker can still discern if a candidate is better than another. An algorithm α is probability-competitive if every element from the optimum appears with probability 1 / α in the output. This measure is stronger than the standard utility competitiveness. Our main result is the introduction of a technique based on forbidden sets to design algorithms with strong probability-competitive ratios on many matroid classes. We improve upon the guarantees for almost every matroid class considered in the MSP literature. In particular, we achieve probability-competitive ratios of 4 for graphic matroids and of 3 3 ≈ 5.19 for laminar matroids. Additionally, we modify Kleinberg’s 1 + O ( 1 / ρ ) utility-competitive algorithm for uniform matroids of rank ρ in order to obtain a 1 + O ( log ρ / ρ ) probability-competitive algorithm. We also contribute algorithms for the ordinal MSP on arbitrary matroids.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the performance of affine policies for a two-stage, adjustable, robust optimization problem with a fixed recourse and an uncertain right-hand side belonging to a budgeted uncertainty set. This is an important class of uncertainty sets, widely used in practice, in which we can specify a budget on the adversarial deviations of the uncertain parameters from the nominal values to adjust the level of conservatism. The two-stage adjustable robust optimization problem is hard to approximate within a factor better than Ω ( log n log log n ) even for budget of uncertainty sets in which n is the number of decision variables. Affine policies, in which the second-stage decisions are constrained to be an affine function of the uncertain parameters provide a tractable approximation for the problem and have been observed to exhibit good empirical performance. We show that affine policies give an O ( log n log log n ) -approximation for the two-stage, adjustable, robust problem with fixed nonnegative recourse for budgeted uncertainty sets. This matches the hardness of approximation, and therefore, surprisingly, affine policies provide an optimal approximation for the problem (up to a constant factor). We also show strong theoretical performance bounds for affine policy for a significantly more general class of intersection of budgeted sets, including disjoint constrained budgeted sets, permutation invariant sets, and general intersection of budgeted sets. Our analysis relies on showing the existence of a near-optimal, feasible affine policy that satisfies certain nice structural properties. Based on these structural properties, we also present an alternate algorithm to compute a near-optimal affine solution that is significantly faster than computing the optimal affine policy by solving a large linear program.},

Unsatisfied demand is lost and unobserved, and the only available information for decision making is the observed sales data (also known as censored demand). Conventional approaches, such as stochastic approximation, online convex optimization, and continuum-armed bandit algorithms, cannot be employed, because neither the realized values of the profit function nor its derivatives are known. A major challenge of this problem lies in that the estimated profit function constructed from observed sales data is multimodal in price. We develop a nonparametric spline approximation–based learning algorithm. The algorithm separates the planning horizon into a disjoint exploration phase and an exploitation phase. During the exploration phase, a spline approximation of the demand-price function is constructed based on sales data, and then the corresponding surrogate optimization problem is solved on a sparse grid to obtain a pair of recommended price and target inventory level. During the exploitation phase, the algorithm implements the recommended strategies. We establish a (nearly) square-root regret rate, which (almost) matches the theoretical lower bound.},

Multiway cut admits a well-known simplex embedding relaxation, where rounding this embedding is equivalent to partitioning the simplex. Current best-known solutions to the problem are comprised of a mix of several different ingredients, resulting in intricate algorithms. Moreover, the best of these algorithms is too complex to fully analyze analytically, and a computer was partly used in verifying its approximation factor. We propose a new approach to simplex partitioning and the multiway cut problem based on general transformations of the simplex that allow dependencies between the different variables. Our approach admits much simpler algorithms and, in addition, yields an approximation guarantee for the multiway cut problem that (roughly) matches the current best computer-verified approximation factor.},

  abstract     = {We study ergodic properties of Markovian multiclass many-server queues that are uniform over scheduling policies and the size of the system. The system is heavily loaded in the Halfin–Whitt regime, and the scheduling policies are work conserving and preemptive. We provide a unified approach via a Lyapunov function method that establishes Foster–Lyapunov equations for both the limiting diffusion and the prelimit diffusion-scaled queuing processes simultaneously. We first study the limiting controlled diffusion and show that if the spare capacity (safety staffing) parameter is positive, the diffusion is exponentially ergodic uniformly over all stationary Markov controls, and the invariant probability measures have uniform exponential tails. This result is sharp because when there is no abandonment and the spare capacity parameter is negative, the controlled diffusion is transient under any Markov control. In addition, we show that if all the abandonment rates are positive, the invariant probability measures have sub-Gaussian tails regardless whether the spare capacity parameter is positive or negative. Using these results, we proceed to establish the corresponding ergodic properties for the diffusion-scaled queuing processes. In addition to providing a simpler proof of previous results in Gamarnik and Stolyar [Gamarnik D, Stolyar AL (2012) Multiclass multiserver queueing system in the Halfin-Whitt heavy traffic regime: asymptotics of the stationary distribution. Queueing Systems 71(1–2):25–51], we extend these results to multiclass models with renewal arrival processes, albeit under the assumption that the mean residual life functions are bounded. For the Markovian model with Poisson arrivals, we obtain stronger results and show that the convergence to the stationary distribution is at an exponential rate uniformly over all work-conserving stationary Markov scheduling policies.},

Each job requests simultaneous access to a random number of files in the database and will lock them for a random period of time. Alternatively, one can think of a queueing system where jobs are split into several fragments that are then randomly routed to specific servers in the network to be served in a synchronized fashion. We assume that the system operates on a first-come, first-served basis. The synchronization and service discipline create blocking and idleness among the servers, which leads to a strict stability condition compared with other distributed queueing models. We analyze the stationary waiting time distribution of jobs under a many-server limit and provide exact tail asymptotics. These asymptotics generalize the celebrated Cramér–Lundberg approximation for the single-server queue.},

The PLIAG method includes many existing algorithms in the literature as special cases, such as the proximal gradient method, the Bregman proximal gradient method (also called the NoLips algorithm), the incremental aggregated gradient method, the incremental aggregated proximal method, and the proximal incremental aggregated gradient method. It also includes some novel interesting iteration schemes. First, we show that the PLIAG method is globally sublinearly convergent without requiring a growth condition, which extends the sublinear convergence result for the proximal gradient algorithm to incremental aggregated-type first-order methods. Then, by embedding a so-called Bregman distance growth condition into a descent-type lemma to construct a special Lyapunov function, we show that the PLIAG method is globally linearly convergent in terms of both function values and Bregman distances to the optimal solution set, provided that the step size is not greater than some positive constant. The convergence results derived in this paper are all established beyond the standard assumptions in the literature (i.e., without requiring the strong convexity and the Lipschitz gradient continuity of the smooth part of the objective). When specialized to many existing algorithms, our results recover or supplement their convergence results under strictly weaker conditions.},

In this way, we obtain separable cost-sharing protocols in matroid games, single-source connection games, and connection games on n -series-parallel graphs.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the value of switching actions in the Prediction From Experts problem (PFE) and Adversarial Multiarmed Bandits problem (MAB). First, we revisit the well-studied and practically motivated setting of PFE with switching costs. Many algorithms achieve the minimax optimal order for both regret and switches in expectation ; however, high probability guarantees are an open problem. We present the first algorithms that achieve this optimal order for both quantities with high probability. This also implies the first high probability guarantees for several other problems, and, in particular, is efficiently adaptable to online combinatorial optimization with limited switching. Next, to investigate the value of switching actions more granularly, we introduce the switching budget setting, which limits algorithms to a fixed number of (costless) switches. Using this result and several reductions, we unify previous work and completely characterize the complexity of this switching budget setting up to small polylogarithmic factors: for both PFE and MAB, for all switching budgets, and for both expectation and high probability guarantees. Interestingly, as the switching budget decreases, the minimax regret rate admits a phase transition for PFE but not for MAB. These results recover and generalize the known minimax rates for the (arbitrary) switching cost setting.},

  abstract     = {We revisit the problem of online linear optimization in the case where the set of feasible actions is accessible through an approximated linear optimization oracle with a factor α multiplicative approximation guarantee. This setting in particular is interesting because it captures natural online extensions of well-studied offline linear optimization problems that are NP-hard yet admit efficient approximation algorithms. The goal here is to minimize the α -regret , which is the natural extension to this setting of the standard regret in online learning . We present new algorithms with significantly improved oracle complexity for both the full-information and bandit variants of the problem. Mainly, for both variants, we present α-regret bounds of O ( T − 1 / 3 ) , were T is the number of prediction rounds, using only O ( l o g T ) calls to the approximation oracle per iteration, on average. These are the first results to obtain both the average oracle complexity of O ( l o g T ) (or even polylogarithmic in T ) and α -regret bound O ( T − c ) for a constant c &gt; 0 for both variants.},

  abstract     = {We solve a family of fractional Riccati equations with constant (possibly complex) coefficients. These equations arise, for example, in fractional Heston stochastic volatility models, which have received great attention in the recent financial literature because of their ability to reproduce a rough volatility behavior. We first consider the case of a zero initial value corresponding to the characteristic function of the log-price. Then we investigate the case of a general starting value associated to a transform also involving the volatility process. The solution to the fractional Riccati equation takes the form of power series, whose convergence domain is typically finite. This naturally suggests a hybrid numerical algorithm to explicitly obtain the solution also beyond the convergence domain of the power series. Numerical tests show that the hybrid algorithm is extremely fast and stable. When applied to option pricing, our method largely outperforms the only available alternative, based on the Adams method.},

The central solution concepts for these games are the discounted values and the value, which represent what playing the game is worth to the players for different levels of impatience. In the present manuscript, we provide algorithms for computing exact expressions for the discounted values and for the value, which are polynomial in the number of pure stationary strategies of the players.

  abstract     = {We consider a load-balancing problem for a network of parallel queues in which information on the state of the queues is subject to a delay. In this setting, adopting a routing policy that performs well when applied to the current state of the queues can perform quite poorly when applied to the delayed state of the queues. Viewing this as a problem of control under partial observations, we propose using an estimate of the current queue lengths as the input to the join-the-shortest-queue policy. For a general class of estimation schemes, under heavy traffic conditions, we prove convergence of the diffusion-scaled process to a solution of a so-called diffusion model, in which an important step toward this goal establishes that the estimated queue lengths undergo state-space collapse. In some cases, our diffusion model is given by a novel stochastic delay equation with reflection, in which the Skorokhod boundary term appears with delay. We illustrate our results with examples of natural estimation schemes, discuss their implementability, and compare their relative performance using simulations.},

Following most approaches, we model the uncertainty sets by balls, polyhedra, or spectrahedra, more generally, by ellipsoids or order intervals intersected with subcones of the copositive matrix cone. We show that the copositive relaxation gap of the RStQP equals the minimax gap under some mild assumptions on the curvature of the aforementioned uncertainty sets and present conditions under which the RStQP reduces to the standard quadratic optimization problem. These conditions also ensure that the copositive relaxation of an RStQP is exact. The theoretical findings are accompanied by the results of computational experiments for a specific application from the domain of graph clustering, more precisely, community detection in (social) networks. The results indicate that the cardinality of communities tend to increase for ellipsoidal uncertainty sets and to decrease for spectrahedral uncertainty sets.},

  abstract     = {Many algorithms that are originally designed without explicitly considering incentive properties are later combined with simple pricing rules and used as mechanisms. A key question is therefore to understand which algorithms, or, more generally, which algorithm design principles, when combined with simple payment rules such as pay your bid, yield mechanisms with a small price of anarchy. Our main result concerns mechanisms that are based on the relax-and-round paradigm. It shows that oblivious rounding schemes approximately preserve price of anarchy guarantees provable via smoothness. By virtue of our smoothness proofs, our price of anarchy bounds extend to Bayes–Nash equilibria and learning outcomes. In fact, they even apply out of equilibrium, requiring only that agents have no regret for deviations to half their value. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our main result by instantiating it for a wide range of optimization problems ranging from sparse packing integer programs, over single-source unsplittable flow problems and combinatorial auctions with fractionally subadditive valuations, to a maximization variant of the traveling salesman problem.},

  abstract     = {Competitive equilibrium from equal incomes (CEEI) is a classic solution to the problem of fair and efficient allocation of goods (Foley 1967, Varian 1974). Every agent receives an equal budget of artificial currency with which to purchase goods, and prices match demand and supply. However, a CEEI is not guaranteed to exist when the goods are indivisible even in the simple two-agent, single-item market. Yet it is easy to see that, once the two budgets are slightly perturbed (made generic ), a competitive equilibrium does exist. In this paper, we aim to extend this approach beyond the single-item case and study the existence of equilibria in markets with two agents and additive preferences over multiple items. We show that, for agents with equal budgets, making the budgets generic—by adding vanishingly small random perturbations—ensures the existence of equilibrium. We further consider agents with arbitrary nonequal budgets, representing non equal entitlements for goods. We show that competitive equilibrium guarantees a new notion of fairness among nonequal agents and that it exists in cases of interest (such as when the agents have identical preferences) if budgets are perturbed. Our results open opportunities for future research on generic equilibrium existence and fair treatment of nonequals.},
