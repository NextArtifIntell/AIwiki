  abstract     = {Reputation systems are used by nearly every digital marketplace, but designs vary and the effects of these designs are not well understood. We use a large-scale experiment on Airbnb to study the causal effects of one particular design choice—the timing with which feedback by one user about another is revealed on the platform. Feedback was hidden until both parties submitted a review in the treatment group and was revealed immediately after submission in the control group. The treatment stimulated more reviewing in total. This is due to users’ curiosity about what their counterparty wrote and/or the desire to have feedback visible to other users. We also show that the treatment reduced retaliation and reciprocation in feedback and led to lower ratings as a result. The effects of the policy on feedback did not translate into reduced adverse selection on the platform.},

Spanning a time period from 2010 to 2016, we combine a unique data set on TV advertising content and quantities with individual-level data containing information on purchases, consideration and awareness sets, demographic variables, and perceived prices. Our results reveal that advertising quantity significantly increases consumer (unaided and aided) awareness but has no effect on conditional consideration and conditional purchase. However, when investigating the relationship between different types of advertising content and purchase stages, we find a more nuanced set of results: advertising only containing noninformational content increases unaided awareness, whereas advertising only containing informational content increases aided awareness. Advertising with both informational and noninformational content affects shoppers’ but not nonshoppers’ awareness and the awareness of other groups of involved consumers.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been significant interest in understanding users’ online content consumption patterns. But the unstructured, high-dimensional, and dynamic nature of such data makes extracting valuable insights challenging. Here we propose a model that combines the simplicity of matrix factorization with the flexibility of neural networks to efficiently extract nonlinear patterns from massive text data collections relevant to consumers’ online consumption patterns. Our model decomposes a user’s content consumption journey into nonlinear user and content factors that are used to model their dynamic interests. This natural decomposition allows us to summarize each user’s content consumption journey with a dynamic probabilistic weighting over a set of underlying content attributes. The model is fast to estimate, easy to interpret, and can harness external data sources as an empirical prior. These advantages make our method well suited to the challenges posed by modern data sets used by digital marketers. We use our model to understand the dynamic news consumption interests of Boston Globe readers over five years. Thorough qualitative studies, including a crowdsourced evaluation, highlight our model’s ability to accurately identify nuanced and coherent consumption patterns. These results are supported by our model’s superior and robust predictive performance over several competitive baseline methods.},

However, there is little empirical work documenting the costs and benefits of bargaining, primarily because of the lack of real-world bargaining data. We leverage rich, transaction-level bargaining data from a major online platform and supplement it with primary data to quantify the costs and benefits of bargaining for sellers, buyers, and the platform. We do this by building a structural model of buyer demand and seller pricing decisions while allowing for the existence of bargaining initiation cost, loss-of-face cost, and price discrimination. Using our results, we perform three policy simulations to quantify the importance of not distinguishing between no-bargain and failed-bargain transactions, ignoring the loss-of-face cost, and not allowing for bargaining. These simulations provide rich details on how the various costs of bargaining impact our understanding of buyer and seller behavior and transaction outcomes. Banning bargaining, in particular, benefits the buyer and the platform greatly but only has a modest benefit for sellers. Finally, we show that our results are robust to our assumptions and replicate in another product category.},

Selecting the best ones is a double challenge: evaluating so many ideas is a large undertaking, and the ideas in their raw form permit only noisy evaluations. In this paper, we demonstrate a further challenge to that large-scale evaluation of raw ideas. We show that verbosity raises the evaluation of ideas, that is, ideas expressed in more words are rated higher. This relationship is especially pronounced for ratings of creativity. Theory tells us that the effect of length on creativity is compounded because length cues both components of creativity—novelty and usefulness. We demonstrate how effort in reading (disfluency) and perceptions of complexity work together to explain the relationship between length and creativity. Our findings provide simple but important new directives for improving the use of crowdsourcing in the practice and study of innovation: either standardize the length of the ideas or control for length in their evaluation. Overall, we urge care with using measures of novelty or creativity when the idea descriptions vary in length.},

In this study, we examine boy-girl gender discrimination in China as manifested in parents’ purchase decisions on behalf of their children across different markets. Our study in itself is significant, because it is the first large-scale empirical work to clearly verify the phenomenon of boy-girl discrimination, taking advantage of e-commerce marketing data. Specifically, we compare the clothing expenditures on boys versus girls using a rich, household-specific data set obtained from two online retailers. We find that the patterns of gender inequality vary systematically across different geographic markets, as the relative expenditure difference on boys versus on girls is bigger in less developed areas as compared with metropolitan areas, and this relative expenditure difference is closely tied with socioeconomic conditions, education levels, and birth rates of a district. Managerial and social implications are discussed.},

Using Twitter data on soccer players from the National Women’s Soccer League, we estimate a demand model where users decide how to allocate their attention among players, based on their content posted on social media and their performance on the soccer field. We consider the amount of tweets mentioning a player’s account as a measure for the level of attention captured by the player. On the supply side, players decide the amount of social media content posted on the platform. We show that the attention substitution between players depends on their posting activity and soccer performance but also on personal characteristics, such as physical attractiveness and team affiliation. Our analysis suggests that the competitive pressure to capture user attention is responsible for about one out of three tweets posted by players. This additional content benefits the social network, increasing by 7\% the users’ activity on the platform. We also quantify the effect on user activity of a revenue-sharing model in which the platform rewards players for posting tweets.},

  abstract     = {We measure the cross-category spillover effects of a retailer changing its assortment at the extensive margin (by dropping an entire category from its portfolio) on the outcomes for its rivals in the industry. By leveraging the quasi-experimental nature of the exit by a national pharmacy chain, hereafter referred to as the exiting chain (EC), from the tobacco category, we measure the effects of this event on the revenue generated by nontobacco products at rival pharmacy chains. We show, using Nielsen store-level aggregate (Retail Measurement Services) data, that for each 1\% increase of cigarette sales in non-EC stores that are located near an “exiting” EC store relative to those non-EC stores that are not, the revenue generated by nontobacco products grows by 0.04\%. Next, using Nielsen household panel data (Homescan), we try to uncover the mechanism underlying this spillover by looking at how the behavior of smokers and nonsmokers at EC stores is affected by the decision. We find that the frequency of trips to the exiting stores that included some tobacco product was negatively affected, suggesting that tobacco was one of the main drivers of store patronage for those trips. For nonsmokers, we find that they react to EC’s action by increasing the frequency of trips to the exiting chain. However, the gains from nonsmokers do not seem to outweigh losses caused by smokers. To assess the generalizability of our results, we analyze the impact of a set of tobacco bans imposed by municipalities in Massachusetts and find cross-category loss patterns for drugstores in those areas that are similar to the gains to rival stores from EC’s exit.},

To explain these findings, we use a survey to show that female reviewers, when writing a negative review, are more likely to perceive management responses as a source of conflict. To understand whether these concerns are well founded, we use Tripadvisor data to provide evidence of gender bias in the way hotel managers address reviewers writing negative reviews. We show that responses to self-identified female reviewers are more likely to be contentious, that is, confrontational, aggressive, or trying to discredit the reviewer. Finally, to confirm that gender bias directly affects reviewing behavior, we show that the probability that a negative review comes from a self-identified female reviewer is lower for hotels that write more contentious responses. Although the introduction of management responses created a new channel of communication between firms and consumers, our findings show that such a channel can be misused to discriminate and can lead to unexpected consequences such as a reduction of reviews by those users more likely to be discriminated against.},

Our empirical strategy exploits Airbnb’s introduction of the algorithm and its voluntary adoption by hosts as a quasinatural experiment. Among those who adopted the algorithm, the average nightly rate decreased by 5.7\%, but average daily revenue increased by 8.6\%. Before Airbnb introduced the algorithm, White hosts earned $12.16 more in daily revenue than Black hosts, controlling for observed characteristics of the hosts, properties, and locations. Conditional on its adoption, the revenue gap between White and Black hosts decreased by 71.3\%. However, Black hosts were significantly less likely than White hosts to adopt the algorithm, so at the population level, the revenue gap increased after the introduction of the algorithm. We show that the algorithm’s price recommendations are not affected by the host’s race—but we argue that the algorithm’s race blindness may lead to pricing that is suboptimal and more so for Black hosts than for White hosts. We also show that the algorithm’s effectiveness at mitigating the Airbnb revenue gap is limited by the low rate of algorithm adoption among Black hosts.

But, delivering these benefits to consumers took at least four years to materialize and varied with the number of screens in a theater. During the early years of theater digitization, product variety declined in larger theaters. Yet, when digital movies became widely available, product variety increased. Once digital movies were broadly available, we show that theaters created increased product variety during less popular time slots and offered more showings of consumers’ favorite movies during peak demand on weekend evenings.

We propose a new model that creates an efficient dimension reduction through the idea of purchase motivations. We only require customer-level purchase history data, which is ubiquitous in modern retailing. The model handles large-scale data and even works in settings with shopping trips consisting of few purchases. Essential features of our model are that it accounts for the product, customer, and time dimensions present in purchase history data; relates the relevance of motivations to customer- and shopping-trip characteristics; captures interdependencies between motivations; and achieves superior predictive performance. Estimation results from this comprehensive model provide deep insights into purchase behavior. Such insights can be used by managers to create more intuitive, better informed, and more effective marketing actions. As scalability of the model is essential for practical applicability, we develop a fast, custom-made inference algorithm based on variational inference. We illustrate the model using purchase history data from a Fortune 500 retailer involving more than 4,000 unique products.},

We show that the bias in heterogeneity estimates leads to incorrect inference about price elasticities and seller markups and has important consequences for personalized pricing.},

  abstract     = {The mere fact that consumers are targeted by advertisements can affect their inference about the expected utility of a product. We build a micromodel where multiple firms compete through targeted advertising. Consumers make inferences from targeted advertising about their potential match values for the product category, as well as the advertising firm’s unobserved quality. We show that in equilibrium, upon being targeted by a firm, consumers make more positive inferences about the product category and the firm’s quality. With such improved beliefs, a targeted consumer is more likely to engage in a costly search throughout the category. We find that the increase in consumer search creates an advertising spillover beyond the level of the mere awareness effects of advertising and that firms’ equilibrium level of targeted advertising can be nonmonotonic in targeting accuracy. Additionally, we show that sometimes it can be optimal for firms to relinquish customer data and instead engage in nontargeted advertising. The results provide insights into the tradeoffs between advertising reach and targeting accuracy.},

The traffic stealing is primarily done by a competitor in the top paid link (6\%–9\% of traffic) who benefits from the presence of other competitors below. However, the probability of an immediate conversion on these “stolen” clicks is low, with around 20\%–47\% of consumers returning to Bing in less than 30 seconds after the click (“quick back”) compared with 7\% for consumers clicking on the focal brand’s link. More relevant competitors get more clicks with a lower quick-back probability.

  abstract     = {In 1956, a group of trade associations representing publishers and independent advertising agencies signed a consent decree aimed at ending a set of trade practices that for half a century effectively precluded advertisers from owning and operating in-house agencies. Since then, large firms have internalized more and more of the services formerly performed by external agencies, perhaps as many as half. We use this phenomenon to test a theory of the firm, thereby simultaneously offering an explanation for it. The theory suggests that firms should internalize activities for which their competitive position implies (1) that it is more important for human capital to be firm specific as opposed to function specific and (2) that frequent modifications are desirable. It also predicts (3) that these two effects reinforce each other. This is the first paper to report on a test of the specialization hypothesis, and we find that it is robustly significant in a cross-sectional data set covering nine different agency activities in 79 firms. In addition to the cross-sectional test, we informally present some time-series data suggesting that both specialization and frequency have grown over time along with the level of internalization.},

  abstract     = {As live streaming of events gains traction, pay what you want (PWYW) pricing strategies are emerging as critical monetization tools. We assess the viability of PWYW by examining the relationship between popularity (i.e., audience size) of a live streaming event and the revenue it generates under a PWYW scheme. On the one hand, increasing audience size may enhance voluntary payment/tips if social image concerns are important because larger audiences amplify the utility pertaining to social image. On the other hand, increasing audience size may reduce tips if gaining the broadcaster’s reciprocal acts motivates tipping because larger audiences are associated with fiercer competition for reciprocity. To examine these trade-offs in the relationship between audience size and revenue under PWYW, we manipulate audience size by exogenously adding synthetic viewers in live streaming shows on a platform in China. The results reveal a mostly positive relationship between audience size and average tip per viewer, which suggests that social image concerns dominate seeking reciprocity. In support of herding, adding synthetic viewers also increases the number of real viewers. Social image concerns and herding together explain the finding that adding one additional viewer improves the tipping revenue per minute by approximately 0.01 yuan (1\% of the mean level). Further, famous female broadcasters who use recognition-related words frequently during the event benefit the most from an increase in audience size. Overall, the results indicate that revenues under PWYW do not scale linearly and support the relevance of social image concerns in driving individual payment decisions under PWYW.},

When faced with higher minimum wages, firms might reduce the number of employees, resulting in poorer consumer service. Alternatively, higher-paid workers might be more motivated to improve consumer service. Using a combination of human annotation and several transformer models, we estimate the incidence of discussion of several service quality attributes (and their valence) in a textual data set of 97,242 online reviews of 1,752 restaurants posted over two years. We exploit a natural experiment in the County of Santa Clara, California, wherein only the city of San Jose legislated a 25\% minimum wage increase in 2013. By comparing restaurant reviews in San Jose with those of synthetic controls, we find an improvement in the perceived service quality of San Jose restaurants. Specifically, we find reduced negative discussion of the courtesy and friendliness of workers. This decrease is present in independent restaurants and not in chains. This finding appears to be consistent with agency theory–based predictions of greater incentives to improve service in independent restaurants. We discuss alternative mechanisms for our results. We also discuss implications for consumers, restaurants, and policy makers.},

We specify precise conditions under which this approach is valid and derive asymptotic properties of the estimators. We demonstrate in Monte Carlo simulations that directly estimating reserve prices is faster and, outside of independent private values settings, more accurate than fully estimating the distribution of valuations. We apply the approach to e-commerce auction data for used smartphones from eBay, where we examine empirically the benefit of the optimal reserve and the size of the data set required in practice to achieve that benefit. This simple approach to estimating reserves may be particularly useful for auction design in Big Data settings, where traditional empirical auctions methods may be costly to implement, whereas the approach we discuss is immediately scalable.},

We propose a new estimator for the Random-Coefficients Logit demand system for purchase datasets with zero-valued market shares. The identification of the demand parameters is based on a pairwise-differencing approach that constructs moment conditions based on differences in demand between pairs of products. The corresponding estimator corrects nonparametrically for the potential selection of the incidence of zeros on unobserved aspects of demand. The estimator also corrects for the potential endogeneity of marketing variables both in demand and in the selection propensities. Monte Carlo simulations show that our proposed estimator provides reliable small-sample inference both with and without selection-on-unobservables. In an empirical case study, the proposed estimator not only generates different demand estimates than approaches that ignore selection in the incidence of zero shares, it also generates better out-of-sample fit of observed retail contribution margins.},

Using a difference-in-differences modeling approach, we compare the changes in average writer behavior before and after the event across two groups of writers: (1) writers who have profit-sharing contracts with the platform and (2) those who do not.

Past research has studied the effect of aggregate measures of reviews (such as average product rating and number of reviews) on consumer behavior. In this study, we investigate how individual reviews displayed on a product web page affect consumers’ purchase likelihood. Identifying this effect is challenging because retailers are free to select which reviews to display on the product page and in what order, making the display of reviews in particular positions potentially endogenous. We address this challenge by utilizing an empirical context in which the retailer displays reviews by recency and exploit the variation in review positions generated as newer reviews are added on top of older ones. We find that individual reviews have a strong effect on consumer purchase decisions even after accounting for a product’s average rating. These effects are particularly pronounced when individual reviews help consumers resolve uncertainty about the product or contrast with the aggregate information that is instantly available on the product page.},

Leveraging the Federal Trade Commission’s investigation of four brands that resulted in removal of the claim from product packages, we study the impact such removal had on sales. We find a decline in demand following the removal of the “Made in USA” claim. Second, to ensure complete exogenous variation, we conduct a field experiment on eBay, on which we run more than 900 auctions, varying only whether a product contains this country-of-origin information. We find that, although products with the “Made in USA” claim have a slightly higher chance of drawing a zero valuation, such products obtain a 44\% higher willingness-to-pay conditional on a positive valuation. However, this increased valuation is insufficient to economically justify firm relocation efforts. Auction transaction prices, on the other hand, are significantly and 28\% higher with the claim, suggesting resellers and auctioneers have incentives to display the claim. The experiments alongside observational data allow us to rationalize firms’ incentives in making deceptive country-of-origin claims.},

Concurrently, they often offer low-price guarantees (LPGs) to customers who purchase through their direct channel; that is, should consumers find a lower price from distribution partners, manufacturers promise to match or even beat the lower price. Many manufacturers, such as Apple, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and Goodyear, use price-matching guarantees (PMGs) against retailers. In the online travel industry, price-beating guarantees (PBGs) are prevalent among travel suppliers. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic model to investigate the manufacturer’s optimal choice of LPG policies and its implications for the manufacturer, retailer, and channel. Our analysis demonstrates that no LPG, PMG, and PBG can each emerge in equilibrium depending on consumer characteristics. Although LPGs can improve channel profit, they may benefit the manufacturer at the expense of the retailer. As such, LPGs can intensify vertical channel conflict. However, both horizontal channel conflict and vertical channel conflict are present in dual channels. LPGs are not merely price discrimination devices; they mitigate horizontal channel conflict. The benefit of LPGs in reducing horizontal channel conflict outweighs the loss from intensified vertical channel conflict under a wide range of conditions. Therefore, LPGs serve as channel coordination devices.},

  abstract     = {Customer base analysis of noncontractual businesses builds on modeling purchases and latent attrition. With the Pareto/NBD model, this has become a straightforward exercise. However, this simplicity comes at a price. Customer-level predictions often lack precision. This issue can be addressed by acknowledging the importance of contextual factors for customer behavior. Considering contextual factors might contribute in two ways: (1) by increasing predictive accuracy and (2) by identifying the impact of these determinants on the purchase and attrition process. However, there is no generalization of the Pareto/NBD model that incorporates time-varying contextual factors. Preserving a closed-form maximum likelihood solution, this study proposes an extension that facilitates modeling time-invariant and time-varying contextual factors in continuous noncontractual settings. These contextual factors can influence the purchase process, the attrition process, or both. The authors further illustrate how to control for endogenous contextual factors.

  abstract     = {The lean start-up method (LSM) advocates an iterative and adaptive product development and testing approach to innovation. It recommends firms to build test products, use them to learn about consumer preferences, and modify (or “pivot”) the product design accordingly. It is less straightforward to understand how effective LSM can be, however, not least because consumers’ responses to the test product are influenced by its quality, price, and design—that is, learning is endogenous to the features of the test product. This paper analyzes the build-test-learn cycle of LSM using an analytical model to understand its microfoundation and how best to implement it. We find that an optimal test product that maximizes learning should aim either to confirm a more likely product design or to rule out a less likely product design as being the most desired by consumers, have a vertical quality that is neither too high nor too low, and have a higher quality when aiming to confirm than to rule out. We also identify the product-market conditions for which the LSM is more effective. Conceptualizing the LSM via a formal model may help to improve its implementation in practice and to advance further academic research.},

We examine equilibrium outcomes when consumers can search among potential options and invest evaluation efforts to resolve product value uncertainty by endogenizing the information structure in the canonical model of sequential search with horizontal differentiation. We show that consumers’ joint decisions on search and evaluation interact in an asymmetric manner. That is, greater evaluation pushes up the search-terminating threshold, whereas a higher stopping threshold first increases and then decreases the incentive for evaluation. As a result, changes in the search/evaluation cost may exert unusual influences on equilibrium behaviors and payoffs. Both the impact of the search cost on optimal evaluation and that of the evaluation cost on expected number of searched products exhibit an inverted U pattern. Because of endogenous evaluation, the equilibrium price and profit can vary nonmonotonically with the search/evaluation cost. This implies that we may observe the coexistence of consumers searching fewer products and firms charging lower prices as sampling becomes more costly. Moreover, consumers can benefit from more costly sampling. We discuss how these findings can shed light on strategic design of shopping environment, user acquisition/retention, and empirical research.},

  abstract     = {A consumer searching for information on a product may be indicative that the consumer has some interest in that product but is still undecided about whether to purchase it. Some of this consumer search for information is not observable to firms, but some may be observable. Once a firm observes a consumer searching for information on its product, the firm may then want to try to provide further information about the product to that consumer, a phenomenon that has been known in electronic commerce as retargeting. Firms may not observe all activities by a consumer in searching for information, may not be able to observe the information gained by consumers, and may not be able to observe whether a consumer stopped searching for information. A consumer could stop searching either because he received information of poor fit with the product, because he bought the product (which may be unobservable to the firm), or because he exogenously lost interest in the product. This paper presents a dynamic model with these features characterizing the optimal advertising retargeting strategy by the firm. We find that a forward-looking firm can advertise more or less than a myopic firm to gain more information about whether the consumer is searching for information, advertising more if the effect of advertising is relatively high. We characterize how the optimal advertising retargeting strategy is affected by the ability of the firm to observe when the consumer purchases the product, when the firm is better able to observe the consumer search behavior, and by the informativeness of the signal received by the consumer. We find that better tracking of consumer search behavior could be beneficial for consumers, because it may reduce the length of time when a consumer receives retargeting, but that it also enlarges the region of firm’s beliefs where retargeting is optimal. Finally, we also find that the value of retargeting is highest for an intermediate value of the likelihood of the consumer receiving an informative signal and that retargeting may allow the firm to charge higher prices if consumers are forward-looking.},

However, existing data fusion approaches do not correct for selection bias in data sources that may not be representative and either do not scale to large populations or are statistically inefficient. We propose an aggregate-disaggregate data fusion method that corrects for selection bias and is both computationally scalable and statistically efficient. We apply the method to estimate a model of customer acquisition and churn at subscription-based firms. We bring the model to life using a large credit card panel and public data from Spotify, the music streaming service. This application and supporting simulations show that incorporating the granular data through our data fusion method enhances identification and offers richer insights than extant approaches. We find, for example, that previously churned customers remain with Spotify longer than newly adopted subscribers do, implying a more sanguine view of Spotify’s future retention profile than previous approaches that do not use multiple data sources.},

  abstract     = {This paper uncovers the striking power of a product’s first consumer review. Our analytical model suggests that two key metrics of online consumer reviews, valence and volume, are not independent, but instead evolve interdependently. This interdependence forms a mechanism to transfer a (dis)advantage from a product’s first review to both a long-lasting (dis)advantage in future word-of-mouth (WOM) valence and an increasing (dis)advantage in future WOM volume. As a result, a single consumer review can significantly influence the fate of a given product. These theoretical predictions, although seemingly unlikely, are supported by our empirical investigations. For example, more than 30\% of vacuum cleaner models offered by both Amazon.com and BestBuy.com receive first reviews of opposite valence on the two platforms. Those with a negative first review subsequently suffer a loss in both valence and volume vis-à-vis their counterparts with a positive first review, even after 36 months. More strikingly, the first-review effect on WOM volume increases over time. Our findings reveal a crucial weakness in the user-generated information mechanism. As a consumption-based information source, it creates an information-availability bias such that when a product receives a negative first review, it not only suffers low initial sales, but also loses the opportunity to correct the possible negative bias via subsequent reviews. These findings have substantial implications for online sellers, e-commerce platform providers, and consumers.},

We find that the program increases customer value by almost 30\% over a five-year horizon, which is considerably larger than has been previously found for non-tiered loyalty programs. Most of the impact of the loyalty program comes through attrition: we show that the program’s reduction in attrition accounts for more than 80\% of the program’s total lift, whereas increased frequency accounts for less than 20\% of the program’s lift. The program’s lift is highest for least and most frequent automatic members, who experience reductions in attrition rates after joining the program.

Thus, media platforms adopt divergent strategies depending on how they allocate the limited space or bandwidth between content and advertising. In this paper, we examine media platforms’ content provision strategies and their implications for the profits of media platforms as well as content suppliers, taking into account the cross-side effects of a multisided media market and the nature of competition in the content supplier market. To facilitate the analysis, we propose a model where media platforms interact with three sides: content suppliers, consumers, and advertisers. First, our analysis of a perfectly competitive content market shows that though consumers’ desire for content raises the willingness to pay, it can hurt platforms’ profits. Second, counter to our intuition, platforms’ profits can increase with the cost of procuring content. Third, advertisers’ desire for consumers reduces a monopoly content supplier’s profits under a paid-content-with-ads strategy. Fourth, a monopoly content supplier cannot extract all the profits from competing platforms. Furthermore, competing content suppliers may even charge higher prices than a monopoly content supplier. Finally, we highlight how the nature of competition in the content market shapes platforms’ choice of a no-ad strategy.},

We address this question by using Netflix’s unexpected announcement of a global market expansion in January 2016 and the subsequent block by the primary telecommunications firm in Indonesia as an exogenous shock to the supply of OTT services in that country. Using synthetic control methods, we compare the change in piracy search between Indonesia and 40 Asian countries where Netflix simultaneously entered and remained available. Netflix’s failure to launch in Indonesia leads to a 19.7\% increase in search for pirated movies and TV shows in Indonesia, relative to the other countries, suggesting a net substitution of piracy for OTT services. Comparison of treatment effects between exclusive and nonexclusive content shows that the treatment effect is driven by both a combination of an expansion of the market for piracy and a substitution between piracy and OTT services. We also find that the treatment effect is stronger for less dialogue-oriented content, which is consistent with the greater appeal of dialogue-light content to non–English-speaking consumers.},

Increases could be at competitors’ expense, coming from consumers with relatively weak brand preferences. However, increased sales from brand-loyal consumers could well cannibalize future sales of the promoted brand. An unintended consequence of promotions is that loyal consumers otherwise willing to pay high prices may strategically stockpile at low prices. What is its impact on firms’ profits? Who benefits from stockpiling? How should firms adapt their pricing to accommodate consumer stockpiling? For answers, we analyze an infinite horizon dynamic model of competition and derive the Markov perfect equilibrium pricing strategies that yield several managerial insights. We find strategic stockpiling does not reduce firms’ long-run profits when managers adopt pricing strategies we identify. Turning to strategies, stockpiling causes firms to move away from frequently promoting below the stockpiling threshold, but it leads to mass points at reservation price and stockpiling threshold. Stockpiling is beneficial to consumers who stockpile but hurts those that do not stockpile, whereas switchers remain largely unaffected. State-dependent pricing as a result of stockpiling leads to positive intertemporal price correlation, implying, counterintuitively, that in equilibrium, deep promotions should be followed by deep promotions.},

Although these ads have excellent user-tracking properties, they have raised concerns among privacy advocates. This has resulted in an ongoing debate on the value of different types of targeting information, the incentives of ad networks to engage in behavioral targeting, and the role of regulation. To answer these questions, we propose a unified modeling framework that consists of two components—a machine learning framework for targeting and an analytical auction model for examining market outcomes under counterfactual targeting regimes. We apply our framework to large-scale data from the leading in-app ad network of an Asian country. We find that an efficient targeting policy based on our machine learning framework improves the average click-through rate by 66.80\% over the current system. These gains mainly stem from behavioral information compared with contextual information. Theoretical and empirical counterfactuals show that although total surplus grows with more granular targeting, the ad network’s revenues are nonmonotonic; that is, the most efficient targeting does not maximize ad network revenues. Rather, it is maximized when the ad network does not allow advertisers to engage in behavioral targeting. Our results suggest that ad networks may have economic incentives to preserve users’ privacy without external regulation.},

To infer the relationship between search activities and preferences, we estimate a structural search model that characterizes the consumer search process. We propose an estimator similar to the Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane estimator to evaluate the likelihood function. The proposed estimator makes recursive draws from truncated distributions that arise because of the observed search and choice behaviors in an optimal sequential search model. The recovered preferences are used to improve retargeting strategies demonstrated through a series of counterfactuals. Results show a substantial heterogeneity in responses to retargeting among consumers who exhibited different search behaviors. By contrast, the heterogeneity among consumers based on other characteristics (e.g., age, gender) is moderate. We consider two counterfactual marketing strategies: sending out coupons redeemed upon purchasing and sending seller recommendations that reveal the offering of recommended sellers. We find that although both strategies help increase the conversion rate, seller recommendations are more effective than coupons, suggesting the importance of providing consumers with the sellers’ information for retargeting. We also show that a pricing mechanism such as an auction that makes the seller self-select to participate will improve the effectiveness of retargeting. Finally, online retail platforms can benefit both sellers and consumers by providing sellers with the information on consumers’ search behaviors.},

  abstract     = {A central challenge in estimating the causal effect of television (TV) advertising on demand is isolating quasirandom variation in advertising. Political advertising, which topped $14 billion in expenditures in 2016, has been proposed as a plausible source of such variation and thus, a candidate for an instrumental variable (IV). We provide a critical evaluation of how and where this instrument is valid and useful across categories. We characterize the conditions under which political cycles theoretically identify the causal effect of TV advertising on demand, highlight threats to the exclusion restriction and monotonicity condition, and suggest a specification to address the most serious concerns. We test the strength of the first-stage category by category for 274 product categories. For most categories, weak-instrument robust inference is recommended, as first-stage F statistics are less than 10 for 221 of 274 product categories in our benchmark specification. The largest first-stage F statistics occur in categories that typically advertise locally, such as automobile dealerships and restaurants. Failure to use the suggested specification leads to results that suggest violations of exclusion and monotonicity in a significant number of categories. Finally, we conduct a case study of the auto industry. Despite a very strong first stage, the IV estimate for this category is imprecise.},

  abstract     = {Political advertisements on television can affect viewers and may, consequently, influence the effectiveness of subsequent ads. Such ad-to-ad spillover effects—where one ad influences how viewers respond to a subsequent ad—have drawn concerns from nonpolitical advertisers, raising the question: how do political ads on television impact viewers’ response to subsequent ads? We empirically investigate this question using two outcomes of ad response: ad viewership and online conversations about ads. We use data on 849 national political television ads from the 2016 election and leverage a quasi-experimental design to delineate the effect that a political ad has on the subsequent ad. We show that, counterintuitively, political ads spur positive spillover effects. Specifically, ads that follow a political ad, compared with ads that follow a nonpolitical ad, experience an 89\% reduction in audience decline and thus air to larger audiences. Additionally, we find evidence that viewers engage in more positive online ad chatter about ads that air after political ads, with these ads experiencing a 3\% increase in positive chatter after the ad. Our investigation contributes to research on advertising that has yet to explore ad-to-ad spillover effects and, more broadly, provides insights into how political messages influence consumers.},

Typically, such access products are provided by third-party firms. More recently, however, some major platforms such as Google have themselves ventured into providing these access products. For example, Google Fiber provides access to YouTube. In this paper, we examine the effect of a platform’s entry into an access product market when the profits from the platform’s advertising business depend upon the quality of the access products. We develop a theoretical model to study this context and find that such an entry by the platform (i) can lead the platform to provide a higher quality access product than the third-party firms at a lower price, (ii) may, in contrast to the entry by a third-party firm, lead to a higher quality access product by both the platform as well as the firms, (iii) improves the platform’s profits because of increased advertising revenue and/or additional profits from the access product sales, and (iv) increases consumer surplus even though the platform becomes more dominant because of its entry into the access product market. All the results are driven by the positive association between the platform’s advertising profits and the quality of access products in the market.},

This paper sheds light on a foundational element of SEM, namely, consumers’ interactions with SERPs. Using eye-tracking equipment and a custom-built Google-like search engine, we conducted a laboratory experiment in which participants performed a series of online searches for a set of consumer goods while their eye movements and interactions with the results page (i.e., scrolling and clicks) were recorded. We provide model-free and model-based analyses of the inspection process, which encompasses a series of microdecisions, including what part of the page to look at, whether to scroll to bring additional results into view, what listings to explore and for how long, and ultimately which listing to click on. The results suggest that search goals (navigational, transactional, and informational), semantic context, spatial characteristics, viewing centrality, and prior inspection path are all predictive of both the flow of the inspection process and the ultimate listing choice. Managers should account for the significant variation in inspection scope across search tasks and SERP compositions when assessing a listing’s performance and deciding on a desirable position on the SERP.},

  abstract     = {From B2B sales to AI-powered ecommerce, one common pricing mechanism is “list price–discount”: The seller first publishes a (committed) list price, then during interactions with a buyer, offers (noncommitted) discounts off of the list price. Some B2B sellers never sell at their list prices. In such cases, what role does a list price play and how to choose the optimal list price and discounts? In this paper, I study a stochastic sales process in which a buyer and a seller discover their match value sequentially. The seller can adjust its price offers over time, and the buyer decides whether to accept each offer. I show that this discovery process creates a hold-up problem for the buyer that results in inefficient no-trades. The seller alleviates this problem by committing to an upper bound in the form of a list price. But in equilibrium players always reach agreement at a discount. I show that the seller prefers this mechanism to having no list price or committing not to discount. When the cost of selling is high, the seller’s ability to offer discount is necessary for trade to happen. There exists reverse price discrimination when buyers are heterogeneous, and list price can serve as a signaling device when sellers are heterogeneous. Extensions with alternative pricing or matching mechanisms are discussed.},

These algorithms are often misspecified, ignoring the effect of factors outside their control, for example, competitors’ prices. We show that the long-run prices depend on the informational value (or signal-to-noise ratio) of price experiments: if low, the long-run prices are consistent with the static Nash equilibrium of the corresponding full information setting. However, if high, the long-run prices are supra-competitive—the full information joint monopoly outcome is possible. We show that this occurs via a novel channel: competitors’ algorithms’ prices end up running correlated experiments. Therefore, sellers’ misspecified models overestimate the own price sensitivity, resulting in higher prices. We discuss the implications on competition policy.},

More and more practitioners are employing this strategy, given the increasing availability of technologies that enable coordination across advertising channels in real time. However, very little is known about the instant impact of TV advertising on the effectiveness of search advertising. We take advantage of a unique opportunity for causal estimation in this research area by leveraging large exogenous variation in TV advertising expenditure over a long period, while at the same time having access to granular consumer search data under relatively stable sponsored search advertising strategies. Utilizing this novel setup, we provide the first empirical evidence that TV-moment-based search advertising could be effective for optimizing sponsored search advertising for both TV-advertised brands and their competitors. We also document the mechanisms driving such cross-channel advertising effects. Specifically, TV advertising can change the quality of online search traffic (e.g., who searches, where they search, and how they search) in the moments following a TV ad, so that an average searcher responds differently to subsequent search results.},

Using a data set of Airbnb listings from the entire United States and an instrumental variables estimation strategy, we show that Airbnb has a positive impact on house prices and rents. This effect is stronger in zip codes with a lower share of owner-occupiers, consistent with non-owner-occupiers being more likely to reallocate their homes from the long- to the short-term rental market. At the median owner-occupancy rate zip code, we find that a 1\% increase in Airbnb listings leads to a 0.018\% increase in rents and a 0.026\% increase in house prices. Considering the median annual Airbnb growth in each zip code, these results translate to an annual increase of $9 in monthly rent and $1,800 in house prices for the median zip code in our data, which accounts for about one-fifth of actual rent growth and about one-seventh of actual price growth. Finally, we formally test whether the Airbnb effect is due to the reallocation of the housing supply. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that although the total supply of housing is not affected by the entry of Airbnb, Airbnb listings increase the supply of short-term rental units and decrease the supply of long-term rental units.},

Although couponing is popular in practice, limited research has examined the causal effects of coupons on visit, search, and purchase behaviors among heterogeneous customers. In this paper, we examine coupon effects using data from a randomized field experiment with an online retailer in which customers were divided into two heterogeneous customer segments (low value and high value) with two types of coupon discounts (base value and better value). We find couponing is effective in increasing revenue, primarily by attracting customers who purchase without coupon redemption, and the lift in revenue per customer is larger for the high-value segment. Using clickstream data of customer visit and search behavior, we find most of the revenue lift arises from a corresponding lift in the likelihood of visiting the website under couponing. Though the lift in visit likelihood is relatively homogeneous across customer segments under the base coupon, the high-value segment has a higher purchase conversion rate than the low-value segment, leading to an amplified revenue lift. We also find a deeper discount leads to higher redemption and purchase conversion for the high-value segment but does not change visit likelihood. Finally, most of the search behaviors are unchanged under couponing, suggesting the mix of customers brought in under couponing are similar to those who visit without receiving coupons.},

We develop a cost-effective solution. We argue that people do not automatically know their preferences, but can make an effort to acquire such knowledge when given sufficient incentives. The method we develop regulates people’s preference-learning incentives using a single parameter, realization probability , meaning the probability with which an individual has to actually purchase the product she says she is willing to buy. We derive a theoretical relationship between realization probability and elicited preferences. This allows us to forecast demand in real purchase settings using inexpensive choice data with small to moderate realization probabilities.

  abstract     = {In response to growing environmental concerns, governments have promoted products that are less harmful to the environment—green products—through various incentives. We empirically study the impact of a commonly used nonmonetary incentive—namely, the single-occupancy permission to high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes—on green and non‐green product demand in the U.S. automobile industry. The HOV incentive could increase unit sales of green vehicles by enhancing their functional value through time saving. On the other hand, the incentive may prove counterproductive if it reduces the symbolic value (i.e., signaling a proenvironmental image) consumers derive from green vehicles. Assessing the effectiveness of green-product incentives is challenging, given the endogenous nature of governments’ incentive provisions. To identify the effect of the HOV incentive on unit sales of green and non‐green vehicles, we take advantage of HOV-incentive changes in two states, and we employ a multitude of quasi‐experimental methods using a data set at the county–model–month level. Unlike previous studies that only examine the launch of the HOV incentive and find an insignificant association between incentive launch and green-vehicle demand, we concentrate on its termination. We find that the termination of the HOV incentive decreases unit sales of vehicles covered by the incentive by 14.4\%. We provide suggestive evidence that this significant negative effect of HOV-incentive termination is due to the elimination of the functional value the incentive provides: time saving. Specifically, we find that the negative effect is more pronounced in counties where consumers value time saving more (i.e., counties with a longer commute to work and higher income). Additionally, in line with prior literature, the launch of the HOV incentive is not found to have a significant effect on green-vehicle sales. Combined, our findings reveal that the effect of termination is not simply the opposite of that of launch, implying that governments’ green-product incentives could backfire.},

Although many academic works address the service provision of the downstream firm, empirically quantifying the impact has been challenging because the downstream firm’s service is often unobservable to the researcher. I propose a new empirical framework that incorporates the downstream firm’s unobserved endogenous service provision by modifying the standard demand model. I apply this empirical framework to proprietary data from a franchise network in the car radiator market to quantify the downstream firms’ (e.g., franchisees’) endogenous service. Counterfactuals under maximum resale price maintenance (RPM) policies show that the standard demand model ignoring the franchisees’ endogenous service reduction (i.e., service externality) results in more optimistic counterfactual predictions than the developed framework does. Such service externality can be mitigated if the service provision cost is lower for franchisees. Last, I examine boundary conditions: under the extreme regime of maximum RPM aiming to fully extract franchisees’ profit, I find that information asymmetry is a greater concern for the upstream firm within the focal industry. Additionally, when service externality is combined with channel information asymmetry, maximum RPM at such extremes may no longer increase the franchisor’s profit.},

  abstract     = {Firms are increasingly using technology to enable targeted, or “personalized,” pricing strategies. In settings where prices are transparent to all consumers, however, there is the potential for interpersonal price differences to be perceived as inherently unfair. In response, firms may strategically obfuscate their prices so that direct interpersonal comparisons are more difficult. The feasibility of such a pricing strategy is not well understood. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which it is profitable for firms to engage in price obfuscation, given the potential fairness concerns of consumers. We study how price obfuscation affects consumer fairness concerns, consumer demand, and equilibrium pricing strategies. The findings suggest that if obfuscation mitigates fairness concerns, it can arise as an equilibrium outcome, even if consumers are aware of the seller’s strategic behavior and are able to update their beliefs and expectations about the prices offered to their peers accordingly. To test the theoretical predictions, an experiment is conducted in which price obfuscation is varied both exogenously and endogenously. The results confirm that buyers have intrinsic distributional (based on the seller’s margins) and peer-induced fairness (due to others being charged different prices) concerns when prices are transparent. In particular, disadvantaged peer-induced fairness concerns enter utility as an intrinsic cost that the seller has to compensate for through lower prices. Obfuscation effectively reduces peer-induced fairness concerns and increases sellers’ pricing power. However, this pricing power is constrained by distributive inequity becoming more salient when prices are obfuscated.},

  abstract     = {Some firms that operate in multiple product markets use the same brand in different markets, whereas others use different brands in different markets. This research investigates in which product markets a firm should use the same or different brands and how this decision depends on the relatedness of product markets. To answer this question, I propose a framework of market relatedness that characterizes the relationships among distinct product markets from the supply side (e.g., shared production technology) and demand side (e.g., correlated customer preferences). This framework is applied to a model of reputation in which a multiproduct firm’s product quality is jointly determined by its hidden capability type (i.e., adverse selection) and hidden choice of effort level (i.e., moral hazard) in each product market. Consumers obtain noisy information about the firm by observing its track record, that is, product quality produced in the past. Umbrella branding allows consumers to pool the firm’s track record across different product markets and form expectations about the product quality based on market relatedness. The analysis shows that umbrella branding is optimal if supply-side relatedness is high and demand-side relatedness is not too high. However, if the product markets are closely related in both dimensions, then independent branding may be optimal because, as an umbrella brand, the firm faces a temptation to exploit positive information spillover across product markets through its shared brand name. By using different brand names, a firm can credibly commit to investing in all product markets and thereby earn higher profits. Finally, this paper provides implications for an umbrella brand’s customer relationship management strategy whether to serve the same or distinct customer segments with its products.},

  abstract     = {This research analyzes a firm’s investment in advertising that signals quality when consumers learn about quality not only from such advertising but also from interactions with other consumers in the form of observational learning or word of mouth. Further, word-of-mouth interactions may involve underreporting (not everyone shares experiences), positivity (positive experiences are communicated more widely than negative ones), or negativity (negative experiences are communicated more widely than positive ones). The analysis focuses on whether a firm should advertise more or less aggressively in the presence of such consumer interactions compared with their absence and offers four key insights. First, consumer interactions can amplify the signaling effect of advertising, and as a consequence, to prevent mimicking it may be optimal for a high-quality firm to become more aggressive and spend more on advertising to signal quality in the presence of such interactions than without. Second, as underreporting increases, it can be optimal to reduce advertising, sometimes significantly. Third, with increasing positivity, it can be optimal to increase advertising. Fourth, even with increasing negativity, under certain conditions it may still be optimal to increase advertising rather than decrease it.},
