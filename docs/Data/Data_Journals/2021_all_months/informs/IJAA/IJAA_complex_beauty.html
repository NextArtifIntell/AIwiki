  abstract = {In the summer of 2020, Music Building Eindhoven (MBE) had to deal with the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for theater halls because governmental regulations were having a severe impact on the occupancy. In particular, MBE faced the challenge of determining how to maximize the number of guests in a theater hall while respecting social distancing rules. We have developed and implemented an optimization model based on trapezoid packings to address this challenge. The model showed that up to 40\% of the normal capacity can be realized for a single show setting and up to 70\% in cases where artists opt for two consecutive performances per evening without reusing seats. The solution was adopted by MBE with significant monetary and managerial benefits.},

We propose a computer-aided system to control and optimize the supply chain to deliver animal feed to livestock farms. Orders can be of multiple types of feed and shipped from multiple depots by using a fleet of heterogeneous vehicles with multiple compartments. Additionally, this case considers some business-specific constraints, such as product compatibility, facility accessibility restrictions, prioritized locations, or biosecurity constraints. A digital twin–based approach is implemented at the farm level by installing sensors to remotely measure the inventories. Our approach combines biased-randomization techniques with a simheuristic framework to make use of data provided by the sensors. The analysis of results is based on these two real pilots and showcases the insights obtained during the IoFEED project. The results of this work show how the internet of things and simulation-based optimization methods combine successfully to optimize the feeding operations of livestock farms.},

This problem considers two types of container transportation orders (i.e., door-to-door orders and warehouse orders) between port yards and the hinterland. Unlike the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, this problem needs to consider not only container pickups and deliveries, but also the loading or unloading of cargo inside containers. Moreover, this problem takes account of some constraints on container transportation regulations in China. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer programming model and design an improved backtracking search optimization algorithm. Based on the proposed model and algorithm, a vehicle scheduling decision support system is also developed to integrate data collection, preprocessing, Amap (a digital map, navigation, and location service provider in China) interfacing, and optimization. The improvement of the operational efficiency is validated by the usage of the proposed system in practice.},

  abstract = {One of the roles of the Bank of Canada (BoC) is to ensure that there is sufficient inventory of each denomination of currency all across the country. To accomplish this, the BoC has established 43 regional distribution centers (RDCs) to store inventory. Each RDC has its own limit in terms of the total value of currency that can be stored without penalty. Local banks can request withdrawals from the RDCs or else can choose to deposit money into the RDCs. In addition, the BoC often has to recall currency that has become unfit for service. Thus, the BoC is faced with a two-way inventory management problem wherein demand can be both positive (withdrawals) or negative (deposits), requiring the BoC to guard against both too little inventory (leading to shortages) and too much inventory (leading to penalties for exceeding value limit). We developed an adapted weekly review (s, S) policy for the management of the inventory at each RDC that determines the weekly decision as to how much inventory ships both to and from each RDC. The BoC implemented the adapted policy through the first half of 2018. Comparisons with the previous two years demonstrated a drop in transportation costs of around 15\% in the 12 months following implementation compared with the average of the two years prior—despite the fact that costs had been increasing prior to implementation from one year to the next.},

Classification serves several purposes, including transparency in the use of taxpayer funding; reporting, tracing, and segmenting government expenditures; budgeting; and forecasting. Government acquisition personnel have historically performed these classifications manually, resulting in a process that is time-consuming and error-prone and offers limited visibility into government purchases. The problem faced is not unique to the public sector and is common across retail, manufacturing, and healthcare, among other settings. Using almost 4 million historical data records on governmental purchases, we fit a series of classifiers and demonstrate (a) superior performance when explicitly modeling the hierarchical structure of information domains through the use of top-down strategies and (b) the effectiveness of character-level convolutional neural networks when textual inputs are terse and contain irregularities such as abnormal character combinations and misspellings, which are common in government contracts. Our machine learning models are embedded in multiple software applications, including a web application that we developed, used by federal government personnel and other contracting professionals.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new dynamic pricing approach for the vacation rental revenue management problem. The proposed approach is based on a conditional logistic regression that predicts the purchasing probability for rental units as a function of various factors, such as lead time, availability, property features, and market selling prices. In order to estimate the price sensitivity throughout the booking horizon, a rolling window technique is provided to smooth the impact over time and build a consistent estimation. We apply a nonlinear optimization algorithm to determine optimal prices to maximize the revenue, considering current demand, availability from both the rental company and its competitors, and the price sensitivity of the rental guest. A booking curve heuristic is used to align the booking pace with business targets and feed the adjustments back into the optimization routine. We illustrate the proposed approach by successfully applying it to the revenue management problem of Wyndham Destinations vacation rentals. Model performance is evaluated by pricing two regions within the Wyndham network for part of the 2018 vacation season, indicating revenue per unit growth of 3.5\% and 5.2\% (for the two regions) through model use.},

Anticipating a particularly hazardous “red flag” day, they activate off-duty personnel and reserve equipment and add these to the total augmented, prepositioned force. Analysis of years of detailed daily data can advise these costly decisions. Three models, respectively, predict for each region of the county the probability of a fire start, the area burned by a fire given any particular package of equipment and personnel preassigned to fight it, and which packages to form and send to each position. The conflicting objectives are to minimize the expected number of citizens evacuated and the constrained augmentation cost for personnel and equipment.},

  abstract = {Intermodal transportation requires multiple entities to manage diverse resources under complex regulations and contracts. In this paper, we carry out a multidisciplinary cross-functional analysis of container rail haulage pricing and operations in India. We discover that the total haulage cost of a container train unduly depends on the position of the containers within the train, which is referred to here as position arbitrage. The main objective of this paper is to introduce and analyze this new concept of arbitrage for the first time in the literature. We derive the limits to the arbitrage, present management insights and empirical results, and explain that the arbitrage is undesirable because of its adverse effects on the efficiency of the container supply chain. With a real case, we empirically show that container train operators can save an average of 450 million INR annually by exploiting the arbitrage. On completion of dedicated freight corridors, the annual total value of the arbitrage can increase by one billion Indian rupees. This research is also beneficial for the railways to understand the implications of haulage pricing on operational efficiency and also for the port operators and shippers to understand the implications of the arbitrage for their operations.},

  abstract = {In 2016, the Dutch government, in pursuit of the UN’s sustainable development goals, set a target that all its diesel transit bus networks should be fully electrified between 2025 and 2030. A research team from Rotterdam School of Management has since worked in close collaboration with Rotterdamse Elektrische Tram, the public transport operator in the city of Rotterdam, to accomplish this complex transition. This paper presents essential lessons learned and key practical implications derived from the project. As part of the transition process, we developed a discrete-event simulation model that can simulate the network using different settings and under uncertainty. We also formulated a mixed-integer linear programming problem to optimize the charging schedule. To mitigate the critical impact of uncertainty regarding traffic delays and energy consumption on the electrified transit bus network operation, we developed a real-time decision support system that adjusts and reoptimizes the charging schedule during the day according to the realizations of this uncertainty. We use this system to achieve better coordination between the charging schedule of the electric buses and electricity generation from renewable energy sources with the latter involving high levels of uncertainty. Our study shows the benefits of real-time optimization compared with off-line planning and other greedy strategies. We also show that even highly conservative off-line planning might not be sufficient to maintain reliability levels under extreme operational uncertainty conditions. Additionally, our results and insights have substantially contributed to the success of the first phase of the project, which involved electrifying seven essential bus lines in the city, in realizing a robust and reliable operational plan. Finally, our study shows the potential substantial positive impact of installing renewable energy generators and coordinating the electric buses’ charging schedule with their output power profile. Based on our recommendations, RET developed a real-time monitoring system and is working on incorporating our charging schedule optimizer into its planning process.},

  abstract = {Drivers on the Lyft ride-share platform do not always know where the areas of supply shortage are in real time. This lack of information hurts both riders trying to find a ride and drivers trying to determine how to maximize their earnings opportunities. Lyft’s Personal Power Zone (PPZ) product helps the company to maintain high levels of service on the platform by influencing the spatial distribution of drivers in real time via monetary incentives that encourage them to reposition their vehicles. The underlying system that powers the product has two main components: (1) a novel “escrow mechanism” that tracks available incentive budgets tied to locations within a city in real time, and (2) an algorithm that solves the stochastic driver-positioning problem to maximize short-run revenue from riders’ fares. The optimization problem is a multiagent dynamic program that is too complicated to solve optimally for our large-scale application. Our approach is to decompose it into two subproblems. The first determines the set of drivers to incentivize and where to incentivize them to position themselves. The second determines how to fund each incentive using the escrow budget. By formulating it as two convex programs, we are able to use commercial solvers that find the optimal solution in a matter of seconds. Rolled out to all 320 cities in which Lyft operates in a little more than a year, the system now generates millions of bonuses that incentivize hundreds of thousands of active drivers to optimally position themselves in anticipation of ride requests every week. Together, the PPZ product and its underlying algorithms represent a paradigm shift in how Lyft drivers drive and generate earnings on the platform. Its direct business impact has been a 0.5\% increase in incremental bookings, amounting to tens of millions of dollars per year. In addition, the product has brought about significant improvements to the driver and rider experience on the platform. These include statistically significant reductions in pick-up times and ride cancellations. Finally, internal surveys reveal that the vast majority of drivers prefer PPZs over the legacy system.},

In this paper, we describe a multiyear effort at Dow Agrosciences (now Corteva) to manage its seed corn portfolio, which includes several hundred seeds and is valued at more than $1 billion. The effort had two mutually interacting parts: (1) developing a decision-analytic theory to estimate the production yield distributions for new seed varieties from discrete quantile judgments provided by plant biology experts and (2) developing an optimization protocol to determine Dow&#39;s annual production plan for the seed portfolio with the flexibility of backup production in South America, under production yield uncertainty. The first part, owned by the research and development (R&amp;amp;D) function, provides yield probability distributions as inputs to the optimization protocol of the second part, which the production function owns. The results of the optimization problem, which include information about the attractiveness of specific future varieties, are returned to R&amp;amp;D. Both parts incorporate contextual details specific to this industry. In this paper, we show the optimality of linear policies for both problems. Additionally, the linear policies have many attractive structural properties that continue to hold for the more complex instances of the problems. A major strength of the theory we developed is that it is implementable in a transparent fashion, providing managers with a user-friendly, real-time decision support tool. The implementation of the theory developed has led to significant monetary and managerial benefits at Dow.},

This year’s winning application is a system for optimally managing Dow Agrosciences’ (now Corteva) seed corn portfolio, which includes seeds for several hundred varieties of corn and is valued at more than $1 billion. The model employs Bayesian analytic methods to estimate crop yields from expert judgement. Stochastic optimization is then used to determine backup production in South America while dealing with yield uncertainty in North America.

  abstract = {We developed a seasonal inventory management model for raw materials, such as iron ore and coal, for multiple suppliers and multiple mills. The Nippon Steel Corporation imports more than 100 million tons of raw material annually by vessels from Australia, Brazil, Canada, and other countries. Once these raw materials arrive in Japan, they are transported to domestic mills and stored in yards before being treated in a blast furnace. A critical problem currently facing the industry is the limited capacity of the yards, which leads to high demurrage costs while ships wait for space to open up in the yards before they can unload. To reduce the demurrage costs, the inventory levels of the raw materials must be kept as low as possible. However, inventory levels that are too low may lead to inventory shortage resulting from seasonal supply disruptions (e.g., a cyclone in Australia) that delay the supply of raw materials. Because both excess and depleted inventory levels lead to increased costs, optimal inventory levels must be determined. To solve this problem, we developed an inventory management model that considers variations on the supply side, differences that should be observable upon looking at the ship operations. The concept is to model the probability distribution of ship arrival intervals by brand groups and mills. We divided ship operations into two stages: arrival at all mills (in Japan) and arrival at individual mills. We modeled the former as a nonhomogeneous Poisson process and the latter as a nonhomogeneous Gamma process. Our proposed model enables inventory levels to be reduced by 14\% in summer and 6\% in winter.},

Under the assumption that the true demand distributions are available to the retailer, we develop an effective dynamic inventory allocation heuristic. We further consider a more realistic and challenging setting for seasonal goods, where demand distributions are unknown to the retailer, and propose two “learning-while-doing” extensions of our inventory allocation heuristic; these policies update demand distribution estimates in a rolling horizon using censored point-of-sales data. We evaluate the performance of the policies using simulation on Dillard’s historical sales data.

One of the largest hotels in Singapore manages a fleet of both in-house and outsourced vehicles around the clock, serving 9,000 trips per month on average. The need for vehicles may scale up rapidly, especially during special events and festive periods in the country. The excess demand is met by having additional outsourced vehicles on standby, incurring millions of dollars of additional expenses per year for the hotel. Determining the required number of limousines by hour of the day is a challenging service capacity planning problem. In this paper, a recent transformational journey to manage this problem for the hotel is introduced, having driven up to S$3.2 million of savings per year while improving the service level. The approach builds on widely available open-source statistical and spreadsheet optimization tools, along with robotic process automation, to optimize the schedule of the hotel’s fleet of limousines and drivers and to support decision making for planners and controllers to cultivate sustained business value.},

  abstract = {The research and development (R&amp;amp;D) management in any major research pharmaceutical company is constantly faced with the need to make complicated activity scheduling and resource allocation decisions, as they carry out scientific work to develop new therapeutic products. This paper describes how we develop a decision support tool that allows practitioners to determine portfolio-wide optimal schedules in a systematic, quantitative, and largely automated fashion. Our tool is based on a novel mixed-integer linear optimization model that extends archetypal multimode resource-constrained project scheduling models in order to accommodate multiple rich features that are pertinent to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) activities carried out within the pharmaceutical R&amp;amp;D setting. The tool addresses this problem at the operational level, determining schedules that are optimal in light of chosen business objectives under activity sequencing, resource availability, and deadline constraints. Applying the tool on current workload data demonstrates its tractability for practical adoption. We further illustrate how, by utilizing the tool under different input instances, one may conduct various tactical analyses to assess the system’s ability to cope with sudden changes or react to shifting management priorities.},

  abstract = {In this essay, I describe 10 critical complicating factors that directly affect the six basic modeling components of problem definition, assumptions, decision variables, objective functions, constraints, and solution approach. The proposed 10 contextual complicating factors are (1) organization, (2) decision-making processes, (3) measures and key performance indicators, (4) rational and irrational biases, (5) decision horizon and interval, (6) data availability, accuracy, fidelity, and latency, (7) legacy and other computer systems, (8) organizational and individual risk tolerance, (9) clarity of model and method, and (10) implementability and sustainability of the approach. I hypothesize that the core analytical problem cannot be adequately described or usefully solved without careful consideration of these factors. I describe detailed examples of these contextual factors’ effects on modeling from six published applied prescriptive analytics projects and provide other examples from the literature. The complicating factors are pervasive in these projects, directly and dramatically affecting basic modeling components over half the time. Further, in the presence of these factors, 23 statistically significant correlations tend to form in three clusters, which I characterize as culture, decision, and project clusters. Unrecognized, these factors would have hampered the implementation and ongoing use of these analytical models; in a sense, the models themselves were wrong, absent consideration of these contextual considerations. With these insights, I hope to help practitioners identify the effects of these common complications and avoid project failure by incorporating these contextual factors into their modeling considerations. Future research could seek to better understand these factors and their effects on modeling.},

  abstract = {Pig iron, the source for a variety of iron-based products, is traded in commodity markets. Therefore, enhanced productivity has significant economic implications for the producers. Pig iron is mainly produced inside of tall, vertical, thermodynamic reactors called blast furnaces that run 24 hours a day. The blast furnaces are too complex to model explicitly and are generally regarded as black boxes. In this study, we design, develop, and deploy novel machine learning models on a rich data sample covering more than 20 production variables spanning nine years of actual operational period, collected at one of the largest pig iron production plants in Brazil. We show that, given the blast furnace parameters, machine learning models are capable of unveiling novel insights by illuminating the black box and successfully predicting production levels at different configurations. These prediction models can be used as decision aids to improve production efficiencies. We also perform a sensitivity analysis of the trained models to identify and rank the input variables according to their relative importance. We present our findings, which are largely in line with the existing literature, and confirm their validity, practicality, and usefulness through consultations with subject matter experts.},

  abstract = {Despite advanced supply chain planning and execution systems, manufacturers and distributors tend to observe service levels below their targets, owing to different sources of uncertainty and risks. These risks, such as drastic changes in demand, machine failures, or systems not properly configured, can lead to planning or execution issues in the supply chain. It is too expensive to have planners continually track all situations at a granular level to ensure that no deviations or configuration problems occur. We present a machine learning system that predicts service-level failures a few weeks in advance and alerts the planners. The system includes a user interface that explains the alerts and helps to identify failure fixes. We conducted this research in cooperation with Michelin. Through experiments carried out over the course of four phases, we confirmed that machine learning can help predict service-level failures. In our last experiment, planners were able to use these predictions to make adjustments on tires for which failures were predicted, resulting in an improvement in the service level of 10 percentage points. Additionally, the system enabled planners to identify recurrent issues in their supply chain, such as safety-stock computation problems, impacting the overall supply chain efficiency. The proposed system showcases the importance of reducing the silos in supply chain management.},

We refer to the associated planning problem as the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Regulations and Common Carriers (VRPTRCC). Unlike ordinary vehicle routing problems, which use only a single type of transportation mode, our VRPTRCC applications include make–buy decisions because some of the package deliveries are ultimately subcontracted to organizations other than DHL. Time regulation means that the problem considers not only delivery-time windows, but also layover and driving-time restrictions. Our developed Network Mode Optimization Tool (NMOT) is an ant-colony optimization (ACO)-based program that aids DHL Supply Chain transportation analysts in identifying cost savings in the ground logistic network. By using the NMOT, DHL and its customers have saved millions of dollars annually. Also, the NMOT is helping DHL to win new customers against bidding competitors and reducing estimation times from multiple weeks to hours. The results show an actual increase in profits compared with the previous process by more than 15\% through a combination of new projects enabled and reduced current operational costs. The NMOT is implemented and evaluated by using data from ongoing projects.},

As the CAF manages its own healthcare system for its members, it must consider the impact of COVID-19 not only on the operational effectiveness of its workforce but also on its healthcare operations. Furthermore, given that the CAF has deployed task forces in support of other government departments, including into long-term care facilities that are experiencing outbreaks, it is important for the CAF to maintain situational awareness of the outbreak in the Canadian population generally. In providing analytical support to the CAF on these questions, we focused on establishing the applicability of estimates of COVID-19 infection fatality rates (IFRs) from the literature to the CAF and to the Canadian public. This paper explores how the age-dependent effects of COVID-19 must be taken into account when comparing estimates based on countries with very different age profiles, such as China and Italy. Furthermore, it explores how varying age structures within a country (e.g., within a subnational jurisdiction, or within a given working population) should affect how analysts apply estimates of IFR to scenarios involving those specific populations.},

  abstract = {Biomanufacturing methods use living organisms (i.e., viruses and bacteria) to generate active ingredients, and this leads to challenges that are different from those incurred by other industries. For example, biomanufacturers often deal with high levels of uncertainty and batch-to-batch variability in production yield, lead times, and costs. Biosafety requirements impose constraints, such as a no-wait requirement throughout the production process. In addition, biomanufacturing operations are cost and labor intensive and involve high risks of failure. To address these challenges, a multidisciplinary team of researchers collaborated over three years to develop a portfolio of optimization models and decision support tools. These tools were aimed at improving biomanufacturing efficiency using a variety of operations research methodologies, including stochastic optimization, Bayesian design of experiments, and simulation optimization. The developed models link the underlying biology and chemistry of biomanufacturing processes with financial trade-offs and business risks. The research has been conducted in close collaboration with MSD Animal Health in Boxmeer, Netherlands. Industry implementation at MSD AH had a significant impact, with up to 50\% increase in batch yield and an additional revenue of €50 million per year. The application of operations research is very new to the biomanufacturing industry. As more companies such as MSD AH embrace operations research, we believe that this will significantly help the industry provide faster and more affordable access to new treatments.},

The objectives of this system are to (1) clear the stores’ excess inventory by a specified date, (2) improve revenue by minimizing the discounts needed to clear shelves, and (3) reduce the substantial cost to relabel merchandise in the stores. The underlying mathematical approach uses techniques such as deep reinforcement learning, simulation, and optimization to determine the optimal (marked-down) price. Starting in 2019, after six months of extensive testing, we implemented the new approach across all Walmart stores in the United States. The result was a high-performance model with a price-adjustment policy tailored to each store. Walmart increased its sell-through rate (i.e., the number of units sold during the markdown period divided by its inventory at the beginning of the markdown) by 21\% and reduced its costs by 7\%. Benefits that Walmart accrues include demographics-based store personalization, reductions in operating costs with limited numbers of price adjustments, and a dynamic time window for markdowns.},

These environments, covering sectors from banking to travel to e-commerce, are serviced by IBM support groups. Incidents occurring on servers, including problem descriptions and resolutions, are documented in client account-specific ticket management systems. PASIR uses machine learning to classify the incident tickets within an IT environment and identify high-impact incidents that involve server outages by using the respective ticket descriptions and resolutions. It then correlates these high-impact tickets with server properties and utilization measurements to identify problematic server configurations. Finally, for such configurations, PASIR uses statistical multivariate analysis and simulation methods to prescribe improvement and modernization actions. In this paper, we present the results achieved from deploying this solution. We describe the PASIR approach, from ticket classification to the recommendations of remediation actions (e.g., hardware and software upgrades). We demonstrate the model’s effectiveness by comparing predictions on the impact of prescriptive actions with actual system improvements. Since 2013, we have applied PASIR to more than 840,000 client servers, resulting in more precise upgrade spending and environmental stability, thus saving our clients an estimated $7 billion.},

The resulting hypergraph models are addressed using a novel coarse-to-fine method that implements a hierarchical column generation over three levels of detail. This algorithm is the mathematical core of DB’s fleet employment optimization (FEO) system for rolling stock rotation planning. FEO’s impact within DB’s planning departments has been revolutionary. DB has used it to support the company’s procurements of its newest high-speed passenger train fleet and its intermodal cargo locomotive fleet for crossborder operations. FEO is the key to successful tendering in regional transport and to construction site management in daily operations. DB’s planning departments appreciate FEO’s high-quality results, ability to reoptimize (quickly), and ease of use. Both employees and customers benefit from the increased regularity of operations. DB attributes annual savings of 74 million euro, an annual reduction of 34,000 tons of CO2 emissions, and the elimination of 600 coupling operations in crossborder operations to the implementation of FEO.},

  abstract = {Carnival Corporation &amp;amp; plc identified the need for a cutting-edge revenue management system; however, existing solutions from the airline and hospitality industries were not compatible with the idiosyncrasies of the cruise domain. As such, the company partnered with revenue analytics to build a complete revenue and inventory management system to meet its requirements. Yield optimization and demand analytics (YODA) is a system that leverages a unique quadratic programming model to jointly determine cruise prices and allocate cabin inventory to multiple cruises (e.g., 14-day and 7-day lengths) offered simultaneously on a given ship. The optimization inputs come from several machine learning algorithms that predict demand. YODA combines these algorithms with an elasticity model derived from an exponential curve to represent the unique price-sensitivity behavior observed in the cruise industry. The system generates millions of price recommendations each day and has been used to price voyages on 65 Carnival ships, approximately one quarter of the ships in the entire cruise industry, since December 2017. During A/B testing, YODA generated a 1.5\%–2.5\% incremental uplift in net ticket revenue, which is a significant revenue increase because Carnival was a Fortune 300 company in 2019.},

  abstract = {Due to its scale, the complexity of its products and manufacturing processes, and the capital-intensive nature of the semiconductor business, efficient product architecture design integrated with supply chain planning is critical to Intel’s success. In response to an exponential increase in complexities, Intel has used advanced analytics to develop an innovative capability that spans product architecture design through supply chain planning with the dual goals of maximizing revenue and minimizing costs. Our approach integrates the generation and optimization of product design alternatives using genetic algorithms and device physics simulation with large-scale supply chain planning using problem decomposition and mixed-integer programming. This corporate-wide capability is fast and effective, enabling analysis of many more business scenarios in much less time than previous solutions, while providing superior results, including faster response time to customers. Implementation of this capability over the majority of Intel’s product portfolio has increased annual revenue by an average of $1.9 billion and reduced annual costs by $1.5 billion, for a total benefit of $25.4 billion since 2009, while also contributing to Intel’s sustainability efforts.},
