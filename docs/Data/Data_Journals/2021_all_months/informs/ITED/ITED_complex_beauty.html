Constructivist teaching strategies, in contrast, increase students’ engagement, link what students learn to meaningful contexts, and potentially help students to better organize and transfer knowledge. In this paper, we present 12 exercises developed to aid in the incorporation of constructivist instructional approaches into an introductory probability and statistics engineering course. The objective of this paper is to disseminate the exercises for broader use and report on the experiences of using these exercises for the past 10 years.},

The merger was finalized last Friday, and NewChicken is now absorbed into GreatDeal. This week, Alice and Rosie, along with their team of experts, have to start the long and arduous process of reconfiguring their now combined supply chains to ensure the most profitable path for the company. Alice and Rosie are expected to give a presentation to the new chief executive officer, Michelle Shalhoub. The expectations from the merger are high, and there is no room for error. Furthermore, Ms. Shalhoub is known for asking for multiple competitive proposals so that she has the option to choose the best one. Depending on which proposal Ms. Shalhoub accepts, Alice may stay in her position as a VP or she may lose her title and office to Rosie. Hence, the stakes are high for Alice at a personal level too. As Alice took another sip of her coffee, she contemplated the changes and challenges ahead. She collected all of her notes on the merger, data sources, related news stories, and business magazines and then pulled up her sleeves to get started.},

Prior to the merger, each company has their existing supply chain and operational strengths. Specifically, one company is a more established brick-and-mortar chain and the other is a web-based, e-commerce retailer. Postmerger, they need to evaluate the supply chain structure in terms of sales channels, distribution and fulfillment strategies, and inventory management (especially for three specific groups of products). The case study presents information regarding the market conditions that forced the two companies to merge and offers information to evaluate two competing proposals from senior executives regarding navigating the integration of the online and physical supply chains. The case article discusses the role of this integrated problem within a supply chain management or an inventory management course. In the case article, we present a literature review regarding the positioning of the posed problem among the existing works. We also highlight our experiences in teaching the case. The case “Teaching Note” presents a number of discussion questions depending on the usage of the case, offers answers to specific discussion questions, and provides guidance regarding classroom discussion.

  abstract     = {The simple vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a common topic of discussion in introductory operations research/management science courses. The VRP can be framed in a variety of ways, and it can be difficult to solve to optimality. For solution purposes, introductory textbooks demonstrate how Excel’s Evolutionary Solver (ES) add-in produces a routing. The ES utilizes a genetic algorithm with a heuristic stopping rule to produce a routing that is not guaranteed to be optimal. Beyond pointing out that search controls, such as maximum execution time, may be extended and followed by restart(s) of ES, textbook treatments do not offer alternative ways to continue the search for a possibly better routing. In this paper, a suite of ways is presented in which students may investigate beyond what ES produces or any other optimality-uncertain VRP solution method. The suite includes perturbation methods and other ways that function within an Excel spreadsheet environment that is popular with students and textbook writers. Because there is no demonstrable feature that confirms optimality, the student problem Solver must settle for a ‘best found’ result as unsettling as it may be. The incertitude is addressed.},

  abstract     = {The effective utilization of capacity is an important operational goal that managers strive to achieve. Most textbooks use the following simple “bottleneck formula” to illustrate the calculation of process capacity: the capacity of each resource is first calculated by examining that resource in isolation; process capacity is then taken as the smallest (bottleneck) among the resource capacities. The bottleneck formula is, in fact, an approximation of the true process capacity and correctly calculates capacity only in some straightforward settings, for example, in processes where each activity requires only one resource and in processes where each resource is dedicated to only one activity. However, when activities require multiple resources simultaneously (collaboration) and when resources are capable of doing multiple activities (multitasking), the simple formula can be significantly inaccurate. Further, several commonly held managerial insights related to process capacity and least-capacity resources that emerge from the formula can be misleading. The main goal of this case is to alert students that, for processes with collaboration and multitasking, the use of the bottleneck formula brings the potential danger of reaching incorrect conclusions about capacity and what constitutes a bottleneck of a process and may eventually lead to erroneous decisions with significant financial impact, for example, investing in procuring an expensive resource without being able to realize the presumed increase in capacity. More generally, the case illustrates the principles of process capacity and bottleneck structures and clarifies some often-repeated misunderstandings on the relationship between process capacity and least-capacity resources. The case also illustrates the importance of using Gantt charts for conveniently displaying schedules of activities.},

The goal of this study is to understand the primary reasons that influence a student’s decision to self-select a concentration of business analytics at a large public university. Moreover, we determine which factors are likely to have a significant effect on the performance of students enrolled in this concentration. The primary factors considered are individuals’ bright and dark personality traits, self-perceived satisfaction in related courses, along with several background control factors. The major insights obtained from analyzing our data revealed a significant effect of certain personality characteristics on both students’ concentration choice (extraversion, narcissism) and on performance (conscientiousness, emotional stability, narcissism). On the other hand, students’ performance in foundational courses in the concentration and self-perceived satisfaction in the chosen concentration had no statistically significant effect on their performance.},

Accordingly, first, a binary programming formulation was developed. This formulation was, however, found to be inefficient, and tremendous time (i.e., more than four hours) and a large amount of processing memory were needed to solve the puzzle. The puzzle was subsequently formulated as a minimum cost network flow problem. The latter formulation outperformed the general binary formulation by solving the puzzle in less than a minute. The network formulation could also save the required processing memory. The results could help students to learn the value of modeling combinatorial optimization problems as network flows.},

Many prominent management science textbooks provide a traditional linear programming (LP) formulation for a classic project crashing problem, in which the time–cost trade-off for each activity is continuous (and linear) over a range of possible completion times. We have found that, for students who are being introduced to time–cost trade-offs and the principles of project crashing, an alternative LP formulation facilitates a greater conceptual understanding. Moreover, the alternative formulation uses only half of the decision variables in the traditional formulation and has fewer constraints for many problems encountered in management science textbooks. Results from an MBA section of operations management suggest that students prefer the alternative formulation. Additionally, we have developed an Excel workbook that generates all possible paths for a network, allows students to manually evaluate crashing decisions, and generates the alternative LP formulation. We demonstrate the workbook using a small synthetic example and a larger, real-world network from the literature. We also show that the alternative formulation can be adapted easily to accommodate discrete project crashing problems for which the time–cost trade-offs for activities are not necessarily linear.},

Difference in perceived learning was not significant. Also, team exam scores were significantly lower in the gamified group, whereas individual exam scores were not significantly different. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence that gamification in classroom may produce unintended consequences and implementing gamification restrictively to assessment is ineffective at best. Directions for further research are discussed.},
