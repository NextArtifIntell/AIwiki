  abstract     = {Combinatorial auctions (CAs) are used to allocate bundles of items among interested bidders. However, to resolve bidder preference elicitation problems, CAs are conducted iteratively. Winner determination is a key bottleneck that restricted the widespread adoption of such iterative CAs. Time bounded winner determination is further complicated by the increased variety and velocity of bids each round, and so regular solvers such as IBM CPLEX and A Mathematical Programming Language have been demonstrably ineffective in determining winners within a short duration. In response, heuristic-based methods have enjoyed an increase in applicability. We add to the growing body of work in heuristic-based winner determination by proposing an ant colony–based anytime algorithm ( tr aveling a nts for c ombinatorial a uctions, or TrACA) that produces optimal or near-optimal winner determination results within specified time. Experiments are performed on 94 open test instances that display a variety in bid-bundle composition. We show and compare the performance of TrACA to 20 most recent state-of-the-art heuristics and two of the best exact algorithms (CPLEX and Max W Clique). Compared with 12 of 20 heuristics that employ classic search (e.g., stochastic local search, tabu search) or genetic or memetic algorithms, TrACA does significantly better on all instances. On the other eight heuristics that employ advanced hybrid search methodologies (e.g., hyperheuristics, biased random keys), TrACA performs significantly better on the harder test instances. Additionally, we show that TrACA resolves the trade-off between time and accuracy by achieving optimal solutions on 76 out of 94 instances, in at most one-sixth the time taken by exact algorithms. Finally, we analyze the TrACA search process and highlight factors that make TrACA suitable for solving hard auction instances within a prespecified (short) duration.},

  abstract     = {This research examines the economic impact of membership-based free-shipping (MFS) programs when introduced as an augmentation to widely accepted contingent free-shipping (CFS) policies. Under CFS, consumers waive the shipping surcharge if the order exceeds a certain threshold, whereas under MFS, consumers pay an upfront fee and enjoy the free-shipping perk throughout the membership period. We develop a stylized model that considers consumer heterogeneity in two dimensions: (1) disutility from acquiring an auxiliary product— a product that consumers would not otherwise purchase—to qualify for CFS; and (2) shopping frequency over a given period. Our analysis suggests that the introduction of MFS allows the e-tailer to segment the market further, which could lead to a higher product price. When the disutility from acquiring an auxiliary product is moderate, the e-tailer should charge a high membership fee to target only frequent shoppers who forgo CFS. However, the e-tailer should lower the fee to lure also (1) frequent shoppers who would otherwise take CFS, when the disutility is high; or (2) infrequent shoppers who would otherwise forgo CFS, when the disutility is low. In all cases, although the collected fee revenue can never compensate for the cost arising from offering the free-shipping perk, the loss can be recouped as a desirable outcome of a more segmented market. Our research generates insights into the optimal design of e-tailers’ shipping policies, shedding light on the practical challenges that confront e-tailers.},

  abstract     = {For decades, brand managers have monitored brand health with the use of consumer surveys, which have been refined to address issues related to sampling bias, response bias, leading questions, etc. However, with the advance of Web 2.0 and the internet, consumers have turned to social media to express their opinions on a variety of topics and, subsequently, have generated an extremely large amount of interaction data with brands. Analyzing these publicly available data to measure brand health has attracted great research attention. In this study, we focus on developing a method to measure brand favorability while accounting for the measure biases exhibited by social media posters. Specifically, we propose a probabilistic graphical model–based collective inference framework and implement a block-based Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling technique to obtain an adjusted brand favorability measure that is correlated with traditional survey-based measures used by brands. For analysis, we collect and examine Facebook data for more than 3,300 brands and about 205 million unique users that interact with those brands via their Facebook brand pages. Our data set is large and contains 6.68 billion likes and full text for 1.01 billion user comments, creating challenges for any modeling efforts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model via out-of-sample prediction, external ground truth testing, and simulation. All demonstrate that our model performs very well, providing brand managers with a new method to more accurately measure consumer opinions toward the brand using social media data.},

In this paper, we present a model to study the market incentives of P2P lending platforms’ optimal information-reporting strategies when the following exist: (i) uncertainty on the return of loans and (ii) competition from entrants. We focus on the information bias of platforms driven by demand-side actors—investors’ optimism/pessimism about risk—while we keep the platforms being rational. We characterize platforms’ equilibrium reporting strategies under different market conditions. Surprisingly, we find that when uncertainty is significant, and the threat of entry is strong but not detrimental, the platform has incentives to bias information toward investors’ biased beliefs. This result demonstrates a case where competition and uncertainty may jointly lead to information bias. However, a properly designed uncertainty-resolution mechanism could reduce the incentive. Our findings contribute to the literature on the P2P lending market by analyzing platform decisions and offer policy implications for regulating P2P lending market.},

To test them, we implement a quasi-experiment in the context of the Google Android mobile platform and the prestigious Google Play Award. We infer the effect of the award by estimating the difference-in-differences between award winners and runners-up, before and after the conferral. The main sample encompasses 125 award nominees and their 793 apps between 2016 and 2018. We report three findings. First, the award encourages recipients to focus on releasing complement improvements rather than new complements. Second, the award increases recipients’ likelihood of multihoming. Finally, the award increases new complement releases in the recipients’ market niche by attracting other complementors. We contribute to the platform governance literature by informing about the effects of awards.

  abstract     = {In contrast to industries of other types of information goods, the video game industry still has a sizable secondhand market for games. This is particularly notable because some of the major gaming-console companies (e.g., Sony and Microsoft) actually possess the ability to annihilate the secondhand market altogether; it appears that those companies have given tacit approval to buying and selling used games. Naturally, the question is, what is the special ingredient in the gaming industry that gives a manufacturer incentive to keep a healthy secondhand market even when it has the technological means to shut it down? In this study, leveraging a game-theoretic model, we investigate the effect of gaming console on a manufacturer’s strategy in the presence of a secondhand market for games. We find that when the manufacturer offers a valuable console that provides utilities in addition to playing games, the secondhand market increases the manufacturer’s profit, and that is not at the cost of consumers; the consumers—as well as the society as a whole—also benefit from the secondhand market. This is in stark contrast with settings where there are no consoles involved or the consoles do not offer any intrinsic value; in such settings, the manufacturer would opt to shut down the secondhand market. In the case with a valuable console, however, the increasing appeal of the secondhand market to consumers may improve the manufacturer’s profit, consumer surplus, and social welfare, all at the same time. We discuss our findings along with managerial and welfare implications.},

Recently, a new breed of autonomous tools has emerged, which can independently learn and execute novel actions. The input–output relationships of these tools, however, are unknowable to human agents both ex ante and ex post. This calls for analysis of how humans experience the enactment of socio-material agency while interacting with autonomous tools. To this end, we conduct an exploratory, theory-building, comparative case study at one of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturers. We investigate how chip designers interact with two families of design technologies: one following a traditional designer-centric approach in which the designer knows what outputs particular inputs to the tools will generate and another relying on autonomous tools that continually surprise the user. Our inquiry reveals significant differences in designers’ experiences of using different tools. When using autonomous tools, designers’ experience of enacting socio-material agency becomes liminal , a state of continuous emergence, in which interactions with the tools are marked by ambiguity, and the design is moved forward along multiple design trajectories in accordance with a multifarious temporality. These insights require us to expand upon several dominant views on the enactment of socio-material agency and necessitate novel thinking on the role and impact of autonomous tools in future work systems as well as on how design and innovation proceeds under such conditions.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the creative idea generation process in an open innovation platform. The idea generation process is simultaneously influenced by multiple activities: knowledge acquisition from participants’ interactions with each other’s ideas, deliberate practice through persistent participation, and learning through failures. Due to the dynamic interplay across these activities, it is challenging to identify each activity’s influence on creative ideation outcomes using reduced-form regression analysis. To overcome these challenges, we employ a comprehensive empirical framework, the mutually exciting spatiotemporal point process model with unobserved heterogeneity, which endogenizes the occurrences of these activities in continuous time and allows for user-dependent effects. By utilizing the activity stream data of 13,028 participants from 2010 to 2016 in an open innovation platform, we uncovered synergistic effects of these activities on creative outcomes. We find that knowledge acquired through interaction with others (i.e., stimulus ideas) plays a vital role in the creative ideation process, but their effect is more nuanced than what we have known so far. In contrast to the prior belief that distant analogies, stimulus ideas outside of a problem domain, spur creativity, we find that distant analogies lead to failures. Yet, we further find that such failures are indispensable to the creative ideation process because failures motivate idea generators (1) to acquire more knowledge by increasing their future interactions with other participants’ ideas (learning from others), and (2) to persist in generating ideas that lead to improvements in their ability to apply the acquired knowledge and to identify innovation tasks that are relevant to their stock of acquired knowledge (learning by doing). Our results indicate that failures are a stronger driver of the learning activities than successes. Based on our findings, we offer insights on how to cultivate creativity in an open innovation setting.},

  abstract     = {Monitoring and contract renegotiation are two common solutions for addressing information asymmetry and uncertainty between a client and a vendor of software outsourcing services. Monitoring is mostly applied in time-and-materials contracts, as a basis for inspecting and reimbursing the vendor’s efforts in system development. Renegotiation, by contrast, is deployed in fixed-price and time-and-materials contracts to mitigate the loss of surplus from uncertainty after system development. We investigate the interaction between monitoring and renegotiation and examine the corresponding contract choice problem. We find that the client benefits from renegotiation based on two effects: an uncertainty-resolution effect and a post-development incentive effect , which incentivizes the vendor to exert additional effort in system development. Monitoring does not resolve uncertainty, although it does encourage the vendor to exert additional effort, a pre-development incentive effect . Our analysis shows that the choice of renegotiation or monitoring depends on the interactions of the above effects, which are moderated by the renegotiation cost, monitoring cost, and bargaining power in renegotiation. When renegotiation cost is low: if the client has high bargaining power and low monitoring cost, monitoring and renegotiation are complements and both are selected; otherwise, the two instruments are substitutes and contract renegotiation is preferred. When renegotiation cost is high: monitoring substitutes for renegotiation and the client only chooses monitoring if the cost to do it is low; or else neither is used. Overall, this research shows that four appropriate contract strategies should be used under somewhat different circumstances. We further analyze the impacts of some other key aspects of software outsourcing and extend the base model to address two alternative situations to show the robustness of our findings. The results apply to a range of software reliability growth models , including when machine learning or cloud computing are used.},

  abstract     = {Online reputation (as reflected in customer ratings) has become a key marketing-mix variable in the digital economy. This paper models how firms compete by managing their online reputations. We consider a market consisting of competing firms that participate in a platform such as Expedia or Yelp. Each firm exerts effort to improve its rating but, in doing so, also influences the mean market rating. The sales of a firm are influenced by its own rating and the mean rating of the firms in the market. We formulate each firm’s decision as a stochastic control problem in which the objective is to maximize the discounted profit over a planning horizon. These control problems are connected through a common market belief that represents the mean rating of the firms in the market. The joint actions of the firms generate a mean market rating in equilibrium. We prove that such an equilibrium exists and is unique, and we use a simple algorithm to compute its value. An equilibrium analysis of the mean market rating reveals several insights. A more heterogeneous market (one in which the parameters of the firms are very different) leads to a lower mean market rating and higher total profit of the firms in the market. Our results can inform platforms to target certain firms to join: growing the middle of the market (firms with average ratings) is the best option considering the goals of the platform (increase the total profit of the firms) and other stakeholders, namely the incumbents and the consumers. For firms, we find that a firm’s profit can increase from an adverse event (such as a reduction in sales margin or an increase in the cost of control) depending on how other firms in the market are affected by the event. Our findings are particularly significant for platform owners to employ a strategic growth model for the platform.},

  abstract     = {The wide variety of pricing policies used in practice by data sellers suggests that there are significant challenges in pricing data sets. In this paper, we develop a utility framework that is appropriate for data buyers and the corresponding pricing of the data by the data seller. Buyers interested in purchasing a data set have private valuations in two aspects—their ideal record that they value the most, and the rate at which their valuation for the records in the data set decays as they differ from the buyers’ ideal record. The seller allows individual buyers to filter the data set and select the records that are of interest to them. The multidimensional private information of the buyers coupled with the endogenous selection of records makes the seller’s problem of optimally pricing the data set a challenging one. We formulate a tractable model and successfully exploit its special structure to obtain optimal and near-optimal data-selling mechanisms. Specifically, we provide insights into the conditions under which a commonly used mechanism—namely, a price-quantity schedule—is optimal for the data seller. When the conditions leading to the optimality of a price-quantity schedule do not hold, we show that the optimal price-quantity schedule offers an attractive worst-case guarantee relative to an optimal mechanism. Further, we numerically solve for the optimal mechanism and show that the actual performance of two simple and well-known price-quantity schedules—namely, two-part tariff and two-block tariff—is near optimal. We also quantify the value to the seller from allowing buyers to filter the data set.},

  abstract     = {Goals are the prism through which actors perceive the affordances of technological artifacts. Yet, personal goals have not been differentiated conceptually, and the learning mechanism through which they shape individuals’ perception of affordances has not been examined. This paper addresses these gaps theoretically and empirically. Drawing on achievement goal theory, we conceptualize information technology (IT) affordances as goal-oriented learning outcomes. We then develop a research model that describes several mediated pathways, in which the impact of personal goals on IT affordance perceptions passes through IT-focused learning strategies. The results of the empirical study support the theoretical model and depict three distinct pathways. Specifically, performance-avoidance goals are positively associated with surface processing, which leads to perceptions of common in-role IT affordances. Performance-approach goals are positively associated with surface processing and effort regulation and these learning strategies lead to perceptions of common and specialized in-role IT affordances. Mastery goals are associated with deep processing, effort regulation, and peer learning, which are positively associated with perceptions of specialized in-role and extra-role IT affordances. The paper offers new insights on how and why employees perceive different IT affordances. The affordances we study are conceptualized and operationalized at a level of abstraction that can be used to study affordance perception across actors, technologies, and contexts. The paper opens new avenues for future research on affordances and on related postimplementation phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Customer misbehavior is a serious and pervasive problem in firm-sponsored social media, yet prior studies provide limited insight into how firms should detect and manage it. To address this gap, we first develop a data science approach to detect customer misbehavior on social media and then devise intervention strategies to deter it. Specifically, we build on natural language processing and deep learning techniques to automatically detect customer misbehavior by mining customers’ social media activities in collaboration with a leading apparel firm. The results show that our algorithmic solution achieves superior performance, improving detection by 7\%–9\% compared with traditional methods. We then implement two types of intervention policies based on the focus theory of normative conduct that advocates the use of injunctive norms (i.e., a punishment policy) and descriptive norms (i.e., a common identity policy) to restrain customer misbehavior. We conduct field experiments with the firm to validate these policies. The experimental results indicate that punishment considerably reduces customer misbehavior in the short term, but this effect decays over time, whereas common identity has a smaller but more persistent effect on misbehavior reduction. In addition, punishing dysfunctional customers decreases their purchase frequency, whereas imposing a common identity increases it. Interestingly, our results show that combining the two policies effectively alleviates the detrimental effect of punishment, especially in the long run. We examine the heterogeneous treatment effect on novice and experienced customers. Finally, a follow-up field experiment reveals that the disclosure of the use of an artificial intelligence detector improves the effectiveness of the intervention strategies, and this effect is more pronounced for the punishment and combination strategies.},

  abstract     = {We study a scenario in which a buyer (e.g., Uber) buys cloud capacity from a seller (e.g., Amazon Web services) to run its business. One of the key factors that affects the quality of cloud services is congestion, and it has drawn considerable attention in recent years. Congestion leads to a potential loss of end users (e.g., riders and drivers of Uber), thereby adversely affecting the demand for cloud services. Discount has been a useful mean to stimulate demand and reward customer loyalty. However, in the presence of congestion, the effect of discount on demand is ambiguous. On the one hand, a higher discount leads to higher demand; on the other hand, higher demand can lead to higher congestion, thereby lowering the demand. Given that end users are both price and congestion sensitive, the choice of optimal discount under congestion is, therefore, not straightforward. Using a game-theoretic model, we study the dynamics between congestion and discount and explore how congestion moderates both the buyer’s and seller’s optimal decisions. Our results show that the buyer is not necessarily worse off even when the end users are more intolerant to congestion. In fact, we find that when end users are more congestion sensitive, the demand of cloud services can actually sometimes increase, and the discount offered by the seller can decrease. These findings have important managerial implications on the seller’s pricing and capacity decisions. We also observe that a lower cost of technology can sometimes hurt the buyer, and the buyer can pass on lower benefits to end users. Moreover, given that the cloud services are prone to disruptions, a buyer sources from multiple cloud vendors, which further complicates the matter. We draw useful insights about the buyer’s procurement decisions under congestion in a multicloud setup.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decades, research on online book reviews has inundated academic circles with numerous theoretical reflections and empirical manifestations aimed at explaining the effects of such resources on business performance. Yet, these studies succumbed to the conventional pitfall of assuming that consumers write reviews only after they fully read the book that they purchased. A recent industry report revealed that although many individuals initiate book reading, only a few finish them. With these considerations in mind, we investigated how consumers’ book-consumption patterns affect their review behaviors and how reviews generated from incomplete consumption influence subsequent sales. We used expectation confirmation theory (ECT) as a theoretical foundation to elaborate on the review behaviors of consumers at various stages of their e-book consumption. On the basis of ECT, we argue that customers can submit reviews not necessarily after full consumption, but at any point during this trajectory, and even when consumption has yet to take place. Consumption patterns were traced and captured from records of reading activities on e-book devices and apps. Our results indicate that a considerable number of consumers provide positive reviews even before initiating reading or after progressing up to an extremely early section of a book. In addition, the relationship between review valence and completion rate can be characterized as a U-shaped pattern, given that reviews arising from negative disconfirmations occur more frequently than those emerging out of positive disconfirmations. The findings also uncover that customers occupying the extreme ends of the completion continuum provide less extreme review ratings. The effect of completion rate on review length is significantly positive. Our text-analysis results suggest that reviews based on sufficient consumption contain more useful insights than do those grounded in incomplete consumption. Moreover, review comments formed after incomplete consumption adversely affect subsequent sales. Finally, we discuss a number of our findings’ implications and provide actionable recommendations that can aid platforms in their efforts to refine their online-review systems and policies in pursuit of enhanced credibility in peer evaluation.},

  abstract     = {In the past decade, the proliferation of online marketplace lending has been disrupting the consumer credit market, especially personal loans used for debt consolidation. These lenders, for example, Lending Club, transcend the geographic boundaries within which local banks operate and offer homogeneous access and terms to borrowers. However, the ultimate benefits borrowers derive from marketplace lending can differ significantly because local alternatives may be used to replace marketplace loans when they are available and favorable. Correspondingly, if local bank competition drives the substitution of an existing marketplace loan with a traditional bank loan, the promise of equal benefits to all borrowers from marketplace lending is unlikely to fully materialize. This competitive dynamic also has implications for policy making, particularly in judging the ramifications of bank mergers and acquisitions. We utilize data from Lending Club, a major peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform, to study whether local market structure drives heterogeneous incentives of traditional banks to convert borrowers of marketplace lending to conventional bank loans. The results indicate that a borrower who resides in a more competitive market is more likely to pay off a P2P loan early by making a large, one-time payment compared with a borrower from a less competitive market. Thus, borrowers from different markets do not benefit equally from online marketplace lending disrupting the consumer credit market. Our study has implications for online marketplace lending, other FinTech-based markets, and the consumer credit market in general.},

A hierarchical Bayesian model, using a unique data set from a leading electronic shopping platform and a simulated experiment, reveals that in the early phases of the purchase funnel, consumers are more likely to click on extremely priced options (i.e., the highest or lowest), which consumers use as anchors to evaluate the broad range of options. Later in the purchase funnel, when clicks tend to convert to purchases, consumers instead are more likely to click on moderately priced options, which usually offer a compromise between price and quality. The effects of price rank diminish among advertisements that sponsor more specific keywords and increase among those that sponsor more popular keywords. These findings provide new insights into the role of price information in the PLA context, as well as managerial implications for devising effective PLA strategies.},

  abstract     = {Upstream firms in supply chains have shown a growing interest in deploying consumer scanning technology (CST), which relies on consumers scanning the purchased products with their mobile devices, as a novel alternative to conventional interorganizational information technology (IOIT) to learn downstream consumer demand information. However, there is limited understanding in the literature on (i) how CST helps improve upstream firms’ performances and (ii) whether CST will replace IOIT. This paper develops a theoretical model to examine the value of CST to a supplier that bypasses a retailer and employs CST to directly collect scan information from consumers who are incentivized with a reward for their scanning effort. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that CST offers both operational and strategic value to the supplier. On the operational level, recognizing that the scan information gathered by CST is a censored version of the realized demand, we develop a simple and effective approach for the supplier to learn the realized demand from the censored scan information. We then investigate the learning efficiency of our approach, the optimal reward decisions, and the savings in the supplier’s inventory overage and underage costs arising from CST. On the strategic level, we examine the choice of IOIT and CST within supply chains in equilibrium. Contrary to the conventional view, we find that the availability of CST may expand (instead of suppress) the use of IOIT within supply chains. Using an extensive simulation analysis based on real-world data from a manufacturer that has implemented a CST program, we show that the value of CST to a manufacturer can be substantial and provide insights into how market conditions affect the value.},

  abstract     = {Business models that provide access to assets rather than transfer ownership of goods have become an important industry trend, representing a challenge for incumbent firms. This paper analyzes the interaction of a peer-to-peer (P2P) rental market and a manufacturer of durable goods, and highlights the important role of consumer heterogeneity in usage rates in determining which business model would be preferred by the manufacturer. The introduction of a P2P rental market creates an equalizing effect, which leads to purchases from low-usage consumers. P2P rentals act as a discrimination device, allowing the manufacturer to segment consumers and extract a larger fraction of surplus, which might hurt consumers. The manufacturer is better off with P2P rentals when the heterogeneity in usage rates is intermediate, whereas the consumers are better off with P2P rentals when the heterogeneity is sufficiently high. This paper examines different business models such as the manufacturer with only sales, with rentals in addition to sales (the “dual” firm), with its own P2P rentals platform alongside sales (the “P2P-sponsoring” firm), and with a mixed structure in which the manufacturer competes against P2P rentals by introducing its own direct rentals (the “dual-plus-P2P” firm). Consumer heterogeneity in usage rates plays a fundamental role in business model outcomes. When usage rates and heterogeneity in usage rates are sufficiently large, the manufacturer is better off offering sales and facilitating a P2P rental market. In contrast, if heterogeneity in usage rates is too low, the manufacturer prefers to offer only sales. If heterogeneity is too high but usage rates are below a threshold, the manufacturer prefers to operate as a dual firm that offers both sales and rentals directly to consumers. If P2P rentals are unavoidable, introducing its own rentals to compete against P2P rentals might not be the best strategy for the manufacturer under certain conditions. Overall, contrary to what could be expected, the manufacturer has an incentive to facilitate P2P rentals in a large variety of cases.},

The proposed measures have two advantages over prior methods: (1) unlike prior categorization schemes that classified goods as either search or experience goods, our measure is continuous, allowing us to rank-order the degree of search versus experience and horizontal versus vertical differentiation among products or categories. (2) Our approach is easier to implement than prior methods, because it relies solely on consumer ratings information (as opposed to expert judgment) and can be employed at multiple levels (attributes, products, or product categories). We illustrate empirical applications of our proposed measures using product rating data from Amazon.com. Our data-driven measures reveal the relative importance of fit in driving product utility and the importance of search for determining fit for each product category at Amazon. Our results also show that, while ratings based on verified purchasers are informative of objective product values, the current Amazon review system appears to have limited ability to resolve fit uncertainty.

  abstract     = {Reputation systems in digital workplaces increase transaction efficiency by building trust and reducing information asymmetry. These systems, however, do not yet capture the dynamic multidimensional nature of online work. By uniformly aggregating reputation scores across worker skills, they ignore skillset-specific heterogeneity (reputation attribution), and they implicitly assume that a worker’s quality does not change over time (reputation staticity). Even further, reputation scores tend to be overly positive (reputation inflation), and, as a result, they often fail to differentiate workers efficiently. This work presents a new augmented intelligence reputation framework that combines human input with machine learning to provide dynamic, multidimensional, and skillset-specific worker reputation. The framework includes three components: The first component maps skillsets into a latent space of finite competency dimensions (word embedding), and, as a result, it directly addresses reputation attribution. The second builds dynamic competency-specific quality assessment models (hidden Markov models) that solve reputation staticity. The final component aggregates these competency-specific assessments to generate skillset-specific reputation scores. Application of this framework on a data set of 58,459 completed tasks from a major online labor market shows that, compared to alternative reputation systems, the proposed approach (1) yields more appropriate rankings of workers that form a closer-to-normal reputation distribution, (2) better identifies “nonperfect” workers who are more likely to underperform and are harder to predict, and (3) improves the ranking of within-opening choices and yields significantly better outcomes. Additional analysis of 77,044 restaurant reviews shows that the proposed framework successfully generalizes to alternative contexts, where assigned feedback scores are overly positive and service quality is multidimensional and dynamic.},

Surprisingly little effort is spent on understanding the cognitive challenges of decision augmentation with AI-based systems although these systems make it more difficult for decision makers to evaluate the correctness of system advice and to decide whether to reject or accept it. As little is known about the cognitive mechanisms that underlie such evaluations, we take an inductive approach to understand how AI advice influences physicians’ decision-making process. We conducted experiments with a total of 68 novice and 12 experienced physicians who diagnosed patient cases with an AI-based system that provided both correct and incorrect advice. Based on qualitative data from think-aloud protocols, interviews, and questionnaires, we elicit five decision-making patterns and develop a process model of medical diagnosis decision augmentation with AI advice. We show that physicians use second-order cognitive processes, namely metacognitions, to monitor and control their reasoning while assessing AI advice. These metacognitions determine whether physicians are able to reap the full benefits of AI or not. Specifically, wrong diagnostic decisions often result from shortcomings in utilizing metacognitions related to decision makers’ own reasoning (self-monitoring) and metacognitions related to the AI-based system (system monitoring). As a result, physicians fall for decisions based on beliefs rather than actual data or engage in unsuitably superficial information search. Our findings provide a first perspective on the metacognitive mechanisms that decision makers use to evaluate system advice. Overall, our study sheds light on an overlooked facet of decision augmentation with AI, namely, the crucial role of human actors in compensating for technological errors.},

  abstract     = {We study the impacts of “humanizing” artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled autonomous customer service agents (chatbots). Implementing a field experiment in collaboration with a dual channel clothing retailer based in the United States, we automate a used clothing buy-back process, such that individuals engage with the retailer’s autonomous chatbot to describe the used clothes they wish to sell, obtain a cash offer, and (if they accept the offer) print a shipping label to finalize the transaction. We causally estimate the impact of chatbot anthropomorphism on transaction conversion by randomly exposing consumers to exogenously varied levels of chatbot anthropomorphism, operationalized by incorporating a random draw from a set of three anthropomorphic features: humor, communication delays, and social presence. We provide evidence that, in this retail setting, anthropomorphism is beneficial for transaction outcomes, but that it also leads to significant increases in offer sensitivity. We argue that the latter effect occurs because, as a chatbot becomes more human-like, consumers shift to a fairness evaluation or negotiating mindset. We also provide descriptive evidence suggesting that the benefits of anthropomorphism for transaction conversion may derive, at least in part, from consumers’ increased willingness to disclose personal information necessary to complete the transaction.},

  abstract     = {Microtask crowdsourcing has emerged as a cost-effective approach for obtaining large-scale labeled data. Crowdsourcing platforms, such as MTurk, provide an online marketplace where task requesters can submit a batch of microtasks for a crowd of workers to complete for a small monetary compensation. As the information collected from a crowd can be prone to errors, additional algorithmic techniques are needed to infer the ground truth labels from noisy annotations by workers with heterogeneous quality. Moreover, it would be very beneficial to identify and possibly filter out low-quality workers to foster the creation of a healthy and sustainable crowdsourcing ecosystem. Much of the existing literature on crowd labeling has focused on the single-label setting. However, in many application domains, it is common that each item to be annotated can be assigned to multiple categories simultaneously. In this paper, we present a variety of new approaches for modeling label dependency and worker quality in the context of multi-label crowdsourcing. To capture label dependency, we introduce three methods based on a Bayesian mixture of Bernoulli distributions, its Dirichlet process extension, and a multivariate logit-normal distribution. We also propose two distinct generative models for characterizing shared and hierarchical structures of worker quality. Efficient collapsed and Laplace variational inference algorithms are then developed to jointly infer ground truth labels and worker quality. Extensive simulation and MTurk experiments show that the models based on integrating Bernoulli mixtures and shared structure of worker quality achieve a significant improvement over other state-of-the-art methods. Our study clearly highlights that joint and effective modeling of label dependency and worker quality is crucial to the design of a multi-label crowdsourcing system. The proposed framework also has great potential to be extended to a broader range of applications, in which different opinions need to be combined to measure multiple perspectives of an object.},

Collaborating with one of the leading P2P companies, we examine how investors use robo-advisors and how the human adjustment of robo-advisor usage affects investment performance. Our analyses show that, somewhat surprisingly, investors who need more help from robo-advisors—that is, those encountered more defaults in their manual investing—are less likely to adopt such services. Investors tend to adjust their usage of the service in reaction to recent robo-advisor performance. However, interestingly, these human-in-the-loop interferences often lead to inferior performance.},

We propose the effect of workers’ use of the direct messaging system on employers’ hiring decisions and conceptualize the information role of direct messaging. To empirically evaluate the information role of the direct messaging system, we leverage data on the direct messaging activities between workers and employers across more than 470,000 job applications on a leading online labor market. We report evidence that direct messaging with a prospective employer increases a worker’s probability of being hired by 8.9\%. However, the degree to which workers benefit from direct messaging is heterogeneous, and the effect amplifies for workers approaching employers from a position of disadvantage (lacking tenure or fit with the job) and attenuates as more workers attempt to message the same prospective employer. The effects also depend on message content. In particular, we find that the benefits of direct messaging for workers depend a great deal on the politeness of the workers, and this “politeness effect” depends on several contextual factors. The beneficial effects are amplified for lower-status workers (i.e., workers lacking tenure and job fit) and workers who share a common language with the employer. At the same time, the beneficial effects weaken in the presence of typographical errors. These findings provide important insights into when and what to message to achieve favorable hiring outcomes in online employment settings.},

This paper explores how, why, and when reviewers’ attentional focus can influence the helpfulness evaluation of reviews beyond the impact of substantive review content. Drawing on the attentional focus and persuasion literatures, we develop a theoretical model proposing that reviewers’ attentional focus may influence consumers’ perception of review helpfulness through opposing processes, and that its overall effect is contingent on the review’s two-sidedness. Results of one archival analysis and five controlled experiments provide consistent support for our hypotheses. This work challenges the predominant view of the positive impact of other-focus (vs. self-focus), explores the interpersonal impact of a reviewer’s attentional focus on prospective consumers who are total strangers, and reveals an important, context-specific boundary condition.},

  abstract     = {A repeated challenge in launching a two-sided market platform is how to ignite the cross-side network effects to jump-start adoption. Prior literature often addresses this issue by using pricing controls—a high price on one side to raise the margin and a low price on the other to attract users—or the “seesaw principle.” More recently, platforms are increasingly embracing nonpricing controls to accelerate user adoptions. Little is known, however, about the role of nonpricing controls and their interplay with pricing controls. In this research note, using a game-theoretic framework, we study “piggybacking”—that is, expanding the focal market to recruit exclusive users from external networks—as a new and nonpricing control to launch platforms in conjunction with pricing controls. We first consider consumer-side piggybacking. In a standard “competitive bottlenecks” setting in which consumers single home and providers multihome, we provide a rich set of novel insights into strategies that platforms use to monetize exclusive access to external users with nontrivial characterizations of the interplay among piggybacking, cross-side network effects, and price competition. We identify necessary and sufficient conditions when piggybacking is profit improving and when it leads to a prisoner’s dilemma, depending on the piggybacking cost and strengths of cross-side network effects. Among others, we show that, if the platforms’ equilibrium strategies were to subsidize consumers (when provider-side network effects are stronger than consumer-side network effects), piggybacking may intensify rather than ease price competition. In contrast, if the platforms’ equilibrium strategies were to subsidize providers (when provider-side network effects are weaker than consumer-side network effects), piggybacking may ease price competition. Interestingly, piggybacking reinforces the seesaw principle for the piggybacking platform. We provide a full characterization on such nontrivial equilibrium outcomes. We then consider provider-side piggybacking, and we show that the insights are qualitatively the same as consumer-side piggybacking except that the prisoner’s dilemma disappears if piggybacking providers multihome. Managerial implications for platform practitioners are also discussed.},

Knowledge sharing that occurs in such a contest may play an important role in the process of contestants generating high-quality solutions. On the one hand, more knowledge resources may lower the participation cost and help improve crowdsourcing performance. On the other hand, the shared knowledge may also interrupt contestants’ independent solution search processes and distract contestants. This study demonstrates the existence of knowledge sharing’s impact on crowdsourcing contestants’ performance and identifies the influence of different shared knowledge dimensions on crowdsourcing contestants. The results indicate that having a knowledge sharing process on the platform does not necessarily improve crowdsourcing contestants’ performance. We show that the effectiveness of knowledge sharing is influenced by the volume, quality, and generativity of shared knowledge. The shared knowledge is only beneficial when it is of high quality or of high generativity. In addition, we examine the effects of the breadth and depth of knowledge generativity in the knowledge sharing process and find that a high degree of derivation breadth improves contestants’ performance. The findings provide implications for a crowdsourcing contest platform to utilize the knowledge sharing feature effectively. The key to making full use of this feature is to ensure a high quality of the shared knowledge and to encourage more contributions of generative knowledge, especially the generative knowledge of great breadth.},

ES users need to not only gain proficiency in interacting with the system but also develop competence to obtain faithful representations of business processes from the system and act upon such information effectively. Thus, the extent to which an organization can extract value from ES depends on an employee’s potential to use the ES to its fullest extent to accomplish job tasks, that is, user competence. Anchoring our study to the job demands-resources model, we examine how work contextual factors, namely, the job demands (i.e., work overload) and three job resources (i.e., leader–member exchange (LMX), traditional support structures, and peer support structures), can facilitate the development of user competence. Based on a longitudinal survey from users in six organizations that have implemented the same ES, we gained two insights. First, we found that all three job resource factors have positive relationships with user competence. Second, the results revealed that the relationship between work overload and user competence is moderated by LMX but not the support structures. Overall, this research contributes to the extant understanding of organizational information systems by moving from a use-focused model to a competence-development model and providing insights on work contextual factors that can foster competence in using the ES.},

We first propose an analytical observational learning framework integrating the impact of product differentiation and social ties. Then, we use two experimental studies to validate our analytical results and provide additional insights. Our key findings are that the effect of learning from strangers is stronger for vertically differentiated products than for horizontally differentiated products. However, the effect of learning from friends does not depend on whether the underlying product is horizontally or vertically differentiated. What is more interesting is the nuanced role of social ties: For horizontally differentiated products, the effect of learning increases with the strength of social ties. In addition, contact-based tie strength is more important than structure-based tie strength in accelerating observational learning. These findings provide motivation for online retailers to generate alternative strategies for increasing product sales through social networks. For example, online retailers offering horizontally differentiated products have strong incentives to cooperate with social media platforms (e.g., Instagram and Pinterest) in encouraging customers to share their purchase information.},

Our results show that the mean rating of substitutive (complementary) products has a negative (positive) effect on purchasing of the focal product. Interestingly, the magnitude of the spillover effects of the mean ratings of covisited (substitutive and complementary) products is significantly larger than the effects on the focal product, especially for complementary products. The spillover effect of ratings is stronger for consumers who use mobile devices versus PCs. We find the negative effect of the mean ratings of substitutive products across different brands on purchasing of a focal product to be significantly higher than within the same brand. Lastly, the effect of the mean ratings is stronger for less experienced consumers and for ratings with lower variance.

  abstract     = {Online commerce websites often request users to register in the online shopping process. Recognizing the challenges of user registration, many websites opt to delay their registration request until the end of the conversion funnel (i.e., ex post registration request). Our study explores an alternative approach by asking users to register with the website at the beginning of their shopping journey (i.e., ex ante registration request). Guided by a stylized analytical model, we conducted a large-scale randomized field experiment in partnership with an online retailer in the United States to examine how the ex ante request affects users’ registration decisions, short-term customer conversions, and long-term purchase behaviors. Specifically, we randomly assigned the new users in the website’s incoming traffic to one of two experimental groups: one with an ex ante registration request preceding the ex post request (treatment) and the other with only an ex post registration request (control). Our results show that the ex ante request leads to an increased probability of user registration; that is, the users in the treatment group, on average, are 58.08\% relatively more likely to register with the website than those in the control group. Furthermore, the ex ante request leads to significant increases in customer purchases in the long run. Based on our estimation of the local average treatment effects, the ex ante registered users are 10.89\% relatively more likely to make a purchase, place a 16.76\% relatively greater number of orders, and generate 13.22\% relatively higher total revenue for the firm in the long run. Finally, the ex ante request also does not impact customer conversion in the short-term. Further investigation into the long-term and short-term effects provides suggestive evidence on several potential mechanisms, such as firm-initiated interaction and screening of low-interest users. Our study provides managerial implications to the e-commerce websites on customer acquisition and contributes to the research on IT artifact design.},

Contemporary treatment for breast cancer is complex and involves highly specialized medical professionals collaborating in a series of information-intensive processes. This poses significant challenges to personalization and customization of treatment plans for individual patients. In this research, we follow the information systems design science paradigm and propose a novel framework for decision support of treatment planning for early stage breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. The core of our framework consists of a predictive model that predicts patient outcome of a treatment plan based on clinical and patient characteristics, and an optimization model that optimizes the treatment plan based on predicted outcomes of different plans. Using a series of simulation experiments, we show that the treatment plans generated from our framework consistently outperform those from the existing practices in balancing the risk of local tumor recurrence and radiation-induced adverse effects, thereby reducing the treatment cost associated with these adverse effects. Our research contributes to the growing literature that examines the potential of healthcare information technologies in delivering cost-effective care. Further, we also contribute to healthcare practices by providing models and tools that have pragmatic value as part of the clinical care delivery system.},

  abstract     = {Pokémon Go, a mobile game that utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology, garnered tremendous public interest upon release with an average of 20 million active daily users. The game combines geospatial elements with gamification practices to incentivize user movement in the physical world. In this study, we examine the potential externalities that such incentives may have on associated businesses. Particularly, we study the impact of Pokémon Go on local restaurants by using online reviews as a proxy for consumer engagement and perception. We treat the release of Pokémon Go as a natural experiment and study the postrelease impact on associated restaurants. We find that restaurants associated with Pokémon Go do indeed enjoy a higher level of consumer engagement and more positive consumer perception. In addition, we find that the characteristics of a restaurant moderate these effects significantly. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to examine the economic implications of augmented-reality applications. Therefore, our research lays the foundation for future studies to examine how augmented-reality applications affect consumer economic behavior. Our study also provides insights for business owners and policymakers regarding the potential value of being associated with AR-based applications.},

  abstract     = {Rapid growth in the cloud services market provides tremendous opportunities to cloud providers who have invested heavily in computing capacities but also has led, at time, to low utilization of capacities. To alleviate this problem, some providers have launched a low-priority service with preemptible (spot) instances, which allows them to attract more customers while keeping the right to reclaim capacities when necessary. In this study, we consider a provider who faces a heterogeneous pool of customers with fault-tolerant (interruptible) computing jobs. We develop an analytical framework that consists of a customer-choice model and a diffusion model to capture the underlying supply-demand dynamics and the resulting preemption probability. First, we examine a commonly used discount scheme for preemptible instances, namely, the uniform discount scheme , and derive the optimal discounted price, given customers’ expectation of the preemption probability. Then, we propose another practical discount scheme, namely, the interruption-based discount scheme , which provides customers with compensation for interruptions. As long as the provider interrupts the preemptible instances randomly and customers are risk neutral, the two discount schemes are equivalent from the provider’s perspective. That said, the proposed scheme is fairer than the uniform discount scheme from the customers’ perspective, as the former provides more discounts to customers who experience more interruptions. Finally, in the presence of risk-averse customers, through a numerical study, we find that the provider would be better off by adopting the uniform discount scheme in an environment in which the level of surplus capacity stays high and stable. Overall, however, the provider would be better off by adopting the proposed scheme when the level of the surplus capacity is moderate and volatile; the relative advantage of the proposed scheme enlarges as the average surplus capacity decreases and its volatility increases.},

Drawing upon issue selling theory, this study examines how chief information officers (CIOs) could lead their organizations’ digital innovation initiatives. We propose that the CIO’s issue selling effectiveness, rather than his or her structural position, directly influences the level of organizational digital innovation success. Furthermore, the CIO’s structural power should not be overlooked because it could amplify (i.e., positively moderate) the impact of CIO issue selling to digital innovation outcomes. In addition, we identify four enabling forces of CIO issue selling effectiveness: (1) CIO strategic decision-making authority, (2) CIO/top management team partnership, (3) CIO information technologies (IT)–related strategic knowledge, and (4) CIO political savvy. Matched-pair survey data collected from senior business and IT executives of 179 organizations largely support the research hypotheses. The findings of the study suggest that issue selling perspective offers a powerful theoretical lens to examine CIO strategic impacts in the digital era.},

  abstract     = {Digital technologies have led to the emergence of many platforms in our economy today. In certain platform networks, buyers in one market purchase services from providers in many other markets, whereas in others, buyers primarily purchase services from providers within the same market. Accordingly, network interconnectivity—which measures the degree to which consumers in one market purchase services from service providers in a different market—varies across different industries. We examine how network interconnectivity affects interactions between an incumbent platform serving multiple markets and an entrant platform seeking to enter one of these markets. Our model yields several interesting results. First, even if the entrant can advertise at no cost, it still may not want to make every user in a local market aware of its service, as doing so may trigger a competitive response from the incumbent. Second, having more mobile buyers, which increases interconnectivity between markets, can reduce the incumbent’s incentive to fight and, thus, increase the entrant’s incentive to expand. Third, stronger interconnectivity between markets may or may not make the incumbent more defensible: when advertising is not costly and mobile buyers consume in both their local markets and the markets they visit, a large number of mobile buyers will increase the entrant’s profitability, thereby making it difficult for the incumbent to deter entry. However, when advertising is costly or mobile buyers only consume in the markets they travel to, a large number of mobile buyers will help the incumbent deter entry. When advertising cost is at an intermediate level, the entrant prefers a market with moderate interconnectivity between markets. Fourth, we find that even if advanced targeting technologies can enable the entrant to also advertise to mobile buyers, the entrant may choose not to do so in order to avoid triggering the incumbent’s competitive response. Finally, we find that the presence of network effects is likely to decrease the entrant’s profit. Our results offer managerial implications for platform firms and help understand their performance heterogeneity.},

Leveraging the opportunity created by the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) mandate in the United States, we use a difference-in-differences approach to examine whether and how a firm’s XBRL adoption affects the readability of its textual disclosures. We find that the initial adopters’ HTML-formatted annual reports become harder to read after the XBRL mandate. Further analysis reveals that this effect is concentrated among adopters with more quantitative disclosures, those with smaller firm size, and those with a higher level of financial complexity. Importantly, we show that managers’ reduced attention to preparing HTML-formatted annual reports, rather than increased disclosures, is likely the explanation for this decrease in textual readability. We also find that the negative effect on textual readability persists at least in the subsequent year. Taken together, our results suggest that although XBRL can standardize numerical disclosures, its initial adoption can divert managerial attention and result in reduced readability of textual disclosures.},

  abstract     = {Organizational information security (ISec) threats have exploded with advances in globalization and technology. Thus, organizations are scrambling to find both technical and behavioral approaches to shore up security. Whereas security technologies are crucial to these efforts, they are often rendered useless by employees’ misunderstanding, carelessness, or deliberate disregard of ISec polices (ISPs). Accordingly, organizations are increasingly seeking ways to encourage employees to work as security allies. A key approach in many organizations is encouraging employees to better understand and comply with ISPs. Consequently, ISec research has leveraged several theories to identify the underlying reasons for ISP compliance behaviors among employees. However, most of this research focuses unilaterally on compliance without simultaneously considering noncompliance, as if noncompliance were caused by opposite factors. A pressing need thus exists for a theoretical foundation that can consider both common outcomes and whether there is an explainable tipping point that can explain when a normally compliant employee chooses to become noncompliant, and vice versa. In this study, we contextualize the extended parallel process model (EPPM) to ISP compliance by accounting for dual outcomes of compliance/noncompliance and dual roles of coping—problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping. We further extend the EPPM to include response costs and maladaptive rewards to predict the two possible outcomes. Additionally, we employ a weighted discriminant value measurement approach to examine the tipping point between compliance and noncompliance. To test our resulting theoretical model and new measure, we conducted two separate empirical studies with 816 employees, using survey and scenario methodologies. The empirical results from these studies indicate that our contextualization and extension of EPPM better explain the gaps than alternative theories in the ISP literature.},

  abstract     = {Contemporary social media fueled social protest is self-organized, rapidly dynamic, and decentralized, constitutes vast populations, and is shaped by multiple and concurrent channels of information flows. Such protest activity is captured in the concept of social protest cycles , which are short periods of intense and contentious protest activity characterized by temporal dynamics, a large repertoire of protest action, confrontation and potential violence, and possible institutional action. Social protest cycles are the microfoundations of long-term social movements. They contain the seeds of potential societal transformation because their intense collective action can be constructively harnessed toward change. This paper examines the role of social media in social protest cycles. Drawing from the theoretical concept of sociomaterial assemblages, we conceptualize the social media enabled social protest cycle as an assemblage having social (e.g., people, elected leaders, police, judges) and technical (e.g., social media applications, online petition applications) components. We analyze how the social protest cycle transforms through performative intra-actions. The empirical context for the study is a social media enabled social protest cycle that emerged after a fatal rape incident in New Delhi, India. Data pertaining to the social protest cycle over the period December 17–25, 2012, were collected from social media activity on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, online blogs, and newspaper websites. Through mixed methods analysis we identify three intra-actions, consolidation, expansion, and intensification, and theorize how they transform the social protest cycle over time. The paper contributes to the information systems literature that studies social media–enabled social protest action. As theoretical contributions, it develops (1) the notion of intra-actions as organizing mechanisms and (2) a relational ontology for social media–enabled social protest action. Through these contributions, we suggest that the power of social media lies in its socially produced and emergent relationships with other entities in the social protest cycle.},

  abstract     = {Massive online open courses (MOOCs) are a booming phenomenon in the digital era, having attracted millions of users around the world to date. At the same time, educational delivery via MOOCs comes with distinct difficulties for students and instructors because the online nature of MOOCs creates every opportunity for digital distraction and procrastination. In this work, we consider that the digital nature of MOOCs and online learning management systems (LMSs) may also offer unique opportunities to counteract procrastination. Building on the temporal motivation theory, this study examines a number of calls to action (CTAs) pertaining to the completion and submission of course assignments, with an eye toward combating student procrastination on MOOCs. We report on the results of a randomized field experiment on a leading MOOC platform in China. By randomly treating MOOC users with different CTAs related to active course assignments, we seek to examine the impacts of alternative informational interventions on students’ time to completion and probability of on-time assignment submission. We consider multiple types of CTAs: a simple CTA, a deadline reminder, descriptive norm interventions (communicating peer assignment completion rates), and a simple CTA combined with a financial incentive. We find that descriptive norms lead to higher probabilities of assignment completion and a shorter time to completion. In contrast, we find that the deadline reminder has a surprisingly counterproductive effect. Subsequently, exploring heterogeneity in the response to our different interventions—considering factors such as course load, education level, and user tenure on the MOOC platform—we find evidence that the deadline reminder in particular can backfire if students’ active course load is low. This result suggests that students with low course loads may perceive the deadline to be distant, which reduces their sense of urgency and leads to complacency. We discuss the implications of our findings for both research and practice.},

By examining a sample of DSBs from 2005 to 2017, our study finds that CEOs with IT expertise are associated with fewer DSBs, with some evidence of a focus on DSBs containing consumer information. Our evidence also suggests that CFOs with IT expertise are less likely to report a DSB in general, as well as DSBs involving employee information or instigated by a person outside of the firm and, to a weaker extent, DSBs containing consumer information. Further, the presence of a CIO as part of the TMT is significantly associated with reduced DSBs of all types examined. Our results are robust to endogeneity concerns and an alternative propensity score matched sample. This study contributes a granular investigation of DSB risk involving executives with IT expertise that extends the upper echelon and ITG literatures.},

  abstract     = {Matching with preferences has great potential to coordinate the efficient allocation of scarce resources in organizations when monetary transfers are not available and thus can provide a powerful design principle for information systems. Unfortunately, it is well known that it is impossible to combine all three properties of truthfulness, efficiency, and fairness (i.e., envy freeness) in matching with preferences. Established mechanisms are either efficient or envy free, and the efficiency loss in envy-free mechanisms is substantial. We focus on a widespread representative of a matching problem: course assignment where students have preferences for courses and organizers have priorities over students. An important feature in course assignment is that a course has both a maximum capacity and a minimum required quota. This is also a requirement in many other matching applications, such as school choice, hospital-residents matching, or the assignment of workers to jobs. We introduce E xtended S eat P rioritized C linch and T rade with a widened R ange of guarantees (RESPCT), a mechanism that respects minimum quotas and is truthful, efficient, and has low levels of envy. The reduction in envy is significant and is due to two remarkably effective heuristics. We follow a design science approach and provide analytical and experimental results based on field data from a large-scale course assignment application. These results have led to a policy change, and the proposed assignment system is now being used to match hundreds of students every semester.},

  abstract     = {Firm relations, which inform the competitive environments of firms, are critical to firm operations and are often factored into investor decisions. Previous studies and practices have considered relatively stable and long-term business relations as an indicator of firm market value. Public news often reports on business relations, especially dynamic and short-term opportunities and challenges involving different partners. Learning about firm relations from news is commonly done by human investors but has not been studied systematically in previous research, leading to a research opportunity in market signaling via dynamic firm relations . In this study, we propose a new approach to market signaling by leveraging text-mining methods to extract cobenefit/counter-benefit networks based on firms’ mutual or conflicting interests in business events. We find that the resulting networks in the long term are partially aligned with firm cooperation and competition relationships, confirming their semantic implications for investor perception and attention. Our empirical study further shows that dynamic networks formed in a short time period (measured by firm centrality in networks) have significant impacts on firm equity value, after controlling for market activities and other information from news, such as volume, sentiment, and comentions. We show that dynamic networks can provide additional value in predicting firm equity value over stable networks. Moreover, the negative effects of counter-benefit networks emerge rapidly and persist longer than the positive effects of cobenefit networks. This study provides new insights into investor perception of news and suggests new research directions for financial text mining. Our research findings on market signaling via news-induced networks also have an impact on financial practices, such as market analysis and automatic trading.},

  abstract     = {Many platforms use monetary incentives to encourage user-generated content (UGC) contributions. However, empirical studies report contradictory findings: monetary incentives may either increase or decrease contribution. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we build a theoretical model where four types of contributors (classified by whether they contribute without monetary incentive and whether they are effective in attracting audience) compete for the audience. We identify two crowding out effects: (1) motivation crowding out , where the introduction of a monetary incentive reduces the non–money-driven contributors’ motivation to contribute (e.g., contributors may worry that they would be viewed as greedy), so they reduce their effort or even stop contributing; and (2) competition crowding out , where the low-effectiveness contributors reduce their effort or even stop contributing because of intensified competition when the monetary incentive increases. Under the influence of these two crowding-out effects, the impact of a monetary incentive on the contributors’ participation and on their total content volume is not monotonic. As a result, different equilibrium outcomes emerge as the monetary incentive increases. We also extend our model to the case where the number of contributors in each type could be different and identify more complicated crowding-out phenomena. Our findings offer guidelines for designing monetary incentive schemes for online UGC platforms.},

  abstract     = {Phishing is a significant security concern for organizations, threatening employees and members of the public. Phishing threats against employees can lead to severe security incidents, whereas those against the public can undermine trust, satisfaction, and brand equity. At the root of the problem is the inability of Internet users to identify phishing attacks even when using anti-phishing tools. We propose the phishing funnel model (PFM), a design artifact for predicting user susceptibility to phishing websites. PFM incorporates user, threat, and tool-related factors to predict actions during four key stages of the phishing process: visit, browse, consider legitimate, and intention to transact . We used a support vector ordinal regression with a custom kernel encompassing a cumulative-link mixed model for representing users’ decisions across funnel stages. We evaluated the efficacy of PFM in a 12-month longitudinal field experiment in two organizations involving 1,278 employees and 49,373 phishing interactions. PFM significantly outperformed competing models/methods by 8\%–52\% in area under the curve, correctly predicting visits to high-severity threats 96\% of the time—a result 10\% higher than the nearest competitor. A follow-up three-month field study revealed that employees using PFM were significantly less likely to interact with phishing threats relative to comparison models and baseline warnings. Furthermore, a cost-benefit analysis showed that interventions guided by PFM resulted in phishing-related cost reductions of nearly $1,900 per employee more than comparison prediction methods. These results indicate strong external validity for PFM. Our findings have important implications for practice by demonstrating (1) the effectiveness of predicting user susceptibility to phishing as a real-time protection strategy, (2) the value of modeling each stage of the phishing process together, rather than focusing on a single user action, and (3) the considerable impact of anti-phishing tool and threat-related factors on susceptibility to phishing.},

  abstract     = {Job erosion is a major concern globally, especially given the COVID-19 pandemic. Unemployment and low wages remain pressing societal challenges in the wake of increased automation, more so for traditionally disadvantaged groups in the labor market, such as women, minorities, and the elderly. However, workers who possess relevant information technology (IT) skills might have an edge in an increasingly digital economy. In this study, we examine the role of IT skills in labor market outcomes for workers. We leverage a household IT use survey from an emerging economy that captures detailed, individual-level data on IT skills and IT use, which are also integrated with household labor force survey data on workers’ wages, occupations, and industries between 2007 and 2015. We find that basic IT skills increase employment probability, and these employment effects can be explained by both increased labor force participation and a higher probability of transitioning from unemployment to employment, after accounting for the decision to participate in the workforce. Advanced IT skills are not significantly associated with higher employment, conditioning on basic IT skills. However, having advanced IT skills helps workers to earn higher wages and incrementally increases the probability that they are employed in higher-paid jobs. Interestingly, the effects of basic IT skills on employment are significantly larger for the female and older workforce that typically has a higher preference for flexible work options. Additionally, IT skills complement occupations that have a higher share of nonroutine tasks that cannot be performed by predefined rules. These results emphasize the importance of providing necessary IT access and basic IT training to traditionally socially disadvantaged groups to reduce the IT skills gap and close the digital divide. We contribute to the literature by providing evidence on the role of different IT skills in the entire labor force across multiple occupations and demographics, going beyond IT professionals and employed workers who have predominantly been studied in the information systems literature. We discuss implications for the future of work and education and public policy for designing IT training policies for workers, students, and organizations to stimulate employment for workers with higher wages, particularly in developing economies and for traditionally disadvantaged segments of the workforce, such as women and the elderly, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract     = {As a result of advances in data mining, more and more empirical studies in the social sciences apply classification algorithms to construct independent or dependent variables for further analysis via standard regression methods. In the classification phase of these studies, researchers need to subjectively choose a classification performance metric for optimization in the standard procedure. No matter which performance metric is chosen, the constructed variable still includes classification error because those variables cannot be classified perfectly. The misclassification of constructed variables will lead to inconsistent regression coefficient estimates in the following phase, which has been documented as a problem of measurement error in the econometrics literature. The pioneering discussions on the issue of estimation inconsistency because of misclassification in these studies have been provided. Our study attempts to investigate systematically the theoretical foundation of this problem when a newly constructed variable is used as the independent or dependent variable in linear and nonlinear regressions. Our theoretical analysis shows that consistent regression estimators can be recovered in all models studied in this paper. The main implication of our theoretical result is that researchers do not need to tune the classification algorithm to minimize the inconsistency of estimated regression coefficients because the inconsistency can be corrected by theoretical formulas, even when the classification accuracy is poor. Instead, we propose that a classification algorithm should be tuned to minimize the standard error of the focal regression coefficient derived based on the corrected formula. As a result, researchers can derive a consistent and most precise estimator in all models studied in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Providers of free-to-play games often gain revenue by monetizing players’ playtime, for example, through in-game advertising and by selling premium modules of the game. One emerging strategy to sell the premium module, known as the virtual selling strategy, is to set the module price based on an amount of virtual currency that players can either spend on playtime to earn or use real currency to buy. In this paper, we examine how the virtual selling strategy leads to different market outcomes than the traditional real selling strategy where players can purchase the premium module using real currency only. We focus on the differences caused by one specific feature—players can pay for the module indirectly using their playtime in the virtual selling strategy. We show that when the provider’s efficiency of monetizing players’ playtime, that is, the time revenue rate, is above a threshold, the virtual selling strategy will benefit the provider and hurt the overall consumer surplus compared with the real selling strategy, even though players in the virtual selling strategy have one additional way, that is, using their playtime, to pay for the module. We identify an undocumented overcompensation effect that causes the profit augmentation and the surplus reduction. The overcompensation effect also results in a U-shaped relationship between the equilibrium module price and the time revenue rate in the virtual selling strategy when the module only provides a small number of new gaming stages. It contradicts the traditional result from the real selling strategy that the provider shall reduce the module price when she becomes more efficient in monetizing players’ playtime.},

  abstract     = {Sexual assault is one of the most repellant and costly crimes, which inflicts irrecoverable harms on victims and society. This study examines the effect of information technology (IT)-enabled ride-sharing platforms on sexual assaults. Drawing upon routine activity theory from the criminology literature, we posit that ride-sharing can reduce a passenger’s risk of being a suitable target of sexual assault by providing a more reliable and timely transportation option for traveling to a safer place. By exploiting the nationwide quasi-experimental setting of Uber’s city-by-city rollouts in the United States during 2005–2017, we demonstrate that Uber’s entry into a city is negatively associated with the number of rape incidents. To zoom into the effects of ride-sharing at a more granular level, we employ precinct-hour–level data on Uber pickups and rape occurrences in New York City in 2015 and conduct spatiotemporal analyses. Our results from the spatiotemporal analyses corroborate those of the quasi-experiment and further reveal situational contingencies in the deterrent effect of ride-sharing. Specifically, ride-sharing contributes to a more significant reduction in the likelihood of rape occurrences in neighborhoods with limited transportation accessibility, and ride-sharing is more effective in deterring sexual crime in riskier circumstances, such as around alcohol-serving places on weekend nights or when the probability of crime occurrences increases. This study sheds new light on the potential of IT-enabled platforms to improve social well-being beyond their economic contributions and offers a new theoretical insight on the distinct role of digital platforms in public safety.},

Real-time feedback applications enable supervisors and employees to give, seek, and receive competency-based feedback using their computers, smartphones, or other devices. In this study, we examine the role of one such real-time feedback application to understand its effects on employee performance appraisals. First, we find that relationship source (peer, subordinate, or supervisor) impacts real-time feedback: feedback tends to be more critical when it is from supervisors. What is more interesting is the effect of favoritism and retribution in real-time feedback: supervisors adopt tit-for-tat strategies, but peers do not. We also uncover that men rate women higher than men and that women rate men and women similar to how men rate men. In addition, positive real-time feedback has a stronger effect on future ratings than negative feedback. Our findings have direct implications for the design and implementation of performance management systems. Further, we highlight how companies can use information systems to create an innovative human resource operation that delivers flexibility and agility.},

In recent years, more and more platforms allowing both buyers and sellers to write reviews for each other have emerged. These bilateral reviews are important information sources in the decision-making process of both buyers and sellers but have not been properly investigated in the literature before. We develop a comprehensive relational topic modeling approach to analyze bilateral reviews to predict transaction results. The prediction results will enable the platform to increase the chance that the buyer and seller reach a transaction by presenting buyers with offerings that are more likely to lead to a transaction. Within the framework of the relational topic model, we embed a topic structure with both shared and corpus-specific topics to better handle text corpora generated from different sources. Our model facilitates the extraction of the appropriate topic structure from different document collections that helps enhance the transaction prediction performance. Comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world data sets collected from sharing economy platforms demonstrate that our new model significantly outperforms other alternatives. The robust results obtained from multiple sets of comparisons demonstrate the value of bilateral reviews if they are processed properly. Our approach can be applied to many platforms where bilateral reviews are available.},

A growing body of research suggests involving bystanders in interventions to combat deviant behaviors. In this paper, we contextualize the bystander intervention framework and reporting literature to social media in order to understand why bystanders report social media harassment. Our contextualized intervention framework focuses on three sociotechnical aspects—the online social environment, characteristics of the technology platform, and their interplay—that explain bystander reporting on social media platforms. We tested the model using data gathered from 291 active Facebook users. We found that four contextualized factors, (1) perceived emergency of the social media harassment incident, (2) perceived responsibility to report, (3) perceived self-efficacy in using built-in reporting functions, and (4) perceived outcome effectiveness of built-in reporting functions for tackling social media harassment, shaped bystanders’ willingness to intervene against social media harassment. In addition, we showed that perceived anonymity of the reporting system counterbalances the negative influence of the presence of others on bystanders’ willingness to intervene. For research, we contribute to the cyberbullying literature by offering a novel sociotechnical explanation of mechanisms that shape bystanders’ willingness to report social media harassment.

Data were collected from the official Facebook and Twitter pages of 30 U.S. car brands from 2009 to 2015. We utilized a panel vector autoregressive model to investigate the dynamic relationships among multiple time series v ariables while controlling for influential durable goods characteristics. The empirical results suggest that Facebook and Twitter have heterogeneous effects on offline vehicle sales. Moreover, FGC is more effective than UGC for influencing offline light vehicle sales. Viral impressions from Facebook and Twitter are essential, although the effects vary by social media platform (Facebook versus Twitter) and content type (FGC versus UGC). The result of the impulse response function analysis indicates that both the firm’s marketing efforts (FGC and traditional media) and UGC have a long-term effect on offline sales, with the long-term effect of a firm’s marketing efforts outlasting that of UGC. Incorporating FGC and UGC from Facebook and Twitter and traditional media could improve the performance of offline sales prediction. We also documented the within-Twitter synergistic effect between FGC and UGC for offline car sales and cross-channel substitution relationships (FGC on both Facebook and Twitter serves as a substitution to traditional media).

The results obtained from a difference-in-differences analysis with coarsened exact matching generally support our hypotheses on the direct and congruence effects of television-program-induced emotions. Findings on the direct effect suggest that television-program-induced emotional shocks have a significant effect on the arousal and valence of viewers’ online WOM toward ads.

This study examines how the two prevalent price promotion strategies affect online review ratings differently as a function of the temporal distance between purchase and review. Drawing upon the framing literature and construal level theory, we argue that whereas free shipping should increase review ratings regardless of temporal distance, coupons should increase review ratings through perceptions of monetary savings when temporal distance is close but decrease review ratings through low perceive product quality when temporal distance is far. Consistent with this argument, our analysis of online consumer reviews from an e-commerce website matched with actual transactional data finds that coupons have a positive effect on review ratings in the short run but a negative effect in the long run. In contrast, free shipping has a consistently positive effect on review ratings over time. A text-mining analysis of the review contents reveals patterns that are consistent with the proposed underlying mechanisms. We then conduct two laboratory experiments that manipulate temporal distance and construal level respectively with real spending and consumptions to provide convergent evidence for the differential effects of coupon versus free shipping on review ratings over time and additionally demonstrate the underlying processes due to perceptions of monetary savings and perceived product quality.},

Because these forums provide an alternative, free source for obtaining software support, one might suspect that the shadow competition from them would eat into the profit the vendor makes from selling support services. We find that, although such a conclusion could be right at the forum’s initial and formative stages, it may not hold later, especially if the forum generates enough momentum. This is because forums, besides playing a substitutive role, also have a complementary effect. At the initial stages, the substitutive role of the forum dominates. However, if and when the forum grows sufficiently, the complementary role eventually takes control. In the meantime, the vendor can try to mitigate the immediate losses and find temporary relief by adopting a strategy of bundling support services with the product.},

Using a structural model, we estimate the own and cross price elasticities for both mobile technologies and mobile money, and the demand effects between mobile money and mobile technologies. We find that the current, dominant technology (i.e., 3G) tends to have more robust demand as compared with other technologies that are either declining (i.e., 1G and 2G) or new to the market (i.e., 4G), and that customers are more likely to substitute forward toward newer technologies than backward toward older technologies when the price increases for a technology. We also find that mobile money differentiates the market and mitigates competition for those firms that offer mobile money. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Despite the growing popularity of online public funding for education (i.e., crowdfunding), controversy persists about whether teachers’ efforts to use this channel are justified and whether donations thus received can actually make a difference in students’ academic performance. We present the first empirical evidence of the positive influence of online education crowdfunding after teachers successfully raise funds. Using data from California public school teachers and their students, as well as the teachers’ fundraising activities on DonorsChoose.org, we find significant academic performance improvements among students after their teachers receive donations through this platform. Such improvements in students’ academic performance are stronger when more local donors participate in teachers’ fundraising campaigns. Notably, teachers who attempt to raise funds online but are unsuccessful are still able to improve their students’ performance. These findings not only document the positive impact of online education crowdfunding on students’ academic performance, but also demonstrate that such impacts are at least partially attributable to the nonfinancial motivational benefits on teachers from receiving such donations. Our study therefore contributes to the literature on crowdfunding, as well as the ongoing debates surrounding the financing of public education.},

  abstract     = {Big data and machine learning (ML) algorithms are key drivers of many fintech innovations. Although it may be obvious that replacing humans with machines would increase efficiency, it is not clear whether and how machines can improve human decisions. We answer this question in the context of crowd lending, in which decisions are traditionally made by a crowd of investors. Using data from Prosper.com, we show that a reasonably sophisticated ML algorithm predicts listing default probability more accurately than crowd investors. The improvement of the machine over the crowd predictions is more pronounced for highly risky listings. We then use the machine to make investment decisions and find that the machine improves upon investors’ decisions and leads to greater welfare for both investors and borrowers simultaneously. When machine prediction is used to select loans, it leads to a higher rate of return for investors and more funding opportunities for borrowers with few alternative funding options. We also find suggestive evidence that the machine is biased in gender and race even when it does not use gender and race information as input. We propose a general and effective “debiasing” method that can be applied to any prediction-focused ML applications and demonstrate its use in our context. We show that the debiased ML algorithm, which suffers from lower prediction accuracy, still improves the crowd’s investment decisions in our context. These results indicate that ML can help crowd-lending platforms better fulfill the promise of providing access to financial resources to otherwise underserved individuals and ensure fairness in the allocation of these resources.},

  abstract     = {Selling virtual items (e.g., clothing, weapons, or virtual furniture) serves as one of the major revenue sources for online game operators. Therefore, exploring what specific factors and design attributes may affect the sales of virtual items has become an important issue. This research draws upon prior studies on currency numerosity, contextualizing them to online game contexts to develop several theory-based predictions about how online game currency numerosity affects players’ perceived expensiveness and consequently their purchase intention of virtual items. To test these predictions, we conducted six experiments that investigate numerosity effects in massive multiplayer online games (MMOs) where players can exchange real money for game currency based on an exchange rate in order to purchase virtual items. Results indicate the following: (1) when the game currency exchange rate is not salient (e.g., game currency exchange rate is not mentioned or players have sufficient game currency in their account), players consider a virtual item as more expensive if the price is high (versus low) in numerosity; but (2) when the game currency exchange rate is salient (e.g., game currency exchange rate is mentioned and no additional information indicates that it is irrelevant), players consider a virtual item as cheaper if the price is high (versus low) in numerosity; in addition, (3) in the latter case, numerosity increases players’ purchase intention of nonsocial, but not social, virtual items through the mediating effect of perceived expensiveness. Our notable findings contribute to the existing literature on numerosity and provide guidance for the design of virtual currency systems in MMOs.},

  abstract     = {Crowdfunding aims to collect small investments from a large number of backers to support a project by fundraisers. Although uncertainty has been an important issue in the reward-based crowdfunding literature, there is limited research on how backers respond to probabilistic uncertain rewards. This study examines how backers respond to the lottery —a type of uncertain reward—and how their motivations may shape their responses to probabilistic uncertain rewards. We hypothesize (1) how backers respond to probabilistic uncertain rewards, (2) how these effects vary over time, and (3) how backer motivations moderate their response to probabilistic uncertain rewards. We empirically test our set of hypotheses using data collected from a reward-based crowdfunding platform in China. First, the results from project-level analysis show that although the lottery does help to attract a higher number of backers on a crowdfunding project, the lottery also reduces the total money raised by the project—and thus the probability of reaching its funding goal. Specifically, although the lottery incentivizes individuals who would otherwise not fund the project to become (small) lottery backers, it also cannibalizes regular prospective rewardees and donors by encouraging them to opt for the (cheaper) lottery option. Second, both the incentivizing and the cannibalizing effects of the lottery are stronger in the earlier stages of a project’s fundraising cycle. Third, our individual backer-level analysis shows that the lottery has larger effects on backers with higher prior tendencies to be donors than rewardees. Our study theoretically contributes to three streams of literature—crowdfunding, decision making under uncertainty, and the lottery. From a practical standpoint, our study informs (1) fundraisers on how to design strategies to attract the right type of backers and (2) crowdfunding platform owners on how to leverage the lottery as a type of uncertain reward in crowdfunding platforms.},

  abstract     = {Research questions surrounding phenomena in information systems (IS) are growing more complex and less amenable to simple explanations. Although many encourage the use of multiple research methods, we go further, advocating for leveraging research methods, analytic approaches, and theoretical perspectives (coined MAP) to better examine complex IS phenomena. The use of multi-MAPs benefits from the complementarity between different theoretical perspectives, that is, variance, process and systems perspectives, and the various analytic approaches that support them in addition to multiple methods. While outlining the broader context of multi-MAP research, this research note focuses on the complementarity between the variance and systems perspectives, associated analytic approaches, and supporting research methods. We use the variance and systems multi-MAPs approach to illustrate our reasoning and outline how the approach can be applied to other MAPs. In addition, we provide researchers with guidelines that they can use to state their choice of MAP based on their research questions. Finally, we demonstrate how researchers can expand their reasoning from deductive and inductive modes to an abductive reasoning process. Using this process, they can move between integrating multiple MAPs a priori within their research design to addressing emergent findings using an a posteriori addition of MAPs. An illustrative study is used to showcase the advocated multi-MAP abductive process. In this research note, we offer guidance for the study of complex phenomena using multiple MAPs through the process of abductive reasoning. In doing so, we extend the multiple methods research discourse. We also encourage researchers to be explicit and transparent in their MAP choices, whether using a single MAP or multiple MAPs.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines the fact that a significant number of empirical studies in behavioral information systems (IS) theory research engage in confirmative testing of self-evident axiomatic theories without yielding highly relevant knowledge for the IS community. To measure how pervasive such testing of axiomatic theories is, we conducted a horizontal analysis using 666 hypotheses from 72 representative behavioral IS theories and discovered that more than 60\% of the hypotheses could be regarded as axiomatic theory elements. To further investigate the pervasiveness of repetitive testing of axiomatic theories, we vertically analyzed 1,301 hypotheses from 148 articles in three theory categories: technology acceptance model, diffusion of innovation theory, and institutional theory. These analyses revealed that 68.1\% of these hypotheses were axiomatic and that 74.6\% of them were inherited from general truths beyond the IS domain. In order to shift the research emphasis toward enhancing the relevance of IS research outcomes without sacrificing methodological rigor, we propose four complementary IS research approaches: (1) identifying disconfirming boundary conditions, (2) measuring the relative importance of axiomatic causal factors, (3) measuring the stage of progression toward visionary goals when the nature of the axiomatic theory can be extended to future visions, and (4) engaging in the conceptual design of visionary axiomatic goals. We conclude with a discussion about why so many scholars devote substantial effort to reconfirming axiomatic theories and suggest avenues for more relevant research outcomes.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we explore why an online retailer would open its platform and why a third-party seller would join the platform when the third party carries products identical to those the retailer sells as well as products the retailer does not carry. When the third party joins the retailer’s platform, more consumers become aware of the third party’s existence and, thus, might become aware of the products it does not list on the retailer’s platform (e.g., by searching the seller brand online), which is called the spillover effect. We develop a game-theoretic model to first examine the spillover effect on the third-party seller’s product offering on the retailer’s platform under an exogenous commission rate and then examine the effect on the retailer’s platform-openness decision. We find that the third party’s optimal selling strategies vary with its initial awareness level, the extent of the spillover effect, and the commission rate. Furthermore, we characterize how the initial awareness level and the extent of the spillover effect together determine the retailer’s openness decision and equilibrium selling partnership. When the spillover effect is mild, the retailer opens its platform and the third-party seller sells its exclusive product on the platform. When the spillover effect is salient, if the retailer has a large awareness advantage over the third party, the retailer has no incentive to open; otherwise, the retailer opens its platform and the third party sells the identical product on the platform. Finally, we find that, compared with the case without a spillover effect, the spillover effect makes the retailer less likely to open its platform, but it makes the third party more likely to sell identical products on an open retailer platform; the spillover effect always (weakly) benefits the third party, but it does not necessarily hurt the retailer.},

We analyze the effects of content generated by human brands (referred to as human brand generated content ) on a popular social media platform, Twitter, on audience engagement. The first objective of this study is to examine the effects of positive and negative tone of human generated content on social media engagement. Next, we study the impact of popularity of human brands on the effect of tone on audience’s engagement. Building on the arguments of perception spillover effects, we also investigate the effects of content generated by related human brands on the engagement of the focal human brand. Set in the context of the 2014 Indian general election, we find that both positive-toned content and negative-toned content have a positive effect on social media engagement. We find that the popularity of a human brand negatively moderates the relationship between positive‐toned content and engagement. Our findings indicate interesting spillover effects of content created by related brands on the effectiveness of content created by a focal human brand. In particular, we find evidence for presence of the reinforcement effect, that is, the effect of negative tone on engagement is greater when the tone of related human brands is negative and the engagement is higher when the tones of both the focal human brand and related brands are positive. However, we find that the effect of negative-toned tweets of a focal human brand is lower when the tone of related human brands is positive. Our analyses account for endogeneity issues, correlated unobservables, and reflection problem. We supplement our core results with additional analyses that include alternative model specifications, alternative samples, estimation strategies, and engagement metrics.

Given the unprecedented opportunities IoT generates for brands and retailers, it is important to glean timely insights regarding the business value of IoT and understand whether the introduction of an IoT technology as an alternative purchase channel for consumers affects the sales of physical products. In this paper, using empirical data from a multinational online retailer that adopted an IoT technology that largely automates consumers’ purchases and a quasi-experimental framework, we study the effect of the introduction of IoT on product sales. Our analyses reveal a statistically and economically significant increase in sales as a result of adopting an IoT technology and demonstrate the business value of the IoT channel for retailers and brands. In addition, we conduct analyses of the IoT phenomenon to also delve into the effect heterogeneity and empirically validate the underlying mechanism by examining the impact of IoT for products in different price ranges, levels of substitutability, and product categories (e.g., search versus experience goods and hedonic versus utilitarian), drawing on mental accounting and automaticity theory. For instance, our analyses reveal that less expensive and more differentiated products as well as experience and utilitarian goods can accrue higher benefits leveraging more effectively novel IoT technologies. We validate the robustness of our findings using an extensive set of robustness checks and falsification tests. This is the first paper to study the impact of an IoT technology on product sales, drawing important theoretical and managerial implications and seeding new future research directions for devices and technologies largely automating the purchase process.},

  abstract     = {Product-fit uncertainty is cited as one of the top reasons for high online product return rates. Fit describes how well a product suits a consumer’s needs. The value of a product drops sharply when it deviates from a customer’s ideal fit. In this study, we focus on ordinal fit, a type of fit attribute that can be ordered on a scale—for example, the size of apparel or the difficulty level of courses. By leveraging a change in the product-review system at an online retailer, we examine the impacts of two types of fit information— fit valence (an overall evaluation of a product’s ordinal-fit attribute) and fit reference (a reviewer’s ordinal-fit attribute and her choice of the product’s fit attribute)—on returns of apparel goods. Using the lens of advice taking, we reveal the important role of the context of fit opinions (i.e., fit reference) in facilitating shoppers to better interpret fit valence by enabling effective ordinal-fit adjustment and, consequently, reducing product returns. We employ a predictive analytics framework for counterfactual prediction via the Generalized Synthetic Control method to address endogeneity issues and shed light on the dynamic treatment effect. Our findings indicate that fit valence alone can lower product returns only in a limited situation—when the majority of reviewers agree on the fit valence. In other cases—when either the fit valences are inconsistent or few and far between—it is the combination of fit valence and fit reference that lowers product returns. With the availability of both types of fit information, similar reviewers play an important role in helping improve the accuracy in ordinal-fit adjustments. Yet, albeit less effective, information from reviewers with dissimilar body sizes can also help make useful ordinal-fit adjustments. Besides, shoppers appear to benefit from both positive and negative fit valences, as long as they are aided by fit reference. Our empirical insights are relevant to many situations where ordinal-fit attributes dominate consumers’ product-evaluation process. Accordingly, we provide useful implications for online sellers grappling with high product return rates.},
