  abstract     = {Momentum stochastic gradient descent (MSGD) algorithm has been widely applied to many nonconvex optimization problems in machine learning (e.g., training deep neural networks, variational Bayesian inference, etc.). Despite its empirical success, there is still a lack of theoretical understanding of convergence properties of MSGD. To fill this gap, we propose to analyze the algorithmic behavior of MSGD by diffusion approximations for nonconvex optimization problems with strict saddle points and isolated local optima. Our study shows that the momentum helps escape from saddle points but hurts the convergence within the neighborhood of optima (if without the step size annealing or momentum annealing). Our theoretical discovery partially corroborates the empirical success of MSGD in training deep neural networks.},

The rare event of interest is that a d -dimensional positive recurrent SRBM enters the set { z ∈ R + d : ∑ k = 1 d z k ≥ n } before hitting a small neighborhood of the origin { z ∈ R + d : ∑ k = 1 d z k ≤ ϵ } as n → ∞ with a starting point outside the two sets and of order o ( n ). We show that, under two regularity conditions (the Dupuis–Williams stability condition of the SRBM and the Lipschitz continuity assumption of the associated Skorokhod problem), the probability of the rare event satisfies a large deviation principle. To study the variational problem (VP) for the rare event in two dimensions, we adapt its exact solution from developed by Avram, Dai, and Hasenbein in 2001. In three and higher dimensions, we construct a novel subsolution to the VP under a further assumption that the reflection matrix of the SRBM is a nonsingular M -matrix. Based on the solution/subsolution, particle-based simulation algorithms are constructed to estimate the probability of the rare event. Our estimator is asymptotically optimal for the discretized problem in two dimensions and has exponentially superior performance over standard Monte Carlo in three and higher dimensions. In addition, we establish that the growth rate of the relative bias term arising from discretization is subexponential in all dimensions. Therefore, we can estimate the probability of interest with subexponential complexity growth in two dimensions. In three and higher dimensions, the computational complexity of our estimators has a strictly smaller exponential growth rate than the standard Monte Carlo estimators.},

  abstract     = {We establish mean-field limits for large-scale random-access networks with buffer dynamics and arbitrary interference graphs. Although saturated buffer scenarios have been widely investigated and yield useful throughput estimates for persistent sessions, they fail to capture the fluctuations in buffer contents over time and provide no insight in the delay performance of flows with intermittent packet arrivals. Motivated by that issue, we explore in the present paper random-access networks with buffer dynamics, where flows with empty buffers refrain from competition for the medium. The occurrence of empty buffers thus results in a complex dynamic interaction between activity states and buffer contents, which severely complicates the performance analysis. Hence, we focus on a many-sources regime where the total number of nodes grows large, which not only offers mathematical tractability but is also highly relevant with the densification of wireless networks as the Internet of Things emerges. We exploit timescale separation properties to prove that the properly scaled buffer occupancy process converges to the solution of a deterministic initial value problem and establish the existence and uniqueness of the associated fixed point. This approach simplifies the performance analysis of networks with huge numbers of nodes to a low-dimensional fixed-point calculation. For the case of a complete interference graph, we demonstrate asymptotic stability, provide a simple closed form expression for the fixed point, and prove interchange of the mean-field and steady-state limits. This yields asymptotically exact approximations for key performance metrics, in particular the stationary buffer content and packet delay distributions.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of optimally controlling the drift of a Brownian motion with a finite set of possible drift rates so as to minimize the long-run average cost, consisting of fixed costs for changing the drift rate, processing costs for maintaining the drift rate, holding costs on the state of the process, and costs for instantaneous controls to keep the process within a prescribed range. We show that, under mild assumptions on the processing costs and the fixed costs for changing the drift rate, there is a strongly ordered optimal policy, that is, an optimal policy that limits the use of each drift rate to a single interval; when the process reaches the upper limit of that interval, the policy either changes to the next lower drift rate deterministically or resorts to instantaneous controls to keep the process within the prescribed range, and when the process reaches the lower limit of the interval, the policy either changes to the next higher drift rate deterministically or again resorts to instantaneous controls to keep the process within the prescribed range. We prove the optimality of such a policy by constructing smooth relative value functions satisfying the associated simplified optimality criteria. This paper shows that, under the proportional changeover cost assumption, each drift rate is active in at most one contiguous range and that the transitions between drift rates are strongly ordered. The results reduce the complexity of proving the optimality of such a policy by proving the existence of optimal relative value functions that constitute a nondecreasing sequence of functions. As a consequence, the constructive arguments lead to a practical procedure for solving the problem that is tens of thousands of times faster than previously reported methods.},

Resource collaboration and multitasking give rise to synchronization constraints in resource scheduling when the resources are not divisible, that is, when the resources cannot be split. The synchronization constraints affect the system performance significantly. For example, because of those constraints, the system capacity can be strictly less than the capacity of the bottleneck resource. Furthermore, the resource scheduling decisions are not trivial under those constraints. For example, not all static prioritization policies retain the maximum system capacity, and the ones that retain the maximum system capacity do not necessarily minimize the delay (or, in general, the holding cost). We study optimal scheduling control of a class of parallel networks and propose a dynamic prioritization policy that retains the maximum system capacity and is asymptotically optimal in diffusion scale and a conventional heavy-traffic regime with respect to the expected discounted total holding cost objective.},

  abstract     = {A service system with multiple types of arriving customers is considered. There is an infinite number of homogeneous servers. Multiple customers can be placed for simultaneous service into one server, subject to general packing constraints . The service times of different customers are independent even if they are served simultaneously by the same server; the service time distribution depends on the customer type. Each new arriving customer is placed for service immediately into either an occupied server, that is, one already serving other customers, as long as packing constraints are not violated or into an empty server. After service completion, each customer leaves its server and the system. The basic objective is to minimize the number of occupied servers in steady state. We study a greedy random (GRAND) placement (packing) algorithm, introduced in our previous work. This is a simple online algorithm that places each arriving customer uniformly at random into either one of the already occupied servers that can still fit the customer or one of the so-called zero servers , which are empty servers designated to be available to new arrivals. In our previous work, a version of the algorithm, labeled GRAND( aZ ), is considered, in which the number of zero servers is aZ with Z being the current total number of customers in the system and positive a being an algorithm parameter. GRAND( aZ ) is shown in our previous work to be asymptotically optimal in the following sense: (a) the steady-state optimality gap grows linearly in the system scale r (the mean total number of customers in service), that is, as c ( a ) r for some positive c(a) , and (b) c(a) vanishes as a goes to zero. In this paper, we consider the GRAND( Z p ) algorithm, in which the number of zero servers is Z p , where p &lt; 1 is a fixed parameter, sufficiently close to 1. We prove the asymptotic optimality of GRAND( Z p ) in the sense that the steady-state optimality gap is sublinear in the system scale r. This is a stronger form of asymptotic optimality than that of GRAND( aZ ).},

The main computational advantage of Tseng’s algorithm is that it relies only on a single projection step and two independent queries of a stochastic oracle. Our algorithm incorporates a minibatch sampling mechanism and leads to almost sure convergence to an optimal solution.

One side of our model stores back orders, and the other side represents inventory. We assume first-come-first-served instantaneous fulfillment discipline. Our goal is to determine the optimal (nonstationary) production rate over a finite time horizon to minimize the costs incurred by the system. In addition to the inventory-related (holding and perishment) and demand-related (waiting and abandonment) costs, we consider a cost that penalizes rapid fluctuations of production rates. We develop a deterministic fluid-control problem (FCP) that serves as a performance lower bound for the original queueing-control problem (QCP). We further consider a high-volume system for which an upper bound of the gap between the optimal values of the QCP and FCP is characterized and construct an asymptotically optimal production rate for the QCP, under which the FCP lower bound is achieved asymptotically. Demonstrated by numerical examples, the proposed asymptotically optimal production rate successfully captures the time variability of the nonstationary demand.},

  abstract     = {We investigate a spreading process where each agent is represented by a continuous-time Markov chain with two states, L and M . State L refers to “home,” whereas state M refers to a “meeting place.” When two agents stay together at M , they “meet” and form a contact. This means, according to the application, that they can exchange information, infect each other, perform an act of trade, and so on. We assume that initially all are at state L , and exactly one of the agents possesses a piece of information (or is infected by a contagious disease, etc.) The process can generally be classified as a spreading process with mobile agents, and its simplicity allows us to demonstrate several interesting properties. We provide an efficient way for computing the propagation time and investigate the dependence of the spreading process on parameters such as the number of agents, the number of uninformed agents at the end of the process, and the contact intensity.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by developments in renewable energy and smart grids, we formulate a stylized mathematical model of a transport network with stochastic load fluctuations. Using an affine control rule, we explore the trade-off between the number of controllable resources in a lossy transport network and the performance gain they yield in terms of expected power losses. Our results are explicit and reveal the interaction between the level of flexibility, the intrinsic load uncertainty, and the network structure.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a stochastic model that describes the evolution of vehicle densities in a road network. It is consistent with the class of (deterministic) kinematic wave models, which describe traffic flows based on conservation laws that incorporate the macroscopic fundamental diagram (a functional relationship between vehicle density and flow). Our setup is capable of handling multiple types of vehicle densities, with general macroscopic fundamental diagrams, on a network with arbitrary topology. Interpreting our system as a spatial population process, we derive, under natural scaling, fluid, and diffusion limits. More specifically, the vehicle density process can be approximated with a suitable Gaussian process, which yield accurate normal approximations to the joint (in the spatial and temporal sense) vehicle density process. The corresponding means and variances can be computed efficiently. Along the same lines, we develop an approximation to the vehicles’ travel time distribution between any given origin and destination pair. Finally, we present a series of numerical experiments that demonstrate the accuracy of the approximations and illustrate the usefulness of the results.},
