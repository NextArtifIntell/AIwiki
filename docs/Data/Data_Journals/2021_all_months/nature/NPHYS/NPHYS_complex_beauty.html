  abstract     = {Organisms acquire and use information from their environment to guide their behaviour. However, it is unclear whether this information quantitatively limits their performance at behavioural tasks. Here we relate information to the ability of Escherichia coli to navigate up chemical gradients, the behaviour known as chemotaxis. First, we derive a theoretical limit on the speed with which cells climb gradients, given the rate at which they acquire information. Next, we measure cells’ gradient-climbing speeds and the rate of information acquisition by their chemotaxis signalling pathway. We find that E. coli cells make behavioural decisions with much less than the one bit required to determine whether they are swimming up the gradient. Some of this information is irrelevant to gradient climbing, and some is lost in communication to behaviour. Despite these limitations, E. coli cells climb gradients at speeds within a factor of two of the theoretical bound. Thus, information can limit the performance of an organism, and sensory–motor pathways may have evolved to efficiently use information acquired from the environment. Information theory sets an upper limit on the ability of bacteria to navigate up chemical gradients. Experiments reveal that cells do so at speeds within a factor of two of the limit, suggesting they are selected to efficiently use information.},

A cornerstone of such networks is an interface between telecom photons and quantum memories, which has proven challenging for the case of spin-mechanical memories. Here we demonstrate a novel approach based on cavity optomechanics that utilizes the susceptibility of spin qubits to strain. We use it to control electronic spins of nitrogen vacancy centres in diamond with photons in the 1,550 nm telecommunication wavelength band. This method does not involve qubit optical transitions and is insensitive to spectral diffusion. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to solid-state qubits in a wide variety of materials, expanding the toolbox for quantum information processing. Quantum networks require a connection between quantum memories and optical links, which often operate in different frequency ranges. An optomechanical device exploiting the strain dependence of a colour-centre spin provides such a spin–optics interface at room temperature.},

Although signatures of topological superconductivity have been reported in heterostructures, material realizations of intrinsic topological superconductors are rather rare. Here we use scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to study the transition metal dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS2 that interleaves superconducting 1H-TaS2 layers with strongly correlated 1T-TaS2 layers, and find spectroscopic evidence for the existence of topological surface superconductivity. These include edge modes running along the 1H-layer terminations as well as under the 1T-layer terminations, where they separate between superconducting regions of distinct topological nature. We also observe signatures of zero-bias states in vortex cores. All the boundary modes exhibit crystallographic anisotropy, which—together with a finite in-gap density of states throughout the 1H layers—allude to the presence of a topological nodal-point superconducting state. Our theoretical modelling attributes this phenomenology to an inter-orbital pairing channel that necessitates the combination of surface mirror symmetry breaking and strong interactions. It, thus, suggests a topological superconducting state realized in a natural compound. Scanning tunnelling microscopy provides evidence for topological superconductivity in a naturally occurring transition metal dichalcogenide material.},

  abstract     = {Protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus move in shells analogous to the electronic shell structures of atoms. The nuclear shell structure varies as a result of changes in the nuclear mean field with the number of neutrons N and protons Z, and these variations can be probed by measuring the mass differences between nuclei. The N = Z = 40 self-conjugate nucleus 80Zr is of particular interest, as its proton and neutron shell structures are expected to be very similar, and its ground state is highly deformed. Here we provide evidence for the existence of a deformed double-shell closure in 80Zr through high-precision Penning trap mass measurements of 80–83Zr. Our mass values show that 80Zr is substantially lighter, and thus more strongly bound than predicted. This can be attributed to the deformed shell closure at N = Z = 40 and the large Wigner energy. A statistical Bayesian-model mixing analysis employing several global nuclear mass models demonstrates difficulties with reproducing the observed mass anomaly using current theory. High-precision mass measurements of exotic zirconium nuclei are reported, and reveal a double-shell closure for the deformed nucleus 80Zr, which is more strongly bound than previously thought.},

  abstract     = {Ultralight axion-like particles are well-motivated dark matter candidates introduced by theories beyond the standard model of particle physics. However, directly constraining their parameter space with laboratory experiments usually yields weaker limits than indirect approaches relying on astrophysical observations. Here we report the search for axion-like particles with a quantum sensor in the mass range of 8.3–744.0 feV. The sensor makes use of hyperpolarized long-lived nuclear spins as a pre-amplifier that effectively enhances a coherently oscillating axion-like dark matter field by a factor of more than 100. Using these spin-based amplifiers, we achieve an ultrahigh magnetic sensitivity of 18 fT Hz–(1/2), which exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art nuclear spin magnetometers. Our experiment constrains the parameter space describing the coupling of axion-like particles to nucleons over the aforementioned mass range, namely, at 67.5 feV reaching 2.9 × 10−9 GeV−1, improving on previous laboratory constraints by at least five orders of magnitude. Our measurements also constrain the quadratic interaction between axion-like particles and nucleons as well as interactions between dark photons and nucleons, exceeding bounds from astrophysical observations. A search for axion-like dark matter with a quantum sensor that enhances potential signals is reported. This work constrains the parameter space of different interactions between nucleons and axion-like particles and between nucleons and dark photons.},

We search the data, consisting of correlated measurements from optical atomic magnetometers located in laboratories all over the world, for patterns of signals propagating through the network consistent with domain walls. The analysis of these data from a continuous month-long operation of GNOME finds no statistically significant signals, thus placing experimental constraints on such dark matter scenarios.

In contexts such as bacterial growth, tumorigenesis and stem cell reprogramming2–4, this phenomenon is often attributed to pre-existing propensities for dominance, whereas in stem cell homeostasis, neutral drift dynamics are invoked5,6. The mechanistic origin of clonal dominance during development, where it is increasingly documented1,6–8, is less understood. Here, we investigate this phenomenon in the Drosophila melanogaster follicle epithelium, a system in which the joint growth dynamics of cell lineage trees can be reconstructed. We demonstrate that clonal dominance can emerge spontaneously, in the absence of pre-existing biases, as a collective property of evolving excitable networks through coupling of divisions among connected cells. Similar mechanisms have been identified in forest fires and evolving opinion networks9–11; we show that the spatial coupling of excitable units explains a critical feature of the development of the organism, with implications for tissue organization and dynamics1,12,13. As tissues grow, a small fraction of cells can give rise to a large fraction of the tissue. A model borrowed from forest fires suggests that this can occur spontaneously in development as a collective property of the cell interaction network.},

  abstract     = {The early development of many organisms involves the folding of cell monolayers, but this behaviour is difficult to reproduce in vitro; therefore, both mechanistic causes and effects of local curvature remain unclear. Here we study epithelial cell monolayers on corrugated hydrogels engineered into wavy patterns, examining how concave and convex curvatures affect cellular and nuclear shape. We find that substrate curvature affects monolayer thickness, which is larger in valleys than crests. We show that this feature generically arises in a vertex model, leading to the hypothesis that cells may sense curvature by modifying the thickness of the tissue. We find that local curvature also affects nuclear morphology and positioning, which we explain by extending the vertex model to take into account membrane–nucleus interactions, encoding thickness modulation in changes to nuclear deformation and position. We propose that curvature governs the spatial distribution of yes-associated proteins via nuclear shape and density changes. We show that curvature also induces significant variations in lamins, chromatin condensation and cell proliferation rate in folded epithelial tissues. Together, this work identifies active cell mechanics and nuclear mechanoadaptation as the key players of the mechanistic regulation of epithelia to substrate curvature. Experiments on cell monolayers on corrugated hydrogels reveal the effects of local curvature on the shape of cells and nuclei. A vertex model lends support to the idea that the modulation of tissue thickness may enable curvature sensing.},

  abstract     = {Flat electronic bands, characteristic of ‘magic-angle’ twisted bilayer graphene, host many correlated phenomena1–9. Nevertheless, many properties of these bands and emerging symmetry-broken phases are still poorly understood. Here we use scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to examine the evolution of the twisted bilayer graphene bands and related gapped phases as the twist angle between the two graphene layers changes. We detect filling-dependent flattening of the bands that is appreciable even when the angle is well above the magic angle value and so the material is nominally in a weakly correlated regime. Upon approaching the magic angle, we further show that the most prominent correlated gaps begin to emerge when band flattening is maximized around certain integer fillings of electrons per moiré unit cell. Our observations are consistent with a model that suggests that a significant enhancement of the density of states caused by the band flattening triggers a cascade of symmetry-breaking transitions. Finally, we explore the temperature dependence of the cascade and identify gapped features that develop in a broad range of band fillings where superconductivity is expected. Our results highlight the role of interaction-driven band flattening in defining the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene. Twisted bilayer graphene hosts flat electronic bands, but their relationship to the observed correlated phases is still debated. Here, it is shown that electron–electron interactions can help to flatten the bands and generate the correlated phases.},

  abstract     = {Magnons enable the transfer of a magnetic moment or spin over macroscopic distances. In quantum Hall ferromagnets, it has been predicted1 that spin and charge are entangled, meaning that any change in the spin texture modifies the charge distribution. As a direct consequence of this entanglement, magnons should carry an electric dipole moment. Here we report evidence of this electric dipole moment in a graphene quantum Hall ferromagnet2,3 using a Mach–Zehnder interferometer. As magnons propagate across the insulating bulk, their electric dipole moment modifies the Aharonov–Bohm flux through the interferometer, affecting both phase and visibility of the interference pattern. In particular, we relate the phase shift to the sign of this electric dipole moment and the loss of visibility to the flux of emitted magnons, and we show that the magnon emission is a Poissonian process. Finally, we probe the emission energy threshold of the magnons for transient states, between ν = 0 and ν = 1, and link them to the emergence of the gapless mode predicted in the canted-antiferromagnetic phase at charge neutrality4,5. The ability to couple the spin degree of freedom to an electrostatic potential is a property of quantum Hall ferromagnets that could be promising for spintronics. Propagating spin waves known as magnons are expected to carry a dipole moment in the quantum Hall regime. Now, this moment has been detected, demonstrating that the degrees of freedom of spin and charge are entangled in quantum Hall magnons.},

Here we report the observation of these atom pairs in the depletion of an equilibrium interacting Bose gas5. Our measurements of atom–atom correlations, both at opposite and close-by momenta6,7, allow us to characterize the equilibrium many-body state. We also show that the atom pairs share the properties of two-mode squeezed states8,9, including relative number squeezing10–12. Our results illustrate how interacting systems acquire non-trivial quantum correlations as a result of the interplay between quantum fluctuations and interactions13. Interactions between atoms in a Bose–Einstein condensate cause quantum fluctuations and the creation of additional correlations between pairs of atoms. These effects have now been directly observed, confirming long-standing theoretical predictions.},

  abstract     = {A rich variety of physical effects in spin dynamics arise at the interface between different magnetic materials1. Engineered systems with interlaced magnetic structures have been used to implement spin transistors, memories and other spintronic devices2,3. However, experiments in solid-state systems can be difficult to interpret because of disorder and losses. Here we realize analogues of magnetic junctions using a coherently coupled mixture of ultracold bosonic gases. The spatial inhomogeneity of the atomic gas makes the system change its behaviour from regions with oscillating magnetization—resembling a magnetic material in the presence of an external transverse field—to regions with a defined magnetization, similar to magnetic materials with ferromagnetic anisotropy stronger than external fields. Starting from a far-from-equilibrium fully polarized state, magnetic interfaces rapidly form. At the interfaces, we observe the formation of short-wavelength magnetic waves. They are generated by a quantum torque contribution to the spin current and produce strong spatial anticorrelations in the magnetization. Our results establish ultracold gases as a platform for the study of far-from-equilibrium spin dynamics in regimes that are not easily accessible in solid-state systems. The evolution of many-body magnetic spin systems is influenced by many factors, including inhomogeneity and the presence of interfaces. These effects have now been measured in a far-from-equilibrium binary mixture of ultracold gases.},

  abstract     = {Lanthanide atoms have an unusual electron configuration, with a partially filled shell of f orbitals. This leads to a set of characteristic properties, including large numbers of optical transitions with widely varying wavelengths and transition strengths, anisotropic interaction properties between atoms and with light, and a large magnetic moment and spin space present in the ground state, that enable enhanced control over ultracold atoms and their interactions. These features, in turn, enable new forms of control as well as novel many-body phenomena. Microkelvin temperatures can be reached by narrow-line laser cooling and evaporative cooling through universal dipolar scattering. The properties and tunability of the interatomic interactions have enabled observations of a rotonic dispersion relation, self-bound liquid-like droplets stabilized by quantum fluctuations and supersolid states. Here we describe how the unusual level structure of lanthanide atoms leads to these key features and provide a brief and necessarily partial overview of experimental progress in this rapidly developing field. The detailed structure of each atomic species determines what physics can be achieved with ultracold gases. This review discusses the exciting applications that follow from lanthanides’ complex electronic structure.},

  abstract     = {Floquet engineering is the concept of tailoring a system by a periodic drive, and it is increasingly employed in many areas of physics. Ultracold atoms in optical lattices offer a particularly large toolbox to design a variety of driving schemes. A strong motivation for developing these methods is the prospect to study the interplay between topology and interactions in a system where both ingredients are fully tunable. We review the recent successes of Floquet engineering in realizing new classes of Hamiltonians in quantum gases, such as Hamiltonians including artificial gauge fields, topological band structures and density-dependent tunnelling. The creation of periodically driven systems also gives rise to phenomena without static counterparts such as anomalous Floquet topological insulators. We discuss the challenges facing the field, particularly the control of heating mechanisms, which currently limit the preparation of many-body phases, as well as the potential future developments as these obstacles are overcome. The freedom to manipulate quantum gases with external fields makes them an ideal platform for studying many-body physics. Floquet engineering using time-periodic modulations has greatly expanded the range of accessible models and phenomena.},

They have traditionally been produced in harmonic electromagnetic traps and thus had inhomogeneous densities, but recent advances in light shaping for optical trapping of neutral particles have led to the development of flat-bottomed optical box traps, allowing the creation of homogeneous samples. Box trapping simplifies the interpretation of experimental results, provides more direct connections with theory and, in some cases, allows qualitatively new, hitherto impossible experiments. It has now been achieved for both Bose and Fermi atomic gases in various dimensionalities, and also for gases of heteronuclear molecules. Here we review these developments and the consequent breakthroughs in the study of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena such as superfluidity, turbulence and the dynamics of phase transitions. Optical box traps create a potential landscape for quantum gases that is close to the homogeneous theoretical ideal. This Review of box trapping methods highlights the breakthroughs in experimental many-body physics that have followed their development.},

As they are based on atom–light interactions, the whole quantum optics toolbox can be used to tailor the detection process to the specific scientific question to be explored in the experiment. Common methods include time-of-flight measurements to access the momentum distribution of the gas, the use of cavities to monitor global properties of the quantum gas with minimal disturbance, and phase-contrast or high-intensity absorption imaging to obtain local real-space information in high-density settings. Even the ultimate limit of detecting each and every atom locally has been realized in two dimensions using so-called quantum gas microscopes. In fact, these microscopes have not only revolutionized detection—they have also revolutionized the control of lattice gases. Here, we provide a short overview of quantum gas microscopy, highlighting the new observables it can access as well as key experiments that have been enabled by its development. Ultracold gases provide a platform for idealized realizations of many-body systems.

  abstract     = {The life and death of an organism rely on correct cell division, which occurs through the process of mitosis. Although the biochemical signalling and morphogenetic processes during mitosis are well understood, the importance of mechanical forces and material properties is only just starting to be discovered. Recent studies have revealed that the layer of proteins beneath the cell membrane—the so-called cell cortex—stiffens during mitosis, but it is as yet unclear whether mechanical changes occur in the rest of the material in the cell, contained in the cytoplasm. Here we show that, in contrast to the cortical stiffening, the interior of the cell undergoes a softening and an increase in dissipative timescale, similar to viscoelastic relaxation. These mechanical changes are accompanied by a decrease in the active forces that drive particle mobility. Using optical tweezers to perform microrheology measurements, we capture the complex active and passive material states of the cytoplasm using six relevant parameters, of which only two vary considerably during mitosis. We demonstrate a role switch between microtubules and actin that could contribute to the observed softening. The cell cortex stiffens during cell division, facilitating the necessary shape changes. Microrheology measurements now reveal that the rest of the cell interior actually softens, in a process that probably involves two key biomolecules trading roles.},

  abstract     = {Active materials are characterized by continuous injection of energy at the microscopic level and typically cannot be adequately described by equilibrium thermodynamics. Here we study a class of active fluids in which equilibrium-like properties emerge when fluctuating and activated degrees of freedom are statistically decoupled, such that their mutual information is negligible. We analyse three paradigmatic systems: chiral active fluids composed of spinning frictional particles that are free to translate, oscillating granular gases and active Brownian rollers. In all of these systems, a single effective temperature generated by activity parameterizes both the equation of state and the emergent Boltzmann statistics. The same effective temperature, renormalized by velocity correlations, relates viscosities to steady-state stress fluctuations via a Green–Kubo relation. To rationalize these observations, we develop a theory for the fluctuating hydrodynamics of these non-equilibrium fluids and validate it through large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Our work sheds light on the microscopic origin of odd viscosities and stress fluctuations characteristic of parity-violating fluids, in which mirror symmetry and detailed balance are broken. Active fluids exhibit properties reminiscent of equilibrium systems when their degrees of freedom are statistically decoupled. A theory for the fluctuating hydrodynamics of these fluids offers a probe of their anomalous transport coefficients.},

  abstract     = {The most well-known example of an ordered quantum state—superconductivity—is caused by the formation and condensation of pairs of electrons. Fundamentally, what distinguishes a superconducting state from a normal state is a spontaneously broken symmetry corresponding to the long-range coherence of pairs of electrons, leading to zero resistivity and diamagnetism. Here we report a set of experimental observations in hole-doped Ba1−xKxFe2As2. Our specific-heat measurements indicate the formation of fermionic bound states when the temperature is lowered from the normal state. However, when the doping level is x ≈ 0.8, instead of the characteristic onset of diamagnetic screening and zero resistance expected below the superconducting phase transition, we observe the opposite effect: the generation of self-induced magnetic fields in the resistive state, measured by spontaneous Nernst effect and muon spin rotation experiments. This combined evidence indicates the existence of a bosonic metal state in which Cooper pairs of electrons lack coherence, but the system spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry. The observations are consistent with the theory of a state with fermionic quadrupling, in which long-range order exists not between Cooper pairs but only between pairs of pairs. A state that breaks time-reversal symmetry is observed in the normal phase above the superconducting critical temperature in a multiband superconductor. This could be explained by correlations between the Cooper pairs formed in different bands.},

  abstract     = {A coherent ensemble of spins interfaced with a proxy qubit is an attractive platform to create many-body coherences and probe the regime of collective excitations. An electron spin qubit in a semiconductor quantum dot can act as such an interface to the dense nuclear spin ensemble within the quantum dot consisting of multiple high-spin atomic species. Earlier work has shown that the electron can relay properties of its nuclear environment through the statistics of its mean-field interaction with the total nuclear polarization, namely its mean and variance. Here, we demonstrate a method to probe the spin state of a nuclear ensemble that exploits its response to collective spin excitations, enabling a species-selective reconstruction beyond the mean field. For the accessible range of optically prepared mean fields, the reconstructed populations indicate that the ensemble is in a non-thermal, correlated nuclear state. The sum over reconstructed species-resolved polarizations exceeds the classical prediction threefold. This stark deviation follows from a spin ensemble that contains inter-particle coherences, and serves as an entanglement witness that confirms the formation of a dark many-body state. Atoms in a semiconductor can have non-zero nuclear spins, creating a large ensemble with many quantum degrees of freedom. An electron spin coupled to the nuclei of a semiconductor quantum dot can witness the creation of entanglement within the ensemble.},

  abstract     = {Topological phases of matter connect mathematical principles to real materials, and may shape future electronic and quantum technologies. So far, this discipline has mostly focused on single-gap topology described by topological invariants such as Chern numbers. Here, based on a tunable kagome model, we observe non-Abelian band topology and its transitions in acoustic semimetals, in which the multi-gap Hilbert space plays a key role. In non-Abelian semimetals, the topological charges of band nodes are converted through the braiding of nodes in adjacent gaps, and their behaviour cannot be captured by conventional topological band theory. Using kagome acoustic metamaterials and pump–probe measurements, we demonstrate the emergence of non-Abelian topological nodes, identify their dispersions and observe the induced multi-gap topological edge states. By controlling the geometry of the metamaterials, topological transitions are induced by the creation, annihilation, merging and splitting of band nodes. This reveals the underlying rules for the conversion and transfer of non-Abelian topological charges in multiple bandgaps. The resulting laws that govern the evolution of band nodes in non-Abelian multi-gap systems should inspire studies on multi-band topological semimetals and multi-gap topological out-of-equilibrium systems. Non-Abelian topology allows topological charges in multi-gap systems to be converted by braiding of different band nodes. Such multi-gap effects are experimentally observed in an acoustic semimetal.},

  abstract     = {In the phase diagram of water, superionic ices with highly mobile protons within the stable oxygen sublattice have been predicted at high pressures. However, the existence of superionic ices and the location of the melting line have been challenging to determine from both theory and experiments, yielding contradictory results depending on the employed techniques and the interpretation of the data. Here we report high-pressure and high-temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy measurements of water in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell and reveal first-order phase transitions to ices with body-centred and face-centred cubic oxygen lattices. Based on the distinct density, increased optical conductivity and the greatly decreased fusion enthalpies, we assign these observed structures to the theoretically predicted superionic ice phases. Our measurements determine the pressure–temperature stability fields of superionic ice phases and the melting line, suggesting the presence of face-centred cubic superionic ice in water-rich giant planets, such as Neptune and Uranus. The melting line determined here is at higher temperatures than previously determined in static compression experiments, but it is in agreement with theoretical calculations and data from shock-wave experiments. Measurements of the phase diagram of water reveal first-order phase transitions to face- and body-centred cubic superionic ice phases. The former is suggested to be present in the interior of ice giant planets.},

  abstract     = {Most water in the Universe may be superionic, and its thermodynamic and transport properties are crucial for planetary science but difficult to probe experimentally or theoretically. We use machine learning and free-energy methods to overcome the limitations of quantum mechanical simulations and characterize hydrogen diffusion, superionic transitions and phase behaviours of water at extreme conditions. We predict that close-packed superionic phases, which have a fraction of mixed stacking for finite systems, are stable over a wide temperature and pressure range, whereas a body-centred cubic superionic phase is only thermodynamically stable in a small window but is kinetically favoured. Our phase boundaries, which are consistent with existing—albeit scarce—experimental observations, help resolve the fractions of insulating ice, different superionic phases and liquid water inside ice giants. Superionic water is believed to exist in the interior of ice giant planets. By combining machine learning and free-energy methods, the phase behaviours of water at the extreme pressures and temperatures prevalent in such planets are predicted.},

  abstract     = {Recent successes in producing intermediate-scale quantum devices have focused interest on establishing whether near-term devices could outperform classical computers for practical applications. A central question is whether noise can be overcome in the absence of quantum error correction or if it fundamentally restricts any potential quantum advantage. We present a transparent way of comparing classical and quantum algorithms running on noisy devices for a large family of tasks that includes optimization and variational eigenstate solving. Our approach is based on entropic inequalities that determine how fast the quantum state converges to the fixed point of the noise model, together with established classical methods of Gibbs state simulation. Our techniques are extremely versatile and so may be applied to a large variety of algorithms, noise models and quantum computing architectures. We use our result to provide estimates for problems within reach of current experiments, such as quantum annealers or variational quantum algorithms. The bounds we obtain indicate that substantial quantum advantages are unlikely for classical optimization unless noise rates are decreased by orders of magnitude or the topology of the problem matches that of the device. This is the case even if the number of available qubits increases substantially. Current quantum computers do not have error correction, which means noise may prevent them outperforming classical devices in useful tasks. An analysis of quantum optimization shows that current noise levels are too high to produce a quantum advantage.},

  abstract     = {In the presence of interactions, electrons in condensed-matter systems can behave hydrodynamically, exhibiting phenomena associated with classical fluids, such as vortices and Poiseuille flow1–3. In most conductors, electron–electron interactions are minimized by screening effects, hindering the search for hydrodynamic materials; however, recently, a class of semimetals has been reported to exhibit prominent interactions4,5. Here we study the current flow in the layered semimetal tungsten ditelluride by imaging the local magnetic field using a nitrogen-vacancy defect in a diamond. We image the spatial current profile within three-dimensional tungsten ditelluride and find that it exhibits non-uniform current density, indicating hydrodynamic flow. Our temperature-resolved current profile measurements reveal a non-monotonic temperature dependence, with the strongest hydrodynamic effects at approximately 20 K. We also report ab initio calculations showing that electron–electron interactions are not explained by the Coulomb interaction alone, but are predominantly mediated by phonons. This provides a promising avenue in the search for hydrodynamic flow and prominent electron interactions in high-carrier-density materials. When interactions between electrons in a material are strong, they can start to behave hydrodynamically. Spatially resolved imaging of current flow in a three-dimensional material suggests that electron–electron interactions are mediated by phonons.},

  abstract     = {The interplay between strong electron–electron interactions and band topology can produce electronic states that spontaneously break symmetries. The discovery of flat bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG)1–3 with non-trivial topology4–7 has provided a compelling platform in which to search for new symmetry-broken phases. Recent scanning tunnelling microscopy8,9 and transport experiments10–13 have revealed a sequence of topological insulating phases in MATBG near integer filling of the electronic bands produced by the moiré pattern. These correspond to a simple pattern of flavour-symmetry-breaking Chern insulators that fill bands of different flavours one after the other. Here we report the high-resolution local compressibility measurements of MATBG with a scanning single-electron transistor, which reveal an additional sequence of incompressible states with unexpected Chern numbers observed down to zero magnetic field. We find that the Chern numbers for eight of the observed incompressible states are incompatible with the simple picture in which the bands are sequentially filled. We show that the emergence of these unusual incompressible phases can be understood as a consequence of broken translation symmetry that doubles the moiré unit cell and splits each flavour band in two. Our findings expand the known phase diagram of MATBG, and shed light on the origin of the close competition between different correlated phases in the system. In addition to the broken time-reversal symmetry that typifies Chern insulators, twisted bilayer graphene hosts a set of topological states with broken translational symmetry.},

  abstract     = {Electrical control of spins at the nanoscale offers significant architectural advantages in spintronics, because electric fields can be confined over shorter length scales than magnetic fields1–5. Thus, recent demonstrations of electric-field sensitivities in molecular spin materials6–8 are tantalizing, raising the viability of the quantum analogues of macroscopic magneto-electric devices9–15. However, the electric-field sensitivities reported so far are rather weak, prompting the question of how to design molecules with stronger spin–electric couplings. Here we show that one path is to identify an energy scale in the spin spectrum that is associated with a structural degree of freedom with a substantial electrical polarizability. We study an example of a molecular nanomagnet in which a small structural distortion establishes clock transitions (that is, transitions whose energy is to first order independent of the magnetic field) in the spin spectrum; the fact that this distortion is associated with an electric dipole allows us to control the clock-transition energy to an unprecedented degree. We demonstrate coherent electrical control of the quantum spin state and exploit it to independently manipulate the two magnetically identical but inversion-related molecules in the unit cell of the crystal. Our findings pave the way for the use of molecular spins in quantum technologies and spintronics. Through chemical design, the spins in molecular nanomagnets may be used as electrically tunable qubits. Electrical control of molecular distortion enables manipulation of the quantum spin state while suppressing decoherence from magnetic fields.},

  abstract     = {The complicated structure of the neutron cannot be calculated using first-principles calculations due to the large colour charge of quarks and the self-interaction of gluons. Its simplest structure observables are the electromagnetic form factors1, which probe our understanding of the strong interaction. Until now, a small amount of data has been available for the determination of the neutron structure from the time-like kinematical range. Here we present measurements of the Born cross section of electron–positron annihilation reactions into a neutron and anti-neutron pair, and determine the neutron’s effective form factor. The data were recorded with the BESIII experiment at centre-of-mass energies between 2.00 and 3.08 GeV using an integrated luminosity of 647.9 pb−1. Our results improve the statistics on the neutron form factor by more than a factor of 60 over previous measurements, demonstrating that the neutron form factor data from annihilation in the time-like regime is on par with that from electron scattering experiments. The effective form factor of the neutron shows a periodic behaviour, similar to earlier observations of the proton form factor. Future works—both theoretical and experimental—will help illuminate the origin of this oscillation of the electromagnetic structure observables of the nucleon. Form factors encode the structure of nucleons. Measurements from electron–positron annihilation at BESIII reveal an oscillating behaviour of the neutron electromagnetic form factor, and clarify a long-standing photon–nucleon interaction puzzle.},

  abstract     = {Charged particles can be accelerated to high energies by collisionless shock waves in astrophysical environments, such as supernova remnants. By interacting with the magnetized ambient medium, these shocks can transfer energy to particles. Despite increasing efforts in the characterization of these shocks from satellite measurements at Earth’s bow shock as well as powerful numerical simulations, the underlying acceleration mechanism or a combination thereof is still widely debated. Here we show that astrophysically relevant super-critical quasi-perpendicular magnetized collisionless shocks can be produced and characterized in the laboratory. We observe the characteristics of super-criticality in the shock profile as well as the energization of protons picked up from the ambient gas to hundreds of kiloelectronvolts. Kinetic simulations modelling the laboratory experiment identified shock surfing as the proton acceleration mechanism. Our observations not only provide direct evidence of early-stage ion energization by collisionless shocks but also highlight the role played by this particular mechanism in energizing ambient ions to feed further stages of acceleration. Furthermore, our results open the door to future laboratory experiments investigating the possible transition to other mechanisms, when increasing the magnetic field strength, or the effect that induced shock front ripples could have on acceleration processes. Proton acceleration by a super-critical collisionless shock is observed in laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations suggest shock surfing as the underlying acceleration mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in realizing optical frequency combs using nonlinear parametric processes in integrated photonic resonators have revolutionized on-chip optical clocks, spectroscopy and multichannel optical communications. At the same time, the introduction of topological physics in photonic systems has allowed the design of photonic devices with novel functionalities and inherent robustness against fabrication disorders. Here we use topological design principles to theoretically propose the generation of optical frequency combs and temporal dissipative Kerr solitons in a two-dimensional array of coupled ring resonators that creates a synthetic magnetic field for photons and exhibits topological edge states. We show that these topological edge states constitute a travelling-wave super-ring resonator that leads to the generation of coherent nested optical frequency combs, as well as the self-formation of nested temporal solitons and Turing rolls that are remarkably phase-locked over more than 40 rings. Moreover, we show that the topological nested solitons are robust against defects in the lattice, and a single nested soliton achieves a mode efficiency of over 50\%, an order of magnitude higher than single-ring frequency combs. Our topological frequency comb works in a parameter regime that can be readily accessed using existing low-loss integrated photonic platforms like silicon nitride. Optical frequency combs are a key technology in precision time keeping, spectroscopy and metrology. A theoretical proposal shows that introducing topological principles into their design makes on-chip combs more efficient and robust against fabrication defects.},

  abstract     = {The single-particle and many-body properties of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) can be dramatically different from those of a single graphene layer, particularly when the two layers are rotated relative to each other by a small angle (θ ≈ 1°), owing to the moiré potential induced by the twist. Here we probe the collective excitations of TBG with a spatial resolution of 20 nm, by applying mid-infrared near-field optical microscopy. We find a propagating plasmon mode in charge-neutral TBG for θ = 1.1−1.7°, which is different from the intraband plasmon in single-layer graphene. We interpret it as an interband plasmon associated with the optical transitions between minibands originating from the moiré superlattice. The details of the plasmon dispersion are directly related to the motion of electrons in the moiré superlattice and offer an insight into the physical properties of TBG, such as band nesting between the flat band and remote band, local interlayer coupling, and losses. We find a strongly reduced interlayer coupling in the regions with AA stacking, pointing at screening due to electron–electron interactions. Optical nano-imaging of TBG allows the spatial probing of interaction effects at the nanoscale and potentially elucidates the contribution of collective excitations to many-body ground states. Moiré potentials substantially alter the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene at a magic twist angle. A propagating plasmon mode, which can be observed with optical nano-imaging, is associated with transitions between the moiré minibands.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional triangular-lattice antiferromagnets are predicted under some conditions to exhibit a quantum spin liquid ground state with no energy barrier to create emergent, fractionalized spinon excitations that carry spin but no charge. Materials that realize this kind of spin liquid are expected to have a low-energy behaviour described by a spinon Fermi surface. Directly imaging the resulting spinons, however, is difficult due to their chargeless nature. Here we use scanning tunnelling spectroscopy to image density waves consistent with the predictions of spinon density modulation arising from a spinon Fermi surface instability in single-layer 1T-TaSe2. We confirm the existence of a triangular lattice of localized spins in this material by contacting it with a metallic 1H-TaSe2 substrate and measuring the Kondo effect. Spectroscopic imaging of isolated single-layer 1T-TaSe2 reveals long-wavelength super-modulations at Hubbard band energies, consistent with the predicted behaviour of itinerant spinons. These super-modulations allow the direct experimental measurement of the spinon Fermi wavevector, in good agreement with theoretical predictions for a two-dimensional quantum spin liquid. Some quantum spin liquids are expected to have an effective Fermi surface of fractionalized spinon excitations. The two-dimensional spin liquid candidate 1T-TaSe2 has charge density modulations that may be caused by an unstable spinon Fermi surface.},

  abstract     = {Quantum states with long-lived coherence are essential for quantum computation, simulation and metrology. The nuclear spin states of ultracold molecules prepared in the singlet rovibrational ground state are an excellent candidate for encoding and storing quantum information. However, it is important to understand all sources of decoherence for these qubits, and then eliminate them, to reach the longest possible coherence times. Here we fully characterize the dominant mechanisms of decoherence for a storage qubit in an optically trapped ultracold gas of RbCs molecules using high-resolution Ramsey spectroscopy. Guided by a detailed understanding of the hyperfine structure of the molecule, we tune the magnetic field to where a pair of hyperfine states have the same magnetic moment. These states form a qubit, which is insensitive to variations in magnetic field. Our experiments reveal a subtle differential tensor light shift between the states, caused by weak mixing of rotational states. We demonstrate how this light shift can be eliminated by setting the angle between the linearly polarized trap light and the applied magnetic field to a magic angle of $$\arccos (1/\sqrt{3})\approx 5{5}^{\circ }$$ . This leads to a coherence time exceeding 5.6 s at the 95\% confidence level. The hyperfine states of ultracold polar molecules are a strong candidate for storing quantum information. Identifying and eliminating all detectable causes of decoherence has extended the qubit coherence time beyond 5.6 s in RbCs molecules.},

  abstract     = {Ultracold polar molecules possess long-range, anisotropic and tunable dipolar interactions, providing opportunities to probe quantum phenomena that are inaccessible with existing cold gas platforms. However, experimental progress has been hindered by the dominance of two-body loss over elastic interactions, which prevents efficient evaporative cooling. Although recent work has demonstrated controlled interactions by confining molecules to a two-dimensional geometry, a general approach for tuning molecular interactions in a three-dimensional stable system has been lacking. Here we demonstrate tunable elastic dipolar interactions in a bulk gas of ultracold 40K87Rb molecules in three dimensions, facilitated by an electric field-induced shielding resonance that suppresses the reactive loss by a factor of 30. This improvement in the ratio of elastic to inelastic collisions enables direct thermalization. The thermalization rate depends on the angle between the collisional axis and the dipole orientation controlled by an external electric field, a direct manifestation of the anisotropic dipolar interaction. We achieve evaporative cooling mediated by the dipolar interactions in three dimensions. This work demonstrates full control of a long-lived bulk quantum gas system with tunable long-range interactions, paving the way for the study of collective quantum many-body physics. Realizing the potential of dipolar molecular gases to explore quantum physics needs elastic, tunable interactions and low temperatures. This is now possible due to advances in control that suppress molecular losses and enable efficient cooling.},

Architectures for measurement-based quantum computing intrinsically support error-protected qubits and are the most viable approach for constructing an all-photonic quantum computer. Here we propose and demonstrate an integrated silicon photonic scheme that both entangles multiple photons, and encodes multiple physical qubits on individual photons, to produce error-protected qubits. We realize reconfigurable graph states to compare several schemes with and without error-correction encodings and implement a range of quantum information processing tasks. We observe a success rate increase from 62.5\% to 95.8\% when running a phase-estimation algorithm without and with error protection, respectively. Finally, we realize hypergraph states, which are a generalized class of resource states that offer protection against correlated errors. Our results show how quantum error-correction encodings can be implemented with resource-efficient photonic architectures to improve the performance of quantum algorithms. Entangled photon states can be used to make quantum information more robust. A photonic experimental implementation with eight qubits shows that error-protection schemes can increase the success rate of running a quantum algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Organ development involves complex shape transformations driven by active mechanical stresses that sculpt the growing tissue1,2. Epithelial gland morphogenesis is a prominent example where cylindrical branches transform into spherical alveoli during growth3–5. Here we show that this shape transformation is induced by a local change from anisotropic to isotropic tension within the epithelial cell layer of developing human mammary gland organoids. By combining laser ablation with optical force inference and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that circumferential tension increases at the expense of axial tension through a reorientation of cells that correlates with the onset of persistent collective rotation around the branch axis. This enables the tissue to locally control the onset of a generalized Rayleigh–Plateau instability, leading to spherical tissue buds6. The interplay between cell motion, cell orientation and tissue tension is a generic principle that may turn out to drive shape transformations in other cell tissues. The development of glands involves cylindrical branches transforming into spherical alveoli. Now there is evidence to suggest that this process can be understood as a budding instability driven by a decrease in tension anisotropy in the tissue.},

  abstract     = {Singularities are common in diverse physical systems1 and lead to universal structures2,3. This universality suggests that they should also naturally arise in biological systems, where active growth, autonomous motion, kinesis and taxis focus deformations in spacetime, as exemplified in the morphogenetic processes determining biological size and shape4. A familiar example of a morphogenetic singularity is seen in the humble apple, which forms in the neighbourhood of the stalk as the apple grows. Here we study the geometry and morphogenesis of the cusp of an apple by combining observations of fruit growth with a simple theory, finite element simulations and controlled swelling experiments using a physical gel simulacrum. Our observations show that the axisymmetric cusp develops into a self-similar form, which can be understood in terms of a mechanical theory for the inhomogeneous growth of a soft sphere. Physical experiments using local inhibition in swelling gels corroborate our theoretical predictions. These experiments further show that axisymmetric cusps can lose stability and become lobed. We use simulations to show that the number of cuspidal lobes depends on the ratio of the size of the stalk to the size of the sphere, as well as the amplitude and periodicity of perturbations that mimic the role of fruit anatomy, consistent with observations of multi-cusped fruits. A study of growing apples shows that the singular cusp at the stalk has a universal form that arises due to the differential growth of a soft solid. Although the cusps are usually symmetric, they can lose stability to form lobes that depend on the geometry of the fruit.},

  abstract     = {The strong coupling between photons and bosonic excitations in matter produces hybrid quasiparticle states known as polaritons1–3. Their signature is the avoided crossing between the eigenfrequencies of the coupled system illustrated by the Jaynes–Cummings Hamiltonian4. It has been observed in quantum electrodynamics experiments based on atoms5,6, ions7, excitons8–10, spin ensembles11,12 and superconducting qubits13. In cavity optomechanics, polariton modes originate from the quantum-coherent coupling of a macroscopic mechanical vibration to the cavity radiation field14,15. Here we investigate polaritonic modes in the motion of an optically levitated nanosphere16–22 in the quantum-coherent coupling regime. The particle is trapped in a high vacuum by an optical tweezer and strongly coupled to a single cavity mode by coherent scattering of the tweezer photons23–27. The two-dimensional motion and optical cavity mode define an optomechanical system with three degrees of freedom. In the strong-coupling regime, we observe hybrid light–mechanical states with a vectorial nature. Our results pave the way towards protocols for quantum information transfer between photonic and phononic components and represent a step towards the demonstration of optomechanical entangled states at room temperature. A levitated nanosphere that is strongly coupled to an optical cavity mode forms an optomechanical system with three degrees of freedom, which supports hybrid light–mechanical states of a vectorial nature.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal dichalcogenide moiré heterostructures provide an ideal platform to explore the extended Hubbard model1, where long-range Coulomb interactions play a critical role in determining strongly correlated electron states. This has led to experimental observations of Mott insulator states at half filling2–4 as well as a variety of extended Wigner crystal states at different fractional fillings5–9. However, a microscopic understanding of these emerging quantum phases is still lacking. Here we describe a scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) technique for the local sensing and manipulation of correlated electrons in a gated WS2/WSe2 moiré superlattice, which enables the experimental extraction of fundamental extended Hubbard model parameters. We demonstrate that the charge state of the local moiré sites can be imaged by their influence on the STM tunnelling current. In addition to imaging, we are also able to manipulate the charge state of correlated electrons. When we ramp the bias on the STM tip, there is a local discharge cascade of correlated electrons in the moiré superlattice, which allows us to estimate the nearest-neighbour Coulomb interaction. Two-dimensional mapping of the moiré electron charge states also enables us to determine the on-site energy fluctuations at different moiré sites. Our technique should be broadly applicable to many semiconductor moiré systems, offering a powerful tool for the microscopic characterization and control of strongly correlated states in moiré superlattices. The Hubbard model describes many fascinating phenomena, but relating it to complicated quantum materials is difficult. Now, atomic-resolution measurements can estimate the interaction parameters that appear in the model for real materials.},

  abstract     = {The kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet formed by frustrated spins arranged in a lattice of corner-sharing triangles is a prime candidate for hosting a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state consisting of entangled spin singlets1. However, the existence of various competing states makes a convincing theoretical prediction of the QSL ground state difficult2, calling for experimental clues from model materials. The kagome lattice materials Zn-barlowite (ZnCu3(OD)6FBr)3–5 and herbertsmithite (ZnCu3(OD)6Cl2)6–10 do not exhibit long-range order and are considered the best realizations of the kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet known so far. Here we use 63Cu nuclear quadrupole resonance combined with the inverse Laplace transform11–13 to locally probe the inhomogeneity of delicate quantum ground states affected by disorder14–17. We present direct evidence for the gradual emergence of spin singlets with spatially varying excitation gaps, but even at temperatures far below the super-exchange energy scale their fraction is limited to ~60\% of the total spins. Theoretical models18,19 need to incorporate the role of disorder to account for the observed inhomogeneously gapped behaviour. It has been difficult to establish which ground state forms in kagome lattice antiferromagnets. Nuclear resonance measurements have overcome the issue of disorder to observe spin singlets consistent with a proposed quantum spin liquid phase.},

  abstract     = {The physics of intense laser–matter interactions1,2 is described by treating the light pulses classically, anticipating no need to access optical measurements beyond the classical limit. However, the quantum nature of the electromagnetic fields is always present3. Here we demonstrate that intense laser–atom interactions may lead to the generation of highly non-classical light states. This was achieved by using the process of high-harmonic generation in atoms4,5, in which the photons of a driving laser pulse of infrared frequency are upconverted into photons of higher frequencies in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range. The quantum state of the fundamental mode after the interaction, when conditioned on the high-harmonic generation, is a so-called Schrödinger cat state, which corresponds to a superposition of two distinct coherent states: the initial state of the laser and the coherent state reduced in amplitude that results from the interaction with atoms. The results open the path for investigations towards the control of the non-classical states, exploiting conditioning approaches on physical processes relevant to high-harmonic generation. Schrödinger cat states are observed in intense laser–atom interactions. These are a superposition of the initial state of the laser and the coherent state that results from the interaction between the light and atoms.},

  abstract     = {The tin isotope 100Sn is of singular interest for nuclear structure due to its closed-shell proton and neutron configurations. It is also the heaviest nucleus comprising protons and neutrons in equal numbers—a feature that enhances the contribution of the short-range proton–neutron pairing interaction and strongly influences its decay via the weak interaction. Decay studies in the region of 100Sn have attempted to prove its doubly magic character1 but few have studied it from an ab initio theoretical perspective2,3, and none of these has addressed the odd-proton neighbours, which are inherently more difficult to describe but crucial for a complete test of nuclear forces. Here we present direct mass measurements of the exotic odd-proton nuclide 100In, the beta-decay daughter of 100Sn, and of 99In, with one proton less than 100Sn. We use advanced mass spectrometry techniques to measure 99In, which is produced at a rate of only a few ions per second, and to resolve the ground and isomeric states in 101In. The experimental results are compared with ab initio many-body calculations. The 100-fold improvement in precision of the 100In mass value highlights a discrepancy in the atomic-mass values of 100Sn deduced from recent beta-decay results4,5. Accurate mass measurements of the indium isotopes adjacent to the doubly magic 100Sn provide critical benchmarks for ab initio theory, which withstands the challenge.},

However, networks are intrinsically limited to describing pairwise interactions, whereas real-world systems are often characterized by higher-order interactions involving groups of three or more units. Higher-order structures, such as hypergraphs and simplicial complexes, are therefore a better tool to map the real organization of many social, biological and man-made systems. Here, we highlight recent evidence of collective behaviours induced by higher-order interactions, and we outline three key challenges for the physics of higher-order systems. Network representations of complex systems are limited to pairwise interactions, but real-world systems often involve higher-order interactions. This Perspective looks at the new physics emerging from attempts to characterize these interactions.},

  abstract     = {The crystal structure of a solid largely dictates its electronic, optical and mechanical properties. Indeed, much of the exploration of quantum materials in recent years including the discovery of new phases and phenomena in correlated, topological and two-dimensional materials—has been based on the ability to rationally control crystal structures through materials synthesis, strain engineering or heterostructuring of van der Waals bonded materials. These static approaches, while enormously powerful, are limited by thermodynamic and elastic constraints. An emerging avenue of study has focused on extending such structural control to the dynamical regime by using resonant laser pulses to drive vibrational modes in a crystal. This paradigm of ‘nonlinear phononics’ provides a basis for rationally designing the structure and symmetry of crystals with light, allowing for the manipulation of functional properties at high speed and, in many instances, beyond what may be possible in equilibrium. Here we provide an overview of the developments in this field, discussing the theory, applications and future prospects of optical crystal structure engineering. The interaction between light and the crystal lattice of a quantum material can modify its properties. Utilizing nonlinear interactions allows this to be done in a controlled way to design specific non-equilibrium functionalities.},

  abstract     = {The Vlasov equation describes collisionless plasmas in the continuum limit and applies to many fundamental plasma energization phenomena. Because this equation governs the evolution of plasma in six-dimensional phase space, studies of its structure have mostly been limited to numerical or analytical methods. Here terms of the Vlasov equation are determined from observations of electron phase-space density gradients measured by the four Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft in the vicinity of magnetic reconnection at Earth’s magnetopause. We identify which electrons in velocity space substantially support the electron pressure divergence within electron-scale current layers. Furthermore, we isolate and characterize the effects of density, velocity and temperature gradients on the velocity-space structure and dynamics of these electrons. Unipolar, bipolar and ring structures in the electron phase-space density gradients are compared to a simplified Maxwellian model and correspond to localized gradients in density, velocity and temperature, respectively. These structures have implications for the ability of collisionless plasmas to maintain kinetic Vlasov equilibrium. The results provide a kinetic perspective relevant to how the electron pressure divergence may develop to violate the electron frozen-in condition and sustain electron-scale energy conversion processes, such as the reconnection electric field, in collisionless space plasma environments. Insights into the structure of the Vlasov equation that governs the evolution of collisionless plasmas from observations have been limited. Now the spatial gradient term for electrons is analysed with recent data from the MMS mission.},

  abstract     = {The design of artificial microswimmers is often inspired by the strategies of natural microorganisms. Many of these creatures exploit the fact that elasticity breaks the time-reversal symmetry of motion at low Reynolds numbers, but this principle has been notably absent from model systems of active, self-propelled microswimmers. Here we introduce a class of microswimmers that spontaneously self-assembles and swims without using external forces, driven instead by surface phase transitions induced by temperature variations. The swimmers are made from alkane droplets dispersed in an aqueous surfactant solution, which start to self-propel on cooling, pushed by rapidly growing thin elastic tails. When heated, the same droplets recharge by retracting their tails, swimming for up to tens of minutes in each cycle. Thermal oscillations of approximately 5 °C induce the swimmers to harness heat from the environment and recharge multiple times. We develop a detailed elasto-hydrodynamic model of these processes and highlight the molecular mechanisms involved. The system offers a convenient platform for examining symmetry breaking in the motion of swimmers exploiting flagellar elasticity. The mild conditions and biocompatible media render these microswimmers potential probes for studying biological propulsion and interactions between artificial and biological swimmers. A class of synthetic microswimmers self-assembled from alkane oil drops in a surfactant solution offers a rechargeable platform for studying how microorganisms exploit flagellar elasticity to move around.},

  abstract     = {The transport of polymers across nanoscale pores underpins many biological processes, such as the ejection of bacteriophage DNA into a host cell and the transfer of genes between bacteria. The movement of polymers into and out of confinement is also the basis for a wide range of sensing technologies used for single-molecule detection and sequencing. Acquiring an accurate understanding of the translocation dynamics is an essential step in the quantitative analysis of polymer structure, including the localization of binding sites or sequences. Here we use synthetic nanopores and nanostructured DNA molecules to directly measure the velocity profile of driven polymer translocation through synthetic nanopores. Our results reveal a two-stage behaviour in which the translocation initially slows with time before accelerating close to the end of the process. We also find distinct local velocity correlations as the DNA polymer chain passes through the nanopore. Brownian dynamics simulations show that the two-stage behaviour is associated with tension propagation, with correlations arising from the random-walk conformation in which the DNA begins. A study of the dynamics of polymer translocation through synthetic nanopores provides a direct observation of tension propagation—a non-equilibrium description of the process of unfolding that a polymer undergoes during translocation.},

  abstract     = {Rapid rupture fronts—akin to earthquakes—mediate the transition to frictional motion. Once formed, their singular form, dynamics and arrest are well described by fracture mechanics. Ruptures, however, first need to be created within initially rough frictional interfaces. Hence, static friction coefficients are not well defined, with frictional ruptures nucleating over a wide range of applied forces. A critical open question is, therefore, how the nucleation of rupture fronts actually takes place. Here we experimentally show that rupture fronts are preceded by slow nucleation fronts—self-similar entities not described by fracture mechanics. They emerge from initially rough frictional interfaces at a well-defined stress threshold, evolve at the characteristic velocity and timescales governed by stress levels, and propagate within a frictional interface to form the initial rupture from which fracture mechanics take over. These results are of fundamental importance to questions ranging from earthquake nucleation and prediction to processes governing material failure. Frictional motion between two surfaces in contact starts with the formation of nucleating rupture fronts. It is now shown that these emerge from nucleation fronts, which develop from a certain stress level onwards and with a characteristic velocity.},

  abstract     = {Turing’s reaction–diffusion theory of morphogenesis has been very successful for understanding macroscopic patterns within complex objects ranging from biological systems to sand dunes. However, Turing patterns on microscopic length scales are extremely rare. Here we show that a strained atomic bismuth monolayer assembled on the surface of NbSe2—and subject to interatomic interactions and kinetics—displays Turing patterns. Our reaction–diffusion model produces stripe patterns with a period of five atoms (approximately 2 nm) and domain walls with Y-shaped junctions that bear a striking resemblance to what has been experimentally observed. Our work establishes that Turing patterns can occur at the atomic scale in a hard condensed-matter setting. Macroscale patterns seen in biological systems such as animal coats or skin can be described by Turing’s reaction–diffusion theory. Now Turing patterns are shown to also exist in bismuth monolayers, an exemplary nanoscale atomic system.},

  abstract     = {Excitons, quasiparticles of electrons and holes bound by Coulombic attraction, are created transiently by light and play an important role in optoelectronics, photovoltaics and photosynthesis. They are also predicted to form spontaneously in a small-gap semiconductor or a semimetal, leading to a Bose–Einstein condensate at low temperature, but there has not been any direct evidence of this effect so far. Here we detect the photoemission signal from spontaneously formed excitons in a debated excitonic insulator candidate, Ta2NiSe5. Our symmetry-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals a characteristic excitonic feature above the transition temperature, which provides detailed properties of excitons, such as the anisotropic Bohr radius. The present result provides evidence for so-called preformed excitons and guarantees the excitonic insulator nature of Ta2NiSe5 at low temperature. Excitons have been predicted to form spontaneously—without external excitation—in some materials. Low-temperature ARPES measurements on Ta2NiSe5 now provide evidence for such an excitonic insulator and for so-called preformed excitons.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computing can be realized with numerous different hardware platforms and computational protocols. A highly promising, and potentially scalable, idea is to combine a photonic platform with measurement-induced quantum information processing. In this approach, gate operations can be implemented through optical measurements on a multipartite entangled quantum state—a so-called cluster state. Previously, a few quantum gates on non-universal or non-scalable cluster states have been performed, but a full set of gates for universal scalable quantum computing has not been realized. Here we propose and demonstrate the deterministic implementation of a multi-mode set of measurement-induced quantum gates in a large two-dimensional optical cluster state using phase-controlled continuous-variable quadrature measurements. Each gate is programmed into the phases of high-efficiency quadrature measurements, which execute the transformations by teleportation through the cluster state. We further execute a small quantum circuit consisting of 10 single-mode gates and 2 two-mode gates on a three-mode input state. Fault-tolerant universal quantum computing is possible with this platform if the cluster-state entanglement is improved and a supply of states with Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill encoding is available. Measurement-based quantum computing performs quantum gates on entangled states without difficult multi-qubit coherent dynamics. A set of gates sufficient for universal quantum computing has now been implemented on a programmable optical platform.},

  abstract     = {Recently, several quantum machine learning algorithms have been proposed that may offer quantum speed-ups over their classical counterparts. Most of these algorithms are either heuristic or assume that data can be accessed quantum-mechanically, making it unclear whether a quantum advantage can be proven without resorting to strong assumptions. Here we construct a classification problem with which we can rigorously show that heuristic quantum kernel methods can provide an end-to-end quantum speed-up with only classical access to data. To prove the quantum speed-up, we construct a family of datasets and show that no classical learner can classify the data inverse-polynomially better than random guessing, assuming the widely believed hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. Furthermore, we construct a family of parameterized unitary circuits, which can be efficiently implemented on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, and use them to map the data samples to a quantum feature space and estimate the kernel entries. The resulting quantum classifier achieves high accuracy and is robust against additive errors in the kernel entries that arise from finite sampling statistics. Many quantum machine learning algorithms have been proposed, but it is typically unknown whether they would outperform classical methods on practical devices. A specially constructed algorithm shows that a formal quantum advantage is possible.},

  abstract     = {Interactions between liquids and surfaces generate forces1,2 that are crucial for many processes in biology, physics and engineering, including the motion of insects on the surface of water3, modulation of the material properties of spider silk4 and self-assembly of microstructures5. Recent studies have shown that cells assemble biomolecular condensates via phase separation6. In the nucleus, these condensates are thought to drive transcription7, heterochromatin formation8, nucleolus assembly9 and DNA repair10. Here we show that the interaction between liquid-like condensates and DNA generates forces that might play a role in bringing distant regulatory elements of DNA together, a key step in transcriptional regulation. We combine quantitative microscopy, in vitro reconstitution, optical tweezers and theory to show that the transcription factor FoxA1 mediates the condensation of a protein–DNA phase via a mesoscopic first-order phase transition. After nucleation, co-condensation forces drive growth of this phase by pulling non-condensed DNA. Altering the tension on the DNA strand enlarges or dissolves the condensates, revealing their mechanosensitive nature. These findings show that DNA condensation mediated by transcription factors could bring distant regions of DNA into close proximity, suggesting that this physical mechanism is a possible general regulatory principle for chromatin organization that may be relevant in vivo. In vitro experiments and theory reveal that a protein associated with DNA transcription mediates condensation of a protein–DNA phase via a first-order transition. The forces uncovered in the study may contribute to chromatin remodelling in the cell.},

  abstract     = {Magnonics is a research field complementary to spintronics, in which the quanta of spin waves (magnons) replace electrons as information carriers, promising lower dissipation1–3. The development of ultrafast, nanoscale magnonic logic circuits calls for new tools and materials to generate coherent spin waves with frequencies as high and wavelengths as short as possible4,5. Antiferromagnets can host spin waves at terahertz frequencies and are therefore seen as a future platform for the fastest and least dissipative transfer of information6–11. However, the generation of short-wavelength coherent propagating magnons in antiferromagnets has so far remained elusive. Here we report the efficient emission and detection of a nanometre-scale wavepacket of coherent propagating magnons in the antiferromagnetic oxide dysprosium orthoferrite using ultrashort pulses of light. The subwavelength confinement of the laser field due to large absorption creates a strongly non-uniform spin excitation profile, enabling the propagation of a broadband continuum of coherent terahertz spin waves. The wavepacket contains magnons with a shortest detected wavelength of 125 nm that propagate into the material with supersonic velocities of more than 13 km s–1. This source of coherent short-wavelength spin carriers opens up new prospects for terahertz antiferromagnetic magnonics and coherence-mediated logic devices at terahertz frequencies. Ultrashort light pulses generate nanometre-scale wavepackets of magnons that propagate coherently and at high speed in an antiferromagnet. This pushes antiferromagnetic magnonics forward as a future platform for information processing.},

Despite several promising preliminary considerations regarding the impact of nonlinearity in such systems5,6, the flourishing field of experimental higher-order topological insulator research has thus far been confined to the linear evolution of topological states. As such, the observation of the interplay between nonlinearity and the dynamics of higher-order topological phases in conservative systems remains elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate nonlinear higher-order topological corner states. Our photonic platform enables us to observe nonlinear topological corner states as well as the formation of solitons in such topological structures. Our work paves the way towards the exploration of topological properties of matter in the nonlinear regime, and may herald a new class of compact devices that harnesses the intriguing features of topology in an on-demand fashion. The nonlinear properties of photonic topological insulators remain largely unexplored, as band topology is linked to linear systems. But nonlinear topological corner states and solitons can form in a second-order topological insulator, as shown by experiments.},

We demonstrate the establishment of antiferromagnetism by probing the evolution of staggered magnetization and spin correlations of the system. Compared with condensed-matter systems, ultracold gases in optical lattices can be microscopically engineered and measured, offering remarkable advantages for exploring bosonic magnetism and spin dynamics4.

  abstract     = {Reaching light intensities above 1025 W cm−2 and up to the Schwinger limit of order 1029 W cm−2 would enable the testing of fundamental predictions of quantum electrodynamics. A promising—yet challenging—approach to achieve such extreme fields consists in reflecting a high-power femtosecond laser pulse off a curved relativistic mirror. This enhances the intensity of the reflected beam by simultaneously compressing it in time down to the attosecond range, and focusing it to submicrometre focal spots. Here we show that such curved relativistic mirrors can be produced when an ultra-intense laser pulse ionizes a solid target and creates a dense plasma that specularly reflects the incident light. This is evidenced by measuring the temporal and spatial effects induced on the reflected beam by this so-called plasma mirror. The all-optical measurement technique demonstrated here will be instrumental for the use of relativistic plasma mirrors with the upcoming generation of petawatt lasers that recently reached intensities of 5 × 1022 W cm−2, and therefore constitutes a viable experimental path to the Schwinger limit. Relativistic mirrors are a promising tool to reach laser intensities up to the Schwinger limit. Such a mirror is created in ultra-intense laser–solid interactions, and its temporal and spatial effects on the reflected laser beam are characterized.},

  abstract     = {Studies of active matter, from molecular assemblies to animal groups, have revealed two broad classes of behaviour: a tendency to align yields orientational order and collective motion, whereas particle repulsion leads to self-trapping and motility-induced phase separation. Here we report a third class of behaviour: orientational interactions that produce active phase separation. Combining theory and experiments on self-propelled Janus colloids, we show that stronger repulsion on the rear than on the front of these particles produces non-reciprocal torques that reorient particle motion towards high-density regions. Particles thus self-propel towards crowded areas, which leads to phase separation. Clusters remain fluid and exhibit fast particle turnover, in contrast to the jammed clusters that typically arise from self-trapping, and interfaces are sufficiently wide that they span entire clusters. Overall, our work identifies a torque-based mechanism for phase separation in active fluids, and our theory predicts that these orientational interactions yield coexisting phases that lack internal orientational order. Self-propelled particles are shown to orient themselves towards areas of high density, phase separating into fluid-like clusters. This behaviour is unique to active systems, forming a distinct class of motility-induced phase separation.},

  abstract     = {At high pressures, simple metals such as potassium have a rich phase diagram including an insulating electride phase in which electrons have a localized, anionic character. Measurements in the liquid phase have shown a transition between two states, but experimental challenges have prevented detailed thermodynamic measurements. Using potassium as an example, we present numerical evidence that the liquid–liquid transition is a continuous transformation from free electron to electride behaviour. We show that the transformation manifests in anomalous diffusivity, thermal expansion, speed of sound, coordination number, reflectivity and heat capacity across a wide range of pressures. The abnormalities stem from a significant change in the local electronic and ionic structure. Although primarily a pressure-induced phenomenon, there is also a thermal expansion anomaly. By establishing the electride nature of the high-pressure liquid phase, we resolve the long-standing mystery of how a liquid can be denser than a close-packed solid. Our work is relevant for high-pressure thermodynamic properties of all alkali metal liquids. Alkali metals at high pressures have a liquid–liquid transition that is difficult to study in detail. Numerical calculations now suggest that the higher-pressure state is an electride liquid, in which electrons behave like localized anions.},

  abstract     = {The strong Ising spin–orbit coupling in certain two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides can profoundly affect the superconducting state in few-layer samples. For example, in NbSe2, this effect combines with the reduced dimensionality to stabilize the superconducting state against magnetic fields up to ~35 T, and could lead to topological superconductivity. Here we report a two-fold rotational symmetry of the superconducting state in few-layer NbSe2 under in-plane external magnetic fields, in contrast to the three-fold symmetry of the lattice. Both the magnetoresistance and critical field exhibit this two-fold symmetry, and it also manifests deep inside the superconducting state in NbSe2/CrBr3 superconductor-magnet tunnel junctions. In both cases, the anisotropy vanishes in the normal state, demonstrating that it is an intrinsic property of the superconducting phase. We attribute the behaviour to the mixing between two closely competing pairing instabilities, namely the conventional s-wave instability typical of bulk NbSe2 and an unconventional d- or p-wave channel that emerges in few-layer NbSe2. Our results demonstrate the unconventional character of the pairing interaction in few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides and highlight the exotic superconductivity in this family of two-dimensional materials. A two-fold rotational symmetry is observed in the superconducting state of NbSe2. This is strikingly different from the three-fold symmetry of the lattice, and suggests that a mixed conventional and unconventional order parameter exists in this material.},

Here we analyse Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference in Mn chains, constructed atom by atom on Nb(110), and reveal the formation of multi-orbital Shiba bands using momentum-resolved measurements. We find evidence that one band features a topologically non-trivial p-wave gap, as inferred from its shape and particle–hole asymmetric intensity. Our work is an important step towards a distinct experimental determination of topological phases in multi-orbital systems by bulk electron band structure properties only. Chains of magnetic atoms on the surface of a superconductor are shown to have topologically non-trivial bands that could host Majorana bound states.},

  abstract     = {Entanglement is the crucial ingredient of quantum many-body physics, and characterizing and quantifying entanglement in the closed-system dynamics of quantum simulators remains a challenge in today’s era of intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here we discuss an efficient tomographic protocol for reconstructing reduced density matrices and entanglement spectra for spin systems. The key step is a parametrization of the reduced density matrix in terms of an entanglement Hamiltonian involving only quasilocal few-body terms. This ansatz is fitted to, and can be independently verified from, a small number of randomized measurements. By analysing data from trapped-ion quantum simulators for quench dynamics of a one-dimensional long-range Ising model, we demonstrate the ability of the protocol to measure the time evolution of the entanglement spectrum, in agreement with theoretical expectations. Furthermore, we develop the protocol as a testbed for predictions of entanglement structure in quantum field theories, which we illustrate for conformal field theory in quench dynamics, as well as the Bisognano–Wichmann theorem for ground states. In theoretical simulations, we demonstrate favourable scaling of sampling efficiency with subsystem size. Although the post-processing might ultimately be exponential, our protocol addresses the bottleneck of exponential sampling complexity in the investigation of entanglement structure in quantum simulation, and brings subsystems of tens of spins into reach for present experiments Entanglement is central to theories of quantum many-body systems but is very resource intensive to measure. A protocol based on a quasilocal parametrization of physical states allows entanglement structures to be studied using very few measurements.},

  abstract     = {Learning the Hamiltonian that describes interactions in a quantum system is an important task in both condensed-matter physics and the verification of quantum technologies. Its classical analogue arises as a central problem in machine learning known as learning Boltzmann machines. Previously, the best known methods for quantum Hamiltonian learning with provable performance guarantees required a number of measurements that scaled exponentially with the number of particles. Here we prove that only a polynomial number of local measurements on the thermal state of a quantum system are necessary and sufficient for accurately learning its Hamiltonian. We achieve this by establishing that the absolute value of the finite-temperature free energy of quantum many-body systems is strongly convex with respect to the interaction coefficients. The framework introduced in our work provides a theoretical foundation for applying machine learning techniques to quantum Hamiltonian learning, achieving a long-sought goal in quantum statistical learning. Learning the Hamiltonian of a complex many-body system is hard, but now there is proof that it can be done in a way where the number of required measurements scales as a polynomial of the number of particles.},

  abstract     = {Gradients in fluid viscosity characterize microbiomes ranging from mucus layers on marine organisms1 and human viscera2,3 to biofilms4. Although such environments are widely recognized for their protective effects against pathogens and their ability to influence cell motility2,5, the physical mechanisms regulating cell transport in viscosity gradients remain elusive6–8, primarily due to a lack of quantitative observations. Through microfluidic experiments, we directly observe the transport of model biflagellated microalgae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) in controlled viscosity gradients. We show that despite their locally reduced swimming speed, the expected cell accumulation in the viscous region9,10 is stifled by a viscophobic turning motility. This deterministic cell rotation—consistent with a flagellar thrust imbalance11,12—reorients the swimmers down the gradient, causing their accumulation in the low-viscosity zones for sufficiently strong gradients. Corroborated by Langevin simulations and a three-point force model of cell propulsion, our results illustrate how the competition between viscophobic turning and viscous slowdown ultimately dictates the fate of population-scale microbial transport in viscosity gradients. Microswimmers tend to accumulate in regions where their speed is significantly reduced, but experimental and numerical evidence now points towards a viscophobic turning mechanism that biases certain microalgae away from high-viscosity areas.},

  abstract     = {Oocytes are large cells that develop into an embryo upon fertilization1. As interconnected germ cells mature into oocytes, some of them grow—typically at the expense of others that undergo cell death2–4. We present evidence that in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, this cell-fate decision is mechanical and related to tissue hydraulics. An analysis of germ cell volumes and material fluxes identifies a hydraulic instability that amplifies volume differences and causes some germ cells to grow and others to shrink, a phenomenon that is related to the two-balloon instability5. Shrinking germ cells are extruded and they die, as we demonstrate by artificially reducing germ cell volumes via thermoviscous pumping6. Our work reveals a hydraulic symmetry-breaking transition central to the decision between life and death in the nematode germline. During the early development of an organism, some cells are fated to grow while other seemingly healthy cells die. Experiments and theory now reveal that a hydraulic instability is the key to this decision.},

  abstract     = {In the class of materials called spin liquids1–3, a magnetically ordered state cannot be attained even at millikelvin temperatures because of conflicting constraints on each spin; for example, from geometric or exchange frustration. The resulting quantum spin-liquid state is currently of intense interest because it exhibits unusual excitations as well as wave-function entanglement. The layered insulator α-RuCl3 orders as a zigzag antiferromagnet at low temperature in zero magnetic field4. The zigzag order is destroyed when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the zigzag axis. At moderate magnetic field strength, there is growing evidence that a quantum spin-liquid state exists. Here we report the observation of oscillations in its thermal conductivity in that field range. The oscillations, whose amplitude is very large within this field range and strongly suppressed on either side, are periodic. This is analogous to quantum oscillations in metals, even though α-RuCl3 is an excellent insulator with a large gap. As the temperature is raised above 0.5 K, the oscillation amplitude decreases exponentially, anticorrelating with the emergence of an anomalous planar thermal Hall conductivity above approximately 2 K. Transport measurements on the Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate α-RuCl3 subjected to a magnetic field reveal oscillating behaviour in its thermal conductivity, reminiscent of Shubnikov de Haas oscillations in metals.},

  abstract     = {In correlated electron materials, multiple electronic phases may appear next to each other in their phase diagram, and these can be tuned, for example, by applying static pressure or chemical doping1–3. These perturbations modify the subtle balance between the electron transfer energy and Coulomb repulsion between electrons. It is, therefore, tempting to explore whether new states of matter can be accessed through the direct tuning of their order parameters, for example, by driving a collective mode of the emergent phase. Here we demonstrate that the direct excitation of the amplitude mode of a charge density wave (amplitudon) by an intense terahertz pulse in a layered transition metal dichalcogenide compound, namely, 3R-Ta1+xSe2, leads to the appearance of an insulating-like metastable state. The formation dynamics of the metastable phase manifest in the opening of a gap in the optical conductivity spectrum, and we show that they synchronize with an oscillation of the amplitudon. This indicates the intimate interplay between the order parameters of the equilibrium charge density wave and the metastable states. Ultrafast optical excitation of a charge density wave leads to the formation of a metastable gapped state that synchronizes with the underlying correlated phase.},

  abstract     = {The interplay of different electronic phases underlies the physics of unconventional superconductors. One of the most intriguing examples is a high-temperature superconductor, FeTe1 – xSex (refs. 1–11). This superconductor undergoes both a topological transition3,4, linked to the electronic band inversion, and an electronic nematic phase transition, associated with rotation symmetry breaking, around the same Se composition where the superconducting transition temperature peaks12,13. In this regime, nematic fluctuations and symmetry-breaking strain could be important, but this is yet to be fully explored. Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunnelling microscopy, we study the electronic nematic transition in FeTe1 – xSex as a function of composition. Near the critical Se composition, we find electronic nematicity in nanoscale regions. The superconducting coherence peaks are suppressed in areas where static nematic order is the strongest. By analysing atomic displacement in scanning tunnelling microscopy topographs, we find that small anisotropic strain can give rise to these strongly nematic localized regions. Our experiments reveal a tendency of FeTe1 – xSex, near x ≈ 0.45, to form puddles hosting static nematic order, suggestive of nematic fluctuations pinned by structural inhomogeneity, and demonstrate the effect of anisotropic strain on superconductivity in this regime. The interplay of superconductivity and nematicity of electrons remains unclear in a wide range of materials. Now, more evidence emerges that nematic fluctuations can be pinned into a static phase by disorder, which hinders the superconductivity.},

  abstract     = {Strong and precisely controlled interactions between quantum objects are essential for quantum information processing1,2, simulation3 and sensing4,5, and for the formation of exotic quantum matter6. A well-established paradigm for coupling otherwise weakly interacting quantum objects is to use auxiliary bosonic quantum excitations to mediate the interactions. Important examples include photon-mediated interactions between atoms7, superconducting qubits8, and colour centres in diamond9, and phonon-mediated interactions between trapped ions10–12 and between optical and microwave photons13. Boson-mediated interactions can, in principle, be amplified through parametric driving of the boson channel; the drive need not couple directly to the interacting quantum objects. This technique has been proposed for a variety of quantum platforms14–24, but has not, so far, been realized in the laboratory. Here we experimentally demonstrate the amplification of a boson-mediated interaction between two trapped-ion qubits by parametric modulation of the trapping potential21. The amplification provides up to a 3.25-fold increase in the interaction strength, validated by measuring the speed-up of two-qubit entangling gates. This amplification technique can be used in any quantum platform where parametric modulation of the boson channel is possible, enabling exploration of new parameter regimes and enhanced quantum information processing. Many applications of quantum systems require them to be joined by strong, controllable interactions. Exploiting the physics of quantum squeezing can amplify the strength of boson-mediated interactions, yielding higher performance.},

It is often possible to establish a provable theoretical advantage for quantum computations by restricting the computational power2–8. In multiple cases, quantum advantage over these restricted models was demonstrated experimentally9–12. Here we consider space-restricted computations that use only one computational classical or quantum bit with a read-only memory as input. We show that n-bit symmetric Boolean functions can be implemented exactly in this framework through the use of quantum signal processing13 and O(n2) gates, but in the analogous classical computations some of the functions may only be evaluated with probability $$1/2 + O\left(n/{\sqrt{2}}^n\right)$$ . We experimentally demonstrate computations of three-bit to six-bit symmetric Boolean functions by quantum circuits with an algorithmic success probability that exceeds the classical limit. This shows that in computations, quantum scrap space offers an advantage over analogous classical space, and calls for an in-depth exploration of space–time trade-offs in quantum circuits. In general, it isn’t known when a quantum computer will have an advantage over a classical device. Now it’s proven that computers with limited working memory are more powerful if they are quantum.},

In the 1950s, the carbon isotope ratio was referenced to a belemnite sample collected by Heinz Lowenstam and Harold Urey1 in South Carolina’s PeeDee region. Due to exhaustion of the sample since then, reference materials that are traceable to the original artefact are used to define the Vienna PeeDee Belemnite scale for stable carbon isotope analysis2. However, these reference materials have also become exhausted or proven to exhibit unstable composition over time3, mirroring issues with the international prototype of the kilogram that led to a revised International System of Units4. A campaign to elucidate the stable carbon isotope ratio of Vienna PeeDee Belemnite is underway5, but independent measurement techniques are required to support it. Here we report an accurate value for the stable carbon isotope ratio inferred from infrared absorption spectroscopy, fulfilling the promise of this fundamentally accurate approach6. Our results agree with a value recently derived from mass spectrometry5 and therefore advance the prospects of International System of Units–traceable isotope analysis. Further, our calibration-free method could improve mass balance calculations and enhance isotopic tracer studies in carbon dioxide source apportionment. Isotope ratio measurements are complicated by the instabilities of composition in reference samples. Now a calibration-free method relying on infrared spectroscopy provides measurements that are traceable to International System of Units standards.},

  abstract     = {The physical state of embryonic tissues emerges from non-equilibrium, collective interactions among constituent cells. Cellular jamming, rigidity transitions and characteristics of glassy dynamics have all been observed in multicellular systems, but it is unclear how cells control these emergent tissue states and transitions, including tissue fluidization. Combining computational and experimental methods, here we show that tissue fluidization in posterior zebrafish tissues is controlled by the stochastic dynamics of tensions at cell–cell contacts. We develop a computational framework that connects cell behaviour to embryonic tissue dynamics, accounting for the presence of extracellular spaces, complex cell shapes and cortical tension dynamics. We predict that tissues are maximally rigid at the structural transition between confluent and non-confluent states, with actively generated tension fluctuations controlling stress relaxation and tissue fluidization. By directly measuring strain and stress relaxation, as well as the dynamics of cell rearrangements, in elongating posterior zebrafish tissues, we show that tension fluctuations drive active cell rearrangements that fluidize the tissue. These results highlight a key role of non-equilibrium tension dynamics in developmental processes. A computational framework draws analogy with foams to offer a comprehensive picture of how cell behaviours influence fluidization in embryonic tissues, highlighting the role of tension fluctuations in regulating tissue rigidity.},

  abstract     = {The healthy growth and maintenance of a biological system depends on the precise spatial organization of molecules within the cell through the dissipation of energy. Reaction–diffusion mechanisms can facilitate this organization, as can directional cargo transport orchestrated by motor proteins, by relying on specific protein interactions. However, transport of material through the cell can also be achieved by active processes based on non-specific, purely physical mechanisms, a phenomenon that remains poorly explored. Here, using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, we discover and describe a hidden function of the Escherichia coli MinDE protein system: in addition to forming dynamic patterns, this system accomplishes the directional active transport of functionally unrelated cargo on membranes. Remarkably, this mechanism enables the sorting of diffusive objects according to their effective size, as evidenced using modular DNA origami–streptavidin nanostructures. We show that the diffusive fluxes of MinDE and non-specific cargo couple via density-dependent friction. This non-specific process constitutes a diffusiophoretic mechanism, as yet unknown in a cell biology setting. This nonlinear coupling between diffusive fluxes could represent a generic physical mechanism for establishing intracellular organization. Protein oscillations linked to cell division in Escherichia coli are shown to localize unrelated molecules on the cell membrane via a diffusiophoretic mechanism, in which an effective friction fosters cargo transport along the fluxes set up by the proteins.},

If, however, a perturbation such as disorder becomes dominant, it may cause a topological phase transition between topologically non-trivial and trivial phases. Here we experimentally reveal the competition and interplay between topology and quasi-periodic disorder in a Thouless pump realized with ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, by creating a quasi-periodic potential from weak to strong regimes in a controllable manner. We demonstrate a disorder-induced pumping in which the presence of quasi-periodic disorder can induce a non-trivial pump for a specific pumping sequence, whereas no pump is observed in the clean limit. Our highly controllable system, which can also straightforwardly incorporate interatomic interaction, could be a unique platform for studying various disorder-related effects in a wide range of topological quantum phenomena. Topologically protected charge transport, known as Thouless pumping, is realized with cold atoms trapped in quasi-periodic disordered potentials. The pumping is disorder-dependent, illustrating the influence of disorder on the topological properties.},

  abstract     = {As Hamiltonian models underpin the study and analysis of physical and chemical processes, it is crucial that they are faithful to the system they represent. However, formulating and testing candidate Hamiltonians for quantum systems from experimental data is difficult, because one cannot directly observe which interactions are present. Here we propose and demonstrate an automated protocol to overcome this challenge by designing an agent that exploits unsupervised machine learning. We first show the capabilities of our approach to infer the correct Hamiltonian when studying a nitrogen-vacancy centre set-up. In preliminary simulations, the exact model is known and is correctly inferred with success rates up to 59\%. When using experimental data, 74\% of protocol instances retrieve models that are deemed plausible. Simulated multi-spin systems, characterized by a space of 1010 possible models, are also investigated by incorporating a genetic algorithm in our protocol, which identifies the target model in 85\% of instances. The development of automated agents, capable of formulating and testing modelling hypotheses from limited prior assumptions, represents a fundamental step towards the characterization of large quantum systems. Quantum systems make it challenging to determine candidate Hamiltonians from experimental data. An automated protocol is presented and its capabilities to infer the correct Hamiltonian are demonstrated in a nitrogen-vacancy centre set-up.},

  abstract     = {The Ising chain in a transverse field is a paradigmatic model for a host of physical phenomena, including spontaneous symmetry breaking, quantum criticality and duality. Although the quasi-one-dimensional ferromagnet CoNb2O6 has been regarded as the Ising chain’s best material realization, it exhibits substantial deviations from ideality. By combining terahertz spectroscopy and calculations, we show that CoNb2O6 is in fact described by a different model with bond-dependent interactions, which we call the ‘twisted Kitaev chain’, as these interactions are similar to those of the honeycomb Kitaev spin liquid. The ferromagnetic ground state of CoNb2O6 arises from the compromise between two axes. Owing to this frustration, even at zero field domain walls have quantum motion, which is described by the celebrated Su–Schriefer–Heeger model of polyacetylene and shows rich behaviour as a function of field. Nevertheless, close to the critical field, this model enters a universal regime in the Ising universality class. We observe that the excitation gap in the ferromagnet closes at a rate twice that of the paramagnet. This universal ratio originates in the Kramers–Wannier duality between domain walls and spin flips, and in the topological conservation of domain wall parity. Our work also shows that Co2+ magnets are fertile ground in the search for quantum spin liquids. A terahertz spectroscopic study of the quasi-one-dimensional ferromagnet CoNb2O6 reveals bond-dependent interactions in this material that are similar to those of a one-dimensional version of the honeycomb Kitaev spin liquid.},

Here we report a study of the high-field Hall coefficient of the single-layer cuprates Tl2Ba2CuO6+δ (Tl2201) and (Pb/La)-doped Bi2Sr2CuO6+δ (Bi2201), which shows how nH(0) evolves in the overdoped—so-called strange metal—regime of cuprates. We find that nH(0) increases smoothly from p to 1 + p, where p is the number of holes doped into the parent insulating state, over a wide range of doping. The evolution of nH correlates with the emergence of the anomalous linear-in-temperature term in the low-temperature in-plane resistivity. The results could suggest that quasiparticle decoherence extends to dopings well beyond the pseudogap regime. A study of the high-field Hall coefficient in thallium- and bismuth-based single-layer cuprates demonstrates a smooth evolution of this quantity from p to 1 + p over a wide doping range.},

  abstract     = {Leptons with essentially the same properties apart from their mass are grouped into three families (or flavours). The number of leptons of each flavour is conserved in interactions, but this is not imposed by fundamental principles. Since the formulation of the standard model of particle physics, the observation of flavour oscillations among neutrinos has shown that lepton flavour is not conserved in neutrino weak interactions. So far, there has been no experimental evidence that this also occurs in interactions between charged leptons. Such an observation would be a sign of undiscovered particles or a yet unknown type of interaction. Here the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN reports a constraint on lepton-flavour-violating effects in weak interactions, searching for Z-boson decays into a τ lepton and another lepton of different flavour with opposite electric charge. The branching fractions for these decays are measured to be less than 8.1 × 10−6 (eτ) and 9.5 × 10−6 (μτ) at the 95\% confidence level using 139 fb−1 of proton–proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of $$\sqrt{s}=13\,{\rm{TeV}}$$ and 20.3 fb−1 at $$\sqrt{s}=8\,{\rm{TeV}}.$$ These results supersede the limits from the Large Electron–Positron Collider experiments conducted more than two decades ago. The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider reports a search for charged-lepton-flavour violation in decays of Z bosons into a τ lepton and an electron or muon of opposite charge.},

  abstract     = {The standard model of particle physics encapsulates our best current understanding of physics at the smallest scales. A fundamental axiom of this theory is the universality of the couplings of the different generations of leptons to the electroweak gauge bosons. The measurement of the ratio of the decay rate of W bosons to τ leptons and muons, R(τ/μ), constitutes an important test of this axiom. Using 139 fb−1 of proton–proton collisions recorded with the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, we report a measurement of this quantity from di-leptonic $$t\overline{t}$$ events where the top quarks decay into a W boson and a bottom quark. We can distinguish muons originating from W bosons and those originating from an intermediate τ lepton through the muon transverse impact parameter and differences in the muon transverse momentum spectra. The measured value of R(τ/μ) is 0.992 ± 0.013 [± 0.007(stat) ± 0.011(syst)] and is in agreement with the hypothesis of universal lepton couplings as postulated in the standard model. This is the only such measurement from the Large Hadron Collider, so far, and obtains twice the precision of previous measurements. The ATLAS Collaboration reports a measurement of the ratio of the decay rates of W bosons to τ leptons and muons, in agreement with universal lepton couplings as postulated in the standard model of particle physics.},

  abstract     = {The Earth’s magnetosphere is the outermost layer of the geospace system deflecting energetic charged particles from the Sun and solar wind. The solar wind has major impacts on the Earth’s magnetosphere, but it is unclear whether the same holds for solar flares—a sudden eruption of electromagnetic radiation on the Sun. Here we use a recently developed whole geospace model combined with observational data from the 6 September 2017 X9.3 solar flare event to reveal solar flare effects on magnetospheric dynamics and on the electrodynamic coupling between the magnetosphere and its adjacent ionosphere, the ionized part of Earth’s upper atmosphere. We observe a rapid and large increase in flare-induced photoionization of the polar ionospheric E-region at altitudes between 90 km and 150 km. This reduces the efficiency of mechanical energy conversion in the dayside solar wind–magnetosphere interaction, resulting in less Joule heating of the Earth’s upper atmosphere, a reconfiguration of magnetosphere convection, as well as changes in dayside and nightside auroral precipitation. This work thus demonstrates that solar flare effects extend throughout the geospace via electrodynamic coupling, and are not limited—as previously believed—to the atmospheric region where radiation energy is absorbed1. The solar wind affects the magnetosphere, but whether this holds true for solar flares was unclear. By combining geospace modelling with observations, solar flares are shown to influence the dynamics of the magnetosphere and its ionosphere coupling.},

  abstract     = {Plasma-based accelerators driven by either intense lasers1 or charged particle beams2 can accelerate electrons or positrons with extremely high gradients compared with conventional radio-frequency accelerators. For their use as next-generation light sources and in energy frontier colliders3, beams with good stability, high quality, controllable polarization and excellent reproducibility4,5 are required. The accelerated electrons can be either internally injected directly from the background plasma or externally injected from conventional accelerators. Despite significant progress6–14, the beam properties obtained with the internal injection scheme fall short of simultaneously reaching these requirements. In contrast, such high-property beams are routinely generated from conventional accelerators. Therefore, it is important to demonstrate the injection from a conventional accelerator into a plasma-based machine followed by further acceleration of the beam. Here we report the demonstration of external injection from a conventional linear accelerator into a laser wakefield accelerator and subsequent acceleration without any significant loss of charge, which is achieved by properly shaping and matching the beam into the plasma structure. The experimental results, combined with three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, indicate that this is possible with modest degradation in the beam quality. This work is an important step towards realizing a high-throughput, multistage, high-energy, hybrid conventional-plasma-based accelerator. Previously, injections from a conventional accelerator into a plasma-based one suffered from low coupling efficiencies. Now electron bunches are injected with an efficiency of nearly 100\% into a laser wakefield accelerator without loss of charge.},

Such structures can also be engineered, appearing in smart materials1–4, photonic crystals5, chemical reactors6, and medical7 and biomimetic8 technologies. Here we report that fluid–fluid interfacial energy drives three-dimensional (3D) structure emergence in a micropillar scaffold. This finding offers a rapid and scalable way of transforming a simple pillar scaffold into an intricate 3D structure that is periodic on a microscale, comprising a solid microscaffold, a dispersed fluid and a continuous fluid. Structures generated with this technique exhibit a set of unique features, including a stationary internal liquid–liquid interface. Using this approach, we create structures with an internal liquid surface in a regime of interest for liquid–liquid catalysis. We also synthesize soft composites in solid, liquid and gas combinations that have previously not been shown, including actuator materials with temperature-tunable microscale pores. We further demonstrate the potential of this method for constructing 3D materials that mimic tissue with an unprecedented level of control, and for microencapsulating human cells at densities that address an unresolved challenge in cell therapy. The revelation that fluid–fluid interfacial energy can drive structure formation in micropillar scaffolds offers a scalable way of synthesizing soft composites, which may have applications in building materials that mimic biological tissue.},

  abstract     = {Strong electronic interactions in condensed-matter systems often lead to unusual quantum phases. One such phase occurs in the Kondo insulator YbB12, the insulating state of which exhibits phenomena that are characteristic of metals, such as magnetic quantum oscillations1, a gapless fermionic contribution to heat capacity2,3 and itinerant-fermion thermal transport3. To understand these phenomena, it is informative to study their evolution as the energy gap of the Kondo insulator state is closed by a large magnetic field. Here we show that clear quantum oscillations are observed in the resulting high-field metallic state in YbB12; this is despite it possessing relatively high resistivity, large effective masses and huge Kadowaki–Woods ratio, a combination that normally precludes quantum oscillations. Both quantum oscillation frequency and cyclotron mass display a strong field dependence. By tracking the Fermi surface area, we conclude that the same quasiparticle band gives rise to quantum oscillations in both insulating and metallic states. These data are understood most simply by using a two-fluid picture in which neutral quasiparticles—contributing little or nothing to charge transport—coexist with charged fermions. Our observations of the complex field-dependent behaviour of the fermion ensemble inhabiting YbB12 provide strong constraints for existing theoretical models. Transport and thermodynamic measurements on strongly correlated Kondo metal YbB12 reveal the coexistence of charged and charge-neutral fermions in the material and the crucial role played by the latter in the quantum oscillations of resistivity.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor heterostructures1 and ultracold neutral atomic lattices2 capture many of the essential properties of one-dimensional electronic systems. However, fully one-dimensional superlattices are highly challenging to fabricate in the solid state due to the inherently small length scales involved. Conductive atomic force microscope lithography applied to an oxide interface can create ballistic few-mode electron waveguides with highly quantized conductance and strongly attractive electron–electron interactions3. Here we show that artificial Kronig–Penney-like superlattice potentials can be imposed on such waveguides, introducing a new superlattice spacing that can be made comparable to the mean separation between electrons. The imposed superlattice potential fractures the electronic subbands into a manifold of new subbands with magnetically tunable fractional conductance. The lowest plateau, associated with ballistic transport of spin-singlet electron pairs3, shows enhanced electron pairing, in some cases up to the highest magnetic fields explored. A one-dimensional model of the system suggests that an engineered spin–orbit interaction in the superlattice contributes to the enhanced pairing observed in the devices. These findings are an advance in the ability to design new families of quantum materials with emergent properties and the development of solid-state one-dimensional quantum simulation platforms. The two-dimensional electron gas at an oxide interface is patterned to form a channel with a periodic potential imposed on top. This replicates the textbook Kronig–Penney model and leads to fractionalization of electron bands in the channel.},

  abstract     = {Among the most actively studied issues in the cuprates are the natures of the pseudogap and strange metal states and their relationship to superconductivity1. There is general agreement that the low-energy physics of the Mott-insulating parent state is well captured by a two-dimensional spin S = 1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model2. However, recent observations of a large thermal Hall conductivity in several parent cuprates appear to defy this simple model and suggest proximity to a magneto-chiral state that breaks all mirror planes that are perpendicular to the CuO2 layers3–6. Here we use optical second harmonic generation to directly resolve the point group symmetries of the model parent cuprate Sr2CuO2Cl2. We report evidence of an order parameter that breaks all perpendicular mirror planes and is consistent with a magneto-chiral state in zero magnetic field. Although this order is clearly coupled to the antiferromagnetism, we are unable to realize its time-reversed partner by thermal cycling through the antiferromagnetic transition temperature or by sampling different spatial locations. This suggests that the order onsets above the Néel temperature and may be relevant to the mechanism of pseudogap formation. Several cuprate superconductors were recently shown to have chiral phonons. Here second harmonic generation measurements show that antiferromagnetism breaks all mirror symmetries in a related compound, consistent with a chiral state.},

  abstract     = {Strontium ruthenate (Sr2RuO4) continues to present an important test of our understanding of unconventional superconductivity, because while its normal-state electronic structure is known with precision, its superconductivity remains unexplained. There is evidence that its order parameter is chiral, but reconciling this with recent observations of the spin part of the pairing requires an order parameter that is either finely tuned or implies a new form of pairing. Therefore, a definitive resolution of whether the superconductivity of Sr2RuO4 is chiral is important for the study of superconductivity. Here we report the measurement of zero-field muon spin relaxation—a probe sensitive to weak magnetism—on samples under uniaxial stresses. We observe stress-induced splitting between the onset temperatures of superconductivity and time-reversal symmetry breaking—consistent with the qualitative expectations for a chiral order parameter—and argue that this observation cannot be explained by conventional magnetism. In addition, we report the appearance of bulk magnetic order under higher uniaxial stress, above the critical pressure at which a Lifshitz transition occurs in Sr2RuO4. When strain is applied to strontium ruthenate, superconductivity emerges at a different temperature to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. This indicates that the superconductivity could have a chiral d-wave order parameter.},

  abstract     = {Particles subject to confinement experience an attractive potential that increases without bound as they separate. A prominent example is colour confinement in particle physics, in which baryons and mesons are produced by quark confinement. Confinement can also occur in low-energy quantum many-body systems when elementary excitations are confined into bound quasiparticles. Here we report the observation of magnetic domain-wall confinement in interacting spin chains with a trapped-ion quantum simulator. By measuring how correlations spread, we show that confinement can suppress information propagation and thermalization in such many-body systems. We quantitatively determine the excitation energy of domain-wall bound states from the non-equilibrium quench dynamics. We also study the number of domain-wall excitations created for different quench parameters, in a regime that is difficult to model with classical computers. This work demonstrates the capability of quantum simulators for investigating high-energy physics phenomena, such as quark collision and string breaking. Long-range Ising interactions present in one-dimensional spin chains can induce a confining potential between pairs of domain walls, slowing down the thermalization of the system. This has now been observed in a trapped-ion quantum simulator.},

  abstract     = {Measuring the spin structure of protons and neutrons tests our understanding of how they arise from quarks and gluons, the fundamental building blocks of nuclear matter. At long distances, the coupling constant of the strong interaction becomes large, requiring non-perturbative methods to calculate quantum chromodynamics processes, such as lattice gauge theory or effective field theories. Here we report proton spin structure measurements from scattering a polarized electron beam off polarized protons. The spin-dependent cross-sections were measured at large distances, corresponding to the region of low momentum transfer squared between 0.012 and 1.0 GeV2. This kinematic range provides unique tests of chiral effective field theory predictions. Our results show that a complete description of the nucleon spin remains elusive, and call for further theoretical works, for example, in lattice quantum chromodynamics. Finally, our data extrapolated to the photon point agree with the Gerasimov–Drell–Hearn sum rule, a fundamental prediction of quantum field theory that relates the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton to its integrated spin-dependent cross-sections. Measurements of the proton’s spin structure in experiments scattering a polarized electron beam off polarized protons in regions of low momentum transfer squared test predictions from chiral effective field theory of the strong interaction.},

  abstract     = {Advancing our understanding of non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum many-body systems remains one of the greatest challenges in physics. Here we report on the experimental observation of a paradigmatic many-body problem, namely the non-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum impurity immersed in a bosonic environment1,2. We use an interferometric technique to prepare coherent superposition states of atoms in a Bose–Einstein condensate with a small impurity-state component, and monitor the evolution of such quantum superpositions into polaronic quasiparticles. These results offer a systematic picture of polaron formation3–7 from weak to strong impurity interactions. They reveal three distinct regimes of evolution with dynamical transitions that provide a link between few-body processes and many-body dynamics. Our measurements reveal universal dynamical behaviour in interacting many-body systems and demonstrate new pathways to study non-equilibrium quantum phenomena. Quantum impurities immersed in a bosonic environment can evolve into polaronic quasiparticles, so-called polarons. Interferometric measurement reveals this transition, which involves three different regimes dominated by few-body and many-body dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Classical hydrodynamics is a remarkably versatile description of the coarse-grained behaviour of many-particle systems once local equilibrium has been established1. The form of the hydrodynamical equations is determined primarily by the conserved quantities present in a system. Some quantum spin chains are known to possess, even in the simplest cases, a greatly expanded set of conservation laws, and recent work suggests that these laws strongly modify collective spin dynamics, even at high temperature2,3. Here, by probing the dynamical exponent of the one-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet KCuF3 with neutron scattering, we find evidence that the spin dynamics are well described by the dynamical exponent z = 3/2, which is consistent with the recent theoretical conjecture that the dynamics of this quantum system are described by the Kardar–Parisi–Zhang universality class4,5. This observation shows that low-energy inelastic neutron scattering at moderate temperatures can reveal the details of emergent quantum fluid properties like those arising in non-Fermi liquids in higher dimensions. Quantum systems possessing conserved quantities are expected to show quantum fluid properties governed by hydrodynamic equations. This behaviour is now evidenced in a neutron scattering study on the one-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet KCuF3.},

  abstract     = {In twisted bilayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides, a combination of structural rippling and electronic coupling gives rise to periodic moiré potentials that can confine charged and neutral excitations1–5. Here we show that the moiré potential in these bilayers at small angles is unexpectedly large, reaching values above 300 meV for the valence band and 150 meV for the conduction band—an order of magnitude larger than theoretical estimates based on interlayer coupling alone. We further demonstrate that the moiré potential is a non-monotonic function of moiré wavelength, reaching a maximum at a moiré period of ~13 nm . This non-monotonicity coincides with a change in the structure of the moiré pattern from a continuous variation of stacking order at small moiré wavelengths to a one-dimensional soliton-dominated structure at large moiré wavelengths. We show that the in-plane structure of the moiré pattern is captured by a continuous mechanical relaxation model, and find that the moiré structure and internal strain, rather than the interlayer coupling, are the dominant factors in determining the moiré potential. Our results demonstrate the potential of using precision moiré structures to create deeply trapped carriers or excitations for quantum electronics and opto-electronics. The electrical potential created by a moiré pattern in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers can be surprisingly deep, trapping electrons that can possibly be used for opto-electronic or quantum simulation applications.},

  abstract     = {The strong electron interactions in the minibands formed in moiré superlattices of van der Waals materials, such as twisted graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, make such systems a fascinating platform with which to study strongly correlated states1–19. In most systems, the correlated states appear when the moiré lattice is filled by an integer number of electrons per moiré unit cell. Recently, correlated states at fractional fillings of 1/3 and 2/3 holes per moiré unit cell have been reported in the WS2/WSe2 hetero-bilayer, hinting at the long-range nature of the electron interaction16. Here we observe a series of correlated insulating states at fractional fillings of the moiré minibands on both electron- and hole-doped sides in angle-aligned WS2/WSe2 hetero-bilayers, with certain states persisting at temperatures up to 120 K. Simulations reveal that these insulating states correspond to ordering of electrons in the moiré lattice with a periodicity much larger than the moiré unit cell, indicating a surprisingly strong and long-range interaction beyond the nearest neighbours. Twisted bilayers of WS2 and WSe2 have correlated states that correspond to real-space ordering of the electrons on a length scale much longer than the moiré pattern.},

  abstract     = {Flat bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) have recently emerged as a rich platform to explore strong correlations1, superconductivity2–5 and magnetism3,6,7. However, the phases of MATBG in a magnetic field and what they reveal about the zero-field phase diagram remain relatively uncharted. Here we report a rich sequence of wedge-like regions of quantized Hall conductance with Chern numbers C = ±1, ±2, ±3 and ±4, which nucleate from integer fillings of the moiré unit cell v = ±3, ±2, ±1 and 0, respectively. We interpret these phases as spin- and valley-polarized many-body Chern insulators. The exact sequence and correspondence of the Chern numbers and filling factors suggest that these states are directly driven by electronic interactions, which specifically break the time-reversal symmetry in the system. We further study the yet unexplored higher-energy dispersive bands with a Rashba-like dispersion. The analysis of Landau-level crossings enables a parameter-free comparison to a newly derived ‘magic series’ of level crossings in a magnetic field and provides constraints on the parameters of the Bistritzer–MacDonald MATBG Hamiltonian. Overall, our data provide direct insights into the complex nature of symmetry breaking in MATBG and allow for the quantitative tests of the proposed microscopic scenarios for its electronic phases. In magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, topological Chern bands that are driven by electron–electron interactions appear at all the integer fillings of the moiré unit cell. The Rashba-like higher-energy bands also show Landau-level crossings.},

  abstract     = {The ability to tailor the hopping interactions between the constituent elements of a physical system could enable the observation of unusual phenomena that are otherwise inaccessible in standard settings1,2. In this regard, a number of recent theoretical studies have indicated that an asymmetry in either the short- or long-range complex exchange constants can lead to counterintuitive effects, for example, the possibility of a Kramer’s degeneracy, even in the absence of spin 1/2 or the breakdown of the bulk–boundary correspondence3–8. Here we show how such tailored asymmetric interactions can be realized in photonic integrated platforms by exploiting non-Hermitian concepts, enabling a class of topological behaviours induced by optical gain. As a demonstration, we implement the Haldane model, a canonical lattice that relies on asymmetric long-range hopping to exhibit quantum Hall behaviour without a net external magnetic flux. The topological response observed in this lattice is a result of gain and vanishes in a passive but otherwise identical structure. Our findings not only enable the realization of a wide class of non-trivial phenomena associated with tailored interactions, but also open up avenues to study the role of gain and nonlinearity in topological systems in the presence of quantum noise. Non-Hermitian concepts together with optical gain allow the tailoring of short- and long-range exchange interactions in integrated topological photonics, and an exact Haldane model can be realized in this way.},

The photonic quantum Hall effect enables the direct and integrated generation of coherent orbital angular momenta beams of large quantum numbers from light travelling in leaky circular orbits at the interface between two topologically dissimilar photonic structures. Our work gives direct access to the infinite number of orbital angular momenta basis elements and will thus enable multiplexed quantum light sources for communication and imaging applications.

  abstract     = {Particle knockout scattering experiments1,2 are fundamental for mapping the structure of atomic nuclei2–6, but their interpretation is often complicated by initial- and final-state interactions of the incoming and scattered particles1,2,7–9. Such interactions lead to reduction in the scattered particle flux and distort their kinematics. Here we overcome this limitation by measuring the quasi-free scattering of 48 GeV c–1 12C ions from hydrogen. The distribution of single protons is studied by detecting two protons at large angles in coincidence with an intact 11B nucleus. The 11B detection suppresses the otherwise large distortions of reconstructed single-proton distributions induced by initial- and final-state interactions. By further detecting residual 10B and 10Be nuclei, we also identified short-range correlated nucleon–nucleon pairs9–13 and provide direct experimental evidence for separation of the pair wavefunction from that of the residual many-body nuclear system9,14. All measured reactions are well described by theoretical calculations that include no distortions from the initial- and final-state interactions. Our results showcase the ability to study the short-distance structure of short-lived radioactive nuclei at the forthcoming Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR)15 and Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB)16 facilities, which is relevant for understanding the structure and properties of nuclei far from stability and the formation of visible matter in the Universe. Initial- and final-state interactions distort the kinematics in particle knockout scattering experiments, complicating their interpretation.

At energy scales below the nucleon mass of about 1 GeV, the intense interaction among the quarks and gluons inside the nucleon makes them highly correlated. Their coherent behaviour causes the emergence of effective degrees of freedom, requiring the application of non-perturbative techniques such as chiral effective field theory1. Here we present measurements of the neutron’s generalized spin polarizabilities that quantify the neutron’s spin precession under electromagnetic fields at very low energy-momentum transfer squared down to 0.035 GeV2. In this regime, chiral effective field theory calculations2–4 are expected to be applicable. Our data, however, show a strong discrepancy with these predictions, presenting a challenge to the current description of the neutron’s spin properties. Measurements of observables sensitive to the neutron’s spin precession are extended to a regime that probes distances of the size of the nucleon. They are found to disagree with predictions from chiral effective field theory.},

  abstract     = {Thermalization is the inevitable fate of many complex quantum systems, whose dynamics allow them to fully explore the vast configuration space regardless of the initial state—the behaviour known as quantum ergodicity. In a quest for experimental realizations of coherent long-time dynamics, efforts have focused on ergodicity-breaking mechanisms, such as integrability and localization. The recent discovery of persistent revivals in quantum simulators based on Rydberg atoms have pointed to the existence of a new type of behaviour where the system rapidly relaxes for most initial conditions, while certain initial states give rise to non-ergodic dynamics. This collective effect has been named ‘quantum many-body scarring’ by analogy with a related form of weak ergodicity breaking that occurs for a single particle inside a stadium billiard potential. In this Review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to quantum many-body scars and highlight the emerging connections with the semiclassical quantization of many-body systems. We discuss the relation between scars and more general routes towards weak violations of ergodicity due to embedded algebras and non-thermal eigenstates, and highlight possible applications of scars in quantum technology. Most large quantum systems are ergodic, meaning that over time they forget their initial conditions and thermalize. This article reviews our understanding of seemingly ergodic systems that in fact have some long-lived, non-thermal states.},

  abstract     = {Effective control of an epidemic relies on the rapid discovery and isolation of infected individuals. Because many infectious diseases spread through interaction, contact tracing is widely used to facilitate case discovery and control. However, what determines the efficacy of contact tracing has not been fully understood. Here we reveal that, compared with ‘forward’ tracing (tracing to whom disease spreads), ‘backward’ tracing (tracing from whom disease spreads) is profoundly more effective. The effectiveness of backward tracing is due to simple but overlooked biases arising from the heterogeneity in contacts. We argue that, even if the directionality of infection is unknown, it is possible to perform backward-aiming contact tracing. Using simulations on both synthetic and high-resolution empirical contact datasets, we show that strategically executed contact tracing can prevent a substantial fraction of transmissions with a higher efficiency—in terms of prevented cases per isolation—than case isolation alone. Our results call for a revision of current contact-tracing strategies so that they leverage all forms of bias. It is particularly crucial that we incorporate backward and deep tracing in a digital context while adhering to the privacy-preserving requirements of these new platforms. Contact tracing is key to epidemic control, but network analysis now suggests that whom you infect may not be as pertinent a question as who infected you. Biases due to contact heterogeneity reveal the efficacy of backward over forward tracing.},

The ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously is also a key characteristic of parallel architectures, as is evident in the human brain and exploited in traditional parallel architectures. Here we show that these two characteristics reflect a fundamental tradeoff between interactive parallelism, which supports learning and generalization, and independent parallelism, which supports processing efficiency through concurrent multitasking. Although the maximum number of possible parallel tasks grows linearly with network size, under realistic scenarios their expected number grows sublinearly. Hence, even modest reliance on shared representations, which support learning and generalization, constrains the number of parallel tasks. This has profound consequences for understanding the human brain’s mix of sequential and parallel capabilities, as well as for the development of artificial intelligence systems that can optimally manage the tradeoff between learning and processing efficiency. The ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously is a key characteristic of parallel architectures. Using methods from statistical physics, this study provides analytical results that quantify the limitations of processing capacity for different types of tasks in neural networks.},

  abstract     = {Electron and X-ray beams originating from compact laser-wakefield accelerators have very small source sizes that are typically on the micrometre scale. Therefore, the beam divergences are relatively high, which makes it difficult to preserve their high quality during transport to applications. To improve on this, tremendous efforts have been invested in controlling the divergence of the electron beams, but no mechanism for generating collimated X-ray beams has yet been demonstrated experimentally. Here we propose and realize a scheme where electron bunches undergoing focusing in a dense, passive plasma lens can emit X-ray pulses with divergences approaching the incoherent limit. Compared with conventional betatron emission, the divergence of this so-called plasma lens radiation is reduced by more than an order of magnitude in solid angle, while maintaining a similar number of emitted photons per electron. This X-ray source offers the possibility of producing brilliant and collimated few-femtosecond X-ray pulses for ultra-fast science, in particular for studies based on X-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy. X-ray pulses with low divergences are produced in a laser-wakefield accelerator by focusing electron bunches in a dense passive plasma lens.},

In bosonic systems, there is no Fermi exclusion principle to enforce uniform band filling, which makes measuring their bulk topological invariants challenging. Here we show how to achieve the controllable filling of bosonic bands using leaky photonic lattices. Leaky photonic lattices host transitions between bound and radiative modes at a critical energy, which plays a role analogous to the electronic Fermi level. Tuning this effective Fermi level into a bandgap results in the disorder-robust dynamical quantization of bulk topological invariants such as the Chern number. Our findings establish leaky lattices as a highly flexible platform for exploring topological and non-Hermitian wave physics. Topological materials are characterized by the topological invariants of filled bands, which cannot be used for bosonic systems. Instead, their topological invariants can be found via the transition from bound to leaky modes in photonic lattices.},

  abstract     = {A long-standing open problem in condensed-matter physics is whether or not a strongly disordered interacting insulator can be mapped to a system of effectively non-interacting localized excitations. Using terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy, we investigate this issue in phosphorus-doped silicon, a classic example of a correlated disordered electron system in three dimensions. Despite the intrinsically disordered nature of these materials, we observe coherent excitations and strong photon echoes that provide us with a powerful method for the study of their decay processes. We extract the energy relaxation and decoherence rates close to the metal–insulator transition. We observe that both rates are linear in excitation frequency with a slope close to unity. The energy relaxation timescale counterintuitively increases with increasing temperature, and the coherence relaxation timescale has little temperature dependence below 25 K, but increases as the material is doped towards the metal–insulator transition. Here we argue that these features imply that the system behaves as a well-isolated electronic system on the timescales of interest, and relaxation is controlled by electron–electron interactions. Our observations constitute a distinct phenomenology, driven by the interplay of strong disorder and strong electron–electron interactions, which we dub the marginal Fermi glass. The combination of disorder and strong interactions makes it hard to understand the nature of doped silicon’s insulating phase. State-of-the-art spectroscopy measurements show marginal electronic behaviour reminiscent of what is seen in the cuprates.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and tuning correlated states is of great interest and importance to modern condensed-matter physics. The recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity and Mott-like insulating states in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene presents a unique platform to study correlation phenomena, in which the Coulomb energy dominates over the quenched kinetic energy as a result of hybridized flat bands. Extending this approach to the case of twisted multilayer graphene would allow even higher control over the band structure because of the reduced symmetry of the system. Here we study electronic transport properties of twisted monolayer–bilayer graphene (a bilayer on top of monolayer graphene heterostructure). We observe the formation of van Hove singularities that are highly tunable by changing either the twist angle or external electric field and can cause strong correlation effects under optimum conditions. We provide basic theoretical interpretations of the observed electronic structure. A structure of monolayer and bilayer graphene with a small twist between them shows correlated insulating states that can be tuned by changing the twist angle or applying an electric field.},

  abstract     = {Excitation of high-Tc cuprates and certain organic superconductors with intense far-infrared optical pulses has been shown to create non-equilibrium states with optical properties that are consistent with transient high-temperature superconductivity. These non-equilibrium phases have been generated using femtosecond drives, and have been observed to disappear immediately after excitation, which is evidence of states that lack intrinsic rigidity. Here we make use of a new optical device to drive metallic K3C60 with mid-infrared pulses of tunable duration, ranging between one picosecond and one nanosecond. The same superconducting-like optical properties observed over short time windows for femtosecond excitation are shown here to become metastable under sustained optical driving, with lifetimes in excess of ten nanoseconds. Direct electrical probing, which becomes possible at these timescales, yields a vanishingly small resistance with the same relaxation time as that estimated by terahertz conductivity. We provide a theoretical description of the dynamics after excitation, and justify the observed slow relaxation by considering randomization of the order-parameter phase as the rate-limiting process that determines the decay of the light-induced superconductor. Evidence for light-induced superconductivity in K3C60 was limited to optical methods due to the short lifetime of the phase. Extending the lifetime from picoseconds to nanoseconds now allows measurement of its negligible electrical resistance.},

  abstract     = {Collective effects leading to spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal pattern formation in complex nonlinear systems driven out of equilibrium cannot be described at the single-particle level and are therefore often called emergent phenomena. They are characterized by length scales exceeding the characteristic interaction length and by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Recent advances in integrated photonics have indicated that the study of emergent phenomena is possible in complex coupled nonlinear optical systems. Here we demonstrate that the out-of-equilibrium driving of a strongly coupled pair of photonic integrated Kerr microresonators (‘dimer’)—which, at the ‘single particle’ (that is, individual resonator) level, generate well-understood dissipative Kerr solitons—exhibits emergent nonlinear phenomena. By exploring the dimer phase diagram, we find regimes of soliton hopping, spontaneous symmetry breaking and periodically emerging (in)commensurate dispersive waves. These phenomena are not included in the single-particle description and are related to the parametric frequency conversion between the hybridized supermodes. Moreover, by electrically controlling the supermode hybridization, we achieve wide tunability of spectral interference patterns between the dimer solitons and dispersive waves. Our findings represent a step towards the study of emergent nonlinear phenomena in soliton networks and multimodal lattices. A pair of strongly coupled photonic microresonators shows nonlinear emergent behaviour, which can be understood by incorporating interactions in the theoretical description of nonlinear optical systems.},

However, owing to their inherently scalar nature, electron waves cannot access the polarization-related quantities. Despite promising attempts based on the conversion of concepts originating from singular optics (such as vortex beams), the definition of an optical polarization analogue for fast electrons has remained an open question. Here we establish such an analogue using the dipole transition vector of the electron between two well-chosen singular wave states. We show that electron energy loss spectroscopy allows the direct measurement of the polarized electromagnetic local density of states. In particular, in the case of circular polarization, it directly measures the local optical spin density. This work establishes electron energy loss spectroscopy as a quantitative technique to tackle fundamental issues in nano-optics, such as super-chirality, local polarization of dark excitations or polarization singularities at the nanoscale. The functionality of electron energy loss spectroscopy can be extended to include a polarization analogue constructed via the dipole transition vector between two electronic states, bringing it closer to its optical counterpart.},

  abstract     = {Holography is a cornerstone characterization and imaging technique that can be applied to the full electromagnetic spectrum, from X-rays to radio waves or even particles such as neutrons. The key property in all these holographic approaches is coherence, which is required to extract the phase information through interference with a reference beam. Without this, holography is not possible. Here we introduce a holographic imaging approach that operates on first-order incoherent and unpolarized beams, so that no phase information can be extracted from a classical interference measurement. Instead, the holographic information is encoded in the second-order coherence of entangled states of light. Using spatial-polarization hyper-entangled photon pairs, we remotely reconstruct phase images of complex objects. Information is encoded into the polarization degree of the entangled state, allowing us to image through dynamic phase disorder and even in the presence of strong classical noise, with enhanced spatial resolution compared with classical coherent holographic systems. Beyond imaging, quantum holography quantifies hyper-entanglement distributed over 104 modes via a spatially resolved Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt inequality measurement, with applications in quantum state characterization. By exploiting polarization entanglement between photons, quantum holography can circumvent the need for first-order coherence that is vital to classical holography.},

An isolated nuclear spin ensemble is a remarkable platform owing to its coherence, but sensing its excitations with single spin precision has remained elusive. Here we achieve quantum sensing of a single nuclear-spin excitation (a nuclear magnon) in a dense ensemble of approximately 80,000 nuclei. A Ramsey measurement on the electron proxy qubit enables us to sense the hyperfine shift induced by a single nuclear magnon. We resolve multiple magnon modes distinguished by atomic species and spin polarity via the spectral dependence of this hyperfine shift. Finally, we observe the time-dependent shift induced by collective Rabi oscillations, revealing the competition between the buildup of quantum correlations and decoherence in the ensemble. These techniques could be extended to probe the engineered quantum states of the ensemble such as long-lived memory states. A single excitation in a semiconductor nuclear spin ensemble is detected with parts-per-million accuracy using the coupling between the ensemble and an electron-spin quantum dot.},

  abstract     = {Many cellular processes, such as cell division1–3, cell motility4, wound healing5 and tissue folding6,7, rely on the precise positioning of proteins on the membrane. Such protein patterns emerge from a combination of protein interactions, transport, conformational state changes and chemical reactions at the molecular level8. Recent experimental and theoretical work clearly demonstrates the role of geometry, including membrane curvature9–11 and local cytosolic-to-membrane ratios12,13, and advective cortical flow in modulating membrane protein patterns. However, it remains unclear how these proteins achieve robust spatiotemporal organization on the membrane during the dynamic cell shape changes involved in physiological processes. Here we use oocytes of the starfish Patiria miniata as a model system to elucidate a shape-adaptation mechanism that robustly controls spatiotemporal protein dynamics on the membrane in spite of cell shape deformations. By combining experiments with biophysical theory, we show how cell shape information contained in a cytosolic gradient can be decoded by a bistable regulator of the enzyme Rho, which is associated with contractility. This bistable front in turn controls a mechanochemical response by locally triggering excitable dynamics of Rho. We posit that such a shape-adaptation mechanism based on a hierarchy of protein patterns may constitute a general physical principle for cell shape sensing and control. Cells exploit protein pattern formation to perform key processes, and do so while undergoing major shape changes. Experiments and theory together reveal a shape-adaptation mechanism capable of controlling protein dynamics even as the cell deforms.},

The control and understanding of antiferromagnetic domain walls, which are the interfaces between domains with differing order parameter orientations, are key ingredients for advancing antiferromagnetic spintronic technologies. However, studies of the intrinsic mechanics of individual antiferromagnetic domain walls are difficult because they require sufficiently pure materials and suitable experimental approaches to address domain walls on the nanoscale. Here we nucleate isolated 180° domain walls in a single crystal of Cr2O3, a prototypical collinear magnetoelectric antiferromagnet, and study their interaction with topographic features fabricated on the sample. We demonstrate domain wall manipulation through the resulting engineered energy landscape and show that the observed interaction is governed by the surface energy of the domain wall. We propose a topographically defined memory architecture based on antiferromagnetic domain walls. Our results advance the understanding of domain wall mechanics in antiferromagnets. High-resolution magnetometry shows that the shape of domain walls in Cr2O3 is determined by the energetic cost of their surface area. The walls behave like elastic surfaces that avoid thicker parts of the sample where they would need to be larger.},

The line resolution is usually limited by a combination of first-order Doppler broadening due to particle thermal motion and a short transit time through the excitation beam. For trapped particles, suitable laser cooling techniques can lead to strong confinement (the Lamb–Dicke regime) and thus to optical spectroscopy free of these effects. For non-laser-coolable spectroscopy ions, this has so far only been achieved when trapping one or two atomic ions, together with a single laser-coolable atomic ion1,2. Here we show that one-photon optical spectroscopy free of Doppler and transit broadening can also be obtained with more easily prepared ensembles of ions, if performed with mid-infrared radiation. We demonstrate the method on molecular ions. We trap ~100 molecular hydrogen ions (HD+) within a Coulomb cluster of a few thousand laser-cooled atomic ions and perform laser spectroscopy of the fundamental vibrational transition. Transition frequencies were determined with a lowest uncertainty of 3.3 × 10−12 fractionally. As an application, we determine the proton–electron mass ratio by matching a precise ab initio calculation with the measured vibrational frequency. Laser spectroscopy can resolve vibrational transitions of molecular hydrogen ions without Doppler broadening when these are trapped within a cluster of laser-cooled atomic ions.},

Recent work demonstrates that the precision of such measurements can be substantially improved by tailoring the spatial profile of light fields used for estimating an observable system parameter4–10. These advances naturally raise the intriguing question of which states of light can provide the ultimate measurement precision11. Here we introduce a general approach to determine the optimal coherent states of light for estimating any given parameter, regardless of the complexity of the system. Our analysis reveals that the light fields delivering the ultimate measurement precision are eigenstates of a Hermitian operator that quantifies the Fisher information from the system’s scattering matrix12. To illustrate this concept, we experimentally show that these maximum information states can probe the phase or the position of an object that is hidden by a disordered medium with a precision improved by an order of magnitude compared with unoptimized states. Our results enable optimally precise measurements in arbitrarily complex systems, thus establishing a new benchmark for metrology and imaging applications3,13. Wavefront shaping can reduce uncertainties due to measurement noise through disordered media—key to many imaging applications. Optimal precision can be achieved using light fields that are eigenstates of an operator related to the medium’s scattering matrix.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian models provide an excellent effective description of many quantum many-body systems ranging from condensed-matter systems1,2 all the way to neutron stars3. Gaussian states are common at equilibrium when the interactions are weak. Recently it was proposed that they can also emerge dynamically from a non-Gaussian initial state evolving under non-interacting dynamics4–11. Here we present the experimental observation of such a dynamical emergence of Gaussian correlations in a quantum many-body system. This non-equilibrium evolution is triggered by abruptly switching off the effective interaction between the observed collective degrees of freedom, while leaving the interactions between the microscopic constituents unchanged. Starting from highly non-Gaussian correlations, consistent with the sine–Gordon model12, we observe a Gaussian state emerging over time as revealed by the decay of the fourth- and sixth-order connected correlations in the quantum field. A description of this dynamics requires a novel mechanism for the emergence of Gaussian correlations, which is relevant for a wide class of quantum many-body systems. In our closed system with non-interacting effective degrees of freedom, we do not expect full thermalization13–19. This memory of the initial state is confirmed by observing recurrences20 of non-Gaussian correlations. Starting from a strongly correlated state, with highly non-Gaussian correlations, a Gaussian state can emerge dynamically over time. Experiments with ultracold atoms show how the mixing between phase and density fluctuations plays the crucial role.},

  abstract     = {DNA is organized into chromatin, a complex polymeric material that stores information and controls gene expression. An emerging mechanism for biological organization, particularly within the crowded nucleus, is biomolecular phase separation into condensed droplets of protein and nucleic acids. However, the way in which chromatin impacts the dynamics of phase separation and condensate formation is poorly understood. Here we utilize a powerful optogenetic strategy to examine the interplay of droplet coarsening with the surrounding viscoelastic chromatin network. We demonstrate that droplet growth dynamics are directly inhibited by the chromatin-dense environment, which gives rise to an anomalously slow coarsening exponent, β ≈ 0.12, contrasting with the classical prediction of β = 1/3. Using scaling arguments and simulations, we show how this arrested growth can arise due to subdiffusion of individual condensates, predicting β ≈ α/3, where α is the diffusive exponent. Tracking the fluctuating motion of condensates within chromatin reveals a subdiffusive exponent, α ≈ 0.5, which explains the anomalous coarsening behaviour and is also consistent with Rouse-like dynamics arising from the entangled chromatin. Our findings have implications for the biophysical regulation of the size and shape of biomolecular condensates and suggest that condensate emulsions can be used to probe the viscoelastic mechanical environment within living cells. Biomolecules in the cell nucleus form condensates at a rate slower than that predicted by the theory of droplet growth. Experiments on living cells attribute this anomalous coarsening behaviour to subdiffusive dynamics in the crowded nucleus.},

  abstract     = {Exchange bias is a property of widespread technological utility, but its underlying mechanism remains elusive, in part because it is rooted in the interaction of coexisting order parameters in the presence of complex magnetic disorder. Here we show that a giant exchange bias housed within a spin-glass phase arises in a disordered antiferromagnet. The magnitude and robustness of the exchange bias emerges from a convolution of two energetic landscapes, namely the highly degenerate landscape of the spin glass biased by the sublattice spin configuration of the antiferromagnet. The former provides a source of uncompensated moment, whereas the latter provides a mechanism for its pinning, which leads to the exchange bias. Tuning the relative strengths of the spin-glass and antiferromagnetic order parameters reveals a principle for tailoring the exchange bias, with potential applications to spintronic technologies. Coexistence of a spin-glass phase with antiferromagnetism in an intercalated crystal produces a large exchange bias effect. This is due to the interplay of disorder and frustration.},

  abstract     = {Various phenomena occur when two-dimensional materials, such as graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides, are assembled into bilayers with a twist between the individual layers. As an application of this paradigm, we predict that structures composed of two-monolayer-thin d-wave superconductors with a twist angle form a robust, fully gapped topological phase with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry and protected chiral Majorana edge modes. These structures can be realized by mechanically exfoliating van der Waals-bonded high-critical-temperature copper oxide materials, such as Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 + δ. Our symmetry arguments and detailed microscopic modelling suggest that this phase will form for a range of twist angles in the vicinity of 45°, and will set in at a temperature close to the bulk superconducting critical temperature of 90 K. Therefore, this platform may provide a long-sought realization of a true high-temperature topological superconductor. Two monolayers of bismuth-containing cuprate will form a high-temperature topological superconductor when stacked with an approximately 45° rotation between the layers.},

  abstract     = {Intense X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) can rapidly excite matter, leaving it in inherently unstable states that decay on femtosecond timescales. The relaxation occurs primarily via Auger emission, so excited-state observations are constrained by Auger decay. In situ measurement of this process is therefore crucial, yet it has thus far remained elusive in XFELs owing to inherent timing and phase jitter, which can be orders of magnitude larger than the timescale of Auger decay. Here we develop an approach termed ‘self-referenced attosecond streaking’ that provides subfemtosecond resolution in spite of jitter, enabling time-domain measurement of the delay between photoemission and Auger emission in atomic neon excited by intense, femtosecond pulses from an XFEL. Using a fully quantum-mechanical description that treats the ionization, core-hole formation and Auger emission as a single process, the observed delay yields an Auger decay lifetime of $$2.2_{ - 0.3}^{ + 0.2}$$ fs for the KLL decay channel. Self-referenced attosecond streaking enables in situ measurements of Auger emission in atomic neon excited by femtosecond pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser with subfemtosecond time resolution and despite the jitter inherent to X-ray free-electron lasers.},

  abstract     = {Epithelial tissues provide an important barrier function in animals, but these tissues are subjected to extreme strains during day-to-day activities such as feeding and locomotion. Understanding tissue mechanics and the adaptive response in dynamic force landscapes remains an important area of research. Here we carry out a multi-modal study of a simple yet highly dynamic organism, Trichoplax adhaerens, and report the discovery of abrupt, bulk epithelial tissue fractures induced by the organism’s own motility. Coupled with rapid healing, this discovery accounts for dramatic shape change and physiological asexual division in this early-divergent metazoan. We generalize our understanding of this phenomenon by codifying it in a heuristic model focusing on the debonding–bonding criterion in a soft, active living material. Using a suite of quantitative experimental and numerical techniques, we demonstrate a force-driven ductile-to-brittle material transition governing the morphodynamics of tissues pushed to the edge of rupture. Characterizing the epithelial tissue of a shape-shifting marine animal as an integrated composite material reveals a ductile-to-brittle phase transition that captures how the tissue responds to failure.},

  abstract     = {Next-generation plasma-based accelerators can push electron bunches to gigaelectronvolt energies within centimetre distances1,2. The plasma, excited by a driver pulse, generates large electric fields that can efficiently accelerate a trailing witness bunch3–5, enabling the realization of laboratory-scale applications ranging from high-energy colliders6 to ultrabright light sources7. So far, several experiments have demonstrated large accelerations8–10 but the resulting beam quality, particularly the energy spread, is still far from state-of-the-art conventional accelerators. Here we show the results of a beam-driven plasma acceleration experiment where we used an electron bunch as a driver followed by an ultrashort witness bunch. By setting a positive energy chirp on the witness bunch, its longitudinal phase space is rotated during acceleration, resulting in an ultralow energy spread that is even lower than the spread at the plasma entrance. This result will significantly impact the optimization of the plasma acceleration process and its implementation in forthcoming compact machines for user-oriented applications. In a beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator, the energy spread of an electron bunch is reduced with respect to the plasma entrance, which is achieved through setting a positive energy chirp that rotates the bunches’ longitudinal phase space.},

In physiology, the nature and function of condensates on cellular structures remain unexplored. Here we study how the condensed protein TPX2 behaves on microtubules to initiate branching microtubule nucleation3–5, which is critical for spindle assembly in eukaryotic cells6–10. Using fluorescence, electron and atomic force microscopies and hydrodynamic theory, we show that TPX2 on a microtubule reorganizes according to the Rayleigh–Plateau instability, like dew droplets patterning a spider web11,12. After uniformly coating microtubules, TPX2 forms regularly spaced droplets, from which branches nucleate. Droplet spacing increases with greater TPX2 concentration. A stochastic model shows that droplets make branching nucleation more efficient by confining the space along the microtubule where multiple necessary factors colocalize to nucleate a branch. Branching microtubule nucleation plays a major part in cellular processes driving eukaryotic cell division. A combination of microscopy approaches and hydrodynamic theory is used to show how the condensed protein TPX2 on a microtubule reorganizes according to the Rayleigh–Plateau instability.},

  abstract     = {Identifying efficient pathways to control and modify the order parameter of a macroscopic phase in materials is an important ongoing challenge. One way to do this is via the excitation of a high-frequency mode that couples to the order, and this is the ultimate goal of the field of ultrafast phase transitions1,2. This is an especially interesting research direction in magnetism, where the coupling between spin and lattice excitations is required for magnetization reversal3,4. However, previous attempts5,6 have not demonstrated switching between magnetic states via resonant pumping of phonon modes. Here we show how an ultrafast resonant excitation of the longitudinal optical phonon modes in magnetic garnet films switches magnetization into a peculiar quadrupolar magnetic domain pattern, revealing the magneto-elastic mechanism of the switching. In contrast, the excitation of strongly absorbing transverse phonon modes results in a thermal demagnetization effect only. Resonant excitation of phonons by a laser pulse switches the magnetization of a thin yttrium iron garnet film. This particular combination of longitudinal optical phonons results in a quadrupolar pattern, but this could be tailored in the future.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor nanowires with proximity-induced superconductivity are leading contenders for manifesting Majorana fermions in condensed matter1–5. However, unambiguous detection of these quasiparticles is controversial6, and one proposed method is to show that the peak in the conductance at zero applied bias is quantized to the value of 2e2/h (refs. 7–10). This has been reported previously11, but only by probing one end of the device. Yet, if peaks come from Majorana modes, they should be observed at both ends simultaneously. Here we fabricate devices that feature tunnel probes on both ends of a nanowire and observe peaks that are close to the quantized value. These peaks evolve with the tunnel barrier strength and magnetic field in a way that is consistent with Majorana zero modes. However, we only find nearly quantized zero-bias peaks localized to one end of the nanowire, while conductance dips are observed for the same parameters at the other end. We also identify delocalized states near zero magnetic field and at higher electron density, which is not in the basic Majorana regime. These results enable us to lay out procedures for assessing the non-locality of subgap wavefunctions and provide a classification of nanowire bound states based on their localization. Majorana bound states should appear at both ends of a nanowire if it is in the topological regime. This paper reports that, in many cases, zero-bias conduction peaks only occur on one end of the wire, which casts doubt on whether they are Majoranas.},

  abstract     = {When the twist angle between two layers of graphene is approximately 1.1°, interlayer tunnelling and rotational misalignment conspire to create a pair of flat bands1 that are known to host various insulating, superconducting and magnetic states when they are partially filled2–7. Most work has focused on the zero-magnetic-field phase diagram, but here we show that twisted bilayer graphene in a finite magnetic field hosts a cascade of ferromagnetic Chern insulators with Chern number ∣C∣ = 1, 2 and 3. The emergence of the Chern insulators is driven by the interplay of the moiré superlattice with the magnetic field, which endows the flat bands with a substructure of topologically non-trivial subbands characteristic of the Hofstadter butterfly8,9. The new phases can be accounted for in a Stoner picture10; in contrast to conventional quantum Hall ferromagnets, electrons polarize into between one and four copies of a single Hofstadter subband1,11,12. Distinct from other moiré heterostructures13–15, Coulomb interactions dominate in twisted bilayer graphene, as manifested by the appearance of Chern insulating states with spontaneously broken superlattice symmetry at half filling of a C = −2 subband16,17. Our experiments show that twisted bilayer graphene is an ideal system in which to explore the strong-interaction limit within partially filled Hofstadter bands. In twisted bilayer graphene, the moiré potential, strong electron–electron interactions and a magnetic field conspire to split the flat band into topologically non-trivial subbands.},

A wide range of candidate models have been proposed5–10, which emphasize single- or multi-orbital electronic structure, Kondo or Hund’s coupling and analogies to cuprates. Further experimental characterization of the superconducting state is needed to develop a full understanding of the nickelates. Here we use magnetotransport measurements to probe the superconducting anisotropy in Nd0.775Sr0.225NiO2. We find that the upper critical field is surprisingly isotropic at low temperatures despite the layered crystal structure. In a magnetic field, the superconductivity is strongly Pauli-limited, such that the paramagnetic effect dominates over orbital de-pairing. Underlying this isotropic response is a substantial anisotropy in the superconducting coherence length, which is at least four times longer in-plane than out-of-plane. A prominent low-temperature upturn in the upper critical field indicates the presence of an unconventional ground state. Measurements of a superconducting infinite-layer nickelate show that its upper critical field is largely isotropic despite its quasi-two-dimensional structure. This indicates that, unusually for layered oxides, the superconductivity is Pauli-limited.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic order is usually associated with well-defined magnon excitations. Exotic magnetic fluctuations with fractional, topological or multipolar character have been proposed for unconventional forms of magnetic matter such as spin liquids1. As a result, considerable effort has been expended to search for, and uncover, low-spin materials with suppressed dipolar order at low temperatures2,3. However, long-range order of magnetic dipoles is much more common. Here we report neutron-scattering experiments and quantitative theoretical modelling of a spin-1 system—the uniaxial triangular magnet FeI2 (ref. 4)—where a dispersive band of mixed dipolar–quadrupolar fluctuations with large spectral weight emerges just above a dipolar ordered ground state. This excitation arises from anisotropic exchange interactions that hybridize overlapping modes carrying fundamentally different quantum numbers. A generalization of spin–wave theory to local SU(3) degrees of freedom5 accounts for all details of the low-energy dynamical response of FeI2, without going beyond quadratic order. Our work highlights that quantum excitations without classical counterparts can be realized, even in the presence of fully developed magnetic order. Neutron-scattering measurements on the magnetically ordered triangular-lattice compound FeI2 reveal a dispersive band of mixed dipolar–quadrupolar fluctuations just above its ground state—a quantum excitation without a classical counterpart.},

Here this random walk and its impact on Kerr soliton timing jitter are studied experimentally. The quantum limit is discerned by measuring the relative position of counter-propagating solitons2. Their relative motion features weak interactions and also presents common-mode suppression of technical noise, which typically hides the quantum fluctuations. This is in contrast to co-propagating solitons, which are found to have relative timing jitter well below the quantum limit of a single soliton on account of strong correlation of their mutual motion. Good agreement is found between theory and experiment. The results establish the fundamental limits to timing jitter in soliton microcombs and provide new insights on multisoliton physics. Quantum jitter fundamentally limits the performance of microresonator frequency combs. The timing jitter of the solitons that generate the comb spectra is analysed, reaching the quantum limit and establishing fundamental limits for soliton microcombs.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and classifying non-equilibrium many-body phenomena, analogously to the classification of equilibrium states of matter into universality classes1,2, is an outstanding problem in physics. From stellar matter to financial markets, any many-body system can be out of equilibrium in a myriad of ways, and many are difficult to experiment on. It is therefore a major goal to establish universal principles that apply to different phenomena and physical systems. For equilibrium states, the universality seen in the self-similar spatial scaling of systems close to phase transitions lies at the heart of their classification. Recent theoretical work3–14 and experimental evidence15,16 suggest that isolated many-body systems far from equilibrium generically exhibit dynamic (spatiotemporal) self-similar scaling, akin to turbulent cascades17 and the Family–Vicsek scaling in classical surface growth18,19. Here we observe bidirectional dynamic scaling in an isolated quench-cooled atomic Bose gas; as the gas thermalizes and undergoes Bose–Einstein condensation, it shows self-similar net flows of particles towards the infrared (smaller momenta) and energy towards the ultraviolet (smaller length scales). For both infrared and ultraviolet dynamics we find that the scaling exponents are independent of the strength of the interparticle interactions that drive the thermalization. Momentum-space transport behaviour studied in a quench-cooled isolated atomic Bose gas shows a self-similar scaling character, implying the existence of a far-from-equilibrium universality class.},

However, all these experiments require many input bits to certify a small number of output bits, and it is an outstanding challenge to develop a system that generates more randomness than is consumed. Here we devise a device-independent spot-checking protocol that consumes only uniform bits without requiring any additional bits with a specific bias. Implemented with a photonic loophole-free Bell test, we can produce 24\% more certified output bits (1,181,264,237) than consumed input bits (953,301,640). The experiment ran for 91.0 h, creating randomness at an average rate of 3,606 bits s–1 with a soundness error bounded by 5.7 × 10−7 in the presence of classical side information. Our system allows for greater trust in public sources of randomness, such as randomness beacons11, and may one day enable high-quality private sources of randomness as the device footprint shrinks. Device-independent randomness expansion is demonstrated in an experiment that is secure in the presence of a classical eavesdropper who does not share any entanglement with the setup.},

  abstract     = {The ability to produce random numbers that are unknown to any outside party is crucial for many applications. Device-independent randomness generation1–4 does not require trusted devices and therefore provides strong guarantees of the security of the output, but it comes at the price of requiring the violation of a Bell inequality for implementation. A further challenge is to make the bounds in the security proofs tight enough to allow randomness expansion with contemporary technology. Although randomness has been generated in recent experiments5–9, the amount of randomness consumed in doing so has been too high to certify expansion based on existing theory. Here we present an experiment that demonstrates device-independent randomness expansion1–3,10–15. By developing a Bell test setup with a single-photon detection efficiency of around 84\% and by using a spot-checking protocol, we achieve a net gain of 2.57 × 108 certified bits with a soundness error of 3.09 × 10−12. The experiment ran for 19.2 h, which corresponds to an average rate of randomness generation of 13,527 bits per second. By developing the entropy accumulation theorem4,16,17, we establish security against quantum adversaries. We anticipate that this work will lead to further improvements that push device-independence towards commercial viability. Device-independent randomness expansion is demonstrated in an experiment that is secure against quantum adversaries as established by the entropy accumulation theorem.},

  abstract     = {Periodically driven Floquet quantum systems could provide a promising platform to investigate novel physics out of equilibrium1, but the drive generically heats the system to a featureless infinite-temperature state2–4. Fortunately, for high driving frequency, the heat absorption rate has been theoretically predicted to be exponentially small, giving rise to a long-lived prethermal regime that exhibits all the intriguing properties of Floquet systems5–8. Here we experimentally observe Floquet prethermalization using NMR techniques and probe the heating rate. We first show the relaxation of a far-from-equilibrium initial state to a long-lived prethermal state, well described by a time-independent ‘prethermal’ Hamiltonian. By measuring the autocorrelation of this prethermal Hamiltonian we can further experimentally confirm the predicted exponentially slow heating rate. More strikingly, we find that, on the timescale at which the prethermal Hamiltonian picture breaks down, the Floquet system still possesses other quasiconservation laws. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to realize robust Floquet engineering, thus enabling the experimental observation of non-trivial Floquet phases of matter. A periodically driven Floquet quantum many-body system initially prepared in a far-from-equilibrium state may exhibit prethermalization: that is, before reaching its thermal equilibrium the system first relaxes to a long-lived quasistationary state.},

  abstract     = {Nuclear charge radii are sensitive probes of different aspects of the nucleon–nucleon interaction and the bulk properties of nuclear matter, providing a stringent test and challenge for nuclear theory. Experimental evidence suggested a new magic neutron number at N = 32 (refs. 1–3) in the calcium region, whereas the unexpectedly large increases in the charge radii4,5 open new questions about the evolution of nuclear size in neutron-rich systems. By combining the collinear resonance ionization spectroscopy method with β-decay detection, we were able to extend charge radii measurements of potassium isotopes beyond N = 32. Here we provide a charge radius measurement of 52K. It does not show a signature of magic behaviour at N = 32 in potassium. The results are interpreted with two state-of-the-art nuclear theories. The coupled cluster theory reproduces the odd–even variations in charge radii but not the notable increase beyond N = 28. This rise is well captured by Fayans nuclear density functional theory, which, however, overestimates the odd–even staggering effect in charge radii. These findings highlight our limited understanding of the nuclear size of neutron-rich systems, and expose problems that are present in some of the best current models of nuclear theory. The charge radii of potassium isotopes up to 52K are measured, and show no sign of magicity at 32 neutrons as previously suggested in calcium. The observations are interpreted with coupled cluster and density functional theory calculations.},

  abstract     = {Living organisms form a large variety of hierarchically structured extracellular functional tissues. Remarkably, these materials exhibit regularity and structural coherence across multiple length scales, far beyond the size of a single cell. Here, synchrotron-based nanotomographic imaging in combination with machine-learning-based segmentation is used to reveal the structural synchronization process of nacre forming in the shell of the mollusc Unio pictorum. We show that the emergence of this highly regular layered structure is driven by a disorder-to-order transition achieved through the motion and interaction of screw-like structural dislocations with an opposite topological sign. Using an analogy to similar processes observed in liquid-crystalline systems, we demonstrate that these microstructural faults act as dissipative topological defects coupled by an elastic distortion field surrounding their cores. Their mutual annihilation results in structural synchronization that is simulated using the classical Kuramoto model. The developed experimental, theoretical and numerical framework provides a comprehensive physical view of the formation of biogenic materials. Molluscs assemble layers of material in the shells around them with a high level of control. Here the authors observe the structural evolution of layer formation and propose a mechanism reminiscent of topological defect dynamics in liquid crystals.},

  abstract     = {To maximize their fitness, cells must be able to respond effectively to stresses. This demands making trade-offs between processes that conserve resources to promote survival, and processes that use resources to promote growth and division. Understanding the nature of these trade-offs and the physics underlying them remains an outstanding challenge. Here we combine single-cell experiments and theoretical modelling to propose a mechanism for antibiotic adaptation through mechanical feedback between cell growth and morphology. Under long-term exposure to sublethal doses of ribosome-targeting antibiotics, we find that Caulobacter crescentus cells can recover their pre-stimulus growth rates and undergo dramatic changes in cell shape. Upon antibiotic removal, cells recover their original forms over multiple generations. These phenomena are explained by a physical theory of bacterial growth, which demonstrates that an increase in cell width and curvature promotes faster growth under protein synthesis inhibition. Shape changes thereby make bacteria more adaptive to surviving antibiotics. Certain bacteria cells respond to the stress of long-term exposure to antibiotics by changing their shape. Single-cell experiments and modelling cast this as a mechanical feedback strategy that makes bacteria more adaptive to surviving antibiotics.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic skyrmions are key candidates for applications in memory, logic and neuromorphic computing. An essential property is their topological protection that is caused by the swirling spin texture and described by a robust integer winding number. However, this protection is strictly enforced only in the continuum, and so the atomic lattice present in all real materials leaves a loophole for switching the winding number. Hence, understanding the microscopic mechanism of this unwinding is crucial for enhancing the stability of skyrmions. Here we use spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy to locally probe skyrmion annihilation by individual hot electrons. We tune the collapse rate by up to four orders of magnitude by using an in-plane magnetic field, and observe distinct transition rate maps that either are radial symmetric or exhibit an excentric hotspot. We compare these maps to atomistic spin simulations based on parameters obtained from first-principles calculations and find that the maps are explained by a radial symmetric collapse at zero in-plane magnetic field and a transition to the recently predicted chimera collapse at finite in-plane magnetic fields. These insights into the transient state of the skyrmion collapse will enable future enhancement of skyrmion stability and designs for intentional skyrmion switches. In principle skyrmions are topologically protected, but the crystal lattice interferes with this protection so that they should be unstable to switching of their winding number. Here this process is understood via scanning tunnelling microscopy.},

However, the insensitivity of AFMs to magnetic fields makes the manipulation of spin currents difficult. The ultrafast generation of the spin current in ferromagnet/heavy-metal (HM) structures has received a lot of attention in recent years, but whether a similar scenario can be observed in an AFM/HM system is still unknown. Here, we show the optical generation of ultrafast spin current in an AFM/HM heterostructure at zero external magnetic field and at room temperature by detecting the associated terahertz emission. We believe that this is a common phenomenon in antiferromagnets with strong nonlinear optical effects. Our results open an avenue of fundamental research into antiferromagnetism and a route to AFM spintronic devices. Spin currents are generated from an antiferromagnet/heavy-metal heterostructure using optical excitation on picosecond timescales. This will have applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

However, there have been rapid recent developments in quantum materials in which topological phase transitions emerge when the single-particle band structure is modified by strong interactions. Here we demonstrate that the room-temperature phase of (TaSe4)2I is a Weyl semimetal with 24 pairs of Weyl nodes. Owing to its quasi-one-dimensional structure, (TaSe4)2I also hosts an established charge-density wave instability just below room temperature. We show that the charge-density wave in (TaSe4)2I couples the bulk Weyl points and opens a bandgap. The correlation-driven topological phase transition in (TaSe4)2I provides a route towards observing condensed-matter realizations of axion electrodynamics in the gapped regime, topological chiral response effects in the semimetallic phase, and represents an avenue for exploring the interplay of correlations and topology in a solid-state material. Strong electron–electron interactions create a charge-density wave that modifies the topological state of the Weyl semimetal (TaSe4)2I. This implies the possibility of experimentally simulating axion electrodynamics in a solid-state material.},

  abstract     = {Twisted van der Waals heterostructures with flat electronic bands have recently emerged as a platform for realizing correlated and topological states with a high degree of control and tunability. In graphene-based moiré heterostructures, the correlated phase diagram and band topology depend on the number of graphene layers and the details of the external environment from the encapsulating crystals. Here, we report that the system of twisted monolayer–bilayer graphene (tMBG) hosts a variety of correlated metallic and insulating states, as well as topological magnetic states. Because of its low symmetry, the phase diagram of tMBG approximates that of twisted bilayer graphene when an applied perpendicular electric field points from the bilayer towards the monolayer graphene, or twisted double bilayer graphene when the field is reversed. In the former case, we observe correlated states that undergo an orbitally driven insulating transition above a critical perpendicular magnetic field. In the latter case, we observe the emergence of electrically tunable ferromagnetism at one-quarter filling of the conduction band, and an associated anomalous Hall effect. The direction of the magnetization can be switched by electrostatic doping at zero magnetic field. Our results establish tMBG as a tunable platform for investigating correlated and topological states. Stacking a monolayer and bilayer of graphene, with a small twist angle between them, creates a tunable platform where the physics of both twisted bilayer graphene and twisted double bilayer graphene can be realized.},

Here we use coherent vibrational control of on-site d–d electronic transitions in a model edge-sharing insulating transition metal oxide (CuGeO3) to single out the effects of vibrational coherence in electron–phonon coupling. By comparing time-domain experiments based on high- and low-photon-energy ultrashort laser excitation pulses with a fully quantum description of phonon-assisted absorption, we could distinguish the processes associated with incoherent thermal lattice fluctuations from those driven by the coherent motion of the atoms. In particular, while thermal fluctuations of the phonon bath uniformly increase the electronic absorption, the resonant excitation of phonon modes also results in light-induced transparency that is coherently controlled by the vibrational motion. A spectroscopic study shows that vibrational pumping can be used to coherently control optical d–d transitions of electronic origin in the transition metal oxide system CuGeO3.},

Spontaneous Hawking radiation was observed in analogue black holes in atomic Bose–Einstein condensates, although the stationarity was not probed. Here we confirm that the spontaneous Hawking radiation is stationary by observing such a system at six different times. Furthermore, we follow the time evolution of Hawking radiation and compare and contrast it with predictions for real black holes. We observe the ramp-up of Hawking radiation followed by stationary spontaneous emission, similar to a real black hole. The end of the spontaneous Hawking radiation is marked by the formation of an inner horizon, which is seen to cause stimulated Hawking radiation, as predicted. We find that the stimulated Hawking and partner particles are directly observable, and that the stimulated emission evolves from multi-mode to monochromatic. Numerical simulations suggest that Bogoliubov–Cherenkov–Landau stimulation predominates, rather than black-hole lasing. In an analogue black hole in an atomic Bose–Einstein condensate, spontaneous Hawking radiation is confirmed to be stationary and the time evolution of Hawking radiation is reported.},

Recently, such states have been experimentally realized using dipolar quantum gases. Here we investigate the response of a dipolar supersolid to an interaction quench that shatters the global phase coherence. We identify a parameter regime in which this out-of-equilibrium state rephases, indicating superfluid flow across the sample as well as an efficient dissipation mechanism. We find a crossover to a regime where the tendency to rephase gradually decreases until the system relaxes into an incoherent droplet array. Although a dipolar supersolid is, by its nature, ‘soft’, we capture the essential behaviour of the de- and rephasing process within a rigid Josephson junction array model. Yet, both experiment and simulation indicate that the interaction quench causes substantial collective mode excitations that connect to phonons in solids and affect the phase dynamics. A supersolid is a phase of matter featuring both crystalline order as a solid and global phase coherence as a superfluid. Now an experiment shows how this global phase coherence can be established across the system in a non-equilibrium process.},

Here we re-examine the refractive index and find a general way to calculate the direction-dependent refractive index and the condition for zero index in a given direction. By analogy with linear versus circular polarization, we show that when the zero-index direction is complex-valued, a material supports waves that can propagate in only one sense, for example, clockwise. We show that there is an infinite family of both time-reversible and time-irreversible homogeneous electromagnetic media that support unidirectional propagation for a particular polarization. As well as extending the concept of the refractive index, shedding new light on our understanding of topological photonics and providing new sets of material parameters, our simple picture also reproduces many of the findings derived using topology. A general approach to derive direction-dependent complex refractive indices close to zero produces infinite families of time-reversible and infinite families of time-irreversible electromagnetic materials, without invoking the concept of topology.},

Recent work has shown that interleaving the unitary operations with single-qubit measurements can drive a transition between high- and low-entanglement phases. Here we study a class of symmetric random quantum circuits with two competing types of measurement in addition to unitary dynamics. We find a rich phase diagram involving robust symmetry-protected topological, trivial and volume law entangled phases, where the transitions are hidden to expectation values of any operator and are only apparent by averaging the entanglement entropy over quantum trajectories. In the absence of unitary dynamics, we find a purely measurement-induced critical point, which maps exactly to two copies of a classical two-dimensional percolation problem. Numerical simulations indicate that this transition is a tricritical point that splits into two critical lines in the presence of arbitrarily sparse unitary dynamics with an intervening volume law entangled phase. Our results show that measurements alone are sufficient to induce criticality and logarithmic entanglement scaling, and arbitrarily sparse unitary dynamics can be sufficient to stabilize volume law entangled phases in the presence of rapid, yet competing, measurements. Repeatedly measuring an array of qubits can create topologically distinct phases depending on which measurements are applied. Lavasani et al. show that critical behaviour can arise from the competition between different choices of measurements.},

  abstract     = {Quantum algorithms hold the promise of solving certain computational problems dramatically faster than their classical counterparts. The latest generation of quantum processors with ~50 qubits are expected to be at the brink of outperforming classical computers. However, due to the lack of fault tolerance, the qubits can be operated for only a few time steps, making the quantum circuits shallow in depth. Variational quantum algorithms are leading candidates in the effort to find shallow-depth quantum algorithms that outperform classical computers. Here we consider the task of computing the mean values of multi-qubit observables, which is a cornerstone of variational quantum algorithms for optimization, machine learning and the simulation of quantum many-body systems. We develop sub-exponential time classical algorithms for solving the quantum mean value problem for general classes of quantum observables and constant-depth quantum circuits. In the special case of geometrically local two-dimensional quantum circuits, the runtime of our algorithm scales linearly with the number of qubits. Our results demonstrate that appropriate choices of circuit parameters such as geometric locality and depth are essential to obtain quantum speed-ups based on variational quantum algorithms. Finding expectation values is a key step in variational quantum algorithms that are hoped to provide a near-term quantum advantage.

  abstract     = {Faster algorithms for combinatorial optimization could prove transformative for diverse areas such as logistics, finance and machine learning. Accordingly, the possibility of quantum enhanced optimization has driven much interest in quantum technologies. Here we demonstrate the application of the Google Sycamore superconducting qubit quantum processor to combinatorial optimization problems with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). Like past QAOA experiments, we study performance for problems defined on the planar connectivity graph native to our hardware; however, we also apply the QAOA to the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model and MaxCut, non-native problems that require extensive compilation to implement. For hardware-native problems, which are classically efficient to solve on average, we obtain an approximation ratio that is independent of problem size and observe that performance increases with circuit depth. For problems requiring compilation, performance decreases with problem size. Circuits involving several thousand gates still present an advantage over random guessing but not over some efficient classical algorithms. Our results suggest that it will be challenging to scale near-term implementations of the QAOA for problems on non-native graphs. As these graphs are closer to real-world instances, we suggest more emphasis should be placed on such problems when using the QAOA to benchmark quantum processors. It is hoped that quantum computers may be faster than classical ones at solving optimization problems. Here the authors implement a quantum optimization algorithm over 23 qubits but find more limited performance when an optimization problem structure does not match the underlying hardware.},

  abstract     = {Modern ultrashort X-ray/XUV (extreme ultraviolet) sources provide unique opportunities to investigate the primary reactions of matter upon energetic excitation. Understanding these processes in molecules on ultrafast timescales is required to improve bespoke high-energy radiation detectors, nanomedicine schemes or to study the molecular composition of interstellar media. However, current experiments struggle to provide a general framework because of the uniqueness and complexity of each system. Here we show the universal role of correlation bands—features created by electron correlation. This is done by studying ultrafast energy relaxation of size-scalable two-dimensional molecules following ionization by an ultrashort XUV pulse. We observed long lifetimes that nonlinearly increase with the number of valence electrons. A general law based on solid-like electron–phonon scattering is proposed, which explains both our results and previously reported measurements. This offers new opportunities in attosecond science and high-energy photophysics. The size-dependent lifetimes observed in the ultrafast molecular relaxation dynamics of an entire class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be explained by correlation bands and electron–phonon scattering, reminiscent of solid-state systems.},

  abstract     = {Optomechanics and electromechanics have made it possible to prepare macroscopic mechanical oscillators in their quantum ground states1, in quadrature-squeezed states2 and in entangled states of motion3. However, the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity precludes access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy-squeezed states. Strong quadratic coupling of motion to light could allow a way around this restriction4–6. Although there have been experimental demonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems5,7,8, these have not yet accessed non-classical states of motion. Here we create non-classical states by quadratically coupling motion to the energy levels of a Cooper-pair box qubit. Through microwave-frequency drives that change the state of both the oscillator and qubit, we then dissipatively stabilize the oscillator in a state with a large mean phonon number of 43 and sub-Poissonian number fluctuations of approximately 3. In this energy-squeezed state, we observe a striking feature of the quadratic coupling: the recoil of the mechanical oscillator caused by qubit transitions, closely analogous to the vibronic transitions in molecules9,10. Strong quadratic coupling between the motion of a membrane and the energy states of a qubit enables the creation of a non-classical energy-squeezed state in the mechanical oscillator.},

  abstract     = {Vortex rings are remarkably stable structures that occur in a large variety of systems, such as in turbulent gases (where they are at the origin of weather phenomena)1, fluids (with implications for biology)2, electromagnetic discharges3 and plasmas4. Although vortex rings have also been predicted to exist in ferromagnets5, they have not yet been observed. Using X-ray magnetic nanotomography6, we imaged three-dimensional structures forming closed vortex loops in a bulk micromagnet. The cross-section of these loops consists of a vortex–antivortex pair and, on the basis of magnetic vorticity (a quantity analogous to hydrodynamic vorticity), we identify these configurations as magnetic vortex rings. Although such structures have been predicted to exist as transient states in exchange ferromagnets5, the vortex rings we observe exist as static configurations, and we attribute their stability to the dipolar interaction. In addition, we observe stable vortex loops intersected by point singularities7 at which the magnetization within the vortex and antivortex cores reverses. We gain insight into the stability of these states through field and thermal equilibration protocols. The observation of stable magnetic vortex rings opens up possibilities for further studies of complex three-dimensional solitons in bulk magnets, enabling the development of applications based on three-dimensional magnetic structures. Three-dimensional structures of vortex loops in a bulk micromagnet GdCo2 have been observed using X-ray magnetic nanotomography.

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional topological insulators are a phase of matter that hosts unique spin-polarized gapless surface states that are protected by time-reversal symmetry. They exhibit unconventional charge and spin transport properties1,2. Intense laser fields can drive ballistic charge dynamics in Dirac bands3,4 or they can coherently steer spin5 and valley pseudospin6. Similarly, high-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids provides insights into the dynamics of the electrons in topological insulators7–13. Despite several theoretical attempts to identify a topological signature in the high-harmonic spectrum14–16, a unique fingerprint has yet to be found experimentally. Here, we observe HHG that arises from topological surface states in the intrinsic topological insulator BiSbTeSe2. The components of the even-order harmonics that are polarized along the pump polarization stem from the spin current in helical surface states, whereas the perpendicular components originate from the out-of-plane spin polarization related to the hexagonal wrapping effect17. The dependence of HHG on surface doping in ambient air also suggests the presence of a Rashba-split two-dimensional electron gas, whose strength can be enhanced by an increase in the intensity of the mid-infrared pump. High-harmonic generation up to the seventh harmonic is observed from the intrinsic three-dimensional topological insulator BiSbTeSe2. The parallel components of the even-order harmonics arise directly from the topological surface states.},

  abstract     = {While mean-field approximations, such as the nuclear shell model, provide a good description of many bulk nuclear properties, they fail to capture the important effects of nucleon–nucleon correlations such as the short-distance and high-momentum components of the nuclear many-body wave function1. Here, we study these components using the effective pair-based generalized contact formalism2,3 and ab initio quantum Monte Carlo calculations of nuclei from deuteron to 40Ca (refs. 4–6). We observe a universal factorization of the many-body nuclear wave function at short distance into a strongly interacting pair and a weakly interacting residual system. The residual system distribution is consistent with that of an uncorrelated system, showing that short-distance correlation effects are predominantly embedded in two-body correlations. Spin- and isospin-dependent ‘nuclear contact terms’ are extracted in both coordinate and momentum space for different realistic nuclear potentials. The contact coefficient ratio between two different nuclei shows very little dependence on the nuclear interaction model. These findings thus allow extending the application of mean-field approximations to short-range correlated pair formation by showing that the relative abundance of short-range pairs in the nucleus is a long-range (that is, mean field) quantity that is insensitive to the short-distance nature of the nuclear force. Effects of nucleon–nucleon correlations are studied with the generalized contact formalism and ab initio quantum Monte Carlo calculations. For nuclei from deuteron to 40Ca, the many-body nuclear wave function is shown to factorize at short distances.},

Here, we develop a maximally predictive behavioural-state space from multivariate measurements, in which the full instantaneous state is smoothly unfolded as a combination of short-time posture sequences. In the off-food behaviour of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, we discover a low-dimensional state space dominated by three sets of cyclic trajectories corresponding to the worm’s basic stereotyped motifs: forward, backward and turning locomotion. We find similar results in the on-food behaviour of foraging worms and npr-1 mutants. In contrast to this broad stereotypy, we find variability in the presence of locally unstable dynamics with signatures of deterministic chaos: a collection of unstable periodic orbits together with a positive maximal Lyapunov exponent. The full Lyapunov spectrum is symmetric with positive, chaotic exponents driving variability balanced by negative, dissipative exponents driving stereotypy. The symmetry is indicative of damped–driven Hamiltonian dynamics underlying the worm’s movement control. Animal behaviour is characterized by repeated movements which can be difficult to analyse quantitatively. Here, the authors apply a data-driven framework based on theory of dynamical systems to characterize nematode behaviour and explain its complexity through deterministic chaotic dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Collective cell migration offers a rich field of study for non-equilibrium physics and cellular biology, revealing phenomena such as glassy dynamics, pattern formation and active turbulence. However, how mechanical and chemical signalling are integrated at the cellular level to give rise to such collective behaviours remains unclear. We address this by focusing on the highly conserved phenomenon of spatiotemporal waves of density and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, which appear both in vitro and in vivo during collective cell migration and wound healing. First, we propose a biophysical theory, backed by mechanical and optogenetic perturbation experiments, showing that patterns can be quantitatively explained by a mechanochemical coupling between active cellular tensions and the mechanosensitive ERK pathway. Next, we demonstrate how this biophysical mechanism can robustly induce long-ranged order and migration in a desired orientation, and we determine the theoretically optimal wavelength and period for inducing maximal migration towards free edges, which fits well with experimentally observed dynamics. We thereby provide a bridge between the biophysical origin of spatiotemporal instabilities and the design principles of robust and efficient long-ranged migration. Spatiotemporal waves appear during collective cell migration and are affected by mechanical forces and biochemical signalling. Here the authors develop a biophysical model that can quantitatively account for complex mechanochemical patterns, and predict how they can be used for optimal collective migration.},

Streamlining active matter is especially important at the microscale, where the viscous forces prevail over inertia and transport requires a non-reciprocal motion. Here we report that microscopic active droplets representing aqueous dispersions of swimming bacteria Bacillus subtilis become unidirectionally motile when placed in an inactive nematic liquid-crystal medium. Random motion of bacteria inside the droplet is rectified into a directional self-locomotion of the droplet by the polar director structure that the droplet creates in the surrounding nematic through anisotropic molecular interactions at its surface. Droplets without active swimmers show no net displacement. The trajectory of the active droplet can be predesigned by patterning the molecular orientation of the nematic. The effect demonstrates that broken spatial symmetry of the medium can be the reason for and the means to control directional microscale transport. Active matter particles self-propel but controlling their direction of motion can be challenging. Here the authors place motile bacteria inside microdroplets and control their propulsion by exploiting the asymmetric director structure of the surrounding liquid crystal.},

Developing an effective, coarse-grained description of morphogenesis is essential for understanding how these processes are coordinated across scales to form robust, functional outcomes. Here we show that the nematic order of the supracellular actin fibres in regenerating Hydra defines a slowly varying field, whose dynamics provide an effective description of the morphogenesis process. We show that topological defects in this field, which are long-lived yet display rich dynamics, act as organization centres with morphological features developing at defect sites. These observations suggest that the nematic orientation field can be considered a ‘mechanical morphogen’ whose dynamics, in conjugation with various biochemical and mechanical signalling processes, result in the robust emergence of functional patterns during morphogenesis. Topological defects in the nematic order of actin fibres in a regenerating organism are shown to be tied to key feature formation. Fibre alignment sets the regenerated body axis and defect sites form organizing centres for the developing body plan.},

However, the possibility of realizing commercial technologies based on ultrafast spin dynamics has been hampered by our limited knowledge of the physics behind processes on this timescale. Recently, it has been suggested that inertial effects should be considered in the full description of the spin dynamics at these ultrafast timescales, but a clear observation of such effects in ferromagnets is still lacking. Here, we report direct experimental evidence of intrinsic inertial spin dynamics in ferromagnetic thin films in the form of a nutation of the magnetization at a frequency of ~0.5 THz. This allows us to reveal that the angular momentum relaxation time in ferromagnets is on the order of 10 ps. Inertial dynamics are observed in a ferromagnet. Specifically, a nutation is seen on top of the usual spin precession that has a lifetime on the order of 10 picoseconds.},

  abstract     = {In RuCl3, inelastic neutron scattering and Raman spectroscopy reveal a continuum of non-spin-wave excitations that persists to high temperature, suggesting the presence of a spin liquid state on a honeycomb lattice. In the context of the Kitaev model, finite magnetic fields introduce interactions between the elementary excitations, and thus the effects of high magnetic fields that are comparable to the spin-exchange energy scale must be explored. Here, we report measurements of the magnetotropic coefficient—the thermodynamic coefficient associated with magnetic anisotropy—over a wide range of magnetic fields and temperatures. We find that magnetic field and temperature compete to determine the magnetic response in a way that is independent of the large intrinsic exchange-interaction energy. This emergent scale-invariant magnetic anisotropy provides evidence for a high degree of exchange frustration that favours the formation of a spin liquid state in RuCl3. Scale-invariant magnetic anisotropy in RuCl3 has been revealed through measurements of its magnetotropic coefficient, providing evidence for a high degree of exchange frustration that favours the formation of a spin liquid state.},

Previously, the thermalization–MBL transition has been largely characterized with the growth of disorder. Here, we explore a new axis, reporting on an energy-resolved MBL transition using a 19-qubit programmable superconducting processor, which enables precise control and flexibility of both disorder strength and initial state preparation. We observe that the onset of localization occurs at different disorder strengths, with distinguishable energy scales, by measuring time-evolved observables and quantities related to many-body wave functions. Our results open avenues for the experimental exploration of many-body mobility edges in MBL systems, whose existence is widely debated due to the finiteness of the system size, and where exact simulations in classical computers become unfeasible. Many-body localization—a phenomenon where an isolated system fails to reach thermal equilibrium—has been studied with a programmable quantum processor, which reveals the crucial role played by the initial energy on the onset of localization.},

The disparity of hybrid systems and the vulnerability of quantum correlations have thus far hampered the generation of macroscopic hybrid entanglement. Here, we generate an entangled state between the motion of a macroscopic mechanical oscillator and a collective atomic spin oscillator, as witnessed by an Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen variance below the separability limit, 0.83 ± 0.02 &amp;lt; 1. The mechanical oscillator is a millimetre-size dielectric membrane and the spin oscillator is an ensemble of 109 atoms in a magnetic field. Light propagating through the two spatially separated systems generates entanglement because the collective spin plays the role of an effective negative-mass reference frame and provides—under ideal circumstances—a back-action-free subspace; in the experiment, quantum back-action is suppressed by 4.6 dB. Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen entanglement between a millimetre-size mechanical membrane oscillator and a collective atomic spin oscillator formed by an ensemble of caesium atoms is achieved, although the two systems are spatially separated by one metre.},

  abstract     = {The comparison of distant atomic clocks is foundational to international timekeeping, global positioning and tests of fundamental physics. Optical-fibre links allow the most precise optical clocks to be compared, without degradation, over intracontinental distances up to thousands of kilometres, but intercontinental comparisons remain limited by the performance of satellite transfer techniques. Here we show that very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), although originally developed for radio astronomy and geodesy, can overcome this limit and compare remote clocks through the observation of extragalactic radio sources. We developed dedicated transportable VLBI stations that use broadband detection and demonstrate the comparison of two optical clocks located in Italy and Japan separated by 9,000 km. This system demonstrates performance beyond satellite techniques and can pave the way for future long-term stable international clock comparisons. Very long baseline interferometry is used to compare two optical clocks located in Japan and Italy through the observation of extragalactic radio sources. This approach overcomes limitations of the performance of satellite transfer techniques.},

  abstract     = {While the structural characteristics of a network are uniquely determined by its adjacency matrix1–3, in physical networks, such as the brain or the vascular system, the network’s three-dimensional layout also affects the system’s structure and function. We lack, however, the tools to distinguish physical networks with identical wiring but different geometrical layouts. To address this need, here we introduce the concept of network isotopy, representing different network layouts that can be transformed into one another without link crossings, and show that a single quantity, the graph linking number, captures the entangledness of a layout, defining distinct isotopy classes. We find that a network’s elastic energy depends linearly on the graph linking number, indicating that each local tangle offers an independent contribution to the total energy. This finding allows us to formulate a statistical model for the formation of tangles in physical networks. We apply the developed framework to a diverse set of real physical networks, finding that the mouse connectome is more entangled than expected based on optimal wiring. Recently, a framework was introduced to model three-dimensional physical networks, such as brain or vascular ones, in a way that does not allow link crossings. Here the authors combine concepts from knot theory and statistical mechanics to be able to distinguish between physical networks with identical wiring but different layouts.},

  abstract     = {The soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus lives in densely packed groups that form dynamic three-dimensional patterns in response to environmental changes, such as droplet-like fruiting bodies during starvation1. The development of these multicellular structures begins with the sequential formation of cell layers in a process that is poorly understood2. Here, using confocal three-dimensional imaging, we find that motile, rod-shaped M. xanthus cells are densely packed and aligned in each layer, forming an active nematic liquid crystal. Cell alignment is nearly perfect throughout the population except at point defects that carry half-integer topological charge. We observe that new cell layers preferentially form at the position of +1/2 defects, whereas holes preferentially open at −1/2 defects. To explain these findings, we model the bacterial colony as an extensile active nematic fluid with anisotropic friction. In agreement with our experimental measurements, this model predicts an influx of cells towards the +1/2 defects and an outflux of cells from the −1/2 defects. Our results suggest that cell motility and mechanical cell–cell interactions are sufficient to promote the formation of cell layers at topological defects, thereby seeding fruiting bodies in colonies of M. xanthus. Topological defects in active nematic systems such as epithelial tissues and neural progenitor cells can be associated with biological functions. Here, the authors show that defects can play a role in the layer formation of the soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus.},

  abstract     = {Bacteria commonly live attached to surfaces in dense collectives containing billions of cells1. While it is known that motility allows these groups to expand en masse into new territory2–5, how bacteria collectively move across surfaces under such tightly packed conditions remains poorly understood. Here we combine experiments, cell tracking and individual-based modelling to study the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa as it collectively migrates across surfaces using grappling-hook-like pili3,6,7. We show that the fast-moving cells of a hyperpilated mutant are overtaken and outcompeted by the slower-moving wild type at high cell densities. Using theory developed to study liquid crystals8–13, we demonstrate that this effect is mediated by the physics of topological defects, points where cells with different orientations meet one another. Our analyses reveal that when defects with topological charge +1/2 collide with one another, the fast-moving mutant cells rotate to point vertically and become trapped. By moving more slowly, wild-type cells avoid this trapping mechanism and generate collective behaviour that results in faster migration. In this way, the physics of liquid crystals explains how slow bacteria can outcompete faster cells in the race for new territory. Bacteria are able to move as vast, dense collectives. Here the authors show that slow movement is key to this collective behaviour because faster bacteria cause topological defects to collide together and trap cells in place.},

  abstract     = {Sr2RuO4 has stood as the leading candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor for 26 years1. However, recent NMR experiments have cast doubt on this candidacy2,3 and it is difficult to find a theory of superconductivity that is consistent with all experiments. The order parameter symmetry for this material therefore remains an open question. Symmetry-based experiments are needed that can rule out broad classes of possible superconducting order parameters. Here, we use resonant ultrasound spectroscopy to measure the entire symmetry-resolved elastic tensor of Sr2RuO4 through the superconducting transition. We observe a thermodynamic discontinuity in the shear elastic modulus c66, which implies that the superconducting order parameter has two components. A two-component p-wave order parameter, such as px + ipy, naturally satisfies this requirement. As this order parameter appears to have been precluded by recent NMR experiments, we suggest that two other two-component order parameters, namely $${{d}_{xz},{d}_{yz}}$$ and $${{d}_{{x}^{2}-{y}^{2}},{g}_{xy({x}^{2}-{y}^{2})}}$$ , are now the prime candidates for the order parameter of Sr2RuO4.

This information is crucial to determine the pairing mechanism of Cooper pairs. Here we use ultrasound velocity to probe the superconducting state of Sr2RuO4. This thermodynamic probe is sensitive to the symmetry of the material, and therefore, it can help in identifying the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter4,5. Indeed, we observe a sharp jump in the shear elastic constant c66 as the temperature is increased across the superconducting transition. This directly implies that the superconducting order parameter is of a two-component nature. On the basis of symmetry arguments and given the other known properties of Sr2RuO4 (refs. 6–8), we discuss which states are compatible with this requirement and propose that the two-component order parameter {dxz; dyz} is the most likely candidate.

These properties are generally associated with strongly correlated states in a flat mini-band of the hexagonal moiré superlattice as was predicted by band structure calculations6–8. Evidence for the existence of a flat band comes from local tunnelling spectroscopy9–13 and electronic compressibility measurements14, which report two or more sharp peaks in the density of states that may be associated with closely spaced Van Hove singularities. However, direct momentum-resolved measurements have proved to be challenging15. Here, we combine different imaging techniques and angle-resolved photoemission with simultaneous real- and momentum-space resolution (nano-ARPES) to directly map the band dispersion in twisted bilayer graphene devices near charge neutrality. Our experiments reveal large areas with a homogeneous twist angle that support a flat band with a spectral weight that is highly localized in momentum space. The flat band is separated from the dispersive Dirac bands, which show multiple moiré hybridization gaps. These data establish the salient features of the twisted bilayer graphene band structure. Spectroscopic measurements using nano-ARPES on twisted bilayer graphene directly highlight the presence of the flat bands.},

Although tunnelling spectroscopy5–9 and electronic compressibility measurements10 in tBLG have found a van Hove singularity that is consistent with the presence of the flat miniband, a direct observation of the flat dispersion in the momentum space of such a moiré miniband in tBLG is still lacking. Here, we report the visualization of this flat moiré miniband by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with nanoscale resolution. The high spatial resolution of this technique enabled the measurement of the local electronic structure of the tBLG. The measurements demonstrate the existence of the flat moiré band near the charge neutrality for tBLG close to the magic angle at room temperature.

For an ideal laser beam1–3, the coherence can be thought of roughly as the number of photons emitted consecutively into the beam with the same phase. This number, $${\mathfrak{C}}$$ , can be much larger than the number of photons in the laser itself, μ. The limit for an ideal laser was thought to be of order μ2 (refs. 4,5). Here, assuming only that a laser produces a beam with properties close to those of an ideal laser beam and that it has no external sources of coherence, we derive an upper bound on $${\mathfrak{C}}$$ , which is of order μ4. Moreover, using the matrix product states method6, we find a model that achieves this scaling and show that it could, in principle, be realized using circuit quantum electrodynamics7. Thus, $${\mathfrak{C}}$$ of order μ2 is only a standard quantum limit; the ultimate quantum limit—or Heisenberg limit—is quadratically better. The coherence of a close-to-ideal laser beam can be quadratically better than what was believed to be the quantum limit. This new Heisenberg limit could be attained with circuit quantum electrodynamics.},

  abstract     = {Controlling the interactions between atoms with external fields opened up new branches in physics ranging from strongly correlated atomic systems to ideal Bose1 and Fermi2 gases and Efimov physics3,4. Such control usually prepares samples that are stationary or evolve adiabatically in time. In contrast, in molecular physics, external ultrashort laser fields are used to create anisotropic potentials that launch ultrafast rotational wave packets and align molecules in free space5. Here we combine these two regimes of ultrafast times and low energies. We apply a short laser pulse to the helium dimer, a weakly bound and highly delocalized single bound state quantum system. The laser field locally tunes the interaction between two helium atoms, imparting an angular momentum of 2ℏ and evoking an initially confined dissociative wave packet. We record a video of the density and phase of this wave packet as it propagates from small to large internuclear distances. At large internuclear distances, where the interaction between atoms is negligible, the wave packet is essentially free. This work paves the way for future tomography of wave-packet dynamics and provides the technique for studying exotic and otherwise hardly accessible quantum systems, such as halo and Efimov states. Ultrashort laser fields applied to a helium dimer are able to tune the interactions between two helium atoms. A video of the dimer’s response to this localized disturbance shows the effect of dissociation and alignment of the wave packets.},

  abstract     = {Twisted van der Waals heterostructures have latterly received prominent attention for their many remarkable experimental properties and the promise that they hold for realizing elusive states of matter in the laboratory. We propose that these systems can, in fact, be used as a robust quantum simulation platform that enables the study of strongly correlated physics and topology in quantum materials. Among the features that make these materials a versatile toolbox are the tunability of their properties through readily accessible external parameters such as gating, straining, packing and twist angle; the feasibility to realize and control a large number of fundamental many-body quantum models relevant in the field of condensed-matter physics; and finally, the availability of experimental readout protocols that directly map their rich phase diagrams in and out of equilibrium. This general framework makes it possible to robustly realize and functionalize new phases of matter in a modular fashion, thus broadening the landscape of accessible physics and holding promise for future technological applications. Moiré heterostructures have latterly captured the attention of condensed-matter physicists.

  abstract     = {The pace and unpredictability of evolution are critically relevant in a variety of modern challenges, such as combating drug resistance in pathogens and cancer, understanding how species respond to environmental perturbations like climate change and developing artificial selection approaches for agriculture. Great progress has been made in quantitative modelling of evolution using fitness landscapes, allowing a degree of prediction for future evolutionary histories. Yet fine-grained control of the speed and distributions of these trajectories remains elusive. We propose an approach to achieve this using ideas originally developed in a completely different context—counterdiabatic driving to control the behaviour of quantum states for applications like quantum computing and manipulating ultracold atoms. Implementing these ideas for the first time in a biological context, we show how a set of external control parameters (that is, varying drug concentrations and types, temperature and nutrients) can guide the probability distribution of genotypes in a population along a specified path and time interval. This level of control, allowing empirical optimization of evolutionary speed and trajectories, has myriad potential applications, from enhancing adaptive therapies for diseases to the development of thermotolerant crops in preparation for climate change, to accelerating bioengineering methods built on evolutionary models, like directed evolution of biomolecules. The unpredictability of evolution makes it difficult to deal with drug resistance because over the course of a treatment there may be mutations that we cannot predict. The authors propose to use quantum methods to control the speed and distribution of potential evolutionary outcomes.},

  abstract     = {The influence of geometry on the local and global packing of particles is important to many fundamental and applied research themes, such as the structure and stability of liquids, crystals and glasses. Here we show by experiments and simulations that a binary mixture of hard-sphere-like nanoparticles crystallizing into a MgZn2 Laves phase in bulk spontaneously forms icosahedral clusters in slowly drying droplets. Using advanced electron tomography, we are able to obtain the real-space coordinates of all the spheres in the icosahedral clusters of up to about 10,000 particles. The local structure of 70–80\% of the particles became similar to that of the MgCu2 Laves phase. These observations are important for photonic applications. In addition, we observed in simulations that the icosahedral clusters nucleated away from the spherical boundary, which is distinctly different from that of the single species clusters. Our findings open the way for particle-level studies of nucleation and growth of icosahedral clusters, and of binary crystallization. The authors investigate out-of-equilibrium crystallization of a binary mixture of sphere-like nanoparticles in small droplets. They observe the spontaneous formation of an icosahedral structure with stable MgCu2 phases, which are promising for photonic applications.},

  abstract     = {Crystallization under geometrical confinement is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics, biophysics and material science. Even the influence of the simplest geometry, a sphere, on crystallization remains far from well understood, thereby making morphology control of the final superstructures challenging. Here, we employ charged colloids encapsulated in an emulsion droplet as a model system to access the crystallization kinetics at the single-particle level. We find rapid formation of ‘skin’ layers with an icosahedral arrangement of defects under the geometrical frustration effect, followed by interior ordering and slow ripening. The final morphologies are determined by dynamical interplay between the system-independent skin layer formation and the system-dependent structural transformation towards the most stable solid far from the surface. We reveal the crucial role of kinetics in morphological selection under a geometrical constraint, besides the thermodynamics, which may shed new light on the structural design of nanoscale crystals. The authors investigate the role of spherical confinement and curvature-induced topological defects on the crystallization of charged colloids. They conclude that crystallization in spherical confinement is due to a combination of thermodynamics and kinetic pathways.},

  abstract     = {Glass is inherently unstable to crystallization. However, how this transformation occurs while the dynamics in the glass stay frozen at the particle scale is poorly understood. Here, through single-particle-resolved imaging experiments, we show that due to frozen-in density inhomogeneities, a soft colloidal glass crystallizes via two distinct pathways. In the poorly packed regions of the glass, crystallinity grew smoothly due to local particle shuffles, whereas in the well-packed regions, we observed abrupt jumps in crystallinity that were triggered by avalanches—cooperative rearrangements involving many tens of particles. Importantly, we show that softness—a structural-order parameter determined through machine-learning methods—not only predicts where crystallization initiates in a glass but is also sensitive to the crystallization pathway. Such a causal connection between the structure and stability of a glass has so far remained elusive. Devising strategies to manipulate softness may thus prove invaluable in realizing long-lived glassy states. Softness, a machine-learned structural quantity, has been recently identified as a parameter that characterizes glassy dynamics. Here, the authors observe devitrification in 3D soft colloidal glasses and find that softness may indicate regions predisposed to crystallization.},

  abstract     = {Superradiance is the anomalous radiance describing coherent photon emission from a gas. It plays a crucial role in atomic physics, quantum mechanics and astrophysics. Because the intensity of superradiant light beams is proportional to the number of particles squared, superradiance is also at the core of today’s most powerful light sources. Superradiant emission is intuitively expected when the distance between light-emitting particles is much smaller than the photon wavelength. Here, we break this assumption by predicting a never considered superradiance effect that holds even when the particle number per wavelength vanishes. We discover that a bunch of relativistic charged particles arranged in certain ways can generate an optical shock along the Vavilov–Cherenkov angle in vacuum, thereby concentrating broadband radiation in any spectral region into single light bullets. The process leaves clear experimental signatures, and we illustrate it in the form of a previously unrecognized nonlinear superradiant Thomson scattering. This concept may enable new forms of superradiant emission in advanced light sources, atomic physics systems, and unlock coherent emission in plasma accelerators. A new form of superradiance is predicted that ‘in contrast to the standard effect’ arises even for vanishing numbers of particles per wavelength. This finding may enable coherent emission in plasma accelerators.},

However, further exploration of two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures is hindered by the limited coupling strength and lack of efficient methods for tuning the interlayer interactions. Here, by using a two-step chemical vapour deposition method, we realize high-quality 2H-stacked WSe2–MoSe2 heterostructures with strong interlayer coupling, and effective tuning of their interlayer interaction by hydrostatic pressure. We unambiguously establish the strong coupling nature in these WSe2–MoSe2 heterostructures through the existence of exclusive interlayer excitons instead of the typical intralayer excitons. We further demonstrate efficient tuning of the interlayer coupling by using pressure engineering, and observe a clear evolution and transition of interlayer excitons in WSe2–MoSe2 heterostructures with a pressure-induced band changeover, which is further confirmed by first-principles calculations. Our findings provide new opportunities for producing, exploring and tuning van der Waals heterostructures with strong interlayer coupling that can lead towards the realization of future excitonic devices based on tailor-made, atomically thin, two-dimensional stacks. High-quality WSe2–MoSe2 heterostructures support strong coupling between the two layers, which is associated with tight hybridization and effective charge separation. In these structures, the bands of the interlayer excitons can be pressure-engineered.},

Here, we engineer two superconducting LC circuits coupled by a strong photon-pressure interaction, a term we use in analogy to the radiation-pressure interaction between light and mechanical objects. The coupling arises from a change in the resonant frequency of one circuit in response to the current flowing in the second. We observe dynamical backaction between the two circuits, photon-pressure-induced transparency and absorption, and enter the strong coupling regime. Furthermore, we observe parametrically amplified thermal current fluctuations in a radiofrequency circuit close to its quantum ground state. Owing to the high design flexibility of superconducting circuits, our approach will enable new experiments with radiofrequency photons and parameter regimes of photon-pressure coupling that are not accessible in other platforms. Analogous to the radiation-pressure coupling known in optomechanics, photon-pressure interaction between superconducting circuits can reach the strong coupling regime, which allows flexible control of the electromagnetic resonator’s quantum state.},

Here we report the results of a direct search for electromagnetic interactions of axion-like dark matter in the mass range that spans three decades from 12 peV to 12 neV. The detection scheme is based on a modification of Maxwell’s equations in the presence of axion-like dark matter that mixes with a static magnetic field to produce an oscillating magnetic field. The experiment makes use of toroidal magnets with ferromagnetic powder cores made of an iron–nickel alloy, which enhance the static magnetic field by a factor of 24. Using superconducting quantum interference devices, we achieve magnetic sensitivity of 150  $$\mathrm{aT}\, {\mathrm{Hz}}^{-1/2}$$ , which is at the level of the most sensitive magnetic field measurements demonstrated with any broadband sensor. We recorded 41 h of data and improved the best limits on the magnitude of electromagnetic coupling constant for axion-like dark matter over a part of our mass range, at 20 peV reaching 4.0 × 10−11 GeV−1 (95\% confidence level). Our measurements begin to explore the coupling strengths and masses of axion-like particles, where their mixing with photons could explain the anomalous transparency of the Universe to TeV γ-rays. The presence of axion-like dark matter candidates is expected to induce an oscillating magnetic field, enhanced by a ferromagnet. Limits on the electromagnetic coupling strength of axion-like particles are reported over a mass range spanning three decades.},

  abstract     = {Roger Penrose proposed that a spatial quantum superposition collapses as a back-reaction from spacetime, which is curved in different ways by each branch of the superposition. In this sense, one speaks of gravity-related wave function collapse. He also provided a heuristic formula to compute the decay time of the superposition—similar to that suggested earlier by Lajos Diósi, hence the name Diósi–Penrose model. The collapse depends on the effective size of the mass density of particles in the superposition, and is random: this randomness shows up as a diffusion of the particles’ motion, resulting, if charged, in the emission of radiation. Here, we compute the radiation emission rate, which is faint but detectable. We then report the results of a dedicated experiment at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory to measure this radiation emission rate. Our result sets a lower bound on the effective size of the mass density of nuclei, which is about three orders of magnitude larger than previous bounds. This rules out the natural parameter-free version of the Diósi–Penrose model. The radiation emission rate from gravity-related wave function collapse is calculated and the results of a dedicated experiment at the Gran Sasso laboratory are reported, ruling out the natural parameter-free version of the Diósi–Penrose model.},

In these environments, microbial transport by disordered flows is relevant for a broad range of natural and engineered processes, from biochemical cycling to remineralization and bioremediation4–7. Yet, how bacteria are transported and distributed in the subsurface as a result of the disordered flow and the associated chemical gradients characteristic of porous media has remained poorly understood, in part because studies have so far focused on steady, macroscale chemical gradients8–10. Here, we use a microfluidic model system that captures flow disorder and chemical gradients at the pore scale to quantify the transport and dispersion of the soil-dwelling bacterium Bacillus subtilis in porous media. We observe that chemotaxis strongly modulates the persistence of bacteria in low-flow regions of the pore space, resulting in a 100\% increase in their dispersion coefficient. This effect stems directly from the strong pore-scale gradients created by flow disorder and demonstrates that the microscale interplay between bacterial behaviour and pore-scale disorder can impact the macroscale dynamics of biota in the subsurface. Bacteria live in heterogeneous environments, so it is important to investigate their behaviour in porous media. Here the authors show that flow disorder enhances the effect of chemical gradients in micropockets in a porous medium, which then aid the transport of bacteria.},

In this work, we simulate the structural properties and vibrational Raman, infrared and optical spectra of hydrogen phase III, accounting for proton quantum effects. We demonstrate that nuclear quantum fluctuations downshift the vibron frequencies by 25\%, introduce a broad lineshape into the Raman spectra and reduce the optical gap by 3 eV. We show that hydrogen metallization occurs at 380 GPa in phase III due to band overlap, in good agreement with transport data2. Our simulations predict that this state is a black metal—transparent in the infrared—so the shiny metal observed at 490 GPa (ref. 1) is not phase III. We predict that the conductivity onset and optical gap will substantially increase if hydrogen is replaced by deuterium, underlining that metallization is driven by quantum fluctuations and is thus isotope-dependent. We show how hydrogen acquires conductivity and brightness at different pressures, explaining the apparent contradictions in existing experimental scenarios1–3.

Here, we show that the Hall effect of the unconventional superconductor BaFe2(As1−xPx)2 contains an anomalous contribution arising from the correlations within the strange metal. This term has a distinctive dependence on the magnetic field, which allows us to track its behaviour across the doping–temperature phase diagram, even under the superconducting dome. These measurements demonstrate that the strange metal Hall component emanates from a quantum critical point and, in the zero-temperature limit, decays together with the superconducting critical temperature. This empirically reveals the structure of the connection between superconductivity and quantum criticality, which may be common to the physics of many strange metal superconductors. The strange metal phase in unconventional superconductors is probed by Hall measurements. This reveals that quantum criticality drives the Hall effect, which also correlates with the superconductivity. This indicates that all three may be linked.},

Quantum fluctuations associated with these orders may account for the unusual characteristics of the normal state, and possibly affect the superconductivity1–4. Yet, spectroscopic evidence for such quantum fluctuations remains elusive. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to reveal spectroscopic evidence of fluctuations associated with a charge order5–14 in nearly optimally doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ. In the superconducting state, while the quasielastic charge order signal decreases with temperature, the interplay between charge order fluctuations and bond-stretching phonons in the form of a Fano-like interference increases, an observation that is incompatible with expectations for competing orders. Invoking general principles, we argue that this behaviour reflects the properties of a dissipative system near an order–disorder quantum critical point, where the dissipation varies with the opening of the pseudogap and superconducting gap at low temperatures, leading to the proliferation of quantum critical fluctuations, which melt charge order.

  abstract     = {In 1929, Felix Bloch suggested that the paramagnetic Fermi sea of electrons should make a spontaneous transition to a fully magnetized state at very low densities, because the exchange energy gained by aligning the spins exceeds the enhancement in the kinetic energy1. However, experimental realizations of this effect have been hard to implement. Here, we report the observation of an abrupt, interaction-driven transition to full magnetization, highly reminiscent of Bloch ferromagnetism. Our platform utilizes the two-dimensional Fermi sea of composite fermions near half-filling of the lowest Landau level. We measure the Fermi wavevector—which directly provides the spin polarization—and observe a sudden transition from a partially spin-polarized to a fully spin-polarized ground state as we lower the density of the composite fermions. Our theoretical calculations that take Landau level mixing into account provide a semi-quantitative account of this phenomenon. Composite fermions can be tuned to very low effective density in a clean two-dimensional electron gas, which allows the formation of a Bloch ferromagnet.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid quantum materials allow for quantum phases that otherwise do not exist in nature1,2. For example, a one-dimensional topological superconductor with Majorana states bound to its ends can be realized by coupling a semiconductor nanowire to a superconductor in the presence of a strong magnetic field3–5. However, the applied magnetic fields are detrimental to superconductivity, and constrain device layout, components, materials, fabrication and operation6. Early on, an alternative source of Zeeman coupling that circumvents these constraints—using a ferromagnetic insulator instead of an applied field—was proposed theoretically7. Here, we report transport measurements in hybrid nanowires using epitaxial layers of superconducting Al and the ferromagnetic insulator EuS on semiconducting InAs nanowires. We infer a remanent effective Zeeman field exceeding 1 T and observe stable zero-bias conductance peaks in bias spectroscopy at zero applied field, consistent with topological superconductivity. Hysteretic spectral features in applied magnetic field support this picture. By incorporating a ferromagnetic layer in their superconductor–semiconductor nanowire hybrid device, Vaitiekėnas et al. show that zero-bias peaks—potential Majorana bound states—can be induced without an external magnetic field.},

Its physical origin is a result of an intrinsically inverted electronic band structure and ferromagnetism3, and its most important manifestation is the dissipationless flow of chiral charge currents at the edges of the system4, a property that has the potential to transform future quantum electronics5,6. Here, we report a Berry-curvature-driven4,7 anomalous Hall regime at temperatures of several Kelvin in the magnetic topological bulk crystals in which Mn ions self-organize into a period-ordered MnBi2Te4/Bi2Te3 superlattice. Robust ferromagnetism of the MnBi2Te4 monolayers opens a surface gap8–10, and when the Fermi level is tuned to be within this gap, the anomalous Hall conductance reaches an e2/h quantization plateau, which is a clear indication of chiral transport through the edge states. The quantization in this regime is not obstructed by the bulk conduction channels and therefore should be present in a broad family of topological magnets. A three-dimensional topological magnetic superlattice structure exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect when the Fermi energy is tuned into the correct energy window.},

  abstract     = {In contrast to interband excitons in undoped quantum wells, doped quantum wells do not display sharp resonances due to excitonic bound states. The effective Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes in these systems typically leads to only a depolarization shift of the single-electron intersubband transitions1. Non-perturbative light–matter interaction in solid-state devices has been investigated as a pathway to tuning optoelectronic properties of materials2,3. A recent theoretical work4 predicted that when the doped quantum wells are embedded in a photonic cavity, emission–reabsorption processes of cavity photons can generate an effective attractive interaction that binds electrons and holes together, leading to the creation of an intraband bound exciton. Here, we spectroscopically observe such a bound state as a discrete resonance that appears below the ionization threshold only when the coupling between light and matter is increased above a critical value. Our result demonstrates that two charged particles can be bound by the exchange of transverse photons. Light–matter coupling can thus be used as a tool in quantum material engineering, tuning electronic properties of semiconductor heterostructures beyond those permitted by mere crystal structures, with direct applications to mid-infrared optoelectronics. Electrons and holes in doped quantum wells cannot form bound states from usual Coulomb interaction. However, when the system is embedded in a cavity, the exchange of photons provides an effective attraction, leading to the creation of bound excitons.},

In particular, heterostructures of twisted double bilayer graphene host correlated insulating states that can be tuned by both the twist angle and an external electric field11–14. Here, we report electrical transport measurements of twisted double bilayer graphene with which we examine the fundamental role of spontaneous symmetry breaking in its phase diagram. The metallic states near each of the correlated insulators exhibit abrupt drops in their resistivity as the temperature is lowered, along with associated nonlinear current–voltage characteristics. Despite qualitative similarities to superconductivity, the simultaneous reversals in the sign of the Hall coefficient point instead to spontaneous symmetry breaking as the origin of the abrupt resistivity drops, whereas Joule heating seems to underlie the nonlinear transport. Our results suggest that similar mechanisms are probably relevant across a broader class of semiconducting flat band van der Waals heterostructures. Transport measurements show that spontaneous symmetry breaking plays a crucial role in the correlated insulating and metallic states in twisted double bilayer graphene.},

The emergent van der Waals magnets1–3 provide a highly tunable platform to explore magnetic excitations in the two-dimensional limit with intriguing properties, manifesting from their honeycomb lattice structure and switchable magnetic configurations. Here, we report the direct observation of two-dimensional magnons through magneto-Raman spectroscopy with optical selection rules determined by the interplay between crystal symmetry, layer number and magnetic states in atomically thin CrI3. In monolayers, we observe an acoustic magnon mode at ~0.3 meV. It has strict cross-circularly polarized selection rules locked to the magnetization direction that originates from the conservation of angular momentum of photons and magnons dictated by three-fold rotational symmetry4. Additionally, we reveal optical magnon modes at ~17 meV. This mode is Raman silent in monolayers, but optically active in bilayers and bulk due to a relaxation of the parity criterion resulting from the layer index. In the layered antiferromagnetic states, we directly resolve two degenerate optical magnon modes with opposite angular momentum and conjugate optical selection rules. From these measurements, we quantitatively extract the spin-wave gap, magnetic anisotropy and intralayer and interlayer exchange constants, and establish two-dimensional magnets as a new platform for exploring magnon physics. Magnons are collective excitations that dictate many of a magnet’s low-temperature properties. By means of Raman scattering, the magnon spectra of CrI3 are measured in the monolayer limit.},

Be it for quantum particles (such as electrons) or classical waves (such as light, sound or mechanical motion), these concepts have so far been mostly developed in idealized scenarios, in which the wave amplitude is neither attenuated nor amplified, and time evolution is unitary. In recent years, however, there has been a considerable push to explore the consequences of topology and symmetries in non-conservative, non-equilibrium or non-Hermitian systems. A plethora of driven artificial materials has been reported, blurring the lines between a wide variety of fields in physics and engineering, including condensed matter, photonics, phononics, optomechanics, as well as electromagnetic and mechanical metamaterials. Here we discuss the latest advances, emerging opportunities and open challenges for combining these exciting research endeavours into the new pluridisciplinary field of non-Hermitian topological systems. The interplay of topological properties and non-Hermitian symmetry breaking has been implemented for a range of classical-wave systems.
