  abstract     = {Companion diagnostics (CDx) are powerful tests that can provide physicians with crucial biomarker information that can improve treatment outcomes by matching therapies to patients. Here, we report a photoacoustic imaging-based CDx (PACDx) for the selective detection of elevated glutathione (GSH) in a lung cancer model. GSH is abundant in most cells, so we adopted a physical organic chemistry approach to precisely tune the reactivity to distinguish between normal and pathological states. To evaluate the efficacy of PACDx in vivo, we designed a blind study where photoacoustic imaging was used to identify mice bearing lung xenografts. We also employed PACDx in orthotopic lung cancer and liver metastasis models to image GSH. In addition, we designed a matching prodrug, PARx, that uses the same SNAr chemistry to release a chemotherapeutic with an integrated PA readout. Studies demonstrate that PARx can inhibit tumour growth without off-target toxicity in a lung cancer xenograft model. Imaging-based companion diagnostics can provide real-time information to match therapies to patients; however, glutathione is abundant in most cells, making it an unlikely candidate for companion diagnosis. Now, a chemical probe has been developed that can detect elevated glutathione concentrations via photoacoustic imaging. Using this probe enables normal and pathological states in a lung cancer model to be distinguished.},

  abstract     = {A key approach for designing bioinspired machines is to transfer concepts from nature to man-made structures by integrating biomolecules into artificial mechanical systems. This strategy allows the conversion of molecular information into macroscopic action. Here, we describe the design and dynamic behaviour of hybrid bioelectrochemical swimmers that move spontaneously at the air–water interface. Their motion is governed by the diastereomeric interactions between immobilized enantiopure oligomers and the enantiomers of a chiral probe molecule present in solution. These dynamic bipolar systems are able to convert chiral information present at the molecular level into enantiospecific macroscopic trajectories. Depending on the enantiomer in solution, the swimmers will move clockwise or anticlockwise; the concept can also be used for the direct visualization of the degree of enantiomeric excess by analysing the curvature of the trajectories. Deciphering in such a straightforward way the enantiomeric ratio could be useful for biomedical applications, for the read-out of food quality or as a more general analogue of polarimetric measurements. Self-propelled artificial chemical swimmers have previously been developed for chemical sensing. Now, hybrid bioelectrochemical swimmers, capable of translating chiral molecular information into macroscopic motion, have been developed. Diastereomeric interactions between enantiopure oligomers immobilized on the swimmer and a chiral molecule present in solution control the trajectory of the device.},

  abstract     = {Layered materials have attracted tremendous interest for accessing two-dimensional structures. Materials such as graphite or transition metal dichalcogenides, in which the layers are held together by van der Waals interactions, can be exfoliated through a variety of processes in a manner that retains the structure and composition of the monolayers, but this has proven difficult for solids with stronger interlayer interactions. Here, we demonstrate the exfoliation of AgCrS2, a member of the AMX2 family (where A is a monovalent metal, M is a trivalent metal and X is a chalcogen), through intercalation with tetraalkylammonium cations, chosen for their suitable redox potential. The as-exfoliated nanosheets consist of Ag layers sandwiched between two CrS2 layers, similar to their structure in the bulk. They show superionic behaviour at room temperature, with an ionic conductivity of 33.2 mS cm−1 at 298 K that originates from Ag+ ions rapidly hopping between neighbouring tetrahedral interstices; in the bulk, this behaviour is only observed above 673 K. Layered materials held together by weak interactions can be exfoliated into monolayers that retain the structure and composition of their bulk counterpart, but this has remained challenging to achieve for non-van der Waals materials. Now, AgCrS2 has been exfoliated into such [CrS2]Ag[CrS2] nanosheets through intercalation with tetraalkylammonium cations chosen for their suitable redox potential. The nanosheets show superionic behaviour at room temperature.},

We have previously identified a [Fe8S8C] L*-cluster, which is homologous to the core structure of the L-cluster but lacks the ‘ninth sulfur’ in the belt region. However, direct evidence and mechanistic details of the L*- to L-cluster conversion upon ‘ninth sulfur’ insertion remain elusive. Here we trace the ‘ninth sulfur’ insertion using SeO32− and TeO32− as ‘labelled’ SO32−. Biochemical, electron paramagnetic resonance and X-ray absorption spectroscopy/extended X-ray absorption fine structure studies suggest a role of the ‘ninth sulfur’ in cluster transfer during cofactor biosynthesis while revealing the incorporation of Se2−- and Te2−-like species into the L-cluster. Density functional theory calculations further point to a plausible mechanism involving in situ reduction of SO32− to S2−, thereby suggesting the utility of this reaction to label the catalytically important belt region for mechanistic investigations of nitrogenase. Located in the catalytically important belt region, the ‘ninth sulfur’ of the nitrogenase cofactor has now been shown to be inserted through coordination of sulfite by two cluster iron atoms at a vacant belt site. This is followed by in situ reduction of sulfite to sulfide, which enables the subsequent transfer and functionalization of the cofactor.},

Previous efforts to catalyse this reaction with molecular complexes required the addition of exogenous oxidizing reagents or application of potentials greater than the thermodynamic potential for the oxygen reduction reaction—the cathodic process of a DAFC. We report a stable metal–metal bonded diruthenium complex that spontaneously produces dinitrogen from ammonia under ambient conditions. The resulting reduced diruthenium material can be reoxidized with oxygen for subsequent reactions with ammonia, demonstrating its ability to spontaneously promote both half-reactions necessary for a DAFC. The diruthenium complex also acts as a redox mediator for the electrocatalytic oxidation of ammonia to dinitrogen at potentials as low as −255 mV versus Fc0/+ and operates below the oxygen reduction reaction potential in alkaline conditions, thus achieving a thermodynamic viability relevant for the future development of DAFCs. The use of ammonia as an alternative fuel relies on its electrochemical conversion to dinitrogen in a fuel cell. Now a stable metal–metal bonded diruthenium complex is shown to spontaneously produce dinitrogen from ammonia under ambient conditions and is also able to electrocatalyse the oxidation of ammonia to dinitrogen at low potentials.},

  abstract     = {Most proteins begin to fold during biosynthesis on the ribosome. It has been suggested that interactions between the emerging polypeptide and the ribosome surface might allow the ribosome itself to modulate co-translational folding. Here we combine protein engineering and NMR spectroscopy to characterize a series of interactions between the ribosome surface and unfolded nascent chains of the immunoglobulin-like FLN5 filamin domain. The strongest interactions are found for a C-terminal segment that is essential for folding, and we demonstrate quantitative agreement between the strength of this interaction and the energetics of the co-translational folding process itself. Mutations in this region that reduce the extent of binding result in a shift in the co-translational folding equilibrium towards the native state. Our results therefore demonstrate that a competition between folding and binding provides a simple, dynamic mechanism for the modulation of co-translational folding by the ribosome. During polypeptide biosynthesis, a strong interaction can occur between a segment of an emerged, disordered nascent protein and the ribosomal surface. Now, it has been shown that competition between this ribosomal binding and the folding energetics of an immunoglobulin-like domain modulates the mechanism of co-translational folding.},

  abstract     = {Achieving the transition metal-catalysed pyridine C3−H alkenylation, with pyridine as the limiting reagent, has remained a long-standing challenge. Previously, we disclosed that the use of strong coordinating bidentate ligands can overcome catalyst deactivation and provide Pd-catalysed C3 alkenylation of pyridines. However, this strategy proved ineffective when using pyridine as the limiting reagent, as it required large excesses and high concentrations to achieve reasonable yields, which rendered it inapplicable to complex pyridines prevalent in bioactive molecules. Here we report that a bifunctional N-heterocyclic carbene-ligated Ni–Al catalyst can smoothly furnish C3–H alkenylation of pyridines. This method overrides the intrinsic C2 and/or C4 selectivity, and provides a series of C3-alkenylated pyridines in 43–99% yields and up to 98:2 C3 selectivity. This method not only allows a variety of pyridine and heteroarene substrates to be used as the limiting reagent, but is also effective for the late-stage C3 alkenylation of diverse complex pyridine motifs in bioactive molecules. Selective C–H alkenylation of pyridines at the C3 position, with the pyridine as the limiting reagent, is a long-standing synthetic challenge. Now, it has been shown that this can be achieved using a bifunctional N-heterocyclic carbene-ligated Ni–Al catalyst that overrides the intrinsic C2/4 selectivity of pyridines and enables the selective late-stage functionalization of a range of complex pyridyl-containing motifs.},

Responsive microscopic systems using a variety of stimuli have demonstrated impressive relative molecular motion. However, locating the position of a movable object that travels along self-assembled fibres under an irresistible force has yet to be achieved. Here, we describe a purely supramolecular system where a molecular ‘traveller’ moves along a ‘path’ over several microns when irradiated with visible light. Real-time imaging of the motion in the solvated state using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy shows that anionic porphyrin molecules move along the fibres of a bis-imidazolium gel upon irradiation. Slight solvent changes mean movement and restructuring of the fibres giving microtoroids, indicating control of motion by fibre mechanics with solvent composition. The insight provided here may lead to the development of artificial travellers that can perform catalytic and other functions. In biological systems, controlled molecular motion along a particular path is realized by protein motors that travel along microtubule filaments. Now, control of motion with light has been achieved in a synthetic supramolecular system, in which anionic porphyrin molecules move along the fibres of a bis-imidazolium gel upon irradiation.},

Here we report an engineered microbial cell expressing a heterologous biosynthetic pathway, containing both natural enzymes and ArMs, that produces an unnatural product with high diastereoselectivity. We engineered Escherichia coli with a heterologous terpene biosynthetic pathway and an ArM containing an iridium–porphyrin complex that was transported into the cell with a heterologous transport system. We improved the diastereoselectivity and product titre of the unnatural product by evolving the ArM and selecting the appropriate gene induction and cultivation conditions. This work shows that synthetic biology and synthetic chemistry can produce, by combining natural and artificial enzymes in whole cells, molecules that were previously inaccessible to nature. Natural products are produced by living organisms practising nature’s chemical transformations. Now, an unnatural product has been generated by creating hybrid biosynthetic microorganisms.

  abstract     = {Living systems provide a promising approach to chemical synthesis, having been optimized by evolution to convert renewable carbon sources, such as glucose, into an enormous range of small molecules. However, a large number of synthetic structures can still be difficult to obtain solely from cells, such as unsubstituted hydrocarbons. In this work, we demonstrate the use of a dual cellular–heterogeneous catalytic strategy to produce olefins from glucose using a selective hydrolase to generate an activated intermediate that is readily deoxygenated. Using a new family of iterative thiolase enzymes, we genetically engineered a microbial strain that produces 4.3 ± 0.4 g l−1 of fatty acid from glucose with 86% captured as 3-hydroxyoctanoic and 3-hydroxydecanoic acids. This 3-hydroxy substituent serves as a leaving group that enables heterogeneous tandem decarboxylation–dehydration routes to olefinic products on Lewis acidic catalysts without the additional redox input required for enzymatic or chemical deoxygenation of simple fatty acids. A dual cellular-then-heterogeneous catalysis strategy has been used to produce olefins from glucose. 3-Hydroxy acids are made using an engineered microbial host. A hydrolytic step then provides the driving force for fatty acid deoxygenation by simple heterogeneous Lewis acid catalysis.

  abstract     = {Although the multiphase chemistry of SO2 in aerosol particles is of great importance to air quality under polluted haze conditions, a fundamental understanding of the pertinent mechanisms and kinetics is lacking. In particular, there is considerable debate on the importance of NO2 in the oxidation of SO2 in aerosol particles. Here experiments with atmospherically relevant deliquesced particles at buffered pH values of 4–5 show that the effective rate constant for the reaction of NO2 with SO32− ((1.4 ± 0.5) × 1010 M−1 s−1) is more than three orders of magnitude larger than the value in dilute solutions. An interfacial reaction at the surface of aerosol particles probably drives the very fast kinetics. Our results indicate that oxidation of SO2 by NO2 at aerosol surfaces may be an important source of sulfate aerosols under polluted haze conditions. In polluted atmospheres, NO2 oxidation of SO2 in particles is a potentially important reaction leading to sulfate aerosol formation. Now it has been shown that the reaction occurs much faster than predicted by known bulk solution chemistry, implicating an interfacial mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Chiral amines can be made by insertion of a carbene into an N–H bond using two-catalyst systems that combine a transition metal-based carbene-transfer catalyst and a chiral proton-transfer catalyst to enforce stereocontrol. Haem proteins can effect carbene N–H insertion, but asymmetric protonation in an active site replete with proton sources is challenging. Here we describe engineered cytochrome P450 enzymes that catalyse carbene N–H insertion to prepare biologically relevant α-amino lactones with high activity and enantioselectivity (up to 32,100 total turnovers, &amp;gt;99% yield and 98% e.e.). These enzymes serve as dual-function catalysts, inducing carbene transfer and promoting the subsequent proton transfer with excellent stereoselectivity in a single active site. Computational studies uncover the detailed mechanism of this new-to-nature enzymatic reaction and explain how active-site residues accelerate this transformation and provide stereocontrol. A haem protein that serves as a dual-function catalyst capable of inserting a carbene into a N–H bond to form α-amino lactones has been reported. The enzyme catalyses both carbene transfer and the subsequent proton transfer in a single active site. This transformation can proceed at the gram scale with high efficiency and enantioselective control.},

Here we introduce a chemoselective ligation reaction that harnesses the reactivity of Wittig reagents and the unique chemical properties of sulfenic acid, a pivotal post-translational cysteine modification in redox biology. The reaction, which generates a covalent bond between the ylide nucleophilic α-carbon and electrophilic γ-sulfur, is highly selective, rapid and affords robust labelling under a range of biocompatible reaction conditions, which includes in living cells. We highlight the broad utility of this conjugation method to enable site-specific proteome-wide stoichiometry analysis of S-sulfenylation and to visualize redox-dependent changes in mitochondrial cysteine oxidation and redox-triggered triphenylphosphonium generation for the controlled delivery of small molecules to mitochondria. Triphenylphosphonium ylides (Wittig reagents) that selectively react with sulfenic acids—a pivotal post-translational cysteine modification in redox biology—are developed.

We present a versatile approach for building such structures block by block on bilayer sodium chloride (NaCl) films on Cu(111) with the tip of an atomic force microscope, while tracking the structural changes with single-bond resolution. Covalent homo-dimers in cis and trans configurations and homo-/hetero-trimers were selectively synthesized by a sequence of dehalogenation, translational manipulation and intermolecular coupling of halogenated precursors. Further demonstrations of structural build-up include complex bonding motifs, like carbon–iodine–carbon bonds and fused carbon pentagons. This work paves the way for synthesizing elusive covalent nanoarchitectures, studying structural modifications and revealing pathways of intermolecular reactions. Tailoring the size and connectivity of organic nanostructures is challenging but is often key in molecular electronics for tuning the properties of the quantum materials.

  abstract     = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the major carbonaceous component of many planetary atmospheres, which includes the Earth throughout its history. Carbon fixation chemistry—which reduces CO2 to organics, utilizing hydrogen as the stoichiometric reductant—usually requires high pressures and temperatures, and the yields of products of potential use to nascent biology are low. Here we demonstrate an efficient ultraviolet photoredox chemistry between CO2 and sulfite that generates organics and sulfate. The chemistry is initiated by electron photodetachment from sulfite to give sulfite radicals and hydrated electrons, which reduce CO2 to its radical anion. A network of reactions that generates citrate, malate, succinate and tartrate by irradiation of glycolate in the presence of sulfite was also revealed. The simplicity of this carboxysulfitic chemistry and the widespread occurrence and abundance of its feedstocks suggest that it could have readily taken place on the surfaces of rocky planets. The availability of the carboxylate products on early Earth could have driven the development of central carbon metabolism before the advent of biological CO2 fixation. Carbon dioxide is a substantial component of many planetary atmospheres, but reduction of carbon dioxide requires conditions and substrates that are rare on planetary surfaces. Now, the reduction of carbon dioxide to organic species with biological relevance has been photochemically coupled to the oxidation of sulfite, suggesting that prebiotic carbon fixation could take place on the surfaces of rocky planets.},

Valorization of the lignin stream is pivotal for making biorefining sustainable. Monomeric units in lignin are bound via C–O and C–C bonds. The majority of existing methods for the production of valuable compounds from lignin are based on the depolymerization of lignin via cleavage of relatively labile C–O bonds within lignin structure, which leads to yields of only 36–40 wt%. The remaining fraction (60 wt%) is a complex mixture of high-molecular-weight lignin, generally left unvalorized. Here we present a method to produce additional valuable monomers from the high-molecular-weight lignin fraction through oxidative C–C bond cleavage. This oxidation reaction proceeds with a high selectivity to give 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone (DMBQ) from high-molecular-weight lignin in 18 wt% yield, thus increasing the yield of monomers by 32%. This is an important step to make biorefining competitive with petroleum-based refineries. The valorization of lignin is generally implemented through the cleavage of labile C–O bonds to produce aromatic monomers in up to 40 wt% yield. The remaining material consists of lignin dimers and oligomers connected by C–C bonds, but now a method has been developed for the oxidative cleavage of these C–C bonds using oxoammonium salts, to produce benzoquinones.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal (O) ribosome-mediated translation of O-mRNAs enables the incorporation of up to three distinct non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in Escherichia coli (E. coli). However, the general and efficient incorporation of multiple distinct ncAAs by O-ribosomes requires scalable strategies for both creating efficiently and specifically translated O-mRNAs, and the compact expression of multiple O-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (O-aaRS)/O-tRNA pairs. We automate the discovery of O-mRNAs that lead to up to 40 times more protein, and are up to 50-fold more orthogonal, than previous O-mRNAs; protein yields from our O-mRNAs match or exceed those from wild-type mRNAs. These advances enable a 33-fold increase in yield for incorporating three distinct ncAAs. We automate the creation of operons for O-tRNA genes, and develop operons for O-aaRS genes. Combining our advances creates a 68-codon, 24-amino-acid genetic code to efficiently incorporate four distinct ncAAs into a single protein in response to four distinct quadruplet codons. Non-canonical amino acids can be incorporated into proteins through translation of orthogonal mRNAs. Now, automating the design of orthogonal mRNAs—which are more selectively and efficiently translated—in combination with compact orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA expression systems, enables the incorporation of four distinct non-canonical monomers via a 68-codon genetic code.},

  abstract     = {In the past few years, the effect of strain on the optical and electronic properties of MoS2 layers has attracted particular attention as it can improve the performance of optoelectronic and spintronic devices. Although several approaches have been explored, strain is typically externally applied on the two-dimensional material. In this work, we describe the preparation of a reversible ‘self-strainable’ system in which the strain is generated at the molecular level by one component of a MoS2-based composite material. Spin-crossover nanoparticles were covalently grafted onto functionalized layers of semiconducting MoS2 to form a hybrid heterostructure. Their ability to switch between two spin states on applying an external stimulus (light irradiation or temperature change) serves to generate strain over the MoS2 layer. A volume change accompanies this spin crossover, and the created strain induces a substantial and reversible change of the electrical and optical properties of the heterostructure. Spin-crossover nanoparticles have been covalently grafted onto a semiconducting MoS2 layer to form a self-strainable heterostructure. Under light or thermal stimulus, the nanoparticles switch between their high- and low-spin states, in which they have different volumes. This generates a reversible strain over the MoS2 layer and, in turn, alters the electrical and optical properties of the heterostructure.},

  abstract     = {Chiral Brønsted acid-catalysed asymmetric synthesis has received tremendous interest over the past decades, and numerous efficient synthetic methods have been developed based on this approach. However, the use of chiral Brønsted acids in these reactions is mostly limited to the activation of imine and carbonyl moieties, and the direct activation of carbon–carbon triple bonds has so far not been invoked. Here we show that chiral Brønsted acids enable the catalytic asymmetric dearomatization reactions of naphthol-, phenol- and pyrrole-ynamides by the direct activation of alkynes. This method leads to the practical and atom-economic construction of various valuable spirocyclic enones and 2H-pyrroles that bear a chiral quaternary carbon stereocentre in generally good-to-excellent yields with excellent chemo-, regio- and enantioselectivities. The activation mode of chiral Brønsted acid catalysis revealed in this study is expected to be of broad utility in catalytic asymmetric reactions that involve ynamides and the related heteroatom-substituted alkynes. Chiral Brønsted acid catalysis is mostly limited to the activation of imine and carbonyl moieties. Now, by direct activation of alkynes, chiral Brønsted acids have been used to enable the catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of naphthol-, phenol- and pyrrole-ynamides for the construction of various spirocyclic enones and 2H-pyrroles bearing a chiral quaternary carbon stereocentre.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in chemical proteomics have begun to characterize the reactivity and ligandability of lysines on a global scale. Yet, only a limited diversity of aminophilic electrophiles have been evaluated for interactions with the lysine proteome. Here, we report an in-depth profiling of &amp;gt;30 uncharted aminophilic chemotypes that greatly expands the content of ligandable lysines in human proteins. Aminophilic electrophiles showed disparate proteomic reactivities that range from selective interactions with a handful of lysines to, for a set of dicarboxaldehyde fragments, remarkably broad engagement of the covalent small-molecule–lysine interactions captured by the entire library. We used these latter ‘scout’ electrophiles to efficiently map ligandable lysines in primary human immune cells under stimulatory conditions. Finally, we show that aminophilic compounds perturb diverse biochemical functions through site-selective modification of lysines in proteins, including protein–RNA interactions implicated in innate immune responses. These findings support the broad potential of covalent chemistry for targeting functional lysines in the human proteome. A deep chemical proteomic investigation of diverse aminophilic electrophiles has identified ligandable lysines across a wide range of human proteins. The proteins cover different functional and structural classes, and the aminophilic electrophiles include compounds that disrupt protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions.

  abstract     = {Anionic redox is a double-edged sword for Li-ion cathodes because it offers a transformational increase in energy density that is also negated by several detrimental drawbacks to its practical implementation. Among them, voltage hysteresis is the most troublesome because its origin is still unclear and under debate. Herein, we tackle this issue by designing a prototypical Li-rich cation-disordered rock-salt compound Li1.17Ti0.33Fe0.5O2 that shows anionic redox activity and exceptionally large voltage hysteresis while exhibiting a partially reversible Fe migration between octahedral and tetrahedral sites. Through combined in situ and ex situ spectroscopic techniques, we demonstrate the existence of a non-equilibrium (adiabatic) redox pathway enlisting Fe3+/Fe4+ and O redox as opposed to the equilibrium (non-adiabatic) redox pathway involving sole O redox. We further show that the charge transfer from O(2p) lone pair states to Fe(3d) states involving sluggish structural distortion is responsible for voltage hysteresis. This study provides a general understanding of various voltage hysteresis signatures in the large family of Li-rich rock-salt compounds. The use of anionic redox chemistry in high-capacity Li-rich cathodes is being hampered by voltage hysteresis, the origin of which remains obscure. Now it has been shown that sluggish ligand-to-metal charge transfer kinetically traps an intermediate Fe4+ species and is responsible for voltage hysteresis in the prototypical Li-rich cation-disordered rock-salt Li1.17Ti0.33Fe0.5O2.},

Here, we observe a concentration-dependent association between CO2 and TFSI anions in water that reaches maximum strength at 5 mol kg−1 LiTFSI. This TFSI–CO2 complex and its reduction chemistry allow us to decouple the interphasial responsibility of an aqueous electrolyte from its bulk properties, hence making high-voltage aqueous Li-ion batteries practical in dilute salt-in-water electrolytes. The CO2/salt-in-water electrolyte not only inherits the wide electrochemical stability window and non-flammability from water-in-salt electrolytes but also successfully circumvents the numerous disadvantages induced by excessive salt. This work represents a deviation from the water-in-salt pathway that not only benefits the development of practical aqueous batteries, but also highlights how the complex interactions between electrolyte components can be used to manipulate interphasial chemistry. Super-concentrated water-in-salt electrolytes enable high-voltage aqueous batteries, but have considerable drawbacks such as high viscosity, low conductivity and slow kinetics.

N-heterocyclic diazoolefins show a strong ylidic character, with a high charge density at the carbon atom next to the diazo group. Despite the presence of terminal N2 groups, N-heterocyclic diazoolefins display a good thermal stability, which surpasses that observed for most diazoalkanes. N-heterocyclic diazoolefins can bind transition and main group metal complexes without the liberation of dinitrogen, and spectroscopic data show that they are strong electron donors. They can also undergo reactions that involve the N2 group, as evidenced by cycloaddition reactions. Diazoolefins tend to be highly reactive compounds, and thus experimental evidence of these species is currently limited.

  abstract     = {Liquid–liquid phase separation of disordered proteins has emerged as a ubiquitous route to membraneless compartments in living cells, and similar coacervates may have played a role when the first cells formed. However, existing coacervates are typically made of multiple macromolecular components, and designing short peptide analogues capable of self-coacervation has proven difficult. Here we present a short peptide synthon for phase separation, made of only two dipeptide stickers linked via a flexible, hydrophilic spacer. These small-molecule compounds self-coacervate into micrometre-sized liquid droplets at sub-millimolar concentrations, which retain up to 75 wt% water. The design is general and we derive guidelines for the required sticker hydrophobicity and spacer polarity. To illustrate their potential as protocells, we create a disulfide-linked derivative that undergoes reversible compartmentalization controlled by redox chemistry. The resulting coacervates sequester and melt nucleic acids, and act as microreactors that catalyse two different anabolic reactions yielding molecules of increasing complexity. This provides a stepping stone for new coacervate-based protocells made of single peptide species. Liquid–liquid phase separation plays an important role in creating cellular compartments and protocells, but designing small-molecule models remains difficult. A peptide-based synthon for liquid–liquid phase separation consisting of two stickers and a flexible, polar spacer has now been presented.

Typically, they require elevated magnesium concentrations for folding and activity, but their function can be inhibited by high concentrations of monovalent salts. Here we show that geologically plausible high-sodium, low-magnesium solutions derived from leaching basalt (rock and remelted glass) inhibit ribozyme catalysis, but that this activity can be rescued by selective magnesium up-concentration by heat flow across rock fissures. In contrast to up-concentration by dehydration or freezing, this system is so far from equilibrium that it can actively alter the Mg:Na salt ratio to an extent that enables key ribozyme activities, such as self-replication and RNA extension, in otherwise challenging solution conditions. The principle demonstrated here is applicable to a broad range of salt concentrations and compositions, and, as such, highly relevant to various origin-of-life scenarios. The correct function of ribozymes in a prebiotic world would be dependent on the presence of optimal salt compositions and concentrations. Now, local heat fluxes have been shown to create an ideal salt habitat for ribozyme activity based on geologically plausible salt-leaching processes.},

  abstract     = {Activation heat capacity is emerging as a crucial factor in enzyme thermoadaptation, as shown by the non-Arrhenius behaviour of many natural enzymes. However, its physical origin and relationship to the evolution of catalytic activity remain uncertain. Here we show that directed evolution of a computationally designed Kemp eliminase reshapes protein dynamics, which gives rise to an activation heat capacity absent in the original design. These changes buttress transition-state stabilization. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations show that evolution results in the closure of solvent-exposed loops and a better packing of the active site. Remarkably, this gives rise to a correlated dynamical network that involves the transition state and large parts of the protein. This network tightens the transition-state ensemble, which induces a negative activation heat capacity and non-linearity in the activity–temperature dependence. Our results have implications for understanding enzyme evolution and suggest that selectively targeting the conformational dynamics of the transition-state ensemble by design and evolution will expedite the creation of novel enzymes. Computationally designed enzymes can be substantially improved by directed evolution. Now, it has been shown that evolution can introduce a dynamic network that selectively tightens the transition-state ensemble, giving rise to a negative activation heat capacity. Targeting such transition state conformational dynamics may expedite de novo enzyme creation.},

  abstract     = {The development of innovative strategies for the synthesis of N-heterocyclic compounds is an important topic in organic synthesis. Ring expansion methods to form large N-heterocycles often involve the cycloaddition of strained aza rings with π bonds. However, in some cases such strategies suffer from some limitations owing to the difficulties in controlling the regioselectivity and the accessibility of specific π-bond synthons. Here, we report the development of a general ring expansion strategy that involves a formal cross-dimerization between three-membered aza heterocycles and three- and four-membered-ring ketones through synergistic bimetallic catalysis. These formal cross-dimerizations of two different strained rings are efficient and scalable, and provide a straightforward and broadly applicable means of assembling diverse N-heterocycles, such as 3-benzazepinones, dihydropyridinones and uracils, which are versatile units in numerous drugs and biologically active compounds. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that the C–C bond of strained ring ketones is first cleaved by the Pd0 species during the reaction. Using synergistic bimetallic catalysis, a general ring expansion strategy has been developed for cross-dimerization between three-membered aza heterocycles and three- and four-membered-ring ketones. This method provides a straightforward and broadly applicable route for the assembly of 3-benzazepinones, dihydropyridinones and uracils, which are versatile units in numerous drugs and biologically active compounds.},

Here, we show that the elusive benzene diradical dianion can be stabilized through creation of a binucleating ligand that enforces a tightly constrained inverse sandwich structure and direct magnetic exchange coupling. Specifically, we report the compounds [K(18-crown-6)(THF)2]2[M2(BzN6-Mes)] (M = Y, Gd; BzN6-Mes = 1,3,5-tris[2′,6′-(N-mesityl)dimethanamino-4′-tert-butylphenyl]benzene), which feature a trigonal ligand that binds one trivalent metal ion on each face of a central benzene dianion. Antiferromagnetic exchange in the Gd3+ compound preferentially stabilizes the triplet state such that it becomes the molecular ground state. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data and nucleus-independent chemical shift calculations support aromaticity, in agreement with Baird’s rule. Molecules with 4n π electrons should display Baird aromaticity in the triplet state, but isolation of ring systems with this electronic ground state is stymied by structural distortion. Now, a benzene diradical dianion has been stabilized by being held rigid in a binucleating ligand as well as through magnetic exchange; single-crystal X-ray diffraction data and NICS calculations support its ground-state Baird aromaticity.},

  abstract     = {There are more amino acid permutations within a 40-residue sequence than atoms on Earth. This vast chemical search space hinders the use of human learning to design functional polymers. Here we show how machine learning enables the de novo design of abiotic nuclear-targeting miniproteins to traffic antisense oligomers to the nucleus of cells. We combined high-throughput experimentation with a directed evolution-inspired deep-learning approach in which the molecular structures of natural and unnatural residues are represented as topological fingerprints. The model is able to predict activities beyond the training dataset, and simultaneously deciphers and visualizes sequence–activity predictions. The predicted miniproteins, termed ‘Mach’, reach an average mass of 10 kDa, are more effective than any previously known variant in cells and can also deliver proteins into the cytosol. The Mach miniproteins are non-toxic and efficiently deliver antisense cargo in mice. These results demonstrate that deep learning can decipher design principles to generate highly active biomolecules that are unlikely to be discovered by empirical approaches. Machine learning has now been shown to enable the de novo design of abiotic nuclear-targeting miniproteins. To achieve this, high-throughput experimentation was combined with a directed evolution-inspired deep-learning approach in which the molecular structures of natural and unnatural residues are represented as topological fingerprints.

However, its application in the site- and enantioselective functionalization of inactive aryl C–H bonds remains in its infancy. Here, we present an organocatalyst-controlled para-selective arene C–H functionalization strategy that addresses this issue, which remains an enduring challenge in arene functionalization chemistry. By emulating enzyme catalysis, the chiral phosphoric acid catalyst offers an ideal chiral environment for stereoinduction, and the projecting substituents give control of chemo- and site-selectivity. Various types of nucleophile are compatible with this method, affording more than 100 para-selective adducts with stereodefined carbon centres or axes in viable molecular contexts. This protocol is expected to provide a general strategy for para-selective functionalization of arene C–H bonds in a controlled manner. Although organocatalysis has emerged as a powerful catalysis platform, its application for the selective transformation of inactive arenes remains challenging. Now, an organocatalyst-controlled site-selective C–H functionalization of arenes has been developed, with wide substrate generality and applicability, offering a general strategy for arene transformation.},

When the number of atoms involved increases, the number of pathways, transition states and product channels also increases and rapidly presents a challenge to experiment and theory. Here we disentangle the dynamics of the competition between bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) and base-induced elimination (E2) in the polyatomic reaction F− + CH3CH2Cl. We find quantitative agreement for the energy- and angle-differential reactive scattering cross-sections between ion-imaging experiments and quasi-classical trajectory simulations on a 21-dimensional potential energy hypersurface. The anti-E2 pathway is most important, but the SN2 pathway becomes more relevant as the collision energy is increased. In both cases the reaction is dominated by direct dynamics. Our study presents atomic-level dynamics of a major benchmark reaction in physical organic chemistry, thereby pushing the number of atoms for detailed reaction dynamics studies to a size that allows applications in many areas of complex chemical networks and environments. As the number of atoms involved in a reaction increases, so do the experimental and theoretical challenges faced when studying their dynamics. Now, using ion-imaging experiments and quasi-classical trajectory simulations, the dynamics of the polyatomic reaction F– + CH3CH2Cl have been studied and the competition between bimolecular nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination has been disentangled.},

  abstract     = {The synthesis of weak chemical bonds at or near thermodynamic potential is a fundamental challenge in chemistry, with applications ranging from catalysis to biology to energy science. Proton-coupled electron transfer using molecular hydrogen is an attractive strategy for synthesizing weak element–hydrogen bonds, but the intrinsic thermodynamics presents a challenge for reactivity. Here we describe the direct photocatalytic synthesis of extremely weak element–hydrogen bonds of metal amido and metal imido complexes, as well as organic compounds with bond dissociation free energies as low as 31 kcal mol−1. Key to this approach is the bifunctional behaviour of the chromophoric iridium hydride photocatalyst. Activation of molecular hydrogen occurs in the ground state and the resulting iridium hydride harvests visible light to enable spontaneous formation of weak chemical bonds near thermodynamic potential with no by-products. Photophysical and mechanistic studies corroborate radical-based reaction pathways and highlight the uniqueness of this photodriven approach in promoting new catalytic chemistry. The formation of weak chemical bonds at or near thermodynamic potential is a challenge in chemical synthesis and catalysis. A bifunctional iridium hydride catalyst has now been discovered that absorbs visible light and promotes proton-coupled electron transfer to a range of substrates—creating element–hydrogen bonds—using dihydrogen as the terminal reductant.},

While snapshots of the ‘up’ and ‘down’ states have been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomagraphy, details of the RBD-opening transition evade experimental characterization. Here over 130 µs of weighted ensemble simulations of the fully glycosylated spike ectodomain allow us to characterize more than 300 continuous, kinetically unbiased RBD-opening pathways. Together with ManifoldEM analysis of cryo-electron microscopy data and biolayer interferometry experiments, we reveal a gating role for the N-glycan at position N343, which facilitates RBD opening. Residues D405, R408 and D427 also participate. The atomic-level characterization of the glycosylated spike activation mechanism provided herein represents a landmark study for ensemble pathway simulations and offers a foundation for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and infection. The opening mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been studied by integrating computational and experimental data.

  abstract     = {Precious metal complexes with the d6 valence electron configuration often exhibit luminescent metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states, which form the basis for many applications in lighting, sensing, solar cells and synthetic photochemistry. Iron(ii) has received much attention as a possible Earth-abundant alternative, but to date no iron(ii) complex has been reported to show MLCT emission upon continuous-wave excitation. Manganese(i) has the same electron configuration as that of iron(ii), but until now has typically been overlooked in the search for cheap MLCT luminophores. Here we report that isocyanide chelate ligands give access to air-stable manganese(i) complexes that exhibit MLCT luminescence in solution at room temperature. These compounds were successfully used as photosensitizers for energy- and electron-transfer reactions and were shown to promote the photoisomerization of trans-stilbene. The observable electron transfer photoreactivity occurred from the emissive MLCT state, whereas the triplet energy transfer photoreactivity originated from a ligand-centred 3π–π* state. Manganese(i) is isoelectronic to iron(ii) but has typically been overlooked as a cheap Earth-abundant metal for the development of 3d6 metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) emitters and photosensitizers. Now, using chelating isocyanide ligands, air-stable manganese(i) complexes have been obtained that exhibit MLCT luminescence, as well as energy- and electron-transfer photoreactivity.},

Taking advantage of strain-release strategies, prior synthetic studies have featured the synthesis of bridgehead-substituted (C1, C3) BCPs from [1.1.1]propellane. Here, we describe an approach to access multisubstituted BCPs via intramolecular cyclization. In addition to C1,C3-disubstituted BCPs, this method also enables the construction of underexplored multisubstituted (C1, C2 and C3) BCPs from readily accessible cyclobutanones. The broad generality of this method has also been examined through the synthesis of a variety of other caged bicyclic molecules, ranging from [2.1.1] to [3.2.1] scaffolds. The modularity afforded by the pendant bridgehead boron pinacol esters generated during the cyclization reaction has been demonstrated through several downstream functionalizations, highlighting the ability of this approach to enable the programmed and divergent synthesis of multisubstituted bicyclic hydrocarbons.

The ability to mediate the assembly of such charged nanoparticles using structurally simple small molecules would greatly facilitate the fabrication of nanostructured materials and harnessing their applications in catalysis, sensing and photonics. Here we show that small molecules with as few as three electric charges can effectively induce attractive interactions between oppositely charged nanoparticles in water. These interactions can guide the assembly of charged nanoparticles into colloidal crystals of a quality previously only thought to result from their co-crystallization with oppositely charged nanoparticles of a similar size. Transient nanoparticle assemblies can be generated using positively charged nanoparticles and multiply charged anions that are enzymatically hydrolysed into mono- and/or dianions. Our findings demonstrate an approach for the facile fabrication, manipulation and further investigation of static and dynamic nanostructured materials in aqueous environments. Coulombic interactions can be used to assemble charged nanoparticles into higher-order structures, but this process typically requires similarly sized oppositely charged partners.

Here we report a microporous hydrogen-bonded organic framework that takes up ethylene with very good selectivity over ethane through a gating mechanism. The material consists of tetracyano-bicarbazole building blocks held together through intermolecular CN···H–C hydrogen bonding interactions, and forms as a threefold-interpenetrated framework with pores of suitable size for the selective capture of ethylene. The hydrogen-bonded organic framework exhibits a gating mechanism in which the threshold pressure required for guest uptake varies with the temperature. Ethylene/ethane separation is validated by breakthrough experiments with high purity of ethylene (99.1%) at 333 K. Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks are usually not robust, yet this material was stable under harsh conditions, including exposure to strong acidity, basicity and a variety of highly polar solvents. Porous materials are promising candidates for the cost- and energy-efficient separation of ethylene and ethane from gas mixtures: an important but challenging industrial process. Now, a hydrogen-bonded organic framework has been reported that is stable under harsh conditions and can take up ethylene at practical temperatures—with very high selectivity over ethane—through a gating mechanism.},

However, the development of adaptive catalytic systems, that is, with reversibly adjustable reactivity, able to cope with the intermittence of renewable resources remains a challenge. Here, we report the preparation of a catalytic system designed to respond adaptively to feed gas composition in hydrogenation reactions. Ruthenium nanoparticles immobilized on amine-functionalized polymer-grafted silica act as active and stable catalysts for the hydrogenation of biomass-derived furfural acetone and related substrates. Hydrogenation of the carbonyl group is selectively switched on or off if pure H2 or a H2/CO2 mixture is used, respectively. The formation of alkylammonium formate species by the catalytic reaction of CO2 and H2 at the amine-functionalized support has been identified as the most likely molecular trigger for the selectivity switch. As this reaction is fully reversible, the catalyst performance responds almost in real time to the feed gas composition. A multifunctional catalytic system composed of ruthenium nanoparticles immobilized on a silica surface decorated with an amine-functionalized polymer is used for the hydrogenation of biomass-derived furfural acetone and related substrates. The presence or absence of CO2 in the gas feed alters the selectivity of the hydrogenation—producing either a ketone or a saturated alcohol, respectively—in a fully reversible manner.},

Here we investigate the non-adiabatic quenching of electronically excited OH(A2Σ+) molecules by H2 molecules using full-dimensional quantum dynamics calculations for zero total nuclear angular momentum using a high-quality diabatic-potential-energy matrix. Good agreement with experimental observations is found for the OH(X2Π) ro-vibrational distribution, and the non-adiabatic dynamics are shown to be controlled by stereodynamics, namely the relative orientation of the two reactants. The uncovering of a major (in)elastic channel, neglected in a previous analysis but confirmed by a recent experiment, resolves a long-standing experiment–theory disagreement concerning the branching ratio of the two electronic quenching channels. The breakdown of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation is omnipresent in chemistry and detailed understanding of non-adiabatic dynamics is still incomplete.

While genetic engineering can incorporate non-natural amino acids into recombinant proteins, regioselective chemical modification of wild-type proteins remains a challenge. Herein, we use photoredox catalysis to develop a site-selective tyrosine bioconjugation pathway that incorporates bioorthogonal formyl groups, which subsequently allows for the synthesis of structurally defined fluorescent conjugates from native proteins. A water-soluble photocatalyst, lumiflavin, has been shown to induce oxidative coupling between a previously unreported phenoxazine dialdehyde tag and a single tyrosine site, even in the presence of multiple tyrosyl side chains, through the formation of a covalent C–N bond. A variety of native proteins, including those with multiple tyrosines, can successfully undergo both tyrosine-specific and single-site-selective labelling. This technology directly introduces aldehyde moieties onto native proteins, enabling rapid product diversification using an array of well-established bioorthogonal functionalization protocols including the alkyne–azide click reaction. Regioselective chemical modification of wild-type proteins remains challenging. Now, by harnessing the varied SOMOphilicity of native tyrosine residues through photoredox catalysis, a site-selective bioconjugation method has been developed. This technology directly incorporates bioorthogonal formyl groups in one step, forming structurally defined fluorescent conjugates that can be rapidly diversified to biorelevant products.},

These steps increase assay time, cost and complexity, making it difficult to realize a truly rapid point-of-care test. Here we report the development of an electrical assay that uses electroactive RNA-cleaving DNAzymes (e-RCDs) to identify specific bacterial targets and subsequently release a DNA barcode for transducing a signal onto an electrical chip. Integrating e-RCDs into a two-channel electrical chip with nanostructured electrodes provides the analytical sensitivity and specificity needed for clinical analysis. The e-RCD assay is capable of detecting 10 CFU (equivalent to 1,000 CFU ml–1) of Escherichia coli selectively from a panel containing multiple non-specific bacterial species. Clinical evaluation of this assay using 41 patient urine samples demonstrated a diagnostic sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 78% at an analysis time of less than one hour compared with the several hours needed for currently used culture-based methods. Methods to detect and identify bacteria typically rely on enrichment steps such as bacterial culture and nucleic acid amplification. Now, an assay for detecting bacteria based on a two-channel electrical chip that combines electroactive DNAzymes with an electrochemical readout, has been developed. This assay enables reagentless and culture-free detection of bacteria in clinical samples.},

  abstract     = {Transition-metal single-atom catalysts present extraordinary activity per metal atomic site, but suffer from low metal-atom densities (typically less than 5 wt% or 1 at.%), which limits their overall catalytic performance. Here we report a general method for the synthesis of single-atom catalysts with high transition-metal-atom loadings of up to 40 wt% or 3.8 at.%, representing several-fold improvements compared to benchmarks in the literature. Graphene quantum dots, later interweaved into a carbon matrix, were used as a support, providing numerous anchoring sites and thus facilitating the generation of high densities of transition-metal atoms with sufficient spacing between the metal atoms to avoid aggregation. A significant increase in activity in electrochemical CO2 reduction (used as a representative reaction) was demonstrated on a Ni single-atom catalyst with increased Ni loading. Transition-metal single-atom catalysts display excellent activity per metal atom site, but suffer from low metal atom densities (typically less than 5 wt% or 1 at.%), which limits their overall catalytic performance. Now, the use of a graphene-quantum-dot primary support, later interweaved into a carbon matrix, has enabled the synthesis of single-atom catalysts with high transition-metal atom loadings of up to 40 wt% or 3.84 at.%.},

  abstract     = {Stereodefined four-membered rings are common motifs in bioactive molecules and versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. However, the synthesis of complex, chiral cyclobutanes is a largely unsolved problem and there is a need for general and modular synthetic methods. Here we report a series of asymmetric cross-coupling reactions between cyclobutenes and arylboronic acids which are initiated by Rh-catalysed asymmetric carbometallation. After the initial carborhodation, Rh–cyclobutyl intermediates undergo chain-walking or C–H insertion so that overall a variety of additions such as reductive Heck reactions, 1,5-addition and homoallylic substitution are observed. The synthetic applicability of these highly stereoselective transformations is demonstrated in the concise syntheses of the drug candidates Belaperidone and PF-04862853. We anticipate this approach will be widely adopted by synthetic and medicinal chemists. While the carbometallation approach reported here is exemplified with Rh and arylboronic acids, it is likely to be applicable to other metals and nucleophiles. Complex substituted cyclobutanes are common motifs in bioactive molecules but are difficult to make enantioselectively. Now, it has been shown that cross-coupling reactions between cyclobutenes and arylboronic acids—initiated by Rh-catalysed asymmetric carbometallation—can provide access to a diverse range of chiral cyclobutanes.},

  abstract     = {Artificial cell-like communities participate in diverse modes of chemical interaction but exhibit minimal interfacing with their local environment. Here we develop an interactive microsystem based on the immobilization of a population of enzyme-active semipermeable proteinosomes within a helical hydrogel filament to implement signal-induced movement. We attach large single-polynucleotide/peptide microcapsules at one or both ends of the helical protocell filament to produce free-standing soft microactuators that sense and process chemical signals to perform mechanical work. Different modes of translocation are achieved by synergistic or antagonistic enzyme reactions located within the helical connector or inside the attached microcapsule loads. Mounting the microactuators on a ratchet-like surface produces a directional push–pull movement. Our methodology opens up a route to protocell-based chemical systems capable of utilizing mechanical work and provides a step towards the engineering of soft microscale objects with increased levels of operational autonomy. Although many systems that involve protocell–protocell interactions have been developed, there are fewer reports of protocell–environment interactive systems. Now, helical hydrogel filaments—in which enzyme-containing proteinosomes are immobilized—have been shown to contract and expand as the local chemical environment changes. Enzyme processing regulates the chemomechanical responses to generate different modes of actuation in the soft microstructures.},

  abstract     = {Sulfur(vi) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) is a category of click chemistry that enables covalent linking of modular units through sulfur(vi) connective hubs. The efficiency of SuFEx and the stability of the resulting bonds have led to polymer chemistry applications. Now, we report the SuFEx click chemistry synthesis of several structurally diverse SOF4-derived copolymers based on the polymerization of bis(iminosulfur oxydifluorides) and bis(aryl silyl ethers). This polymer class presents two key characteristics. First, the [–N=S(=O)F–O–] polymer backbone linkages are themselves SuFExable and undergo precise SuFEx-based post-modification with phenols or amines to yield branched functional polymers. Second, studies of individual polymer chains of several of these new materials indicate helical polymer structures. The robust nature of SuFEx click chemistry offers the potential for post-polymerization modification, enabling the synthesis of materials with control over composition and conformation. Sulfur(vi) fluoride exchange (SuFEx)—a type of click chemistry that generates SVI-centred covalent linkages—has previously been used for polymer synthesis. Now, modular SuFEx polymerization using SOF4 has been used to generate helical polymers. Unlike previous examples of SuFEx polymerization, the backbone retains SVI–F motifs and therefore is able to undergo further SuFEx click reactions, enabling facile and efficient post-polymerization modification.},

  abstract     = {Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), such as rotaxanes and catenanes, have captured the attention of chemists both from a synthetic perspective and because of their role as simple prototypes of molecular machines. Although examples exist in nature, most synthetic MIMs are made from artificial building blocks and assembled in organic solvents. The synthesis of MIMs from natural biomolecules remains highly challenging. Here, we report on a synthesis strategy for interlocked molecules solely made from peptides, that is, mechanically interlocked peptides (MIPs). Fully peptidic, cysteine-decorated building blocks were self-assembled in water to generate disulfide-bonded dynamic combinatorial libraries consisting of multiple different rotaxanes, catenanes and daisy chains as well as more exotic structures. Detailed NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry characterization of a [2]catenane comprising two peptide macrocycles revealed that this structure has rich conformational dynamics reminiscent of protein folding. Thus, MIPs can serve as a bridge between fully synthetic MIMs and those found in nature. The construction of mechanically interlocked molecules solely made from peptides is a great synthetic challenge because of a lack of effective templating strategies. Now it has been shown that by combining self-assembly and dynamic covalent chemistry, catenanes, daisy chains and other interlocked peptides can be synthesized from genetically engineered building blocks.},

  abstract     = {Biochemical networks interconnect, grow and evolve to express new properties as different chemical pathways are selected during a continuous cycle of energy consumption and transformation. In contrast, synthetic systems that push away from equilibrium usually return to the same self-assembled state, often generating waste that limits system recyclability and prevents the formation of adaptable networks. Here we show that annealing by slow proton dissipation selects for otherwise inaccessible morphologies of fibres built from DNA and cyanuric acid. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, we observe that proton dissipation influences the growth mechanism of supramolecular polymerization, healing gaps within fibres and converting highly branched, interwoven networks into nanocable superstructures. Just as the growth kinetics of natural fibres determine their structural attributes to modulate function, our system of photoacid-enabled depolymerization and repolymerization selects for healed materials to yield organized, robust fibres. Our method provides a chemical route for error-checking, distinct from thermal annealing, that improves the morphologies and properties of supramolecular materials using out-of-equilibrium systems. Nature uses out-of-equilibrium systems to control hierarchical assembly. Now, a dissipative chemical system has been shown to slowly release monomer DNA strands from a high-energy reservoir, regulating self-assembly by switching the mechanism of supramolecular polymerization at the single-molecule level. This process heals fibre defects, converting branched, heterogeneous networks into nanocable superstructures.},

Here we report a ruthenium-catalysed reversible C–C single-bond metathesis reaction that allows redox- and pH-neutral biaryl synthesis. Assisted by directing groups, unstrained homo-biaryl compounds undergo aryl exchanges to generate cross-biaryl products, catalysed by a well-defined air-stable ruthenium(II) complex. Functional groups reactive under typical cross-coupling reactions, such as halogen, silyl and boronate moieties, are compatible under the metathesis conditions. Mechanistic studies disclose an intriguing ‘olefin-metathesis-like’ pathway that involves an unexpected heptacoordinated, 18-electron closed-shell intermediate. The distinct reaction mode discovered here is expected to inspire the development of more general C–C single-bond metathesis and orthogonal cross-coupling reactions. Metathesis reactions involving carbon–carbon double bonds have been well established, but direct metathesis of carbon–carbon single bonds is extremely rare. Now, a ruthenium-catalysed carbon–carbon single-bond metathesis reaction has been developed with unstrained homo-biaryl substrates.

  abstract     = {N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are promising modifiers and anchors for surface functionalization and offer some advantages over thiol-based systems. Because of their strong binding affinity and high electron donation, NHCs can dramatically change the properties of the surfaces to which they are bonded. Highly ordered NHC monolayers have so far been limited to metal surfaces. Silicon, however, remains the element of choice in semiconductor devices and its modification is therefore of utmost importance for electronic industries. Here, a comprehensive study on the adsorption of NHCs on silicon is presented. We find covalently bound NHC molecules in an upright adsorption geometry and demonstrate the formation of highly ordered monolayers exhibiting good thermal stability and strong work function reductions. The structure and ordering of the monolayers is controlled by the substrate geometry and reactivity and in particular by the NHC side groups. These findings pave the way towards a tailor-made organic functionalization of silicon surfaces and, thanks to the high modularity of NHCs, new electronic and optoelectronic applications. Although monolayers of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) readily form on metals, surface reactivity usually hinders their self-assembly on semiconductors. Now, it has been shown that thermally stable, well-ordered monolayers of NHCs can be formed on silicon surfaces. A large reduction in work function is observed and steric effects enable sufficient diffusivity of the NHCs.},

  abstract     = {Chemotherapy is a powerful tool in the armoury against cancer, but it is fraught with problems due to its global systemic toxicity. Here we report the proof of concept of a chemistry-based strategy, whereby gamma/X-ray irradiation mediates the activation of a cancer prodrug, thereby enabling simultaneous chemo-radiotherapy with radiotherapy locally activating a prodrug. In an initial demonstration, we show the activation of a fluorescent probe using this approach. Expanding on this, we show how sulfonyl azide- and phenyl azide-caged prodrugs of pazopanib and doxorubicin can be liberated using clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation. This strategy is different to conventional chemo-radiotherapy radiation, where chemo-sensitization of the cancer takes place so that subsequent radiotherapy is more effective. This approach could enable site-directed chemotherapy, rather than systemic chemotherapy, with ‘real time’ drug decaging at the tumour site. As such, it opens up a new era in targeted and directed chemotherapy. Prodrugs offer one route to treat cancer, but they require activation once they have been delivered to the tumour. Now, a simultaneous chemo-radiotherapy strategy has been demonstrated in mice that uses gamma or X-ray irradiation to locally activate an anticancer prodrug.},

Molecular catalysts have served as models to understand its mechanism, in particular the O–O bond-forming reaction, which is still not fully understood. Here we report a Ru(iv) side-on peroxo complex that serves as a ‘missing link’ for the species that form after the rate-determining O–O bond-forming step. The Ru(iv) side-on peroxo complex (η2-1–OO) is generated from the isolated Ru(iv) oxo complex (1=O) in the presence of an excess of oxidant. The oxidation (iv) and spin state (singlet) of η2-1–OO were determined by a combination of experimental and theoretical studies. 18O- and 2H-labelling studies evidence the direct evolution of O2 through the nucleophilic attack of a H2O molecule on the highly electrophilic metal–oxo species via the formation of η2-1–OO. These studies demonstrate water nucleophilic attack as a viable mechanism for O–O bond formation, as previously proposed based on indirect evidence. Obtaining mechanistic data after the rate-determining step of a chemical reaction is difficult but essential for its understanding. Now, a Ru(iv) side-on peroxo complex has been isolated following the rate-determining step of the water oxidation reaction (O–O bond formation) carried out using a Ru-based molecular catalyst.},

  abstract     = {Here we demonstrate the synthesis of cyclic polyacetylene (c-PA), or [∞]annulene, via homogeneous tungsten-catalysed polymerization of acetylene. Unique to the cyclic structure and evidence for its topology, the c-PA contains &amp;gt;99% trans double bonds, even when synthesized at −94 °C. High activity with low catalyst loadings allows for the synthesis of temporarily soluble c-PA, thus opening the opportunity to derivatize the polymer in solution. Absolute evidence for the cyclic topology comes from atomic force microscopy images of bottlebrush derivatives generated from soluble c-PA. Now available in its cyclic form, initial characterization studies are presented to elucidate the topological differences compared with traditionally synthesized linear polyacetylene. One advantage to the synthesis of c-PA is the direct synthesis of the trans–transoid isomer. Low defect concentrations, low soliton concentration, and relatively high conjugation lengths are characteristics of c-PA. Efficient catalysis permits the rapid synthesis of lustrous flexible thin films of c-PA, and when doped with I2, they are highly conductive (398 (±76) Ω−1 cm−1). Lustrous flexible thin films of semiconducting cyclic polyacetylene (c-PA) have been synthesized and characterized. Rapid and efficient tungsten-catalysed acetylene polymerization conditions produce temporarily soluble c-PA, enabling the in situ derivatization of this typically insoluble polymer. Compelling evidence for the cyclic topology—and its influence on the physical properties of the polymer—are presented.},

  abstract     = {Homochiral membrane bilayers organize biological functions in all domains of life. The membrane’s permeability—its key property—correlates with a molecule’s lipophilicity, but the role of the membrane’s rich and uniform stereochemistry as a permeability determinant is largely ignored in empirical and computational measurements. Here, we describe a new approach to measuring permeation using continuously generated microfluidic droplet interface bilayers (DIBs, generated at a rate of 480 per minute) and benchmark this system by monitoring fluorescent dye DIB permeation over time. Enantioselective permeation of alkyne-labelled amino acids (Ala, Val, Phe, Pro) and dipeptides through a chiral phospholipid bilayer was demonstrated using DIB transport measurements; the biological l enantiomers permeated faster than the d enantiomers (from 1.2-fold to 6-fold for Ala to Pro). Enantioselective permeation both poses a potentially unanticipated criterion for drug design and offers a kinetic mechanism for the abiotic emergence of homochirality via chiral transfer between sugars, amino acids and lipids. Droplet interface bilayer measurements have now shown that membranes formed from chiral phospholipid bilayers are enantioselectively permeable to chiral amino acids. The results show that membrane stereochemistry is necessary and sufficient to drive such enantioselective transport, presenting a new potential route to homochirality. These findings could also have implications for pharmacokinetics and drug design.},

Quenching then results in the formation of melt-quenched MOF glasses that retain the three-dimensional coordination bonding of the crystalline phase. These hybrid glasses have intriguing properties and could find practical applications, yet the melt-quench phenomenon has so far remained limited to a few MOF structures. Here we turn to hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites—which occupy a prominent position within materials chemistry owing to their functional properties such as ion transport, photoconductivity, ferroelectricity and multiferroicity—and show that a series of dicyanamide-based hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites undergo melting. Our combined experimental–computational approach demonstrates that, on quenching, they form glasses that largely retain their solid-state inorganic–organic connectivity. The resulting materials show very low thermal conductivities (~0.2 W m−1 K−1), moderate electrical conductivities (10−3–10−5 S m−1) and polymer-like thermomechanical properties. A series of dicyanamide-based hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite structures has been shown to melt at temperatures below 300 °C. On melt-quenching, they form glasses that possess coordination bonding and show very low thermal conductivities and moderate electrical conductivities as well as polymer-like thermomechanical properties.},

Chemists have developed theories to predict oxidation states based on electron-counting rules, but these can fail to describe oxidation states in extended crystalline systems such as metal–organic frameworks. Here we propose the use of a machine-learning model, trained on assignments by chemists encoded in the chemical names in the Cambridge Structural Database, to automatically assign oxidation states to the metal ions in metal–organic frameworks. In our approach, only the immediate local environment around a metal centre is considered. We show that the strategy is robust to experimental uncertainties such as incorrect protonation, unbound solvents or changes in bond length. This method gives good accuracy and we show that it can be used to detect incorrect assignments in the Cambridge Structural Database, illustrating how collective knowledge can be captured by machine learning and converted into a useful tool. Oxidation states help chemists to understand the bonding, properties and reactivity of compounds, but they can be difficult to determine for metal ions in extended crystalline materials. Now, oxidation states manually assigned to metal–organic frameworks have been harvested from the Cambridge Structural Database and used to build a machine-learning model that predicts oxidation states in metal–organic frameworks with good accuracy.},

Here we used luminescence induced by scanning tunnelling microscopy to probe model multichromophoric structures assembled on a surface. Mimicking strategies developed by photosynthetic systems, individual molecules were used as ancillary, passive or blocking elements to promote and direct resonant energy transfer between distant donor and acceptor units. As it relies on organic chromophores as the elementary components, this approach constitutes a powerful model to address fundamental physical processes at play in natural light-harvesting complexes. Energy funnelling within multichromophoric assemblies is key to the conversion of solar energy by plants. Now, energy transport between phthalocyanine-based chromophores has been monitored at the submolecular level using scanning tunnelling microscopy, focusing on the role of ancillary, passive and blocking chromophores in promoting and directing energy transfer between distant donor and acceptor units.},

The bidentate ligand that chelates molybdenum in Moco is the pyranopterin dithiolene (molybdopterin, MPT). However, neither the mechanism of molybdate insertion into MPT nor the structure of Moco prior to its insertion into pyranopterin molybdenum enzymes is known. Here, we report this final maturation step, where adenylated MPT (MPT–AMP) and molybdate are the substrates. X-ray crystallography of the Arabidopsis thaliana Mo-insertase variant Cnx1E S269D D274S identified adenylated Moco (Moco–AMP) as an unexpected intermediate in this reaction sequence. X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the first coordination sphere geometry of Moco trapped in the Cnx1E active site. We have used this structural information to deduce a mechanism for molybdate insertion into MPT–AMP. Given their high degree of structural and sequence similarity, we suggest that this mechanism is employed by all eukaryotic Mo-insertases. The molybdenum cofactor (Moco) is found in the active site of numerous enzymes, but the mechanism of molybdate insertion is not clear. Now, the mechanism of the final maturation step, in which adenylated molybdopterin and molybdate are the substrates, has been revealed.

  abstract     = {The translation of messenger RNA sequences into polypeptide sequences according to the genetic code is central to life. How this process, which relies on the ribosomal machinery, arose from much simpler precursors is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that single nucleotides charged with an amino acid couple with amino acids linked to the 5′-terminus of an RNA primer in reactions directed by the nucleotides of an RNA template in dilute aqueous solution at 0 °C. When a mixture of U-Val, A-Gly and G-Leu competed for coupling to Gly-RNA, base pairing dictated which dipeptide sequence formed preferentially. The resulting doubly anchored dipeptides can retain their link to the primer for further extension or can be fully released under mild acidic conditions. These results show that a single-nucleotide-based form of translation exists that requires no more than oligoribonucleotides and anchored amino acids. Elucidating the origin of translation—the process that produces a specific peptide from an RNA sequence—is one of the most difficult challenges in prebiotic chemistry and evolutionary biology. Now, it has been shown that aminoacylated nucleotides couple to amino-acid-bearing oligoribonucleotides, directed by an RNA template, forming specific di- and tripeptides in the absence of ribosomal machinery.},

Despite some progress, few depolymerizable polymers exhibit the desirable thermal stability and strong mechanical properties of traditional polymers. Here we report a series of chemically recyclable polymers that show excellent thermal stability (decomposition temperature &amp;gt;370 °C) and tunable mechanical properties. The polymers are formed through ring-opening metathesis polymerization of cyclooctene with a trans-cyclobutane installed at the 5 and 6 positions. The additional ring converts the non-depolymerizable polycyclooctene into a depolymerizable polymer by reducing the ring strain energy in the monomer (from 8.2 kcal mol–1 in unsubstituted cyclooctene to 4.9 kcal mol–1 in the fused ring). The fused-ring monomer enables a broad scope of functionalities to be incorporated, providing access to chemically recyclable elastomers and plastics that show promise as next-generation sustainable materials. Depolymerizable polymers can potentially address challenges in polymer sustainability, but most existing systems lack the useful thermomechanical properties of traditional ones. Now, it has been shown that depolymerizable polymers based on olefin metathesis show good thermal stability as well as versatile mechanical properties and that the monomers used to make them can be prepared from abundant materials.},

  abstract     = {The reaction of low-energy electrons with neutral molecules to form anions plays an important role in chemistry, being involved in, for example, various biological and astrochemical processes. However, key aspects of electron–molecule interactions, such as the effect of incremental solvation on the initially excited electronic resonances, remain poorly understood. Here two-dimensional photoelectron spectroscopy of anionic anthracene and nitrogen-substituted derivatives—solvated by up to five water molecules—reveals that for an incoming electron, resonances red-shift with increasing hydration; but for the anion, the excitation energies of the resonances remain essentially the same. These complementary points of view show that the observed onset of enhanced anion formation for a specific cluster size is mediated by a bound excited state of the anion. Our findings suggest that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may be more efficient at electron capture than previously predicted with important consequences for the ionization fraction in dense molecular clouds. Although electron-driven chemistry is ubiquitous, how molecular electron capture is altered by solvent remains poorly understood. Now, using anion two-dimensional photoelectron spectroscopy, it is shown that the presence of water molecules can enhance electron capture and that considering the mechanism from the perspective of the anion offers further understanding.},

  abstract     = {The use of solid supports and ultra-high vacuum conditions for the synthesis of two-dimensional polymers is attractive, as it can enable thorough characterization, often with submolecular resolution, and prevent contamination. However, most on-surface polymerizations are thermally activated, which often leads to high defect densities and relatively small domain sizes. Here, we have obtained a porous two-dimensional polymer that is ordered on the mesoscale by the two-staged topochemical photopolymerization of fluorinated anthracene triptycene (fantrip) monomers on alkane-passivated graphite surfaces under ultra-high vacuum. First, the fantrip monomers self-assemble into highly ordered monolayer structures, where all anthracene moieties adopt a suitable arrangement for photopolymerization. Irradiation with violet light then induces complete covalent crosslinking by [4+4] photocycloaddition to form a two-dimensional polymer, while fully preserving the long-range order of the self-assembled structure. The extent of the polymerization is confirmed by local infrared spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy characterization, in agreement with density functional theory calculations, which also gives mechanistic insights. On-surface, ultra-high vacuum conditions enable two-dimensional polymerizations to be precisely studied—often with submolecular resolution—but these syntheses are typically thermally activated, which can lead to high defect densities and relatively small domain sizes. Now, a self-assembled monolayer of a three-bladed fantrip monomer on alkane-passivated graphite has been covalently crosslinked into a mesoscale-ordered two-dimensional polymer by [4+4] photocycloaddition.},

The former activates aromatic carboxylic acids as acid chlorides in the presence of secondary aromatic amines and the latter even in the presence of primary aromatic amines. These reagents allow p-aminobenzoic acid derivatives to form solution-stable activated monomers that polymerize in a living fashion in the presence of amine initiators. Other aryl amino acids and even dimers of aryl amino acids can be polymerized in a living fashion when slowly added to the phosphonium salt in the presence of an amine initiator. Diblock copolymers and triblock terpolymers of aryl amino acids can be prepared even in the presence of electrophilic functional groups. Two phosphine-based reagents can be used to prepare aromatic acid chlorides in the presence of either primary or secondary amines. This approach enables the living polycondensation of aromatic amino acids under mild conditions and can be used to make block copolymers as well as helical aromatic amide foldamers.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic bistable materials that feature magnetic hysteresis are comparable to elementary binary units and promising for application in switches and memory devices. In this work, we report a material that consists of parallel cyanide-bridged [Feii–Wv] coordination chains linked together through rigid bis(imidazolyl)–benzene ligands and displays multiple magnetic states. The paramagnetic high-spin and diamagnetic low-spin states of the spin-crossover Feii ions can be interconverted by reversible light-induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST) by alternating between light irradiation of 808 and 473 nm. At 1.8 K, under 808-nm-light irradiation, magnetic interactions between the photogenerated paramagnetic high-spin Feii centres and the Wv centres lead to long fragments that exhibit single-chain magnet behaviour, with a wide magnetic hysteresis and a large coercive field of 19 kOe; under a 473 nm light, isolated Feii–Wv fragments behave as single-molecule magnets instead. At 3.3 K, the high-spin form still displays magnetic hysteresis, albeit narrower, whereas the low-spin one does not. Photoinduced spin crossover offers a convenient handle on the spin states and magnetic interactions within a material, which is promising for the development of photoresponsive nanomagnets. Now, a Wv–CN–Feii-based coordination polymer has been prepared that behaves either as a single-chain magnet or as single-molecule magnets under different light irradiations. Its magnetic hysteresis can also be switched on and off.},

However, current methods for the synthesis of prostaglandins suffer from low yields and lengthy steps. Here, we report a practicability-oriented synthetic strategy for the enantioselective and divergent synthesis of prostaglandins. In this approach, the multiply substituted five-membered rings in prostaglandins were constructed via the key enyne cycloisomerization with excellent selectivity (&amp;gt;20:1 d.r., 98% e.e.). The crucial chiral centre on the scaffold of the prostaglandins was installed using the asymmetric hydrogenation method (up to 98% yield and 98% e.e.). From our versatile common intermediates, a series of prostaglandins and related drugs could be produced in two steps, and fluprostenol could be prepared on a 20-gram scale. Current methods for the synthesis of prostaglandins suffer from low yields and lengthy steps. Now, a strategy for their enantioselective synthesis has been developed with rhodium-catalysed enyne cycloisomerization as the key step. This concise route was scaled up, enabling the preparation of fluprostenol on a 20-gram scale.},

  abstract     = {Mammalian oocytes undergo major changes in zinc content and localization to be fertilized, the most striking being the rapid exocytosis of over 10 billion zinc ions in what are known as zinc sparks. Here, we report that fertilization of amphibian Xenopus laevis eggs also initiates a zinc spark that progresses across the cell surface in coordination with dynamic calcium waves. This zinc exocytosis is accompanied by a newly recognized loss of intracellular manganese. Synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence and analytical electron microscopy reveal that zinc and manganese are sequestered in a system of cortical granules that are abundant at the animal pole. Through electron–nuclear double-resonance studies, we rule out Mn2+ complexation with phosphate or nitrogenous ligands in intact eggs, but the data are consistent with a carboxylate coordination environment. Our observations suggest that zinc and manganese fluxes are a conserved feature of fertilization in vertebrates and that they function as part of a physiological block to polyspermy. Zinc fluxes have now been shown to be essential in the fertilization of amphibian eggs. Furthermore, manganese(ii), which is initially bound to low-molecular-weight carboxylates, is stored and released with zinc from cortical vesicles following fertilization. This rapid metal ion release blocks the otherwise fatal entry of a second sperm.},

  abstract     = {Platinum functions exceptionally well as a nanoparticulate catalyst in many important fields, such as in the removal of atmospheric pollutants, but it is scarce, expensive and not always sufficiently durable. Here, we report a perovskite system in which 0.5 wt% Pt is integrated into the support and its subsequent conversion through exsolution to achieve a resilient catalyst. Owing to the instability of most Pt oxides at high temperatures, a thermally stable platinum oxide precursor, barium platinate, was used to preserve the platinum as an oxide during the solid-state synthesis in an approach akin to the Trojan horse legend. By tailoring the procedure, it is possible to produce a uniform equilibrated structure with active emergent Pt nanoparticles strongly embedded in the perovskite surface that display better CO oxidation activity and stability than those of conventionally prepared Pt catalysts. This catalyst was further evaluated for a variety of reactions under realistic test environments—CO and NO oxidation, diesel oxidation catalysis and ammonia slip reactions were investigated. Nanoparticulate platinum is a highly active catalyst, but it is scarce, expensive and not always sufficiently durable. Now, barium platinate has been used as a vehicle to preserve platinum as an oxide during the solid-state synthesis of a Pt-doped titanate perovskite; this enables the production of a structure with active and stable Pt nanoparticles on the perovskite surface that catalyses CO oxidation.},

Here we report that the 1,2-positional interchange of vicinal C–C and C–Pd(iv) bonds (dyotropic rearrangement) can be realized in a stereospecific manner under mild conditions, giving access to quaternary carbon–palladium bonds. An enantioselective synthesis of medicinally relevant fluorinated cyclopentanes, featuring this rearrangement as a key step, has been developed. We anticipate that implementing a Pd-based dyotropic rearrangement in reaction design could provide a new tool in the development of Pd-catalysed transformations.

Although progress continues to be made in modelling the structural features of nitrogenase cofactors, no synthetic Fe–S cluster has been shown to form a well-defined coordination complex with N2. Here we report that embedding an [MoFe3S4] cluster in a protective ligand environment enables N2 binding at Fe. The bridging [MoFe3S4]2(μ-η1:η1-N2) complex thus prepared features a substantially weakened N–N bond despite the relatively high formal oxidation states of the metal centres. Substitution of one of the [MoFe3S4] cubanes with an electropositive Ti metalloradical induces additional charge transfer to the N2 ligand with generation of Fe–N multiple-bond character. Structural and spectroscopic analyses demonstrate that N2 activation is accompanied by shortened Fe–S distances and charge transfer from each Fe site, including those not directly bound to N2. These findings indicate that covalent interactions within the cluster play a critical role in N2 binding and activation. Although iron–sulfur cofactors are known to carry out biological nitrogen fixation, how these clusters bind dinitrogen remains poorly understood. Now, a dinitrogen complex of a synthetic iron–sulfur cluster has been characterized, and electronic cooperation in the cluster has been shown to result in strong N–N bond activation.},

It has remained challenging, however, to prepare synthetic helical polymers, and those that exist have mainly been limited to single-stranded polymers or short oligomeric double helices. Here, we report the synthesis of covalent helical polymers, with a high molecular weight, from the achiral monomer hexahydroxytriphenylene through to spiroborate formation. Polymerization and crystallization occurred simultaneously under solvothermal conditions to form single crystals of the resulting helical covalent polymers. Characterization by single-crystal X-ray diffraction showed that each crystal consisted of pairs of mechanically entwined polymers. No strong non-covalent interactions were observed between the two helical polymers that formed a pair; instead, each strand interacted with neighbouring pairs through hydrogen bonding. Each individual crystal was made up of helical polymers of the same handedness, but the crystallization process produced a racemic conglomerate, with equal amounts of right-handed and left-handed crystals. Single crystals of a helical covalent polymer have been obtained from an achiral monomer through spiroborate formation. Polymerization and crystallization occur simultaneously to give a network of pairs of entwined helical strands of the same handedness.

Many protein structures have been solved, but far less is known about their relevant conformational changes. To address this challenge, over a million citizen scientists banded together through the Folding@home distributed computing project to create the first exascale computer and simulate 0.1 seconds of the viral proteome. Our adaptive sampling simulations predict dramatic opening of the apo spike complex, far beyond that seen experimentally, explaining and predicting the existence of ‘cryptic’ epitopes. Different spike variants modulate the probabilities of open versus closed structures, balancing receptor binding and immune evasion. We also discover dramatic conformational changes across the proteome, which reveal over 50 ‘cryptic’ pockets that expand targeting options for the design of antivirals. All data and models are freely available online, providing a quantitative structural atlas. Simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome that include over 0.1 s of aggregate data are reported. Spike opening was observed, revealing cryptic epitopes that differ between variants, explaining differential interactions with antibodies and receptors that determine pathogenicity. The cryptic pockets described provide new targets for antivirals and a wealth of mechanistic insight.},

  abstract     = {The design of peptides that assemble in membranes to form functional ion channels is challenging. Specifically, hydrophobic interactions must be designed between the peptides and at the peptide–lipid interfaces simultaneously. Here, we take a multi-step approach towards this problem. First, we use rational de novo design to generate water-soluble α-helical barrels with polar interiors, and confirm their structures using high-resolution X-ray crystallography. These α-helical barrels have water-filled lumens like those of transmembrane channels. Next, we modify the sequences to facilitate their insertion into lipid bilayers. Single-channel electrical recordings and fluorescent imaging of the peptides in membranes show monodisperse, cation-selective channels of unitary conductance. Surprisingly, however, an X-ray structure solved from the lipidic cubic phase for one peptide reveals an alternative state with tightly packed helices and a constricted channel. To reconcile these observations, we perform computational analyses to compare the properties of possible different states of the peptide. The de novo design of functional membrane proteins is a formidable challenge. Now, water-soluble peptides have been designed that assemble into α-helical barrels with accessible, polar and hydrated central channels. Insights from these structures have been used to produce stable membrane-spanning, cation-selective channels.},

  abstract     = {Desymmetrization of fully substituted carbons with a pair of enantiotopic functional groups is a practical strategy for the synthesis of quaternary stereocentres, as it divides the tasks of enantioselection and C−C bond formation. The use of disubstituted malonic esters as the substrate of desymmetrization is particularly attractive, given their easy and modular preparation, as well as the high synthetic values of the chiral monoester products. Here, we report that a dinuclear zinc complex with a tetradentate ligand can selectively hydrosilylate one of the carbonyls of malonic esters to give α-quaternary β-hydroxyesters, providing a promising alternative to the desymmetric hydrolysis using carboxylesterases. The asymmetric reduction features excellent enantiocontrol that can differentiate sterically similar substituents and high chemoselectivity towards the diester motif of substrates. Together with the versatile preparation of malonic ester substrates and post-reduction derivatization, the desymmetric reduction has enabled the synthesis of a diverse array of quaternary stereocentres with distinct structural features. The desymmetrization of easily accessible malonic esters represents an attractive approach towards the formation of chiral quaternary stereocentres, but is largely limited to enzymatic hydrolysis. Now, a zinc-catalysed asymmetric hydrosilylation reaction—that works with a broad scope of substrates—has been shown to reduce one of the esters to a primary alcohol with excellent enantiocontrol.},

  abstract     = {DNA–protein interactions regulate critical biological processes. Identifying proteins that bind to specific, functional genomic loci is essential to understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms on a molecular level. Here we describe a co-binding-mediated protein profiling (CMPP) strategy to investigate the interactome of DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) in native chromatin. CMPP involves cell-permeable, functionalized G4-ligand probes that bind endogenous G4s and subsequently crosslink to co-binding G4-interacting proteins in situ. We first showed the robustness of CMPP by proximity labelling of a G4 binding protein in vitro. Employing this approach in live cells, we then identified hundreds of putative G4-interacting proteins from various functional classes. Next, we confirmed a high G4-binding affinity and selectivity for several newly discovered G4 interactors in vitro, and we validated direct G4 interactions for a functionally important candidate in cellular chromatin using an independent approach. Our studies provide a chemical strategy to map protein interactions of specific nucleic acid features in living cells. DNA–protein interactions are essential to genome function, but they are challenging to map in a cellular environment. Now, a chemical proteomics approach, which uses DNA G-quadruplex-specific ligands containing a photocrosslinking motif, has enabled the systematic identification of DNA G-quadruplex-binding proteins in live cells.},

Herein we have prepared solid solutions in hierarchical solids that are built from atomically precise clusters. Two geometrically similar metal chalcogenide clusters, Co6Se8(PEt3)6 and Cr6Te8(PEt3)6, were combined as random substitutional mixture, in three different ratios, in a crystal lattice together with fullerenes. This does not alter the underlying crystalline structure of the [cluster][C60]2 material, but it influences its electronic and magnetic properties. All three solid solutions showed increased electrical conductivities compared with either the Co- or Cr-based parent material, substantially so for two of the Co:Cr ratios (up to 100-fold), and lowered activation barriers for electron transport. We attribute this to the existence of additional energy states arising from the materials’ structural heterogeneity, which effectively narrow transport gaps. In atomic solids, substitutional doping is a powerful approach to modulating materials properties. Now, three substitutional mixtures of {Co6Se8} and {Cr6Te8} clusters in a crystal lattice with C60 fullerenes have been prepared. At two Co:Cr mixing ratios, the solid solutions showed particularly high electrical conductivities and low activation barriers for electron transport, owing to their structural heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {Natural products with rare functional groups are likely to be constructed by unique biosynthetic enzymes. One such rare functional group is the O-methyl nitronate, which can undergo [3 + 2] cycloaddition reactions with olefins in mild conditions. O-methyl nitronates are found in some natural products; however, how such O-methyl nitronates are assembled biosynthetically is unknown. Here we show that the assembly of the O-methyl nitronate in the natural product enteromycin carboxamide occurs via activation of glycine on a peptidyl carrier protein, followed by reaction with a diiron oxygenase to give a nitronate intermediate and then with a methyltransferase to give an O-methyl nitronate. Guided by the discovery of this pathway, we then identify related cryptic biosynthetic gene cassettes in other bacteria and show that these alternative gene cassettes can, instead, facilitate oxidative denitrification of glycine-derived nitronates. Altogether, our work reveals bifurcating pathways from a central glycine-derived nitronate intermediate in bacteria. O-methyl nitronate is a rare functional group in natural products. Now, the biosynthetic pathway to O-methyl nitronate, which involves O-methylation of a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)-tethered nitronate, has been revealed. In some bacteria, the same PCP-tethered nitronate is shown to be oxidized by nitronate monooxygenases to provide nitrite and a PCP-tethered glyoxylate.},

  abstract     = {Materials that combine magnetic order with other desirable physical attributes could find transformative applications in spintronics, quantum sensing, low-density magnets and gas separations. Among potential multifunctional magnetic materials, metal–organic frameworks, in particular, bear structures that offer intrinsic porosity, vast chemical and structural programmability, and the tunability of electronic properties. Nevertheless, magnetic order within metal–organic frameworks has generally been limited to low temperatures, owing largely to challenges in creating a strong magnetic exchange. Here we employ the phenomenon of itinerant ferromagnetism to realize magnetic ordering at TC = 225 K in a mixed-valence chromium(ii/iii) triazolate compound, which represents the highest ferromagnetic ordering temperature yet observed in a metal–organic framework. The itinerant ferromagnetism proceeds through a double-exchange mechanism, which results in a barrierless charge transport below the Curie temperature and a large negative magnetoresistance of 23% at 5 K. These observations suggest applications for double-exchange-based coordination solids in the emergent fields of magnetoelectrics and spintronics. The development of metal–organic magnets that combine tunable magnetic properties with other desirable physical properties remains challenging despite numerous potential applications. Now, a mixed-valent chromium–triazolate material has been prepared that exhibits itinerant ferromagnetism with a magnetic ordering temperature of 225 K, a high conductivity and large negative magnetoresistance (23%).},

  abstract     = {Most functional groups, especially those consisting of the abundant elements of organic matter—carbon, nitrogen and oxygen—have been extensively studied and only very few remain speculative due to their high intrinsic reactivity. In contrast to the well-explored chemistry of diazoalkanes (R2C=N2), diazoalkenes (R2C=C=N2) have been postulated in several organic transformations, but remain elusive long-sought intermediates. Here, we present a room-temperature stable diazoalkene, utilizing a dinitrogen transfer from nitrous oxide. This functional group shows dual-site nucleophilicity (C and N atoms) and features a bent C–C–N entity (124°) and a long N–N bond together with a remarkable low infrared absorption (1,944 cm–1). Substitution of N2 by an isocyanide leads to a vinylidene ketenimine. Furthermore, photochemically triggered loss of dinitrogen might proceed through a transient triplet vinylidene. We anticipate the existence of a stable diazoalkene functional group to pave an exciting avenue into the chemistry of low-valent carbon and unsaturated carbenes. Although diazoalkenes have been reported as reactive intermediates in organic chemistry, their detection and isolation remains challenging. Such species have previously only been detected at low temperatures in matrix-isolation studies. Now, a room-temperature stable diazoalkene has been reported, which shows dual-site nucleophilicity and can undergo N2 exchange or lose dinitrogen under irradiation.},

  abstract     = {Nanographenes with zigzag edges are predicted to manifest non-trivial π-magnetism resulting from the interplay of concurrent electronic effects, such as hybridization of localized frontier states and Coulomb repulsion between valence electrons. This provides a chemically tunable platform to explore quantum magnetism at the nanoscale and opens avenues towards organic spintronics. The magnetic stability in nanographenes is thus far greatly limited by the weak magnetic exchange coupling, which remains below the room-temperature thermal energy. Here, we report the synthesis of large rhombus-shaped nanographenes with zigzag peripheries on gold and copper surfaces. Single-molecule scanning probe measurements show an emergent magnetic spin singlet ground state with increasing nanographene size. The magnetic exchange coupling in the largest nanographene (C70H22, containing five benzenoid rings along each edge), determined by inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy, exceeds 100 meV or 1,160 K, which outclasses most inorganic nanomaterials and survives on a metal electrode. Open-shell nanographenes are promising for quantum technologies, but their magnetic stability has remained limited by weak exchange coupling. Now, two large rhombus-shaped nanographenes with zigzag peripheries, one with 48 carbon atoms and the other with 70, have been synthesized on gold and copper surfaces. The 70-carbon compound exhibits a large magnetic exchange coupling exceeding 100 meV.},

  abstract     = {Enantioselective catalytic processes are promoted by chiral catalysts that can execute a specific mode of catalytic reactivity, channeling the chemical reaction through a certain mechanistic pathway. Here, we show how by simply using visible light we can divert the established ionic reactivity of a chiral allyl–iridium(iii) complex to switch on completely new catalytic functions, enabling mechanistically unrelated radical-based enantioselective pathways. Photoexcitation provides the chiral organometallic intermediate with the ability to activate substrates via an electron-transfer manifold. This redox event unlocks an otherwise inaccessible cross-coupling mechanism, since the resulting iridium(ii) centre can intercept the generated radicals and undergo a reductive elimination to forge a stereogenic centre with high stereoselectivity. This photochemical strategy enables difficult-to-realize enantioselective alkyl–alkyl cross-coupling reactions between allylic alcohols and readily available radical precursors, which are not achievable under thermal activation. A chiral (η3-allyl)iridium(iii) complex has previously been used to catalyse enantioselective allylic substitution reactions in the polar domain. Now, it has been shown that the visible-light excitation of this iridium complex unlocks an otherwise inaccessible radical-based pathway to achieve enantioselective alkyl–alkyl cross-coupling reactions between allylic alcohols and radical precursors.},

An interesting feature of some frameworks is the ability to open their pores to a specific guest, enabling highly selective separation. A prerequisite for this is bistability of the host structure, which enables the framework to breathe, that is, to switch between two stability minima in response to its environment. Here we describe a porous framework DUT-8(Ni)—which consists of nickel paddle wheel clusters and carboxylate linkers—that adopts a configurationally degenerate family of disordered states in the presence of specific guests. This disorder originates from the nonlinear linkers arranging the clusters in closed loops of different local symmetries that in turn propagate as complex tilings. Solvent exchange stimulates the formation of distinct disordered frameworks, as demonstrated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and diffraction techniques. Guest exchange was shown to stimulate repeatable switching transitions between distinct disorder states. Some flexible metal–organic frameworks are known to exhibit an adaptive behaviour as they convert between two stable forms in response to their environment. Now, a metal–organic framework based on nonlinear linkers has been shown to adopt a much more complex family of degenerate disordered configurations, which can be reversibly interconverted through guest exchange.},

  abstract     = {Singlet fission (SF) can potentially boost the efficiency of solar energy conversion by converting a singlet exciton (S1) into two free triplets (T1 + T1) through an intermediate state of a correlated triplet pair (TT). Although efficient TT generation has been recently realized in many intramolecular SF materials, their potential applications have been hindered by the poor efficiency of TT dissociation. Here we demonstrate that this can be overcome by employing a spatially separated 1(T…T) state with weak intertriplet coupling in tetracene oligomers with three or more chromophores. By using transient magneto-optical spectroscopic methods, we show that free-triplet generation can be markedly enhanced through the SF pathway that involves the spatially separated 1(T…T) state rather than the pathway mediated by the spatially adjacent TT state, leading to a marked improvement in free-triplet generation with an efficiency increase from 21% for the dimer to 85% (124%) for the trimer (tetramer). The overall efficiency of free-triplet generation from intramolecular singlet fission is limited by the efficiency of the dissociation of spatially adjacent triplet pairs. Now, using transient magneto-optical spectroscopy, it has been shown that this limitation can be overcome by promoting a pathway mediated by spatially separated triplet pairs in tetracene trimers and tetramers.},

  abstract     = {RNA origami is a framework for the modular design of nanoscaffolds that can be folded from a single strand of RNA and used to organize molecular components with nanoscale precision. The design of genetically expressible RNA origami, which must fold cotranscriptionally, requires modelling and design tools that simultaneously consider thermodynamics, the folding pathway, sequence constraints and pseudoknot optimization. Here, we describe RNA Origami Automated Design software (ROAD), which builds origami models from a library of structural modules, identifies potential folding barriers and designs optimized sequences. Using ROAD, we extend the scale and functional diversity of RNA scaffolds, creating 32 designs of up to 2,360 nucleotides, five that scaffold two proteins, and seven that scaffold two small molecules at precise distances. Micrographic and chromatographic comparisons of optimized and non-optimized structures validate that our principles for strand routing and sequence design substantially improve yield. By providing efficient design of RNA origami, ROAD may simplify the construction of custom RNA scaffolds for nanomedicine and synthetic biology. RNA origami can be used for the modular design of RNA nanoscaffolds but can be challenging to design. Newly developed computer-aided design software has now been shown to improve the folding yield of kilobase-sized RNA origami. These structures fold from a single strand during transcription by an RNA polymerase, and are able to position small molecules and protein components with nanoscale precision.},

  abstract     = {The encoding of chemical compounds with amplifiable DNA tags facilitates the discovery of small-molecule ligands for proteins. To investigate the impact of stereo- and regiochemistry on ligand discovery, we synthesized a DNA-encoded library of 670,752 derivatives based on 2-azido-3-iodophenylpropionic acids. The library was selected against multiple proteins and yielded specific ligands. The selection fingerprints obtained for a set of protein targets of pharmaceutical relevance clearly showed the preferential enrichment of ortho-, meta- or para-regioisomers, which was experimentally verified by affinity measurements in the absence of DNA. The discovered ligands included novel selective enzyme inhibitors and binders to tumour-associated antigens, which enabled conditional chimeric antigen receptor T-cell activation and tumour targeting. A DNA-encoded chemical library based on regio- and stereoisomers of phenylalanine has been synthesized and used for affinity-based selections against multiple target proteins. This approach led to the isolation and validation of potent ligands capable of CAR T-cell activation and tumour targeting.},

  abstract     = {Enabling the cellular delivery and cytosolic bioavailability of functional proteins constitutes a major challenge for the life sciences. Here we demonstrate that thiol-reactive arginine-rich peptide additives can enhance the cellular uptake of protein–CPP conjugates in a non-endocytic mode, even at low micromolar concentration. We show that such thiol- or HaloTag-reactive additives can result in covalently anchored CPPs on the cell surface, which are highly effective at co-delivering protein cargoes. Taking advantage of the thiol reactivity of our most effective CPP additive, we show that Cys-containing proteins can be readily delivered into the cytosol by simple co-addition of a slight excess of this CPP. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of our ‘CPP-additive technique’ in the delivery of functional enzymes, nanobodies and full-length immunoglobulin-G antibodies. This new cellular uptake protocol greatly simplifies both the accessibility and efficiency of protein and antibody delivery, with minimal chemical or genetic engineering. Robust delivery of proteins into cells is challenging, but it has now been shown that by conjugating arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides to the surface of cells, proteins containing a cell-penetrating peptide can be delivered efficiently into them. Using a thiol-reactive cell-penetrating peptide enables thiol-containing proteins to be delivered by simple co-incubation.},

  abstract     = {Anchoring molecular catalysts on electrode surfaces combines the high selectivity and activity of molecular systems with the practicality of heterogeneous systems. Molecular catalysts, however, are far less stable than traditional heterogeneous electrocatalysts, and therefore a method to easily replace anchored molecular catalysts that have degraded could make such electrosynthetic systems more attractive. Here we applied a non-covalent ‘click’ chemistry approach to reversibly bind molecular electrocatalysts to electrode surfaces through host–guest complexation with surface-anchored cyclodextrins. The host–guest interaction is remarkably strong and enables the flow of electrons between the electrode and the guest catalyst. Electrosynthesis in both organic and aqueous media was demonstrated on metal oxide electrodes, with stability on the order of hours. The catalytic surfaces can be recycled by controlled release of the guest from the host cavities and the readsorption of fresh guest. Molecular catalysts can be made more practical by anchoring them onto electrode surfaces, but such systems are less stable than standard heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Now, supramolecular hosts bound to electrode surfaces have enabled the immobilization of molecular electrocatalysts through host–guest interactions. Desorbed or degraded guest molecules can be replaced with fresh guest molecules, extending their lifetimes.},

Preparedness for future zoonotic outbreaks requires a fundamental understanding of how viruses of animal origin have adapted to binding to a cell surface component and/or receptor of the new host. Here we report on the specificities of human and animal viruses that engage with O-acetylated sialic acid, which include betacoronaviruses, toroviruses and influenza C and D viruses. Key to these studies was the development of a chemoenzymatic methodology that can provide almost any sialate-acetylation pattern. A collection of O-acetylated sialoglycans was printed as a microarray for the determination of receptor specificity. These studies showed host-specific patterns of receptor recognition and revealed that three distinct human respiratory viruses uniquely bind 9-O-acetylated α2,8-linked disialoside. Immunofluorescence and cell entry studies support that such a glycotope as part of a ganglioside is a functional receptor for human coronaviruses. The specificity of human and animal viruses that engage with O-acetylated sialic acids has now been probed using a collection of O-acetylated sialoglycans obtained by diversification of trisaccharide precursors with viral haemagglutinin–esterases. The results revealed host-specific patterns of receptor recognition and showed that human respiratory viruses uniquely employ 9-O-acetylated α2,8-linked disialosides as receptors.},

Here, we show that stereoelectronic effects contribute to stabilizing protein–N-glycan interactions in the context of a cooperatively folding protein. Double-mutant cycle analyses of the folding data from 52 electronically varied N-glycoproteins demonstrate an enthalpy–entropy compensation depending on the electronics of the interacting side chains. Linear and nonlinear models obtained using quantum mechanical calculations and machine learning explain up to 79% and 97% of the experimental interaction energy variability, as inferred from the R2 value of the respective models. Notably, the protein–carbohydrate interaction energies strongly correlate with the molecular orbital energy gaps of the interacting substructures. This suggests that stereoelectronic effects must be given a greater weight than previously thought for accurately modelling the short-range dispersive van der Waals interactions between the N-glycan and the protein. Analysis of the thermodynamics of protein–N-glycan interactions perturbed by mutations has revealed an enthalpy–entropy compensation that depends on the electronics of the interacting side chains. Machine-learned and statistical models showed that protein–N-glycan interactions highly correlate with stereoelectronic effects, and that a major part of protein–N-glycan interactions can be explained using the energetic rules of frontier molecular orbital interactions.},

  abstract     = {Membrane potential is a key aspect of cellular signalling and is dynamically regulated by an array of ion-selective pumps and channels. Fluorescent voltage indicators enable non-invasive optical recording of the cellular membrane potential with high spatial resolution. Here, we report a palette of bright and sensitive hybrid voltage indicators (HVIs) with fluorescence intensities sensitive to changes in membrane potential via electrochromic Förster resonance energy transfer. Enzyme-mediated site-specific incorporation of a probe, followed by an inverse-electron-demand Diels–Alder cycloaddition, was used to create enhanced voltage-sensing rhodopsins with hybrid dye–protein architectures. The most sensitive indicator, HVI-Cy3, displays high voltage sensitivity (−39% ΔF/F0 per 100 mV) and millisecond response kinetics, enabling optical recording of action potentials at a sampling rate of 400 Hz over 10 min across a large neuronal population. The far-red indicator HVI-Cy5 could be paired with optogenetic actuators and green/red-emitting fluorescent indicators, allowing an all-optical investigation of neuronal electrophysiology. Voltage imaging is a powerful technique for studying electrical signalling in neurons. A palette of bright and sensitive voltage indicators has now been developed via enzyme-mediated ligation and Diels–Alder cycloaddition. Among these, a far-red indicator faithfully reports neuronal action potential dynamics with an excitation spectrum orthogonal to optogenetic actuators and green/red-emitting biosensors.},

  abstract     = {Aprotic alkali metal–O2 batteries face two major obstacles to their chemistry occurring efficiently, the insulating nature of the formed alkali superoxides/peroxides and parasitic reactions that are caused by the highly reactive singlet oxygen (1O2). Redox mediators are recognized to be key for improving rechargeability. However, it is unclear how they affect 1O2 formation, which hinders strategies for their improvement. Here we clarify the mechanism of mediated peroxide and superoxide oxidation and thus explain how redox mediators either enhance or suppress 1O2 formation. We show that charging commences with peroxide oxidation to a superoxide intermediate and that redox potentials above ~3.5 V versus Li/Li+ drive 1O2 evolution from superoxide oxidation, while disproportionation always generates some 1O2. We find that 1O2 suppression requires oxidation to be faster than the generation of 1O2 from disproportionation. Oxidation rates decrease with growing driving force following Marcus inverted-region behaviour, establishing a region of maximum rate. Redox mediators are important for improving the rechargeability of metal–air batteries, however, how they affect singlet oxygen formation and hence parasitic chemistry is unclear, hindering strategies for their improvement. Now, the mechanism of mediated peroxide and superoxide oxidation is elucidated, explaining how redox mediators either enhance or suppress singlet oxygen formation.},

  abstract     = {Monophosphorus compounds are of enormous industrial importance due to the crucial roles they play in applications such as pharmaceuticals, photoinitiators and ligands for catalysis, among many others. White phosphorus (P4) is the key starting material for the preparation of all such chemicals. However, current production depends on indirect and inefficient, multi-step procedures. Here, we report a simple, effective ‘one-pot’ synthesis of a wide range of organic and inorganic monophosphorus species directly from P4. Reduction of P4 using tri-n-butyltin hydride and subsequent treatment with various electrophiles affords compounds that are of key importance for the chemical industry, and it requires only mild conditions and inexpensive, easily handled reagents. Crucially, we also demonstrate facile and efficient recycling and ultimately catalytic use of the tributyltin reagent, thereby avoiding the formation of substantial Sn-containing waste. Accessible, industrially relevant products include the fumigant PH3, the reducing agent hypophosphorous acid and the flame-retardant precursor tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride. State-of-the-art industrial methods for transforming P4 into useful phosphorus compounds currently rely on indirect, multi-step strategies. It has now been shown that straightforward one-pot reactions can convert P4 directly into industrially relevant products while requiring only mild conditions and simple, inexpensive reagents—and can also functionalize P4 catalytically.},

To address these limitations, herein we report a strategy that merges solid-phase synthesis and continuous-flow operation, enabling push-button automated multistep syntheses of active pharmaceutical ingredients. We demonstrate our platform with a six-step synthesis of prexasertib in 65% isolated yield after 32 h of continuous execution. As there are no interactions between individual synthetic steps in the sequence, the established chemical recipe file was directly adopted or slightly modified for the synthesis of twenty-three prexasertib derivatives, enabling both automated early and late-stage diversification. Although strategies for the automated assembly of compounds of pharmaceutical relevance is a growing field of research, the synthesis of small-molecule pharmacophores remains a predominantly manual process. Now, an automated six-step synthesis of prexasertib is achieved by multistep solid-phase chemistry in a continuous-flow fashion using a chemical recipe file that enables automated scaffold modification through both early and late-stage diversification.},

  abstract     = {A major role for the intracellular post-translational modification O-GlcNAc appears to be the inhibition of protein aggregation. Most of the previous studies in this area focused on O-GlcNAc modification of the amyloid-forming proteins themselves. Here we used synthetic protein chemistry to discover that O-GlcNAc also activates the anti-amyloid activity of certain small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), a potentially more important modification event that can act broadly and substoichiometrically. More specifically, we found that O-GlcNAc increases the ability of sHSPs to block the amyloid formation of both α-synuclein and Aβ(1–42). Mechanistically, we show that O-GlcNAc near the sHSP IXI-domain prevents its ability to intramolecularly compete with substrate binding. Finally, we found that, although O-GlcNAc levels are globally reduced in Alzheimer’s disease brains, the modification of relevant sHSPs is either maintained or increased, which suggests a mechanism to maintain these potentially protective O-GlcNAc modifications. Our results have important implications for neurodegenerative diseases associated with amyloid formation and potentially other areas of sHSP biology. The post-translational modification O-GlcNAc on amyloid-forming proteins can inhibit their aggregation. Now, it has been shown that O-GlcNAc modification of small heat shock proteins HSP27, αA- and αB-crystallin can increase their anti-amyloid activity and block the amyloid formation of both α-synuclein and Aβ(1–42). A mechanism for this protective effect based on decreased physical interactions is also proposed.},

  abstract     = {Quantum-state control of reactive systems has enabled microscopic probes of underlying interaction potentials and the alteration of reaction rates using quantum statistics. However, extending such control to the quantum states of reaction outcomes remains challenging. Here, we realize this goal by utilizing the conservation of nuclear spins throughout the reaction. Using resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization spectroscopy to investigate the products formed in bimolecular reactions between ultracold KRb molecules we find that the system retains a near-perfect memory of the reactants’ nuclear spins, manifested as a strong parity preference for the rotational states of the products. We leverage this effect to alter the occupation of these product states by changing the coherent superposition of initial nuclear spin states with an external magnetic field. In this way, we are able to control both the inputs and outputs of a reaction with quantum-state resolution. The techniques demonstrated here open up the possibilities to study quantum entanglement between reaction products and ultracold reaction dynamics at the state-to-state level. Energy scrambling in intermediate complexes—which form in many chemical reactions—presents a major challenge to state-to-state control. However, nuclear spin tends to remain unchanged throughout reactions and now, by manipulating the reactants’ nuclear spins using an external magnetic field, control over the product state distribution of a bimolecular reaction has been demonstrated.},

However, only a limited set of molecular inputs can currently be detected using reagentless sensors. Here, we report a sensing mechanism that is compatible with the analysis of proteins that are important physiological markers of stress, allergy, cardiovascular health, inflammation and cancer. The sensing method is based on the motion of an inverted molecular pendulum that exhibits field-induced transport modulated by the presence of a bound analyte. We measure the sensor’s electric field-mediated transport using the electron-transfer kinetics of an attached reporter molecule. Using time-resolved electrochemical measurements that enable unidirectional motion of our sensor, the presence of an analyte bound to our sensor complex can be tracked continuously in real time. We show that this sensing approach is compatible with making measurements in blood, saliva, urine, tears and sweat and that the sensors can collect data in situ in living animals.

Spectroscopic evidence indicates that the ternary complex is sufficiently stable in solution for the two outer shells to affect the addition chemistry of the fullerene guest. When the complex is subjected to Bingel cyclopropanation conditions, the exclusive formation of a single trans-3 fullerene bis-adduct was observed in a reaction that typically yields more than a dozen products. The selectivity facilitated by this matryoshka-like approach appears to be a general phenomenon and could be useful for applications where regioisomerically pure C60 bis-adducts have been shown to have superior properties compared with isomer mixtures.

Successful preparations of AHCBs offer the prospect of providing well-defined templates for the growth of uniform single-walled carbon nanotubes—a long-standing interest in nanocarbon science.

Here, we report a nitrene-mediated intermolecular N–N coupling of dioxazolones and arylamines under iridium or iron catalysis. These reactions offer a simple and efficient method for the synthesis of various hydrazides from readily available carboxylic acid and amine precursors. Although the Ir-catalysed conditions usually give higher N–N coupling yield than the Fe-catalysed conditions, the reactions of sterically more demanding dioxazolones derived from α-substituted carboxylic acids work much better under the Fe-catalysed conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed that the nitrogen atom of Ir acyl nitrene intermediates has strong electrophilicity and can undergo nucleophilic attack with arylamines with the assistance of Cl···HN hydrogen bonding to form the N–N bond with high efficiency and chemoselectivity. Although many natural products and drug molecules contain N–N linkages, the chemistry of N–N coupling is somewhat underdeveloped.

  abstract     = {The metathesis of carbon–carbon double bonds—the ‘reshuffling’ of their constituting carbene fragments—is a tremendously important preparative tool in industry and academia. Metathesis of heavier alkene homologues is restricted to occasional unproductive examples in phosphorus chemistry and cross-metathesis to mixed heavier alkynes. We now report the thermally induced, transition-metal-free metathesis of purpose-built unsymmetrically substituted digermenes. The A2Ge=GeAB starting materials are thus converted to symmetrically substituted derivatives of the A2Ge=GeA2 and ABGe=GeAB types. The use of tethered auxiliary donors (dimethylaniline groups) in substituents B ensures intramolecular donor–acceptor stabilization of the transient germylene fragments, the intermediacy of which is proven by trapping experiments. Density functional theory calculations shed light on the thermodynamic driving force of the metathesis and validate the crucial role of the tethered donor. With an analogously equipped bridged tetragermadiene precursor (A2Ge=GeB-X-BGe=GeA2), heavier acyclic diene metathesis polymerization occurs, in analogy to the widespread acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization in the carbon case, yielding a polydigermene. The metathesis of carbon–carbon double bonds is an important tool in organic synthesis and now a similar reshuffling has been carried out with heavier alkene analogues featuring unsymmetrically substituted Ge=Ge double bonds. This reaction enables the synthesis of symmetric molecular digermenes as well as a polymer based on Ge=Ge repeat units.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical techniques have long been heralded for their innate sustainability as efficient methods to achieve redox reactions. Carbonyl desaturation, as a fundamental organic oxidation, is an oft-employed transformation to unlock adjacent reactivity through the formal removal of two hydrogen atoms. To date, the most reliable methods to achieve this seemingly trivial reaction rely on transition metals (Pd or Cu) or stoichiometric reagents based on I, Br, Se or S. Here we report an operationally simple pathway to access such structures from enol silanes and phosphates using electrons as the primary reagent. This electrochemically driven desaturation exhibits a broad scope across an array of carbonyl derivatives, is easily scalable (1–100 g) and can be predictably implemented into synthetic pathways using experimentally or computationally derived NMR shifts. Systematic comparisons to state-of-the-art techniques reveal that this method can uniquely desaturate a wide array of carbonyl groups. Mechanistic interrogation suggests a radical-based reaction pathway. Excising hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group—one of the most basic and widely employed transformations in organic synthesis—is traditionally achieved using metals and/or stoichiometric oxidants. Now, it has been shown that an electrochemically driven approach removes such requirements, resulting in a more sustainable and easily scalable method with wide substrate scope.},

  abstract     = {Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been studied extensively in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the water oxidation reaction (WOR) with sacrificial reagents, but overall photocatalytic water splitting using MOFs has remained challenging, principally because of the fast recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes. Here we have integrated HER- and WOR-MOF nanosheets into liposomal structures for separation of the generated charges. The HER-MOF nanosheets comprise light-harvesting Zn–porphyrin and catalytic Pt–porphyrin moieties, and are functionalized with hydrophobic groups to facilitate their incorporation into the hydrophobic lipid bilayer of the liposome. The WOR-MOF flakes consist of [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)3]2+-based photosensitizers and Ir–bipyridine catalytic centres, and are localized in the hydrophilic interior of the liposome. This liposome–MOF assembly achieves overall photocatalytic water splitting with an apparent quantum yield of (1.5 ± 1)% as a result of ultrafast electron transport from the antennae (Zn–porphyrin and [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)3]2+) to the reaction centres (Pt–porphyrin and Ir–bipyridine) in the MOFs and efficient charge separation in the lipid bilayers. Some metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can promote photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and others can facilitate water oxidation, but it is difficult to combine them into a single system. Now, by confining MOFs that can promote each half-reaction within the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions of a liposome to avoid the fast recombination of photo-generated charges, evidence for water splitting has been obtained.},

  abstract     = {Element–element double bonds of group 14 elements can be formed in solution, but generally only by applying harsh reductive conditions using sterically highly shielded tetryl halides as precursors. The two-dimensional confinement in surface-assisted polymerization represents a valuable alternative to access such reactive compounds, as it allows shielding of the labile entities without requiring bulky residues and catalytic activation of the reactive groups. Here, we demonstrate Si–Si bond formation in on-surface chemistry. Polymerization upon multiple Si–H bond dissociation and subsequent Si–Si bond formation was achieved on Au(111) and Cu(111) surfaces by using two different monomers, each containing two silicon functional groups (CH3SiH2 or SiH3) attached to an aromatic backbone, leading to polymeric disilenes that interact with the surface. A combination of experimental and theoretical studies corroborates the formation of covalent Si–Si bonds between the long, highly ordered polymer chains with high diastereoselectivity. The reactive Si=Si bonds formally generated via double dehydrogenative coupling are stabilized via covalent Si–surface interaction. On-surface dehydrogenative bond formation between sp3-hybridized carbon atoms usually requires high temperatures. Now, it has been shown that the higher homologue, silicon, can undergo dehydrogenative polymerization at room temperature on metal surfaces. This process creates well-ordered structures on Au(111) and Cu(111), with different stereoselectivity depending on the metal.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that the solvent plays a critical role in ultrafast electron-transfer reactions. However, solvent reorganization occurs on multiple length scales, and selectively measuring short-range solute–solvent interactions at the atomic level with femtosecond time resolution remains a challenge. Here we report femtosecond X-ray scattering and emission measurements following photoinduced charge-transfer excitation in a mixed-valence bimetallic (FeiiRuiii) complex in water, and their interpretation using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Combined experimental and computational analysis reveals that the charge-transfer excited state has a lifetime of 62 fs and that coherent translational motions of the first solvation shell are coupled to the back electron transfer. Our molecular dynamics simulations identify that the observed coherent translational motions arise from hydrogen bonding changes between the solute and nearby water molecules upon photoexcitation, and have an amplitude of tenths of ångströms, 120–200 cm−1 frequency and ~100 fs relaxation time. This study provides an atomistic view of coherent solvent reorganization mediating ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer. Solvent plays a critical role in electron-transfer reactions, but short-range solvation dynamics are challenging to observe. Now, femtosecond X-ray solution scattering has been used to directly monitor the reorganization of water upon ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer in a bimetallic complex. Coherent motions of the first-shell water molecules are observed, arising from changes in solute–solvent hydrogen bonding.},

  abstract     = {In cells, myriad membrane-interacting proteins generate and maintain curved membrane domains with radii of curvature around or below 50 nm. To understand how such highly curved membranes modulate specific protein functions, and vice versa, it is imperative to use small liposomes with precisely defined attributes as model membranes. Here, we report a versatile and scalable sorting technique that uses cholesterol-modified DNA ‘nanobricks’ to differentiate hetero-sized liposomes by their buoyant densities. This method separates milligrams of liposomes, regardless of their origins and chemical compositions, into six to eight homogeneous populations with mean diameters of 30–130 nm. We show that these uniform, leak-resistant liposomes serve as ideal substrates to study, with an unprecedented resolution, how membrane curvature influences peripheral (ATG3) and integral (SNARE) membrane protein activities. Compared with conventional methods, our sorting technique represents a streamlined process to achieve superior liposome size uniformity, which benefits research in membrane biology and the development of liposomal drug-delivery systems. Small liposomes of uniform sizes are valuable tools for studying membrane biology and developing drug-delivery vehicles. Now, a DNA-assisted sorting technique has been shown to produce multiple species of monodispersed liposomes with mean diameters below 150 nm in a scalable manner. This approach has enabled the high-resolution analyses of curvature-dependent membrane protein activities.},

  abstract     = {The asymmetric construction of all-carbon quaternary centres within acyclic settings represents a long-standing challenge for synthetic chemists. Alongside polar and radical methods, rearrangement reactions represent an attractive platform, but still broadly applicable methods are in high demand. Here we report an asymmetric, radical sulfinyl-Smiles rearrangement to access acyclic amides that bear an α-all-carbon quaternary centre. Our strategy uses enantioenriched N-arylsulfinyl acrylamides as acceptors for a variety of radicals produced in situ under mild photoredox conditions. The sulfinamido group not only directs the 1,4-migration of the aryl moiety onto the α-carbon of the amide, which thus governs its absolute configuration, but also functions as a traceless chiral auxiliary. The amides obtained in this multicomponent process are prevalent in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and bioactive natural products, and can be transformed into valuable chiral α,α-disubstituted acids, oxindoles as well as into β,β-disubstituted amines, highlighting the synthetic potential of this transformation. The assembly of a single configuration of an all-carbon quaternary centre within acyclic systems remains a challenge for synthetic chemists. Now, it has been shown that α-all-carbon quaternary centres can be installed in acyclic amides, with excellent levels of absolute stereocontrol, through a radical sulfinyl Truce–Smiles rearrangement.},

  abstract     = {Efforts to use RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes (DNAzymes) as gene-silencing agents in therapeutic applications have stalled due to their low efficacy in clinical trials. Here we report a xeno-nucleic-acid-modified version of the classic DNAzyme 10–23 that achieves multiple-turnover activity under cellular conditions and resists nuclease digestion. The new reagent, X10–23, overcomes the problem of product inhibition, which limited previous 10–23 designs, using molecular chemotypes with DNA, 2′-fluoroarabino nucleic acid and α-l-threofuranosyl nucleic acid backbone architectures that balance the effects of enhanced biological stability with RNA hybridization and divalent metal ion coordination. In cultured mammalian cells, X10–23 facilitates persistent gene silencing by efficiently degrading exogenous and endogenous messenger RNA transcripts. Together, these results demonstrate that new molecular chemotypes can improve the activity and stability of DNAzymes, and may provide a new route for nucleic acid enzymes to reach the clinic. RNA-cleaving DNA enzymes (DNAzymes) have the potential to function as therapeutic agents by silencing the expression of disease-associated proteins. Xeno-nucleic acids were used to improve the catalytic activity and biological stability of a highly evolved DNAzyme known as 10–23. The enzyme exhibits a robust multiple-turnover activity in cultured mammalian cells.},

  abstract     = {Enzymatic reactions through mononuclear metal hydrides are unknown in nature, despite the prevalence of such intermediates in the reactions of synthetic transition-metal catalysts. If metalloenzymes could react through abiotic intermediates like these, then the scope of enzyme-catalysed reactions would expand. Here we show that zinc-containing carbonic anhydrase enzymes catalyse hydride transfers from silanes to ketones with high enantioselectivity. We report mechanistic data providing strong evidence that the process involves a mononuclear zinc hydride. This work shows that abiotic silanes can act as reducing equivalents in an enzyme-catalysed process and that monomeric hydrides of electropositive metals, which are typically unstable in protic environments, can be catalytic intermediates in enzymatic processes. Overall, this work bridges a gap between the types of transformation in molecular catalysis and biocatalysis. Enzymatic reactions involving mononuclear metal hydrides are unknown in nature, despite the prevalence of such intermediates in synthetic transition-metal catalysed reactions. Now, it has been shown that zinc-containing carbonic anhydrase enzymes can catalyse hydride transfers from silanes to ketones with high enantioselectivity and there is evidence to support the intermediacy of a mononuclear zinc hydride.},

  abstract     = {Reactions at the interface between water and other phases play important roles in nature and in various chemical systems. Although some experimental and theoretical studies suggest that chemical reactions at water interfaces can be different from those in bulk water—for example, ‘on-water catalysis’ and the activation of photochemically inert fatty acids at the air–water interface upon photoexcitation—directly investigating these differences and generating molecular-level understanding has proved difficult. Here, we report on the direct probing of a photochemical reaction occurring at the air–water interface, using ultrafast phase-sensitive interface-selective nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy. The femtosecond time-resolved data obtained clearly show that the photoionization reaction of phenol proceeds 104 times faster at the water surface than in the bulk aqueous phase (upon irradiation with photons with the same energy). This finding demonstrates that photochemical reactions at water interfaces are very different from those in bulk water, reflecting distinct reaction environments at the interface. Reactions at the interface between water and other phases play important roles in various chemical settings. Now, ultrafast phase-sensitive interface-selective vibrational spectroscopy has revealed that the photoionization of phenol can occur four orders of magnitude faster at the water surface than in the bulk aqueous phase.},

  abstract     = {Developing targeted α-therapies has the potential to transform how diseases are treated. In these interventions, targeting vectors are labelled with α-emitting radioisotopes that deliver destructive radiation discretely to diseased cells while simultaneously sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. Widespread implementation requires advances in non-invasive imaging technologies that rapidly assay therapeutics. Towards this end, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has emerged as one of the most informative diagnostic techniques. Unfortunately, many promising α-emitting isotopes such as 225Ac and 227Th are incompatible with PET imaging. Here we overcame this obstacle by developing large-scale (Ci-scale) production and purification methods for 134Ce. Subsequent radiolabelling and in vivo PET imaging experiments in a small animal model demonstrated that 134Ce (and its 134La daughter) could be used as a PET imaging candidate for 225AcIII (with reduced 134CeIII) or 227ThIV (with oxidized 134CeIV). Evaluating these data alongside X-ray absorption spectroscopy results demonstrated how success relied on rigorously controlling the CeIII/CeIV redox couple. 134Ce and 134La have great potential as companion diagnostic isotopes for radiotherapeutics labelled with α-emitting 225Ac and 227Th. Now, by controlling the CeIII/CeIV redox couple, the large-scale production, purification and characterization of 134Ce- and 134La-based radiolabels has been achieved and their use for in vivo positron emission tomography is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Amphidynamic crystals, which possess crystallinity and support dynamic behaviours, are very well suited to the exploration of emergent phenomena that result from the coupling on the dynamic moieties. Here, dipolar rotors have been embedded in a crystalline metal–organic framework. The material consists of Zn(ii) nodes and two types of ditopic bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-based linkers—one that coordinates to the Zn clusters through two 1,4-aza moieties, and a difluoro-functionalized derivative (the dipolar rotor) that coordinates through linked 1,4-dicarboxylate groups instead. Upon cooling, these linkers collectively order as a result of correlated dipole–dipole interactions. Variable-temperature, frequency-dependent dielectric measurements revealed a transition temperature Tc = 100 K, when a rapidly rotating, dipole-disordered, paraelectric phase transformed into an ordered, antiferroelectric one in which the dipole moments of the rotating linkers largely cancelled each other. Monte Carlo simulations on a two-dimensional rotary lattice showed a ground state with an Ising symmetry and the effects of dipole–lattice and dipole–dipole interactions. A metal–organic framework (MOF) has been prepared that features dynamic rotors embedded within its crystalline lattice. The dipolar F2-functionalized carboxylate linkers—rapidly rotating at room temperature—show correlated behaviour upon cooling, converting the paraelectric MOF into an ordered antiferroelectric one below 100 K.},

  abstract     = {Cross-coupling of two alkyl fragments is an efficient method to produce organic molecules rich in sp3-hybridized carbon centres, which are attractive candidate compounds in drug discovery. Enantioselective C(sp3)–C(sp3) coupling is challenging, especially of alkyl electrophiles without an activating group (aryl, vinyl, carbonyl). Here, we report a strategy based on nickel hydride addition to internal olefins followed by nickel-catalysed alkyl–alkyl coupling. This strategy enables the enantioselective cross-coupling of non-activated alkyl halides with alkenyl boronates to produce chiral alkyl boronates. Employing readily available and stable olefins as pro-chiral nucleophiles, the coupling proceeds under mild conditions and exhibits broad scope and high functional-group tolerance. Applications for the functionalization of natural products and drug molecules, as well as the synthesis of chiral building blocks and a key intermediate to (S)-(+)-pregabalin, are demonstrated. Methods for producing organic molecules rich in sp3-hybridized carbon centres can be particularly useful for drug development. Now, it has been shown that the enantioselective cross-coupling of non-activated alkyl halides with alkenyl boronates enables the synthesis of chiral alkyl boronates. The reaction proceeds via nickel hydride insertion into an internal alkene followed by nickel-catalysed alkyl–alkyl cross-coupling.},

  abstract     = {Robust methods for predicting thermal stabilities of collagen triple helices are critical for understanding natural structure and stability in the collagen family of proteins and also for designing synthetic peptides mimicking these essential proteins. In this work, we determine the relative stability imparted on the collagen triple helix by single amino acids and interactions between amino acid pairs. Using this analysis, we create a comprehensive algorithm, SCEPTTr, for predicting melting temperatures of synthetic triple helices. Critically, our algorithm is compatible with every natural amino acid, can evaluate both homotrimers and heterotrimers, and accounts for all possible helix compositions and registers, including non-canonically staggered helices. We test and optimize our algorithm against 431 published collagen triple helices to demonstrate the quality of our predictive system. Finally, we use this algorithm to successfully guide the design of an ABC heterotrimer possessing high assembly specificity. Collagen-like peptides can self-assemble into hundreds of closely related triple helices. Now, an algorithm has been developed that predicts the most stable helix and the extent to which it will assemble to the exclusion of the competing helices. This information can help improve the understanding of triple helix design and assembly.},

  abstract     = {The structure-selective precise synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been long sought in materials science. The aromatic molecules corresponding to segment structures of CNTs, that is, carbon nanobelts (CNBs), are of interest as templates for CNT growth. Among the three types of CNB (armchair, chiral and zigzag CNBs), zigzag CNBs have been considered the most difficult type to synthesize. Here we report the synthesis, isolation and structural characterization of a zigzag CNB. The synthesis involves an iterative Diels–Alder reaction sequence followed by reductive aromatization of oxygen-bridged moieties. As predicted by theoretical calculations, this CNB was isolated as a stable compound. The structure of the zigzag CNB was fully characterized by X-ray crystallography and its wide energy gap with blue fluorescence properties was revealed by photophysical measurements. With synthetic strategies towards all three types of CNB in hand, the road to the precise synthesis of CNTs can now proceed to the next stage. The synthesis of a zigzag carbon nanobelt has been achieved through an iterative Diels–Alder reaction followed by reductive aromatization. The isolated nanobelt was fully characterized by X-ray crystallography and its wide energy gap with blue fluorescence properties was revealed by photophysical measurements.},

  abstract     = {The desire to better understand the quantum nature of isomerization led to recent experimental observations of the vibrationally induced isomerization of OC–NaCl(100) to CO–NaCl(100). To investigate the mechanism of this isomerization, we performed dynamics calculations using finite (CO–NaCl)n cluster models. We constructed new potential energy surfaces for CO–NaCl and CO–CO interactions using high-level ab initio data and report key properties of the bare CO–NaCl potential energy surface, which show much in common with the experiment. We investigated the isomerization dynamics using several cluster models and, in all cases, isomerization was seen for highly excited CO vibrational states, in agreement with experiments. A detailed examination of the reaction trajectories indicates that isomerization occurs when the distance between CO and NaCl is larger than the distance at the conventional isomerization saddle point, which is a strong indicator of ‘roaming’. Recent experiments reporting the isomerization of CO on a NaCl(100) surface—from C adsorbed to O adsorbed—represent a major challenge to simulate from first principles. Now, using dynamics calculations and (CO–NaCl)n cluster models that feature CO–CO interactions, it is found that isomerization occurs via a ‘roaming’ mechanism at a large distance from the NaCl(100) surface.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of ferrocene nearly 70 years ago marked the genesis of metallocene chemistry. Although the ferrocenium cation was discovered soon afterwards, a derivatized ferrocenium dication was only isolated in 2016 and the monoanion of ferrocene has only been observed in low-temperature electrochemical studies. Here we report the isolation of a derivatized ferrocene anion in the solid state as part of an isostructural family of 3d metallocenates, which consist of anionic complexes of a metal centre (manganese, iron or cobalt) sandwiched between two bulky Cpttt ligands (where Cpttt is {1,2,4-C5H2 tBu3}). These thermally and air-sensitive complexes decompose rapidly above −30 °C; however, we were able to characterize all metallocenates by a wide range of physical techniques and ab initio calculations. These data have allowed us to map the electronic structures of this metallocenate family, including an unexpected high-spin S = 3/2 ground state for the 19e− derivatized ferrocene anion. Unlike ferrocene and its cationic counterpart ferrocenium, the ferrocene monoanion is an unusual species that has been observed through low-temperature electrochemical studies. Now, a family of isostructural 3d metallocenates has been isolated that consists of a manganocene, a cobaltocene and a high-spin ferrocene anion stabilized by cyclopentadienyl ligands bearing bulky aliphatic groups.},

  abstract     = {The development of efficient methods, particularly catalytic and enantioselective processes, for the construction of all-carbon quaternary stereocentres is an important (and difficult) challenge in organic synthesis due to the occurrence of this motif in a range of bioactive molecules. One conceptually straightforward and potentially versatile approach is the catalytic enantioconvergent substitution reaction of a readily available racemic tertiary alkyl electrophile by an organometallic nucleophile; however, examples of such processes are rare. Here we demonstrate that a nickel-based chiral catalyst achieves enantioconvergent couplings of a variety of tertiary electrophiles (cyclic and acyclic α-halocarbonyl compounds) with alkenylmetal nucleophiles to form quaternary stereocentres with good yield and enantioselectivity under mild conditions in the presence of a range of functional groups. These couplings, which probably proceed via a radical pathway, provide access to an array of useful families of organic compounds, including intermediates in the total synthesis of two natural products, (–)-eburnamonine and madindoline A. A wide variety of bioactive molecules contain stereogenic quaternary carbons, and developing methods for the construction of these stereocentres continues to be an active area of research. Now, it has been shown that a nickel-catalysed enantioconvergent coupling of tertiary alkyl electrophiles with alkenylmetal nucleophiles—which probably proceeds via a radical pathway—can form and set quaternary stereocentres efficiently under mild conditions.},

These properties capitalize on effective Lewis acid catalysis, a chemical strategy for accelerating Diels–Alder reactions common in the laboratory but so far unknown in nature. Extension of this approach to other metal ions and other de novo scaffolds may propel the design field in exciting new directions. A de novo designed zinc-binding protein has been converted into a highly active, stereoselective catalyst for a hetero-Diels–Alder reaction.

  abstract     = {All superheavy elements (SHEs), with atomic numbers (Z) ≥104, have been artificially synthesized one atom at a time and their chemical properties are largely unknown. Because these heavy nuclei have short lifetimes as well as extremely low production rates, chemical experiments need to be carried out on single atoms and have mostly been limited to adsorption and extraction. We have now investigated the precipitation properties of the SHE Rf (Z = 104). A co-precipitation method with samarium hydroxide had previously established that the co-precipitation behaviour of a range of elements reflected these elements’ tendency to form hydroxide precipitates and/or ammine complex ions. Here we investigated co-precipitation of Rf in basic solutions containing NH3 or NaOH. Comparisons between the behaviour of Rf with that of Zr and Hf (lighter homologues of Rf) and actinide Th (a pseudo-homologue of Rf) showed that Rf does not coordinate strongly with NH3, but forms a hydroxide (co)precipitate that is expected to be Rf(OH)4. It is difficult to investigate the chemical properties of superheavy elements, which are only available an atom at a time and rapidly decay. A co-precipitation method with samarium has now been developed that suggests rutherfordium would form hydroxide precipitates—but not ammine ones—if it were possible to perform these experiments on macroscopic quantities.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional conformation is the primary determinant of molecular properties. The thermal energy available at room temperature typically equilibrates the accessible conformational states. Here, we introduce a method for isolating unique and previously understudied conformations of macrocycles. The observation of unusual conformations of 16- to 22-membered rings has been made possible by controlling their interconversion using dominant rotors, which represent tunable atropisomeric constituents with relatively high rotational barriers. Density functional theory and in situ NMR measurements suggest that dominant rotor candidates for the amino-acid-based structures considered here should possess a rotational energy barrier of at least 25 kcal mol−1. Notable differences in the geometries of the macrocycle conformations were identified by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. There is evidence that amino acid residues can be forced into rare turn motifs not observed in the corresponding linear counterparts and homodetic rings. These findings should unlock new avenues for studying the conformation–activity relationships of bioactive molecules. Constrained molecules typically adopt one major conformation and this limitation prevents the study of other energetically less-favourable conformations. Nevertheless, these alternate structures might prove to be useful and it has now been shown that a dominant rotor method can alter the energetic landscape of peptides to create two-well systems with distinct conformational behaviour.},

  abstract     = {Solute–solvent interactions are key for the assembly and proper functioning of biomacromolecules and play important roles in many fields of organic and polymer chemistry. Despite numerous reports describing the effects of (chiral) solvents on helical conformations of (supramolecular) polymers, the combination of chiral solvents and chiral monomers is unexplored. Here we report diastereomeric differences in the supramolecular polymerization of enantiomers of chiral triphenylene-2,6,10-tricarboxamides in chiral chlorinated solvents. Competition between the preferences induced by the stereocentres of the assembled monomers and those present in the solvent molecules results in unforeseen temperature-dependent solvation effects. By combining experiments and mathematical modelling, we show that the observed differences between enantiomers originate from the combined additive entropic effects of stereocentres present in the monomer and in the solvent. Remarkably, copolymerizations show that the chiral solvent can bias the copolymer helicity and thereby overrule the helical preference of the monomers. Our results highlight the importance of cumulative solvation effects in supramolecular polymerizations. Mirror-symmetry breaking in chiral systems by a chiral solvent has remained poorly understood for decades. Now, the supramolecular polymerization of triphenylene derivatives has shown that—through the additive effects of polymerization—the cumulative entropic effects of the interactions between chiral solvents and solutes create measurable differences in free enthalpy.},

This makes MOFs a promising platform for the development of stimuli-responsive materials that show drastically different magnetic properties depending on the presence or absence of guest molecules within their pores. Here we report a CO2-responsive magnetic MOF that converts from ferrimagnetic to paramagnetic on CO2 adsorption, and returns to the ferrimagnetic state on CO2 desorption. The ferrimagnetic material is a layered MOF with a [D+–A−–D] formula, produced from the reaction of trifluorobenzoate-bridged paddlewheel-type diruthenium(ii) clusters as the electron donor (D) with diethoxytetracyanoquinodimethane as the electron acceptor (A). On CO2 uptake, it undergoes an in-plane electron transfer and a structural transition to adopt a [D–A–D] paramagnetic form. This magnetic phase change, and the accompanying modifications to the electronic conductivity and permittivity of the MOF, are electronically stabilized by the guest CO2 molecules accommodated in the framework. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can combine porosity and magnetic order within their lattice, which makes them attractive for the development of stimuli-responsive magnets. Now, a MOF has been prepared that converts from a ferrimagnet to a paramagnet with CO2 uptake, and returns to the ferrimagnetic state on releasing CO2.},

  abstract     = {Transition-metal-catalysed, redox-neutral dehydrosilylation of alkenes is a long-standing challenge in organic synthesis, with current methods suffering from low selectivity and narrow scope. In this study, we report a general and simple method for the manganese-catalysed dehydrosilylation and hydrosilylation of alkenes, with Mn2(CO)10 as a catalyst precursor, by using a ligand-tuned metalloradical reactivity strategy. This enables versatility and controllable selectivity with a 1:1 ratio of alkenes and silanes, and the synthetic robustness and practicality of this method are demonstrated using complex alkenes and light olefins. The selectivity of the reaction has been studied using density functional theory calculations, showing the use of an iPrPNP ligand to favour dehydrosilylation, while a JackiePhos ligand favours hydrosilylation. The reaction is redox-neutral and atom-economical, exhibits a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance, and is suitable for various synthetic applications on a gram scale. Methods for the dehydrosilylation of alkenes typically suffer from low selectivity and narrow scope. Now, the highly selective manganese-catalysed redox-neutral dehydrosilylation and hydrosilylation of alkenes has been achieved through ligand-tuned metalloradical activity. Whereas an electron-rich bidentate ligand promotes dehydrosilylation, hydrosilylation is the favoured pathway when using an electron-deficient phosphine ligand. DFT calculations have been carried out to understand the observed selectivity.},

  abstract     = {Gram-positive bacteria colonize mucosal tissues, withstanding large mechanical perturbations such as coughing, which generate shear forces that exceed the ability of non-covalent bonds to remain attached. To overcome these challenges, the pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes utilizes the protein Cpa, a pilus tip-end adhesin equipped with a Cys–Gln thioester bond. The reactivity of this bond towards host surface ligands enables covalent anchoring; however, colonization also requires cell migration and spreading over surfaces. The molecular mechanisms underlying these seemingly incompatible requirements remain unknown. Here we demonstrate a magnetic tweezers force spectroscopy assay that resolves the dynamics of the Cpa thioester bond under force. When folded at forces &amp;lt;6 pN, the Cpa thioester bond reacts reversibly with amine ligands, which are common in inflammation sites; however, mechanical unfolding and exposure to forces &amp;gt;6 pN block thioester reformation. We hypothesize that this folding-coupled reactivity switch (termed a smart covalent bond) could allow the adhesin to undergo binding and unbinding to surface ligands under low force and remain covalently attached under mechanical stress. Bacteria use thioester-bond-containing proteins to covalently bind to host surfaces and withstand large mechanical shocks. Now, thioester bond reactivity has been shown to be force-dependent: forces &amp;gt;35 pN inhibit bond cleavage by primary amine ligands, whereas forces &amp;lt;6 pN enable reversible reformation. This force-modulated thioester bond reactivity could potentially enable bacterial mobility and a route by which they optimize infection.},

Both processes are believed to be mediated by a biexcitonic triplet-pair state, 1(TT). Recently however, there has been debate over the role of 1(TT) in triplet–triplet annihilation. Here we use intensity-dependent, low-temperature photoluminescence measurements, combined with kinetic modelling, to show that distinct 1(TT) emission arises directly from triplet–triplet annihilation in high-quality pentacene single crystals and anthradithiophene (diF-TES-ADT) thin films. This work demonstrates that a real, emissive triplet-pair state acts as an intermediate in both singlet fission and triplet–triplet annihilation and that this is true for both endo- and exothermic singlet fission materials. The role of the biexcitonic triplet-pair state 1(TT) during triplet–triplet annihilation events in singlet-fission materials has been the subject of recent debate. Now, emissive 1(TT) states have been shown to be direct products of triplet–triplet annihilation in both endothermic and exothermic singlet-fission materials.},

Although examples of chemical recycling of polymers are known, few have been applied to materials derived from abundant commodity olefinic monomers, which are the building blocks of ubiquitous plastic resins. Here we describe a [2+2] cycloaddition/oligomerization of 1,3-butadiene to yield a previously unrealized telechelic microstructure of (1,n′-divinyl)oligocyclobutane. This material is thermally stable, has stereoregular segments arising from chain-end control, and exhibits high crystallinity even at low molecular weight. Exposure of the oligocyclobutane to vacuum in the presence of the pyridine(diimine) iron precatalyst used to synthesize it resulted in deoligomerization to generate pristine butadiene, demonstrating a rare example of closed-loop chemical recycling of an oligomeric material derived from a commodity hydrocarbon feedstock. Iron-catalysed [2+2] cycloaddition/oligomerization of neat butadiene affords (1,n′-divinyl)oligocyclobutane—a telechelic, crystalline material consisting of 1,3-enchained cyclobutyl units. This oligocyclobutane can be chemically recycled to pure butadiene using the same iron catalyst employed in its synthesis, demonstrating design principles for next-generation plastic materials that can be returned to pristine monomer.},

  abstract     = {The concept of aromaticity was originally defined as a property of unsaturated, cyclic planar organic molecules like benzene, which gain stability by the inherent delocalization of 4n + 2 π-electrons over the ring atoms. Since then, π-aromaticity has been observed for a large variety of organic and inorganic non-metal compounds, yet, for molecules consisting only of metal atoms, it has remained restricted to systems with three to five atoms. Here, we present the straightforward synthesis of a metal 12-ring that exhibits 2π-aromaticity and has a ring current much stronger than that of benzene (6π) and equivalent to that of porphine (26π), despite these organic molecules having (much) larger numbers of π-electrons. Highly reducing reaction conditions allowed access to the heterometallic anion [Th@Bi12]4−, with interstitial Th4+ stabilizing a Bi128− moiety. Our results show that it is possible to design and generate substantial π-aromaticity in large metal rings, and we hope that such π-aromatic heavy-metal cycles will eventually find use in cluster-based reactions. A wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds show π-aromaticity, yet for all-metal systems it has remained restricted to compounds with three to five atoms. Now, the anionic cluster [Th@Bi12]4− has been shown to exhibit π-aromaticity, with a significant ring current despite relying on the delocalization of only two π-electrons.},

Spatial and temporal control over drug activation in response to stimuli is a promising strategy to attenuate and circumvent these problems. Here we use ultrasound to activate drugs from inactive macromolecules or nano-assemblies through the controlled scission of mechanochemically labile covalent bonds and weak non-covalent bonds. We show that a polymer with a disulfide motif at the centre of the main chain releases an alkaloid-based anticancer drug from its β-carbonate linker by a force-induced intramolecular 5-exo-trig cyclization. Second, aminoglycoside antibiotics complexed by a multi-aptamer RNA structure are activated by the mechanochemical opening and scission of the nucleic acid backbone. Lastly, nanoparticle–polymer and nanoparticle–nanoparticle assemblies held together by hydrogen bonds between the peptide antibiotic vancomycin and its complementary peptide target are activated by force-induced scission of hydrogen bonds. This work demonstrates the potential of ultrasound to activate mechanoresponsive prodrug systems. Stimuli-responsive control of drug activation can mitigate issues caused by poor drug selectivity. Now, it has been shown that mechanical force—induced by ultrasound—can be used to activate drugs in three different systems. This approach has enabled the activation of antibiotics or a cytotoxic anticancer agent from synthetic polymers, polyaptamers and nanoparticle assemblies.},

  abstract     = {Hydroformylation, a reaction that installs both a C–H bond and an aldehyde group across an unsaturated substrate, is one of the most important catalytic reactions in both industry and academia. Given the synthetic importance of creating new C–C bonds, the development of carboformylation reactions, wherein a new C–C bond is formed instead of a C–H bond, would bear enormous synthetic potential to rapidly increase molecular complexity in the synthesis of valuable aldehydes. However, the demanding complexity inherent in a four-component reaction, utilizing an exogenous CO source, has made the development of a direct carboformylation reaction a formidable challenge. Here, we describe a palladium-catalysed strategy that uses readily available aroyl chlorides as a carbon electrophile and CO source, in tandem with a sterically congested hydrosilane, to perform a stereoselective carboformylation of alkynes. An extension of this protocol to four chemodivergent carbonylations further highlights the creative opportunity offered by this strategy in carbonylation chemistry. In an effort to extend the important hydroformylation reaction, a palladium-catalysed carboformylation reaction has now been developed in which two new carbon–carbon bonds are created across an alkyne. This modular reaction relies on a CO shuffling process and uses an acid chloride as a dual carbon and CO source.},

Here we report that Zn(ii) or Fe(ii) ions can be used to weave ligand strands to form a woven 3 × 3 molecular grid. We found that the process requires tetrafluoroborate anions to template the assembly of the interwoven grid by binding within the square cavities formed between the metal-coordinated criss-crossed ligands. The strand ends of the grid can subsequently be joined through within-grid alkene metathesis reactions to form a topologically trivial macrocycle (unknot), a doubly interlocked [2]catenane (Solomon link) and a knot with seven crossings in a 258-atom-long closed loop. This 74 knot topology corresponds to that of an endless knot, which is a basic motif of Celtic interlace, the smallest Chinese knot and one of the eight auspicious symbols of Buddhism and Hinduism. The weaving of molecular strands within a discrete layer by anion-template metal–ion coordination opens the way for the synthesis of other molecular knot topologies and to woven polymer materials. A combination of metal- and anion-template synthesis directs the weaving of molecular weft and warp strands in the assembly of a 3 × 3 interwoven grid.

  abstract     = {Scattering resonances play a central role in collision processes in physics and chemistry. They help build an intuitive understanding of the collision dynamics due to the spatial localization of the scattering wavefunctions. For resonances that are localized in the reaction region, located at short separation behind the centrifugal barrier, sharp peaks in the reaction rates are the characteristic signature, observed recently with state-of-the-art experiments in low-energy collisions. If, however, the localization occurs outside of the reaction region, mostly the elastic scattering is modified. This may occur due to above-barrier resonances, the quantum analogue of classical orbiting. By probing both elastic and inelastic scattering of metastable helium with deuterium molecules in merged-beam experiments, we differentiate between the nature of quantum resonances—tunnelling resonances versus above-barrier resonances—and corroborate our findings by calculating the corresponding scattering wavefunctions. Low-temperature scattering leads to the formation of quantum resonances or quasi-bound states, which are observable as peaks in the measured collision cross-sections. Now it has been shown that two different formation mechanisms, quantum tunnelling and quantum reflection, can be distinguished by measuring and comparing elastic and inelastic scattering, which probe the spatial localization of the resonance wavefunctions.},

It has previously been stabilized in L→C2←L compounds but the bonding situation of the central C2 in this motif differs remarkably from that of free C2. Here we have prepared and structurally characterized diatomic C2 as a monoligated complex L→C2 using a bulky phosphine ligand bearing two imidazolidin-2-iminato groups (L is (NHCR=N)2(CH3)P, where NHCR is an N-heterocyclic carbene). The compound is stable in solution at ambient temperature and has also been isolated in the solid state. Reactivity studies, in combination with quantum chemical analysis, suggest that the two carbon atoms of the L→C2 complex both have carbene character. The complex underwent intermolecular C–H bond activation upon thermolysis and exhibited hydroalkoxylation-like reactivity with methanol. Diatomic C2 is an elusive species that has only been indirectly observed in the gas phase. It had previously been stabilized in the condensed phase using two ligands, but now a monoligated L→C2 complex has been prepared with a bulky phosphine ligand (L) bearing two imidazolidin-2-iminato groups.

  abstract     = {Membrane proteins on the cell surface perform a myriad of biological functions; however, ligand discovery for membrane proteins is highly challenging, because a natural cellular environment is often necessary to maintain protein structure and function. DNA-encoded chemical libraries (DELs) have emerged as a powerful technology for ligand discovery, but they are mainly limited to purified proteins. Here we report a method that can specifically label membrane proteins with a DNA tag, and thereby enable target-specific DEL selections against endogenous membrane proteins on live cells without overexpression or any other genetic manipulation. We demonstrate the generality and performance of this method by screening a 30.42-million-compound DEL against the folate receptor, carbonic anhydrase 12 and the epidermal growth factor receptor on live cells, and identify and validate a series of novel ligands for these targets. Given the high therapeutic significance of membrane proteins and their intractability to traditional high-throughput screening approaches, this method has the potential to facilitate membrane-protein-based drug discovery by harnessing the power of DEL. A method to label membrane proteins with a DNA tag has been developed that enables the selection of DNA-encoded chemical libraries against endogenous membrane proteins on live cells. As a demonstration, a 30-million-compound DNA-encoded chemical library is screened against folate receptor, carbonic anhydrase 12 and epidermal growth factor receptor on live cells.},

  abstract     = {Electron transfer reactions facilitate energy transduction and photoredox processes in biology and chemistry. Recent findings show that molecular vibrations can enable the dramatic acceleration of some electron transfer reactions, and control it by suppressing and enhancing reaction paths. Here, we report ultrafast spectroscopy experiments and quantum dynamics simulations that resolve how quantum vibrations participate in an electron transfer reaction. We observe ballistic electron transfer (~30 fs) along a reaction coordinate comprising high-frequency promoting vibrations. Along another vibrational coordinate, the system becomes impulsively out of equilibrium as a result of the electron transfer reaction. This leads to the generation (by the electron transfer reaction, not the laser pulse) of a new vibrational coherence along this second reaction coordinate in a mode associated with the reaction product. These results resolve a complex reaction trajectory composed of multiple vibrational coordinates that, like a sequence of ratchets, progressively diminish the recurrence of the reactant state. Electronic–vibrational interplay can enable electron and energy transfer processes to be regulated. Now, coherence spectroscopy has been used to disentangle two vibrational pathways that control an electron transfer reaction. It has been shown that a fast, effectively ballistic, electron transfer along one vibrational path acts like a pulse to generate a coherent wavepacket along another vibrational pathway.},

This means that the connection of multi-step syntheses in a single machine to run many different protocols and reactions is not possible, as manual intervention is required. Here we show how the Chemputer synthesis robot can be programmed to perform many different reactions, including solid-phase peptide synthesis, iterative cross-coupling and accessing reactive, unstable diazirines in a single, unified system with high yields and purity. Developing universal and modular hardware that can be automated using one software system makes a wide variety of batch chemistry accessible. This is shown by our system, which performed around 8,500 operations while reusing only 22 distinct steps in 10 unique modules, with the code able to access 17 different reactions. We also demonstrate a complex convergent robotic synthesis of a peptide reacted with a diazirine—a process requiring 12 synthetic steps. Automated synthesis technologies are often highly specialized, focusing only on a narrow set of reaction classes. Now, solid-phase peptide synthesis, iterative Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling and diazirine chemistry have all been automated using the same universal platform architecture. A convergent 12-step synthesis demonstrates the utility of the reported Chemputer system.},

  abstract     = {Mechanophores can be used to produce strain-dependent covalent chemical responses in polymeric materials, including stress strengthening, stress sensing and network remodelling. In general, it is desirable for mechanophores to be inert in the absence of force but highly reactive under applied tension. Metallocenes possess potentially useful combinations of force-free stability and force-coupled reactivity, but the mechanistic basis of this reactivity remains largely unexplored. Here, we have used single-molecule force spectroscopy to show that the mechanical reactivities of a series of ferrocenophanes are not correlated with ring strain in the reactants, but with the extent of rotational alignment of their two cyclopentadienyl ligands. Distal attachments can be used to restrict the mechanism of ferrocene dissociation to proceed through ligand ‘peeling’, as opposed to the more conventional ’shearing’ mechanism of the parent ferrocene, leading the dissociation rate constant to increase by several orders of magnitude at forces of ~1 nN. It also leads to improved macroscopic, multi-responsive behaviour, including mechanochromism and force-induced cross-linking in ferrocenophane-containing polymers. Metallocenes are attractive mechanophores because they are stable in the absence of force, yet reactive under tension. Now, covalently bridging the two cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligands of ferrocenes embedded in a polymer has been shown to alter their mechanochemical reactivity, leading to a faster dissociation of the Fe–Cp bond, which occurs through a peeling mechanism rather than a shearing one.},

  abstract     = {Polyether ionophores are complex natural products capable of transporting cations across biological membranes. Many polyether ionophores possess potent antimicrobial activity and a few selected compounds have the ability to target aggressive cancer cells. Nevertheless, ionophore function is believed to be associated with idiosyncratic cellular toxicity and, consequently, human clinical development has not been pursued. Here, we demonstrate that structurally novel polyether ionophores can be efficiently constructed by recycling components of highly abundant polyethers to afford analogues with enhanced antibacterial selectivity compared to a panel of natural polyether ionophores. We used classic degradation reactions of the natural polyethers lasalocid and monensin and combined the resulting fragments with building blocks provided by total synthesis, including halogen-functionalized tetronic acids as cation-binding groups. Our results suggest that structural optimization of polyether ionophores is possible and that this area represents a potential opportunity for future methodological innovation. Polyether ionophores are natural products that display antibacterial activity—but they also show activity against mammalian cells, which has limited their development as clinical antibiotics. Now, a semisynthesis principle of recycling substructures from highly abundant natural polyether ionophores has been used to prepare analogues with enhanced selectivity towards bacterial cells.},

  abstract     = {Polymer mechanochemistry has traditionally been employed to study the effects of mechanical force on chemical bonds within a polymer backbone or to generate force-responsive materials. It is under-exploited for the scalable synthesis of wholly new materials by chemically transforming the polymers, especially products inaccessible by other means. Here we utilize polymer mechanochemistry to synthesize a fluorinated polyacetylene, a long-sought-after air-stable polyacetylene that has eluded synthesis by conventional means. We construct the monomer in four chemical steps on gram scale, which involves a rapid incorporation of fluorine atoms in an exotic photochemical cascade whose mechanism and exquisite stereoselectivity were informed by computation. After polymerization, force activation by ultrasonication produces a gold-coloured, semiconducting fluoropolymer. This work demonstrates that polymer mechanochemistry is a valuable synthetic tool for accessing materials on a preparative scale. Fluorinated polyacetylene has typically proven to be inaccessible using traditional polymer synthesis, but there is much interest in its predicted properties. Now, a mechanochemical unzipping strategy has succeeded in the synthesis of a gold-coloured, semiconducting fluorinated polyacetylene with improved stability in air compared to polyacetylene.},

  abstract     = {The efficient conversion of electricity to chemicals is needed to mitigate the intermittency of renewable energy sources. Driving these electrochemical conversions at useful rates requires not only fast electrode kinetics, but also rapid mass and ion transport. However, little is known about the effect of local environments on ionic flows in solid polymer electrolytes. Here, we show that it is possible to measure and manipulate the local pH in membrane electrolysers with a resolution of tens of nanometres. In bipolar-membrane-based gas-fed CO2 electrolysers, the acidic environment of the cation exchange layer results in low CO2 reduction efficiency. By using ratiometric indicators and layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte assembly, the local pH was measured and controlled within an ~50-nm-thick weak-acid layer. The weak-acid layer suppressed the competing hydrogen evolution reaction without affecting CO2 reduction. This method of probing and controlling the local membrane environment may be useful in devices such as electrolysers, fuel cells and flow batteries, as well as in operando studies of ion distributions within polymer electrolytes. Moving towards renewable energy sources requires pathways for efficiently converting electricity to chemicals, and gas-fed CO2 electrolysers show promise. Now, the layer-by-layer assembly of a weak-acid cation exchange layer has been shown to affect the local pH in a bipolar-membrane-based gas-fed CO2 electrolyser, improving the conversion efficiency of CO2 to CO by suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction.},

  abstract     = {Oxidative cyclizations create many unique chemical structures that are characteristic of biologically active natural products. Many of these reactions are catalysed by ‘non-canonical’ or ‘thwarted’ iron oxygenases and appear to involve long-lived radicals. Mimicking these biosynthetic transformations with chemical equivalents has been a long-standing goal of synthetic chemists but the fleeting nature of radicals, particularly under oxidizing conditions, makes this challenging. Here we use redox-neutral photocatalysis to generate radicals that are likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of lignan natural products. We present the total syntheses of highly oxidized dibenzocyclooctadienes, which feature densely fused, polycyclic frameworks that originate from a common radical progenitor. We show that multiple factors control the fate of the proposed biosynthetic radicals, as they select between 5- or 11-membered ring cyclizations and a number of different terminating events. Our syntheses create new opportunities to explore the medicinal properties of these natural products, while shedding light on their biosynthetic origin. Many biosynthetic cyclizations are catalysed by iron oxygenases and appear to involve long-lived radical species. Now, mimicking these biosynthetic transformations, the total synthesis of highly oxidized lignan natural products has been reported using redox-neutral photocatalysis to enable late-stage radical cyclizations that install challenging 5- and 11-membered rings.},

  abstract     = {DNA nanotechnology is an emerging field that promises fascinating opportunities for the manipulation and imaging of proteins on a cell surface. The key to progress is the ability to create a nucleic acid–protein junction in the context of living cells. Here we report a covalent labelling reaction that installs a biostable peptide nucleic acid (PNA) tag. The reaction proceeds within minutes and is specific for proteins carrying a 2 kDa coiled-coil peptide tag. Once installed, the PNA label serves as a generic landing platform that enables the recruitment of fluorescent dyes via nucleic acid hybridization. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach by recruiting different fluorophores, assembling multiple fluorophores for increased brightness and achieving reversible labelling by way of toehold-mediated strand displacement. Additionally, we show that labelling can be carried out using two different coiled-coil systems, with epidermal growth factor receptor and endothelin receptor type B, on both HEK293 and CHO cells. Finally, we apply the method to monitor internalization of epidermal growth factor receptor on CHO cells. A method for the covalent labelling of proteins by installing a biostable peptide nucleic acid (PNA) tag has now been developed. The PNA label serves as a generic landing platform that enables the recruitment of fluorescent dyes via nucleic acid hybridization and fluorophore removal by toehold-mediated strand displacement. Imaging of cell surface receptors, including internalized receptors, has been demonstrated using this approach.},

  abstract     = {Photoinduced charge-transfer is an important process in nature and technology and is responsible for the emergence of exotic functionalities, such as magnetic order for cyanide-bridged bimetallic coordination networks. Despite its broad interest and intensive developments in chemistry and material sciences, the atomic-scale description of the initial photoinduced process, which couples intermetallic charge-transfer and spin transition, has been debated for decades; it has been beyond reach due to its extreme speed. Here we study this process in a prototype cyanide-bridged CoFe system by femtosecond X-ray and optical absorption spectroscopies, enabling the disentanglement of ultrafast electronic and structural dynamics. Our results demonstrate that it is the spin transition that occurs first on the Co site within ~50 fs, and it is this that drives the subsequent Fe-to-Co charge-transfer within ~200 fs. This study represents a step towards understanding and controlling charge-transfer-based functions using light. Cyanide-bridged CoFe coordination networks exhibit photomagnetism because of coupled charge-transfer and spin transition. Now, femtosecond X-ray and optical absorption spectroscopies have enabled the electronic and structural dynamics of this light-induced process to be disentangled and show that it is the spin transition on the cobalt atom, occurring within ~50 fs, that induces the Fe-to-Co charge-transfer within ~200 fs.},
