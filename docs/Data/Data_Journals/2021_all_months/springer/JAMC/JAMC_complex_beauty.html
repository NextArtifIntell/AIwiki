  abstract     = {Entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) provide a general framework for quantum code construction, which overcome certain self-orthogonal restriction. It becomes one main task in quantum error-correction to find EAQECCs with good parameters, especially entanglement-assisted quantum maximum distance separable (EAQMDS) codes. In this work, we construct four new families of EAQECC codes with flexible parameters in view of negacyclic codes. It is worth pointing out that those EAQECCs are EAQMDS codes when $$d\le (n+2)/2$$ . By exploring the selection of defining sets, the constructed EAQECCs possess larger minimum distance in contrast with the known results in the literatures.},

It is then proved that the method is second-order uniformly convergent with respect to singular perturbation parameter, in discrete maximum norm.

The objective of this research is to propose two new iterative methods with inertial effect to solve equilibrium problems. These iterative methods are based on an extra-gradient method and a Mann-type iterative method. Two strong convergence theorems have been proved in the setting of real Hilbert space, with mild assumptions that the underlying bi-function is Lipschitz-type continuous and pseudo-monotone. The primary advantage of the second method is that it does not require the information of the Lipschitz-type bi-functional constants. We have also studied the applications of our research results to solve particular classes of equilibrium problems. Numerical studies are carried out to show the behaviour of proposed methods and to compare them with the existing ones in the literature.},

Fuzzy soft theory allows parametrization in the problems with vague data, as it inherits the properties of a fuzzy set and soft set simultaneously. This feature of fuzzy soft theory influenced us to represent the variation in competition that appears among the constituents of a system. This article presents the competition graph and economic competition graph in fuzzy soft theory; the fuzzy soft competition graph and fuzzy soft economic competition graph. Various extensions of the proposed graphs like fuzzy soft k-competition graphs, p-competition fuzzy soft graph and m-step fuzzy soft competition graphs have also been defined together with examples and some important results. An application to fuzzy soft economic competition graphs is provided that shows diverse competition among the wireless internet service providers of Malaysia. As there exist only a few mobile operators which facilitate the whole country with the wireless internet service, this competitive market structure is an oligopoly. The strength of oligopolistic (economic) competition is also manipulated. An algorithm is also established that evaluates the strength of any fuzzy soft economic competition among the sellers.},

These two strains of MRSA, referred to as staph, have been a serious problem in hospitals and it is known that they give rise to more deaths per year than AIDS. Hence, the transmission dynamics determining whether the CA-MRSA overtakes HA-MRSA is analyzed by means of a non-local fractional derivative. We show the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the fractional staph infection model through fixed-point theorems. Moreover, stability analysis and iterative solutions are furnished by the recursive procedure. We make use of the parameter values obtained from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Analysis of the model under investigation shows that the disease-free equilibrium existing for all parameters is globally asymptotically stable when both $${\mathscr {R}}_0^H$$ and $${\mathscr {R}}_0^C$$ are less than one. We also carry out the sensitivity analysis to identify the most sensitive parameters for controlling the spread of the infection. Additionally, the solution for the above-mentioned model is obtained by the Laplace-Adomian decomposition method and various simulations are performed by using convenient fractional-order $$\alpha $$ .},

The corresponding optimal control system with vaccination, awareness campaigns and treatment is further established and four different control strategies are compared by numerical simulations to contain hepatitis B. It is concluded that joint implementation of these measures can minimize the numbers of exposed and infectious individuals in the shortest time, so it is the most efficient strategy to curb the hepatitis B epidemic.

A deterministic nonlinear mathematical model that describes the co-infection dynamics of HIV and typhoid incorporating typhoid vaccine and treatment has been developed. The basic reproduction number for the co-infection model is computed. The co-infection model exhibits four steady states, namely, the disease-free, HIV alone endemic, typhoid alone endemic, and the co-infection endemic states. The local stability of the disease-free state has been investigated. The co-infection endemic state, if it exists, is found to be locally stable. The minimum vaccination rate that eliminates the typhoid infection is determined. Sensitivity analysis has been performed to ascertain model parameters that have a strong impact on the disease dynamics. It is demonstrated that the co-infection basic reproduction number can be reduced to below unity by simultaneous preventive measures, thereby eliminating both diseases. Numerical simulation of the co-infection model is carried out to examine the effects of parameters on disease spread. The study suggests that the two diseases need to be managed simultaneously for effective control of the co-infection.},

  abstract     = {To understand the effect of population pressure (demand of population for forestry trees and land) on the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide gas, a nonlinear model is formulated and analyzed. In formulating the model, four dynamical variables namely; concentration of carbon dioxide, human population, population pressure and forest biomass are considered. In the modeling process, it is assumed that the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide gas increases naturally as well as through anthropogenic emission. Further, it depletes naturally and due to its uptake by the forestry biomass. Moreover, it is assumed that both the human population and forestry biomass follow logistic growth and the population pressure reduces only the carrying capacity of forestry biomass, which decreases the absorption rate of $$\hbox {CO}_2$$ by forests. Feasibility and stability of equilibria are discussed. Analytical findings demonstrate that as deforestation rate due to human population crosses a critical value, the system destabilizes and oscillations arise through Hopf-bifurcation. Also, it is found that transcritical bifurcation takes place between two equilibria. Our analysis reveals that as the reduction rate coefficient due to population pressure increases, the forestry biomass decreases and the concentration of carbon dioxide increases. Numerical simulation is performed, which supports analytical findings. It is also noted that the dynamics of $$\hbox {CO}_2$$ is much affected by anthropogenic emissions but the impact of deforestation due to population pressure can not be ignored.},

  abstract     = {Malaria is a life-threatening mosquito-borne disease. It is transmitted through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. Malaria may be fatal if not treated promptly. Malaria is a major public health problem in India. Here we propose an SIRS model to study the transmission dynamics of malaria with saturated treatment. We assume that the mosquito population is growing logistically in the environment. Here we include a saturated type treatment function which is more suitable for the regions with limited resources. We discuss the existence and stability of different equilibria of the proposed model. We also compute the basic reproduction number $$R_0$$ which plays an important role in existence and stability of equilibria of the model. For $$R_0 &lt; 1$$ , backward bifurcation occurs, which suggests that lowering $$R_0$$ below one is not enough to eliminate the disease from the population. We estimate the key parameter corresponding to transmission of malaria using real data from different states of India by least square method. We also perform sensitivity analysis using PRCC to identify the key parameters which influence the infection prevalence of the disease and the basic reproduction number. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the analytic findings. Our numerical results suggest that infected population should get proper treatment and increase in the death rate of mosquito can also help to eradicate the malaria disease from the population.},

  abstract     = {Density dependent prey–predator systems under the impact of harvest are considered. The recruitment functions for both the prey and predator belong to the Deriso–Schnute family which allow us to study how the dynamical behaviour of both populations changes when compensatory density dependence turns overcompensatory. Depending on the degree of overcompensation, we show in the case of no harvest that an increase of the fecundity of the prey always acts in a destabilizing fashion. If the degree of overcompensation becomes sufficiently large, such an increase can lead to large amplitude chaotic oscillations of the prey, which actually may drive the predator population to extinction. The impact of harvest also depends on the degree of overcompensatory density dependence. If only the prey is the target population, increased harvest in general seems to stabilize the dynamics. On the other hand, harvesting only the predator may in some cases tend to stabilize dynamics, but there are also parameter regions where this turns out to be a strong destabilizing effect.},

Moreover, the convergence of the algorithms were established under suitable assumptions on the operator under consideration. In addition, numerical experiments were conducted on some benchmark test problems to depict the efficiency and competitiveness of the algorithms compared with existing algorithms.

  abstract     = {Wu et al. (Applied Mathematics and Computation 217(2011)8343-8353) constructed a gradient based iterative (GI) algorithm to find the solution to the complex conjugate and transpose matrix equation $$\begin{aligned} A_{1}XB_{1}+A_{2}\overline{X}B_{2}+A_{3}X^{T}B_{3}+A_{4}X^{H}B_{4}=E \end{aligned}$$ and a sufficient condition for guaranteeing the convergence of GI algorithm was given for an arbitrary initial matrix. Zhang et al. (Journal of the Franklin Institute 354 (2017) 7585-7603) provided a new proof of GI method and the necessary and sufficient conditions was presented to guarantee that the proposed algorithm was convergent for an arbitrary initial matrix. In this paper, a relaxed gradient based iterative (RGI) algorithm is proposed to solve this complex conjugate and transpose matrix equation. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence factor is determined to guarantee the convergence of the introduced algorithm for any initial iterative matrix. Numerical results are given to verify the efficiency of the new method. Finally, the application in time-varying linear system of the presented algorithm is provided.},

The detour index $$\omega (G)$$ of a connected graph G is defined as $$\omega (G)=\sum \nolimits _{{u,v}\subseteq V(G)}l_{G}(u,v)$$ , where $$l_{G}(u,v)$$ denotes the detour distance between vertices u and v.

Based on the perturbation technique, analytical solutions for flow rate and stream function are presented. This function and its velocity fields build a nonlinear dynamic system in two spatial dimensions. We are then interested in identifying the global and local bifurcation of the invariant curves in which the recurrent fluid dynamics close to the stagnation points change qualitatively. For this purpose, a geometric description, analytical expressions and the development of a computational algorithm are provided to recognize the multiplicity of admissible/virtual stagnation points. In a variety of physical parameters, the analysis highlights the presence of several types of nonlinear phenomena, such as infinite/finite heteroclinic and homoclinic orbits, saddle-node and border-collision bifurcations. These results guide the streamline patterns for capturing novel complex behaviors such as multiple trapping phenomena and critical transition to distinguish between different flow regions.},

This set theory which is a very successful mathematical model, especially as it handles information in three different aspects, was first introduced to the literature by Maji (Ann Fuzzy Math Inf 5(1):157–168, 2013) and later modified by Deli and Broumi (J Intell Fuzzy Syst 28(5):2233–2241, 2015). In this way, they aimed to use neutrosophic soft sets more effectively for uncertainty problems encountered in most real life problems. Relations are a method preferred by researchers to explain the correspondences between objects. In this paper, neutrosophic soft relationships are discuss and define by referring to the theory of neutrosophic soft set proposed by Deli and Broumi (Ann Fuzzy Math Inf 9:169–182, 2015). Then, we present the concepts of composition, inverse of neutrosophic soft relations and functions along with some related properties and theorems. Moreover, the equivalence classes and equivalence relations of soft relations are given with support from real life examples and some of their properties are analyzed. Finally, we propose an algorithm to be used in expressing the correspondence between objects in solving uncertainty problems by using the soft relationship defined and an example is given to show how this algorithm can be applied for uncertainty problems.},

In the case of algebras, the work constitutes a generalization to any algebra of the concept of hierarchy that Tian gave for a particular type of them, evolution algebras, via concepts of occurrence and persistence. This new hierarchy proves to be invariant under isomorphism of algebras, which leads to a necessary condition for two generic algebras to be isomorphic. Furthermore, the task of how to effectively obtain the hierarchy of an algebra is also discussed, arriving to the association of a certain type of graphs to generic algebras, which leads us to introduce new concepts, based in hierarchy, in graph theory.},

Bifurcation theory and center manifold theory are used to establish the conditions for the existence of these bifurcations. Moreover, existence of Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation of codimension 2 (i.e. two parameters must be varied for the occurrence of bifurcation) is exhibited. The non-degeneracy conditions are determined for occurrence of Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation. The extensive numerical simulation is performed to demonstrate the analytical findings.

The eigenvalues of Q(G) and $${{\mathcal {D}}}^Q(G)$$ will be denoted by $$q_{1} \ge q_{2} \ge \cdots \ge q_{n-1} \ge q_n$$ and $$\partial ^Q_1 \ge \partial ^Q_2 \ge \cdots \ge \partial ^Q_{n-1} \ge \partial ^Q_n$$ , respectively. A graph G which does not share its distance signless Laplacian spectrum with any other non-isomorphic graphs is said to be determined by its distance signless Laplacian spectrum. Characterizing graphs with respect to spectra of graph matrices is challenging. In literature, there are many graphs that are proved to be determined by the spectra of some graph matrices (adjacency matrix, Laplacian matrix, signless Laplacian matrix, distance matrix etc.). But there are much fewer graphs that are proved to be determined by the distance signless Laplacian spectrum. Namely, the path graph, the cycle graph, the complement of the path and the complement of the cycle are proved to be determined by the distance signless Laplacian spectra. In this paper, we establish Nordhaus–Gaddum-type results for the least signless Laplacian eigenvalue of graph G. Moreover, we prove that the join graph $$G\vee K_{q}$$ is determined by the distance singless Laplacian spectrum when G is a $$p-2$$ regular graph of order p. Finally, we show that the short kite graph and the complete split graph are determined by the distance signless Laplacian spectra. Our approach for characterizing these graphs with respect to distance signless Laplacian spectra is different from those given in literature.},

Matching numbers in a fuzzy graph are not only a direct tool in improving existing matching optimization algorithms, but also can be used to build optimization algorithms based on the vertices of a matching. Thus, introduce the properties of matching numbers which are useful in constructing and solving edge-fuzzy and vertex-fuzzy maximization problems.},

  abstract     = {Human mobility has been significantly influencing public health since time immemorial. A susceptible-infected-deceased epidemic reaction diffusion network model using asymptotic transmission rate is proposed to portray the spatial spread of the epidemic among two cities due to population dispersion. Qualitative behaviour including global attractor and persistence property are obtained. We also study asymptotic behaviour of the whole network with the help of asymptotic behaviour at individual cities. The epidemic model shows up two equilibria, (i) the disease-free, and (ii) unique endemic equilibria. An expression that can be used to calculate the basic reproduction number for heterogeneous environment, for the entire network is obtained. We use graph theory to analyze the global stability of our diffusive two-city model. We also performed bifurcation analysis and discovered that endemic equilibrium changes stability via Hopf bifurcations. A significant reduction in the number of infectives were observed when proper migration rate is maintained between the cities. Numerical results are provided to illuminate and clarify theoretical findings. Simulation experiments for two-dimensional spatial models show that infectious populations will increase if contact heterogeneity is increased, but it will decline if infective populations perform more local random movement. We observe that infection risk may be understated if the parameters used to estimate the basic reproduction number remains unchanged through space or time.},

Then, by means of a new inner product, the unconditional stability and convergence in the maximum norm of the derived high-order numerical method have been discussed rigorously using the energy method. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to test the convergence order in the temporal and spatial direction, respectively. To precisely demonstrate the computational efficiency of the derived high-order numerical method, the maximum norm error and the CPU time are measured in contrast with the second-order finite difference scheme for the same temporal grid size. Additionally, the derived high-order numerical method has been applied to solve and analyze the flow problem of an incompressible Oldroyd-B fluid with fractional derivative model bounded by two infinite parallel rigid plates.},

A set $$D\subseteq V$$ is called a semitotal dominating set of G if D is a dominating set and every vertex in D is within distance 2 from another vertex of D. For a given graph G, the semitotal domination problem is to find a semitotal dominating set of G with minimum cardinality. The decision version of the semitotal domination problem is shown to be NP-complete for chordal graphs and bipartite graphs. Henning and Pandey (Theor Comput Sci 766:46–57, 2019) proposed an $$O(n^2)$$ time algorithm for computing a minimum semitotal dominating set in interval graphs. In this paper, we show that for a given interval graph $$G=(V,E)$$ , a minimum semitotal dominating set of G can be computed in $$O(n+m)$$ time, where $$n=|V|$$ and $$m=|E|$$ .

  abstract     = {The aim of this work is to study global dynamics of target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) models and their solutions by nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) schemes. Firstly, we use comparison principles and the Lyapunov stability theory for ODEs to establish positivity, boundedness, local and global asymptotic stability of the TMDD models. Secondly, positivity-preserving NSFD schemes are proposed and their dynamical properties are analysed rigorously. Lastly, we perform a set of numerical simulations to support and illustrate the theoretical results and to show advantages of the NSFD schemes over standard ones. The results show that there is a good agreement between the numerical results and theoretical ones. In addition, the numerical simulations indicate that the constructed NSFD schemes are dynamically stable and efficient in replicating the complex dynamical properties of the continuous models.},

  abstract     = {In the spread of infectious diseases, media reports have played a positive role. However, in the process of game communication, there are not only positive but also negative media reports. Therefore, in this paper, we establish a model with positive and negative media reports to analyze the role of media reports in the process of game communication. First, we study its positivity and boundedness, and calculate the basic reproduction number $$R_{0}$$ under three different incidence rates. The existence and stability of the equilibria are proved. Secondly, the optimal control problem is studied by adding two dynamic variables of media reports. Finally, in the simulation we simulate the stability of the equilibria, so as to verify the correctness of the theory. Then the influence of media parameters on $$R_{0}$$ is analyzed. The numerical results of optimal control are simulated by forward and backward sweep method. By comparing the results of the optimal control and without control, the media coverage should be controlled according to the optimal control measures shown in this paper. The serious situation of game addiction will be greatly alleviated, which can reduce the infection rate by at least 90\%.},

The given finite element space consists of piecewise polynomial space $$P_3$$ and some bubble functions. Different from non- $$C^0$$ nonconforming scheme, a smoother discrete solution can be obtained by this method. Compared with the existed 16 freedoms finite element method, this scheme uses less freedoms. As the finite elements are not affine equivalent each other, the associated interpolating error estimation is technically proved by introducing another affine finite elements. With this space to solve biharmonic problem, the convergence analysis is demonstrated between true solution and discrete solution. Under a stronger hypothesis that true solution $$u\in H_0^2(\Omega )\cap H^4(\Omega )$$ , the scheme is of linear order convergence by the measurement of discrete norm $$\Vert \cdot \Vert _h$$ .

To reduce the smoothness requirement in time, the considered TFNWEs are equivalently transformed into their partial integro-differential forms by the Riemann–Liouville integral. Then, the first scheme is constructed by using piecewise rectangular formulas in time and the fourth-order approximation in space. And, this scheme can be fast evaluated by the sum-of-exponentials technique. The second scheme is developed by using the Crank–Nicolson technique combined with the second-order convolution quadrature formula. By the energy method, the convergence and unconditional stability of the proposed schemes are proved rigorously. Finally, numerical experiments are given to support our theoretical results.},

At the same time, the related limit method is also introduced as the continuous approximation derived from the iterative scheme. In the approximation interval, it is worth noting that the mean-square order of the parallel numerical iterative scheme can be kept consistent with the previous SRK method at any arbitrary time point, not just at discrete points.

Public environmental awareness may be a plausible factor for the control of toxicants in the aquatic medium. The present paper is devoted to study the impact of awareness among human on reduction of environmental toxins affecting planktonic system. The provision of awareness among people helps to maintain the ecological balance of the system by reducing the input rate of toxicants through anthropogenic sources. The conditions for existence and local asymptotic stability of all feasible steady states of the system are derived. Our study reveals that the system is stable for low or high input rate of toxicants, but for intermediate ranges, the system produces oscillations by destroying the stable dynamics. Moreover, for very large level of pollutants, zooplankton disappears from the system. Importantly, the limited supply of additional food to zooplankton prevents the crash of aquatic food web system. Sensitivity results evoke that environmental toxins can be reduced to a low level by imparting awareness among human, thereby maintaining the rhythm of the planktonic ecosystem.},

Then applying $$L1 - 2$$ formula for the Caputo time-fractional derivative and using a collocation method based on quadratic B-spline basic functions for the space discretization, we establish a higher accuracy numerical scheme which yields $$3-\alpha $$ order convergence in time and fourth-order convergence in space. Furthermore, the uniqueness of the numerical solution and the convergence of the algorithm are investigated. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to verify the theoretical order of accuracy and demonstrate the effectiveness of the new technique. Moreover, we also study the effect of different parameters on option price in time-fractional Black–Scholes model.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a mathematical model with a saturated treatment rate in the presence of information. We consider that the information about the disease affects the transmission rate of infection and hence the transmission rate is corrected. We also assume that people are losing their immunity against disease and the model is of SIRS type. We analyse the stability of the model system and our analysis shows that the model possesses the existence of backward bifurcation and multiple endemic steady states. The saturation in treatment is an important factor causing backward bifurcation. Various situations of multiple endemic steady states are explored numerically. We observe that our model shows existence of bi-stability via backward bifurcation, oscillations and hysteresis. Further, we extend the model to include the time lag in information and we find that in presence of time delay, the endemic steady state destabilizes and oscillations are observed. Thus, we conclude that if information dissemination is delayed beyond a threshold time then the infection oscillates in population and it may lead to difficulty in controlling the disease. Also, nonlinear incidence rate and saturated treatment may cause the existence of multiple endemic steady states and hence leads to complex dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Boreal forest in Canada has two main recurrent disturbances: one is fire and the other one is spruce budworm. The defoliation by spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) was first started in British Columbia of Canada in 1957 near Liard River. Budworm outbreaks were observed in the 1960’s to 1970’s and from the mid 1980’s to the present. Spruce budworm disturbance is one of the major issues of the forest management because of the potential losses of timber and non-timber resources in the boreal forest. To develop a sustainable management of the boreal ecosystem, mathematical modeling approaches for the budworm outbreak have been progressed. For this understanding, we propose a single species reaction-diffusion model appended with Holling type II functional response. In this paper, our main goal is to understand the spreading phenomenon of spruce budworm and subsequently identify its spreading velocity. In order to determine the spreading velocity, we focus on the one-dimensional traveling wave solutions of the model. Our results suggest that the minimal speed of traveling wave solutions can exhibit the spreading velocity of the spruce budworm in boreal forests.},

Awareness plays a vital role in understanding about causes factors of diabetes and its prevention. The world is not completely deterministic as there are biological fluctuations present within the population. With this motivation, we propose and analyze diabetes awareness models with human beings suffering from diabetes mellitus and introducing awareness programs driven by the media in deterministic as well as the stochastic environment. In this work, we investigate the effect of awareness programs on the prevalence of epidemiology of diabetes mellitus. The local stability analysis around the biologically feasible equilibrium point of both the model systems are investigated. The analytical results of the models are verified numerically by taking a set of biologically feasible parameter values.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a nonlinear mathematical model of illicit drug use in a population is studied using dynamical system theory. The work is largely concerned with the analysis of asymptotic behaviour of solutions to a six-dimensional system of differential equations modeling the influence of illicit drug use in the population. The model is mathematically well-posed based on positivity and boundedness of solutions. A key threshold which measures the potential spread of the illicit drug use in the population is derived analytically. The model is shown to exhibit forward bifurcation property, implying the existence, uniqueness and local stability of an illicit drug-present equilibrium. Furthermore, the global asymptotic dynamics of the model around the illicit drug-free and drug-present equilibria are extensively investigated using appropriate Lyapunov functions. Numerical simulations are carried out to complement the obtained theoretical results, and to examine the effects of some parameters, such as influence rate, rehabilitation rates of drug users and relapse rate, on the dynamical spread of illicit drug use in the population. Measures to guide against the menace of the illicit drug use are suggested.},

It takes account on the asymptomatic people and the strategies involving hospital isolation of the confirmed infected person, quarantine of people contacting them, and home containment of all population to restrict mobility. We establish a relationship between the containment control coefficient $$c_0$$ and the basic reproduction number $${\mathscr {R}}_0$$ . Different scenarios are tested with different values of $$c_0$$ , for which the stability of a Disease Free Equilibrium point is correlated with the condition linking $${\mathscr {R}}_0$$ and $$c_0$$ . A worst scenario in which the containment is not respected in the same way during the period of confinement leads to several rebound in the evolution of the pandemic. It is shown that home containment, if it is strictly respected, played a crucial role in controlling the disease spreading.},

Parameter variation experimentation suggests that a high cell-to-cell infection rate induces the chronic infection state in the host, whereas a high non-cytolytic cure rate positively contributes to the reduction of the viral load. We observe that a moderate cure rate under the exposure of a weak cell-to-cell transmission can effectively reduce the level of infection. Further, we examine the effect of cell-free transmission on the infection dynamics under the influence of cell-to-cell transmission. To substantiate our hypothesis, we present a case study of five HIV-1 infected patients to depict the primary HIV-1 infection dynamics in a real life scenario through model prediction.},

Let the semilinear control system of fractional order with delay as $$\begin{aligned} ^CD_\tau ^\alpha z(\tau )= &amp; {} Az(\tau )+Bv(\tau )+g(\tau ,z(\tau -h)),\;0\le \tau \le b;\\ z_0(\theta )= &amp; {} \phi (\theta ),\;\;\;\; \theta \in [-h,0]\\ z&#39;(0)= &amp; {} z_0. \end{aligned}$$ where $$1&lt;\alpha \le 2$$ , fractional Caputo derivative is denoted as $$^CD_{\tau }^\alpha $$ , time constant b is positive and finite. $$A:D(A)\subseteq X\rightarrow X$$ is a operator which is linear and closed having densed domain X and A is the infinitesimal generator of solution operator $${C_\alpha (\tau )}_{\tau \ge 0}$$ .

The operator $$B:Y\rightarrow Z$$ is linear and bounded. The function $$g:[0,b]\times X\rightarrow V$$ is purely nonlinear and satisfies Lipschitz continuity. We assumed that the fractional semilinear system without delay is approximate/exact controllable and by imposing some conditions on the range of the nonlinear term, we obtained the controllability results of the fractional semilinear system with delay. Approximate controllability of proposed problem is discussed under three different sets of assumptions. Exact controllability of proposed problem is also discussed.

Recently a new paradigm of Fractional Repetition (FR) codes has been introduced, in which, encoded data information is stored on distributed servers using an encoding involving a Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code and a Repetition code. In this work, we have considered FR codes with asymmetric parameters known as Generalized Fractional Repetition (GFR) codes. We have shown that any GFR code is equivalent to a hypergraph. Using the correspondence, the properties and the bounds of a hypergraph are directly mapped to the associated GFR code. In general, using the correspondence, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a GFR code is obtained. It is also shown that any GFR code associated with a linear hypergraph is universally good, and any locally repairable GFR code is associated with a class of non-linear hypergraph.},

A prey refuge was introduced in the healthy prey population to make the model more realistic. Various qualitative properties including local and global stability analysis of equilibrium points are investigated. The theoretical results are verified by numerical simulations.

Such an approach yields a nonlinear equation, where a second transformation is derived to linearize the expression. Consequently, this approach describes a procedure for finding the exact solutions of the hierarchy. A formula of the nth solution is provided, and to demonstrate its application, we discuss the solution to several members of the nonlinear hierarchy.},

  abstract     = {Cigarette smoking on college campuses has become a significant public health issue, which in turn led to an increasing focus on establishing programs to reduce its prevalence. In this paper, a compartmental model depicting the spread and cessation of the smoking habit on college campuses, obtained using theoretical principles often employed in mathematical epidemiology, is proposed and analysed. The existence and stability of the habitual smoking-free and habitual smoking-persistent equilibria, respectively, are explored in terms of a threshold parameter, hereby called the smokers generation number and denoted by $$R_c$$ . A sensitivity analysis indicates that $$R_c$$ is the most sensitive to the contact rate between habitual-smokers and occasional-smokers and to the rate of successfully quitting smoking. Numerical simulations of the proposed optimal control strategies reveal that the most effective approach to reduce the prevalence of cigarette smoking and possibly achieve a smoking-free campus should combine both control measures, namely allocating mandatory smoking rooms together with educating the public on the harmful effects of smoking and providing large scale guidance, counselling and support therapy to help students quit smoking.},

Furthermore, an exponential fitting factor is introduced in the derived new scheme using the theory of singular perturbations and an efficient ’discrete invariant imbedding algorithm’ is used to solve the resulting tridiagonal system of equations. Convergence of the method is analyzed. Numerical experiments performed on several test examples; presentation of the computational results in terms of maximum absolute errors and the comparison of the results with some other method results, show the applicability and efficiency of the proposed scheme.

  abstract     = {Globalization concepts for Newton-type iteration schemes are widely used when solving nonlinear problems numerically. Most of these schemes are based on a predictor/corrector step size methodology with the aim of steering an initial guess to a zero of f without switching between different attractors. In doing so, one is typically able to reduce the chaotic behavior of the classical Newton-type iteration scheme. In this note we propose a globalization methodology for general Newton-type iteration concepts which changes into a simplified Newton iteration as soon as the transformed residual of the underlying function is small enough. Based on Banach’s fixed-point theorem, we show that there exists a neighborhood around a suitable iterate $$x_{n}$$ such that we can steer the iterates—without any adaptive step size control but using a simplified Newton-type iteration within this neighborhood—arbitrarily close to an exact zero of f. We further exemplify the theoretical result within a global Newton-type iteration procedure and discuss further an algorithmic realization. Our proposed scheme will be demonstrated on a low-dimensional example thereby emphasizing the advantage of this new solution procedure.},

  abstract     = {This work is considered in the framework of studies dedicated to the control problems, especially in epidemiology where the scientist are concerned to develop effective control strategies to minimize the number of infected individuals. In this paper, we set this problem as an asymptotic target control problem under mixed state-control constraints, for a general class of ordinary differential equations that model the temporal evolution of disease spread. The set of initial data, from which the number of infected people decrease to zero, is generated by a new type of Lyapunov functions defined in the sense of viability theory. The associated controls are provided via selections of adequately designed feedback map. The existence of such selections is improved by using Micheal selection theorem. Finally, an application to the SIRS epidemic model, with numerical simulations, is given to show the efficiency of our approach. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one that used a set-valued approach based on the viability theory to deal with an epidemic control problem.},

  abstract     = {Mantle convection and melt migration are important processes for understanding Earth’s dynamics and how they relate to observations at the surface. Recently it has been established that melt migration can be modelled by coupling variable-viscosity Stokes flow and Darcy flow, where Stokes flow generally captures the long-term behaviour of the mantle and lithosphere, and Darcy flow models the two-phase regime. It is known that approximating the solution by finite element methods requires the use of mixed inf-sup stable elements or additional stabilization terms. Here, we propose a formulation with a coercive non-symmetric linear operator which allows the use of simple equal-order elements.},

It is known that there are difficulties in solving such systems by direct methods when the perturbation parameter, $$\varepsilon $$ , is small (MacLachlan and Madden in SIAM J Sci Comput 35(5):A2225–A2254, 2013). Therefore, iterative methods are natural choices. However, we show that, in two dimensions, the condition number of the coefficient matrix grows unboundedly when $$\varepsilon $$ tends to zero, and so unpreconditioned iterative schemes, such as the conjugate gradient algorithm, perform poorly with respect to $$\varepsilon $$ . We provide a careful analysis of diagonal and incomplete Cholesky preconditioning methods, and show that the condition number of the preconditioned linear system is independent of the perturbation parameter. We demonstrate numerically the surprising fact that these schemes are more efficient when $$\varepsilon $$ is small, than when $$\varepsilon $$ is $$\mathcal {O}(1)$$ . Furthermore, our analysis shows that when the singularly perturbed problem features no corner layers, an incomplete Cholesky preconditioner performs extremely well when $$\varepsilon \ll 1$$ . We provide numerical evidence that our findings extend to three-dimensional problems.},

An important special case that is considered in this paper is the thermal grooving that occurs when a grain boundary intersects the flat surface of a recently solidified metal slab giving rise to the formation of a thin symmetric groove. In case the transient surface diffusion is the main forming mechanism this yields a fourth-order time-dependent partial differential equation with unknown time-dependent surface diffusivity. In order to determine it, the profile of the free grooving surface at a fixed location is recorded in time. The grooving boundaries are supported by self-adjoint boundary conditions. We provide sufficient conditions on the input data for which the resulting coefficient identification problem is proved to be well-posed. Furthermore, we develop a predictor–corrector finite-difference spline method for obtaining an accurate and stable numerical solution to the nonlinear coefficient identification problem. Numerical results illustrate the performance of the inversion of both exact and noisy data.},

  abstract     = {Special number sequences play important role in many areas of science. One of them named as Fibonacci sequence dates back to 820 years ago. There is a lot of research on Fibonacci numbers due to their relation with the golden ratio and also due to many applications in Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Anthropology, Social Sciences, Architecture, Anatomy, Finance, etc. A slight variant of the Fibonacci sequence was obtained in the eighteenth century by Lucas and therefore named as Lucas sequence. There are very natural close relations between graph theory and other areas of Mathematics including number theory. Recently Fibonacci graphs have been introduced as graphs having consecutive Fibonacci numbers as vertex degrees. In that paper, graph theory was connected with number theory by means of a new graph invariant called $$\varOmega (D)$$ for a realizable degree sequence D defined recently. $$\varOmega (D)$$ gives information on the realizability, number of components, chords, loops, pendant edges, faces, bridges, connectedness, cyclicness, etc. of the realizations of D and is shown to have several applications in graph theory. In this paper, we define Lucas graphs as graphs having degree sequence consisting of n consecutive Lucas numbers and by using $$\varOmega $$ and its properties, we obtain a characterization of these graphs. We state the necessary and sufficient conditions for the realizability of a given set D consisting of n successive Lucas numbers for every n and also list all possible realizations called Lucas graphs for $$1 \le n \le 4$$ and afterwards give the general result for $$n \ge 5$$ .},
