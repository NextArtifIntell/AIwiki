  abstract     = {One of the most common tasks of groundwater engineers is to estimate aquifer parameters from transient time-drawdown data which are measured during the execution of pumping tests. The classical method consists in the manual superimposition of the observed time-drawdown data over a type-curve, and the appreciation of the goodness-of-fit is left to the visual inspection of the engineer. The present paper proposes a computerized method based on a new hybrid algorithm named CSARao-1. It combines two recent metaheuristic algorithms: the crow search algorithm (CSA) and Rao-1 algorithm for the optimal aquifer parameters estimation, which inherits the advantages of both algorithms. The CSARao-1 hybrid algorithm along with CSA and Rao-1 algorithm was applied in conjunction with both the Theis solution to analyze time-drawdown datasets coming from confined aquifers systems and the Hantush and Jacob solution to analyze datasets coming from leaky aquifers systems. The proposed approach was coded in FORTRAN programming language and evaluated on fourteen time-drawdown datasets coming from different confined and leaky aquifers systems. The results obtained using CSARao-1 hybrid algorithm were compared to those obtained by applying CSA and Rao-1 algorithm separately, and to those recently published. Globally, the proposed CSARao-1 hybrid algorithm was found to exhibit more accuracy, better robustness and higher rate of convergence over the analyzed transient time-drawdown datasets.},

  abstract     = {Sleep is important part for human health and quality of life in the daily routine basis. However, numerous individuals face sleep problems due to rapid changes occurred in both social and professional lifestyles. These problems can lead to several neurological and physical disorder diseases, and therefore, decrease their overall life quality. Machine learning methods for automated sleep stage classification (ASSC) are a fundamental approach to evaluate and treat this public health challenge. The main objective of this study is to propose a high-effective and high-accuracy based multiple sleep staging classification model based on single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using machine learning (ML) model. The proposed automated sleep staging system followed four basic stages: signal preprocessing, feature extraction and screening, classification algorithms, and performance evaluation. In this research work, a novel method is applied for signal preprocessing, feature screening and classification models. In signal preprocessing we obtain the wiener filter techniques for removing the different types of artifacts from input sleep recordings. In feature extraction, we obtain a total of 28 features based on both time and frequency domain features and non-linear features. The relevant features are screened through ReliefF weight feature selection algorithm, and eliminating the redundant features using Pearson correlation coefficients. The important contribution of this research work is establishes two layers an ensembling learning stacking model for classifying the multiple sleep stages. Three different subgroups of ISRUC-Sleep (SG-I/SG-II/SG-III) subjects sleep recordings having different health condition obtained for our proposed experimental work. Comparing with the recent contributions on sleep staging performances using single-channel EEG signals, it has found that our proposed ensemble learning stacking model was reported excellent in sleep staging classification accuracy performance for five sleep stages classification task (CT-5). The overall classification accuracy reported as 99.34\%, 90.8\%, and 98.50\% for SG-I, SG-II, and SG-III dataset, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a hybrid sunflower-teaching learning-based optimization (SFO-TLBO) algorithm has been proposed, integrating two well-known algorithms, namely sunflower optimization, and teaching–learning-based optimization. The proposed hybrid SFO-TLBO algorithm has been incorporated based on the ratio of the fitness value of the search agent and the average fitness value of the population. The SFO has more tendency of global exploration but has a problem of slow convergence speed. On the other hand, the convergence of the TLBO algorithm is fast, but it may get stuck in local optima. In this work, we have hybridized SFO with TLBO to take advantage of both the algorithms and also to balance the trade-off between exploitation and exploration. The proposed hybrid SFO-TLBO has been first applied to nineteen test benchmark functions. The outcomes have been compared with twelve state-of-the-art algorithms. In seventeen benchmark test functions, better performance has been achieved by the proposed hybrid SFO-TLBO. Also, the proposed hybrid SFO-TLBO algorithm has been used to solve an Internet of Vehicles (IoV) optimization problem and performance has been compared with fifteen state-of-the-art algorithms. In solving the IoV problem, hybrid SFO-TLBO has been achieved better performance in comparison with all fifteen considered algorithms which showcases the applicability of hybrid SFO-TLBO algorithm in resolving large-scale, real-world problems. In addition, for feature selection problems, a binary version of hybrid SFO-TLBO has been proposed, in which a wrapper approach is used to decide an optimal subset of features with a k-nearest neighbor classifier. The proposed binary method also determines an optimal value of k for the k-nearest neighbor classifier. The binary hybrid SFO-TLBO algorithm has been applied to the QSAR biodegradation dataset for classification, and for evidencing its efficiency, its performance has been compared with the other state-of-the-art algorithms. The results of the proposed approach are quite encouraging, and an average accuracy of 89.10\% has been achieved.},

  abstract     = {The k-nearest neighbor (kNN) rule is one of the best-known distance-based classifiers, and is usually associated with high performance and versatility as it requires only the definition of a dissimilarity measure. Nevertheless, kNN is also coupled with low-efficiency levels since, for each new query, the algorithm must carry out an exhaustive search of the training data, and this drawback is much more relevant when considering complex structural representations, such as graphs, trees or strings, owing to the cost of the dissimilarity metrics. This issue has generally been tackled through the use of data reduction (DR) techniques, which reduce the size of the reference set, but the complexity of structural data has historically limited their application in the aforementioned scenarios. A DR algorithm denominated as reduction through homogeneous clusters (RHC) has recently been adapted to string representations but as obtaining the exact median value of a set of string data is known to be computationally difficult, its authors resorted to computing the set-median value. Under the premise that a more exact median value may be beneficial in this context, we, therefore, present a new adaptation of the RHC algorithm for string data, in which an approximate median computation is carried out. The results obtained show significant improvements when compared to those of the set-median version of the algorithm, in terms of both classification performance and reduction rates.},

However, the dermatologists can diagnose skin lesion diseases by carefully examining the high-quality images at their clinics or from a distance area. Further, the computerized automatic diagnostic system may assist primary health professionals for quick and accurate diagnosis of these skin diseases. Thus, there is a need for medical image processing and analysis of skin lesion images to enhance their visibility properties. An efficient and effective skin lesion detection and identification software tool will provide a better classification system and may enhance the automation of skin lesion diagnosis. In this work, detection of skin lesions from human skin images is conducted by utilizing three image processing segmentation methodologies namely—Edge Detection using Ant Colony Optimization, Color Space-based Thresholding, Genetic Algorithm-based Segmentation and FCM-Based Image Segmentation. In order to quantitatively collate the working of three techniques, the entropy values of skin lesion images are considered. Application of FCM-based Segmentation yields in far better attribute of skin lesion images as compared to Genetic Algorithm-based Segmentation, Edge Detection using Ant Colony Optimization and Color Space-based Thresholding.},

  abstract     = {The cervical cancer patient’s death rate can be minimized by accurate and early detection of cervical cancer (CC). One of the popular techniques called the Pap test or Pap smear is widely used for the early detection of CC. In the instance of CC detection, the manual analysis took more time. Existing approaches had a number of drawbacks, including low accuracy, increased computational complexity, higher feature dimensionality, poor reliability, and increased time consumption due to poor hyperparameter optimization. In this paper, we proposed MASO-optimized DenseNet 121 architecture for the early detection of cervical cancer. At first, different kinds of augmentation techniques such as horizontal flip, vertical flip, zooming, shearing, height shift, width shift, rotation, and brightness increase the number of training samples. The Mutation-based Atom Search Optimization (MASO) algorithm is established to optimize the hyperparameters in DenseNet 121 architecture such as the number of neurons in the dense layer, learning rate value, and the batch sizes. The proposed method effectively optimizes the hyperparameters inherent in the DenseNet 121 architecture, resulting in improved classification results while reducing computational complexity and data overfitting. Different kinds of performance metrics such as accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precisions, recall, F-score, and confusion matrix evaluate the performance of MASO-optimized DenseNet 121 architecture for CC detection. A single normal class with three abnormal classes, namely Carcinoma, Light dysplastic, and Sever dysplastic, was selected from the Hervel dataset for experimental investigation. The proposed MASO-optimized DenseNet 121 architecture achieves 98.38\% accuracy, 98.5\% specificity, 98.83\% sensitivity, 98.58\% precision, 99.3\% recall, and 98.25\% F-score values than other existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic since March 2020 by the World Health Organization. It consists of an emerging viral infection with respiratory tropism that could develop atypical pneumonia. Experts emphasize the importance of early detection of those who have the COVID-19 virus. In this way, patients will be isolated from other people and the spread of the virus can be prevented. For this reason, it has become an area of interest to develop early diagnosis and detection methods to ensure a rapid treatment process and prevent the virus from spreading. Since the standard testing system is time-consuming and not available for everyone, alternative early screening techniques have become an urgent need. In this study, the approaches used in the detection of COVID-19 based on deep learning (DL) algorithms, which have been popular in recent years, have been comprehensively discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of different approaches used in literature are examined in detail. We further present the databases and major future challenges of DL-based COVID-19 detection. The computed tomography of the chest and X-ray images gives a rich representation of the patient’s lung that is less time-consuming and allows an efficient viral pneumonia detection using the DL algorithms. The first step is the preprocessing of these images to remove noise. Next, deep features are extracted using multiple types of deep models (pretrained models, generative models, generic neural networks, etc.). Finally, the classification is performed using the obtained features to decide whether the patient is infected by coronavirus or it is another lung disease. In this study, we also give a brief review of the latest applications of cough analysis to early screen the COVID-19 and human mobility estimation to limit its spread.},

These emissions, due to physicochemical conditions, can interact with each other, resulting in additional pollutants such as ozone.

This research aims to correlate, through soft computing techniques, namely Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Programming, the data of the tumours recorded by the Local Health Authority of the city of Benevento, in Italy, with those of the pollutants detected in the air monitoring stations. Such stations can monitor many pollutants, i.e. NO2, CO, PM10, PM2.5, O3 and Benzene (C6H6). Assuming possible effects on human health in the medium term, in this work we treat the data relating to pollutants from the 2012–2014 period while, the tumour data, provided by local hospitals, refer to the time interval 2016–2018. The results show a high correlation between the cases of lung tumours and the exceedance of atmospheric particulate matter and ozone. The explicit genetic programming knowledge representation allows also to measure the relevance of each considered pollutant on human health, evidencing the major role of PM10, NO2 and O3.},

  abstract     = {Consolidation settlement is a phenomenon happens in saturated fine-grained soils when subjected to change in effective stress. Consolidation settlement is often determined using the compressibility parameters, the compression index ( $$Cc$$ ) and the recompression index $$(Cr$$ ). However, there is lack of studies on the accuracy of the empirical correlations to predict the recompression index ( $$Cr$$ ). In addition, no study has been concerned with the development of region-specific correlations to predict the recompression index of fine-grained soils in middle and north of Iraq. Thus, this research has been conducted to fill these gaps by collecting and testing of 350 undisturbed samples, assessing the available empirical correlations and developing of novel region-specific data-driven correlations to predict the recompression index $$(Cr$$ ) using the evolutionary polynomial regression analysis (EPR-MOGA). The tests include the soil unit weight, specific gravity, water content, Atterberg limits and recompression index. The statistical assessment involved calculating the mean absolute error ( $$MAE$$ ), root mean square error ( $$RMSE$$ ), mean ( $$\mu )$$ , percentage of predictions within error range of ± 30\% ( $$P30$$ ) and coefficient of correlation ( $$R$$ ). In addition, 80\% of the data has been used in the EPR-MOGA model training while 20\% of data has been used to test (validate) the model accuracy. The results illustrate that all of the available correlations provide an average prediction of the recompression index with $$R$$ ranges between 0.12 and 0.70, $$MAE$$ ranges between 0.01 and 0.03, $$RMSE$$ ranges between 0.020 and 0.030, $$\mu$$ ranges between 0.26 and 1.73 and\% $$P30$$ ranges between 0 and 61\%. However, the new EPR-MOGA correlations showed much better prediction capabilities, where the best EPR-MOGA correlation scored $$R$$ , $$MAE$$ , $$RMSE$$ , $$\mu$$ and $$P30$$ of 0.90, 0.01, 0.008, 1.05 and 82\%, respectively, for training data and 0.88, 0.01, 0.009, 1.02 and 86\%, respectively, for testing data. The new EPR-MOGA correlations require only the saturated unit weight, water content and void ratio of the soil to accurately predict the $$Cr$$ .},

  abstract     = {Gender classification system is an automated, challenging, and efficacious system due to the analogous vision of males and females with handwriting. Gender classification is a binary problem that is based on physiological and behavioral biometric traits. It is widely used for forensic-based investigations, autopsy determination, suspected areas, and questioned documents. The proposed study has been considered for the behavioral biometric trait, i.e., handwriting in the Gurumukhi script. The novelty of this study can be seen from the three perspectives, i.e., hybridization of feature extraction techniques, principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and hybridization of classification techniques. Zoning, Diagonal, Transition, and Peak Extent-based feature extractions were implemented followed by their hybridization. The classification techniques such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting classifiers were experienced with the hybridized approach using a majority voting scheme. Also, the comparison and critical analysis of gender classification accuracy with CPU elapsed time has also been presented before and after implementing PCA. There are many novel ideas for the researchers such as gender classification through online handwriting, prediction of age, personality, state, nationality, and stress prediction through handwriting, and further gender classification problem can be enhanced to third or trans-gender too using handwriting as a biometric modality. The system can be implemented with many other Indic scripts and presenting novel track in the handwriting-based researches.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection is referred to a process in which the aim is to detect data points that follow a different pattern from the majority of data points. With the rapid development of computer technology, protecting networks from various threats such as network intruders is becoming crucial. Traditional anomaly detection methods suffer from several well-known challenges that hinder their performance, such as the curse of high dimensionality. Autoencoders are unsupervised neural networks that have been used for the purpose of reducing dimensionality and also detecting network anomalies in large datasets. The performance of autoencoders debilitates when the training set contains noise and anomalies. In this paper, a new gradient-reversal method is proposed to overcome the influence of anomalies on the training phase for the purpose of detecting network anomalies. The method is different from other approaches as it does not require an anomaly-free training set and is based on reconstruction error. Once latent variables are extracted from the network, local outlier factor is used to separate normal data points from anomalies. A simple pruning approach and data augmentation are also added to improve performance further. The experimental results show that the proposed model can outperform other well-known approaches.},

  abstract     = {Macular edema (ME) is an essential sort of macular issue caused due to the storing of fluid underneath the macula. Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are the two customary visual contaminations that can lead to fragmentary or complete vision loss. This paper proposes a deep learning-based predictive algorithm that can be used to detect the presence of a Subretinal hemorrhage. Region Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and faster R-CNN are used to develop the predictive algorithm that can improve the classification accuracy. This method initially detects the presence of Subretinal hemorrhage, and it then segments the Region of Interest (ROI) by a semantic segmentation process. The segmented ROI is applied to a predictive algorithm which is derived from the Fast Region Convolutional Neural Network algorithm, that can categorize the Subretinal hemorrhage as responsive or non-responsive. The dataset, provided by a medical institution, comprised of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of both pre- and post-treatment images, was used for training the proposed Faster Region Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN). We also used the Kaggle dataset for performance comparison with the traditional methods that are derived from the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm. The evaluation results using the Kaggle dataset and the hospital images provide an average sensitivity, selectivity, and accuracy of 85.3\%, 89.64\%, and 93.48\% respectively. Further, the proposed method provides a time complexity in testing as 2.64s, which is less than the traditional schemes like CNN, R-CNN, and Fast R-CNN.},

Numerous MADM methods such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE), and several others well-known methods proven to have rank reversal problems. In this paper, we study the rank reversal problem for a recent MADM method that is known as Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS). As far as we know, there is no study that considers the rank reversal problem in the WASPAS. In this paper, rank reversal problems in WASPAS are analyzed empirically by considering different types of rank reversals. After detailed computational experiments, we show that rank reversal problems also exist in WASPAS when classical normalization techniques are utilized. We also show through extensive computational experiments by using different problem instances that rank reversal problems can be avoided in WASPAS when modified Max and Max–Min normalization techniques are used.},

Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is a typical prevention reliability analysis method. However, there are some drawbacks in traditional FMEA method. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a hybrid risk evaluation method, which combines picture fuzzy sets (PFSs), the PF-linear programming model (PF-LPM) method and the PF-weighted aggregated sum product assessment (PF-WASPAS) method. We adopt PFSs to evaluate risks of products. In order to overcome drawback of the traditional distance between PFSs, some new distance measures between PFSs based on the Dice similarity and the Jaccard similarity are proposed by us. The PF-LPM method which considers the subjective weights of risk factors and calculates synthetical deviation with the Dice similarity-based distance is utilized to calculate the weights of risk factors. Moreover, the PFWA operator and the PFWG operator are used by us to fuse experts’ evaluation information. Then, the PF-WASPAS method is utilized to rank failure modes. Finally, an illustrative example with respect to pallet exchange rack is introduced, and the rationality, effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method are verified by a discussion and comparison.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy grey cognitive maps (FGCMs) have been widely adopted to support cause-and-effect decision-making under uncertainty. However, capturing the information for the initial state vector and the relationship matrix from various specialists can be cumbersome, which may affect the convergence of FGCMs or cause them to reach a chaotic state. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel group decision approach based on the combination of grey clustering (GC) and fuzzy grey cognitive maps for assessing causal relationships in uncertain environments. The main contribution consists in applying GC as a mean to obtain the initial state vector from the relationship matrix data. This halves the required inputs to the users, reducing uncertainty in the computational model. Also, the proposition brings a method for aggregating the linguistic judgements of multiple decision-makers when assessing causal relationships. The proposition also differs from others in the literature by providing results with lower imprecision levels, named greyness, and lower number of required iterations for the FGCM-based system to converge. A real application was conducted in a technology start-up to test the approach to practical implications. Results allowed the identification of important elements regarding the company’s profile and performance, aiding prioritization and enabling the development of action plans. This paper also includes a comparison of other representative models with the proposed approach, which led to more accurate results. Hence, this study addresses the need for new alternatives to improve the reliability and convergence of FGCM-based systems. Finally, suggestions for future applications are proposed.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning based on convolutional neural network (CNN) has been successfully applied to stereo matching as it can accelerate the training process and improve the matching accuracy. However, the existing stereo matching framework based on CNN often has two problems. The first problem is the generalization ability of training model. Stereo matching frameworks are usually pre-trained on a large synthetic Scene Flow dataset and then fine-tuned on evaluation dataset. However, the evaluation dataset may contain trivial training data or even do not have disparity label for some specified tasks. This adversely affects the generality of the training model. The second problem is the poor matching performance in ill-posed regions. It is difficult to distinguish the ill-posed regions, including weak texture area, repeated texture area, occlusion area, reflection structure, and fine structure, etc. To ameliorate the aforementioned problems, we propose the cost volume enhancement network (CVE-Net) guided by sparse features for stereo matching. CVE-Net use the edge information and saliency information for sparsely sampling the precise disparity labels during training. Furthermore, we enhance the cost volume by leveraging the precise disparity sparse label information to guide the direction of training. The experiment shows that the generalization ability is significantly improved. The domain-transferring problem on the new dataset is significantly alleviated. In addition, introducing the sparse multiple semantic features improves the matching performance in the ill-posed regions. Even without fine-tuning, the matching requirements can be met. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CVE-Net.},

Second, the differential evolution and whale optimization algorithm are employed to generate the offspring for the leadership and ordinary solutions, respectively.

In the present article, we introduce a novel FS algorithm, GWNO, to tackle this challenge. The novelty of GWNO stems from combining the powers of both grey wolf optimization (GWO) and rough set theory (RST). GWO is used to search for a minimal feature subset just enough to describe the IHIS, whereas RST is used to design a clever fitness function to guide the search. For validation, GWNO was implemented and heavily tested with a kNN classifier, using seven publicly available IHISs of dimensionalities ranging from 10s of features to 2000+ features. For each IHIS, GWNO first selected the important features and then submitted those features to kNN for classification. The test results were highly impressive, with FS ending in less than 10 iterations and classification accuracy reaching 99\%. For performance evaluation, GWNO was compared to eight recently published algorithms of its category on the same seven IHISs. It outperformed them all, in terms of FS speed, number of features selected, and classification accuracy. Specifically, it ended FS first, selected up to 77\% less features, and achieved with those fewer features a classification accuracy higher than the competitors.

In this paper, for the first time, we introduce two such new hybrid uncertain variables—random type-2 trapezoidal (RT2TF) and gamma fuzzy (RT2GF) variables, their derandomization and defuzzification methods, and applications. Mimicking two-stage public distribution system of the developing countries, breakable multi-item two-stage fixed-charge four-dimensional transportation problems (MITSFC-4DTPs) are formulated and solved. Here, some breakable items are transported from sources to destinations via warehouses using some conveyances, traveling through connecting routes and incurring transportation costs and fixed charges at each stage. The objective is to find suitable conveyances, appropriate travel routes, and corresponding transported amounts at each stage so that total transportation cost is minimum. The model’s parameters—transportation costs, fixed costs, availabilities, demands, and conveyances’ capacities are considered as RT2TF and RT2GF. The models’ random type-2 fuzzy objectives and constraints are first derandomized using expectation and probability chance constraint techniques, respectively. The reduced type-2 fuzzy models are transformed into type-1 fuzzy problems by the CV-based reduction technique (CV-bRT), which are then converted to deterministic ones using two methods—generalized credibility measures (GCM) theory and centroid techniques (trapezoidal fuzzy problem only) separately. All these deterministic models are solved by the generalized reduced gradient (GRG) method using LINGO 12.0 and numerically illustrated. A real-life problem and several particular models under different uncertain environments are solved using some input data. Results from two CV-based methods—CV-bRT-GCM and CV-bRT-centroid for type-2 fuzzy, are compared, and superiority of proposed CV-bRT-GCM is established. In 4DTPs, the importance of multi-routes is numerically illustrated. Some managerial insights are also presented.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to present a novel approach for computing two-player constant-sum matrix games laid on the notion of a “symbolic proportional” linguistic term set. It is not always possible to lay assessments based on uniformly and symmetrically distributed linguistic term sets; hence, the defined concept motivates the decision-makers to represent their opinions using 2-tuples composed of two proportional linguistic terms. The proportional 2-tuple linguistic representation of payoffs concerns linguistic labels, which do not certainly have to be symmetrically distributed or do not have the conventional prerequisite of having uniform distance among them. This representation confers an opportunity to describe the linguistic payoffs of a matrix game using members of a continuous linguistic scale domain. In our work, we have defined a two-player constant-sum proportional linguistic matrix game and proposed an approach of Proportional Linguistic Linear Programming (PLLP) to evaluate these game problems. The framed PLLP problem is then transformed into a crisp LPP that can be easily solved, decreasing the computation complexities involved in solving the linguistic decision-making problems. This perspective of proportional 2-tuples provides decision-makers an approach to represent their opinions not by just using one label, rather by proportional linguistic labels of the form $$(\delta u_i,\,\gamma u_{i+1})$$ , where $$u_i$$ and $$u_{i+1}$$ are two successive linguistic terms, with $$0\le \delta ,\,\gamma \le 1$$ and $$\delta \,+\,\gamma \,=\,1$$ . Besides, some test examples are also presented to show the consistency of our designed approach. Further, the PLLP formulation is utilized to solve a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making problem based on actual-time linguistic data.},

  abstract     = {To solve engineering problems with evolutionary algorithms, many expensive function evaluations (FEs) are required. To alleviate this difficulty, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have attracted increasingly more attention in both academia and industry. Most existing SAEAs either waste computational resources due to the lack of accuracy of the surrogate model or easily fall into the local optimum as the dimension increases. To address these problems, this paper proposes an adaptive surrogate-assisted particle swarm optimization algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, a surrogate model is adaptively selected from a single model and an ensemble model by comparing the best existing solution and the latest obtained solution. Additionally, a model output criterion based on the standard deviation is suggested to improve the stability and generalization ability of the ensemble model. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, 10 benchmark functions with different modalities from 10 to 50 dimensions are tested, and the results are compared with those of five state-of-the-art SAEAs. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs well for most benchmark functions within a limited number of FEs. Moreover, the performance of the proposed algorithm in solving engineering problems is verified by applying the algorithm to the PX oxidation process.},

  abstract     = {Parameter-free algorithms are of an increasing interest in applications that require out-of-the-box solving techniques. For instance, scheduling in volatile environments or control parameters optimisation often requires flexible solving approaches without the need to tune or retune the parameters. In addition, parameter-free algorithms are usually beneficial in solving previously unexplored real-world problem instances. In this paper, we propose a parameter-free local search strategy to solve graph colouring, which is the underlying problem for a number of scheduling applications. Two variants of parameter-free local search are computationally investigated: PFLS-A and PFLS-B. Both of these algorithms are based on accepting strictly improving moves and operating as a random walk if no strictly improving move is found. PFLS-A and PFLS-B differ in randomised versus systematic exploration of the neighbourhood of the current solution. Their cooperative variant CPFLS is also proposed. We compare the results of these three algorithms to the results obtained by 13 other local search methods from the literature. CPFLS provides better or equal results as the other local search algorithms in $$67.25\%$$ of per-instance comparisons. This is without employing any explicit or implicit parameters that are usually used in metaheuristics. This hints the promising nature of parameter-free metaheuristics not only for this problem but also metaheuristics in general.},

Researchers usually use fuzzy clustering algorithms for image preprocessing. The fuzzy c-means (FCM) method is easy to implement, so it is the most widely used and more successful among many fuzzy clustering algorithms. However, the algorithm is highly sensitive to randomly initialized cluster centers, and the final result is highly likely to be a local optimal value. Therefore, we use quantum-inspired ant lion optimizer (QALO) to optimize FCM clustering method and propose an efficient hybrid clustering algorithm called QALOFCM. The UCI dataset is used as an experimental dataset to testify the clustering effect of the method and compare and analyze the clustering results with other well-known clustering algorithms. The algorithm is designed to perform image segmentation experiments on Simulated Brain Database. The final comparative experiment can draw a conclusion that the hybrid method can not only be effectively used for fuzzy clustering, but also can be effectively applied in image segmentation.},

Firstly, the concept of PDIVq-ROFG is given and some basic terms, such as complement, self-complement, bridge, degree and total degree, are discussed.

In this, we split our system into two parts such that the actuator fault function had only occurred in the second state vector of nonlinear dynamics. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory and appropriate inequality, some sufficient criteria in the form of linear matrix inequalities are obtained to ensure the bounded stability for the prescribed $$H_{\infty }$$ performance level. In addition, the designed algorithm for actuator fault is further applied for sensor fault.

In most of the real-life scheduling practices, unexpected and unknown events occur frequently, which necessitates solving operations and maintenance scheduling problems dynamically. Dynamic events like new order arrival, machine breakdown, changes in due date, order cancellation, and urgent order are considered in this study. Moreover, order acceptance/rejection decisions and an order review release mechanism are also taken into account in order to enhance the overall performance by adjusting capacity regarding to customer due date requirements. Four objectives namely mean tardiness, schedule instability, makespan, and mean flow time are considered within a lexicographic programming logic. Random test instances are generated for the stated dynamic scheduling problem. In order to confirm the applicability of the proposed GRASP-based algorithm, extensive experiments were also conducted on well-known job shop scheduling benchmark instances and flexible job shop scheduling benchmark instances with preventive maintenance activities. Computational experiments conducted under various experimental settings such as flexibility level and due date tightness in addition to different preventive maintenance policies. To the best of our knowledge, the present study presents the first attempt through GRASP for simultaneous dynamic scheduling of operations and preventive maintenance activities in flexible job shops. Results of the extensive computational experiments demonstrate that simultaneous scheduling of manufacturing operations and preventive maintenance activities is a viable and effective approach for performance improvement in dynamic flexible job shop scheduling environments.},

  abstract     = {The use of regression methods, for instance, linear regression, decision tree regression, etc., has been used earlier to build software fault prediction (SFP) models. However, these methods showed limited SFP performance with higher misclassification errors. In previous works, issues such as multicollinearity, feature scaling, and imbalance distribution of faulty and non-faulty modules in the dataset have not been considered reasonably, which might be a potential cause behind the poor prediction performance of these regression methods. Motivated from it, in this paper, we investigate the impact of 15 different regression methods for the faults count prediction in the software system and report their interpretation for fault models. We consider different fault data quality issues, and a comprehensive assessment of the regression methods is presented to handle these issues. We believe that many used regression methods have not been explored before for the SFP by considering different data quality issues. In the presented study, 44 fault datasets and their versions are used that are collected from the PROMISE software data repository are used to validate the performance of the regression methods, and absolute relative error (ARE), root mean square error (RSME), and fault-percentile-average (FPA) are used as the performance measures. For the model building, five different scenarios are considered, (1) original dataset without preprocessing; (2) standardized processed dataset; (3) balanced dataset; (4) non-multicollinearity processed dataset; (5) balanced+non-multicollinearity processed dataset. Experimental results showed that overall kernel-based regression methods, KernelRidge and SVR (Support vector regression, both linear and nonlinear kernels), yielded the best performance for predicting the fault counts compared to other methods. Other regression methods, in particular NNR (Nearest neighbor regression), RFR (Random forest regression), and GBR (Gradient boosting regression), are performed significantly accurately. Further, results showed that applying standardization and handling multicollinearity in the fault dataset helped improve regression methods’ performance.

  abstract     = {In the manufacturing sector, the section that has attained the most demand is metal forming. Most traditional methods in the manufacturing industry are not flexible, thus opted for the single point incremental forming (SPIF) method. However, it encompasses a geometric deviation issue. The prediction of geometric deviation and optimal parameter selection is more tedious in the existing works. In order to trounce these issues, this paper proposes a modified adaptive neuro-fuzzy inferences system (MANFIS)-centred geometric deviation prediction and enhanced squirrel search algorithm (ESSA)-centred optimal parameter selection for SPIF in AA2024-O aluminium alloy sheets. The proposed methodology encompasses &#39;3&#39; sections. Initially, the SPIF designing is performed in which truncated cone shape is chosen and inputted into Computer-Aided Designs/Computer-Aided Manufacturing software. Next, the designed shape is constructed and coordinate-measuring machines gauges the geometric metrics. Therefore, to envisage the geometric deviations, the measured geometric values are rendered as the input to the MANFIS. If the deviation is presented, then the ESSA algorithm chooses the optimal initial parameters, and that selected parameters are suggested to the SPIF design. The minimum roundness deviation together with the position deviation is fixed as the Fitness Function in ESSA. The AA2024-O aluminium alloy sheet is taken for the experimental investigation. In addition, the proposed method&#39;s performance is contrasted with prevailing methods centred on statistical metrics and MSE, which exhibits that the proposed methods outweigh the prevailing methods. A better result is attained by the proposed works when analogized to the existent methods by obtaining values of 97.90\%, 96.78\%, 95.84\%, 96.23\%, and 0.017\% for accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure along with mean error.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a fuzzy portfolio selection problem with systematic risk and non-systematic risk simultaneously. These two kinds of risks are measured by beta coefficient and random error variance obtained by Sharp Single Index Model. The total risk as the objective of portfolio decision is obtained by weighting the two kinds of risk. Among them, the weight of systematic risk $$\lambda$$ is regarded as the degree of investors&#39; attention to system risk in economic sense. In addition, the fuzzy return and the degree of diversification are measured by triangular fuzzy number and entropy, respectively. And they are also considered the goal of investment decisions. Hence, a tri-objective portfolio is proposed in this paper. For the fuzzy objectives in the model, a goal programming method based on fuzzy dominance is proposed, which can help investors better capture the ideal point of fuzzy returns according to their risk preference. Finally, combined with the systematic impact of COVID-19 on the financial market, we make an empirical analysis based on our proposed model. The results show that the total risk will be on the high side when $$\lambda$$ value is too large or too small. That means paying too much or little attention to the systematic risk will lead investors to bear more risk. In addition, when investors ignore the systematic risk; that is, the $$\lambda$$ value is low, and investors will concentrate their funds in the same industry.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the hedging effectiveness of crude oil futures on the basis of the lower partial moments (LPMs). An improved kernel density estimation method is proposed to estimate the optimal hedge ratio. We investigate crude oil price hedging by contributing to the literature in the following twofold: First, unlike the existing studies which focus on univariate kernel density method, we use bivariate kernel density to calculate the estimated LPMs, wherein the two bandwidths of the bivariate kernel density are not limited to the same, which is our main innovation point. According to the criterion of minimizing the mean integrated square error, we derive the conditions that the optimal bandwidths satisfy. In the process of derivation, we make a distribution assumption locally in order to simplify calculation, but this type of local distribution assumption is far better than global distribution assumption used in parameter method theoretically and empirically. Second, in order to meet the requirement of bivariate kernel density for independent random variables, we adopt ARCH models to obtain the independent noises with related to the returns of crude oil spot and futures. Genetic algorithm is used to tune the parameters that maximize quasi-likelihood. Empirical results reveal that, at first, the hedging strategy based on the improved kernel density estimation method is of highly efficiency, and then it achieves better performance than the hedging strategy based on the traditional parametric method. We also compare the risk control effectiveness of static hedge ratio vs. time-varying hedge ratio and find that static hedging has a better performance than time-varying hedging.},

The optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process by taking three objectives in pressure management into consideration. Knowledge-assisted learning is incorporated into the reinforcement learning framework (KA-RL) to help evaluate the state value and guide the design of reward function, since the proposed KA-RL framework leverages the notion that historical data of WDNs could be utilized to produce optimal trajectories with respect to parametric variations. The knowledge-assisted proximal policy optimization (KA-PPO) algorithm, which only uses nodal pressure data, is proposed based on the KA-RL framework to address the arbitrary WDN topology and time-varying water demand. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm are illustrated by virtue of the 22-node network with two pumps in a pump station. Empirical results demonstrate that KA-PPO works well in practice and compares favorably to Nelder–Mead method.},

Then, we propose a novel binary GWO algorithm (named SetGWO), which is based on set encoding and uses set operations in its updating strategy. The proposed algorithm uses a completely different encoding scheme that eliminates the need for the transfer function and boundary checking, and also uses lower-dimensional agents; therefore, decreases the running time. Also, by using an exclusive exploration set for each agent, defining a different distance measure and an encircling strategy in discrete spaces, the quality of solutions has been improved. Experimental results on different real-world combinatorial optimization problems and datasets show that SetGWO outperforms other existing binary GWO algorithms in terms of quality of solutions, running time, and scalability.},

  abstract     = {Superalloys are categorized as difficult to process materials with a broad spectrum of applications in industries. Process modeling and optimization of WEDM performances on nickel- and titanium-based superalloys are widely investigated. However, such investigations on iron-based superalloy are still lacking and hence probed in the present article. Thus, the paper targets modeling the correlation between the performance parameters and the control parameters with two popular techniques: response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) for WEDM of a typical iron-based superalloy, i.e., A286 superalloy. A comparison between the model estimates and the experimental values is made to check ANN and RSM&#39;s prediction accuracy. The estimates by the ANN model are exact and consistent with the experimental results. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test is performed to perceive the degree of statistical significance of parameters. Moreover, a novel two-stage procedure, i.e., MOEA/D in collaboration with TOPSIS method, is implemented to search the optimal condition for process performances. The quality of Pareto-optimal solutions acquired using MOEA/D is compared to that of Pareto-optimal solutions obtained using NSGA II, PESA II, and MMOPSO through the use of a hypervolume (HV) parameter. Wilcoxon’s test is performed to identify the statistical difference between MOEA/D and competing algorithms. The optimal parametric combination recommended by the proposed optimization approach is Ton = 130 µs, Toff = 52 µs, Ipeak = 12 A, Wf = 5 m/min and SV = 30 V. The proposed optimization technique can also be exploited in other manufacturing processes.},

This paper addresses a joint daily route and speed optimization problem in home health care (HHC) with the constraints of synchronized visits and carbon emissions. In this work, the aim is to design a reasonable logistics route with the objective of minimizing the carbon emissions, which has a linear relationship with fuel consumption. This goal can reduce environmental pollution while optimizing operating costs for the HHC company. This paper formulated the problem as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and used the Gurobi solver to solve the MIP model with a time limit of 1 h. However, the method based on the MIP model is difficult to solve large-scale instances. Therefore, this paper proposed an ant colony optimization (ACO)-based heuristic approach improved by local search for this problem with large-scale instances. The minimal carbon emissions of each route is calculated by a dynamic programming (DM) algorithm. We designed three kinds of experiments to test the proposed approach, including the basic vehicle routing problem with time window (VRPTW), the studied problem with one speed and the studied problem with two speeds. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Balancing the convergence and the diversity is one of the crucial researches in solving multi-objective problems (MOPs). However, the optimization algorithms are inefficient and require massive iterations. The convergence accuracy and the distribution of the obtained non-dominated solutions are defective in solving complex MOPs. To solve these problems, a novel adaptive multi-objective particle swarm optimization using a three-stage strategy (tssAMOPSO) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an adaptive flight parameter adjustment is proposed to manage the states of the algorithm, switching between the global exploration and the local exploitation. Then, the three-stage strategy, including adaptive optimization, decomposition, and Gaussian attenuation mutation, is conducted by population in each iteration. The three-stage strategy remarkably promotes the diversity and efficiency of the optimization process. Furthermore, the convergence analysis of three-stage strategy is provided in detail. Finally, particles are equipped with memory interval to improve the reliability of personal best selection. In the maintenance of external archive, the proposed fusion index can enhance the quality of non-dominated solutions directly. A series of benchmark instances, ZDT and DTLZ test suits, are used to verify the performance of tssAMOPSO. Several classical and state-of-the-art algorithms are employed for experimental comparisons. Experimental results show that tssAMOPSO outperforms the other algorithms and achieves admirable comprehensive performance.},

To find properties of the gH-Clarke derivative, the concepts of limit superior, limit inferior, and sublinear interval-valued functions are studied in the sequel. It is proved that the upper gH-Clarke derivative of a gH-Lipschitz continuous interval-valued function (IVF) always exists. For a convex and gH-Lipschitz IVF, the upper gH-Clarke derivative is found to be identical with the gH-directional derivative. It is observed that the upper gH-Clarke derivative is a sublinear IVF. Several numerical examples are provided to support the entire study.},

However, there are more and more demands for the automatic blanking and loading, and it is necessary to solve the problem of object pose estimation in changing accommodation space. This paper proposes a method for pose estimation in the accommodation space using alpha-shape algorithm and improved fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA). The alpha-shape volume variety of object and measured space is set to the objective function, and the pose variety of object is set to six variables of improved FOA. The experiments were performed by setting parameters of improved FOA and considering the four space types represented the common accommodation shapes. Compared with previous work using convex hull, the new study using alpha-shape algorithm not only keeps the object in the accommodation space, but also maintains the object pose which is at the bottom of the space and can meet the practical requirement of object placement by robot arms.},

  abstract     = {Reentry trajectory optimization is a critical optimal control problem for reusable launch vehicle (RLV) with highly nonlinear dynamic characteristics and complex constraints. In this paper, a hybrid parallel Harris hawks optimization (HPHHO) algorithm is proposed to address the problem. HPHHO aims to enhance the performance of existing Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm by three strategies including oppositional learning, smoothing technique and parallel optimization mechanism. At the beginning of each iteration, the opposite population is calculated from the current population by the oppositional learning strategy. Following that, the individuals in the two populations are arranged in ascending order on the basis of the fitness function values, and the top half of the resulting population is selected as the initial population. The selected initial population is divided into two equal subpopulations which are assigned to the differential evolution and the HHO algorithm, respectively. The both algorithms operate in parallel to search and update the solutions of each subpopulation simultaneously. Then the solutions are smoothed for each iteration by the smoothing technique to reduce fluctuations. As a result, the optimal solution obtained by the parallel optimization mechanism avoids falling into local optima. The performance of HPHHO is evaluated by 4 CEC 2005 benchmark functions and 3 constrained continuous optimal control problems, showing better efficiency and robustness in terms of performance metrics, convergence rate and stability. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective, practical and feasible in solving the RLV reentry trajectory optimization problem.},

Most clustering algorithms have complications like automatic cluster number determination, poor clustering precision, inconsistent clustering of various datasets and parameter-dependent, etc. A new fuzzy autonomous solution for clustering named Meskat-Mahmudul (MM) clustering algorithm was proposed to overcome the complexity of parameter-free automatic cluster number determination and clustering accuracy. The Meskat-Mahmudul clustering algorithm finds out the exact number of clusters based on the average silhouette method in multivariate mixed attribute dataset, including real-time gene expression dataset and missing values, noise, and outliers. Meskat-Mahmudul Extended K-Means (MMK) clustering algorithm enhances the K-Means algorithm, which serves the purpose of automatic cluster discovery and runtime cluster placement. Several validation methods are used to evaluate clusters and certify optimum cluster partitioning and perfection. Some datasets are used to assess the performance of the proposed algorithms to other algorithms in terms of time complexity and clustering efficiency.

However, these customizations of topic modeling are limited by the cumbersome derivation of a specific inference algorithm for each modification. In this paper, we propose a new supervised topic modeling approach for document classification problems, Neural Labeled LDA (NL-LDA), which builds on the VAE framework, and designs a special generative network to incorporate prior information. The proposed model can support semi-supervised learning based on the manifold assumption and low-density assumption. Meanwhile, NL-LDA has a consistent and concise inference method while semi-supervised learning and predicting. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate our model has outstanding performance on supervised document classification relative to the compared approaches, including traditional statistical and neural topic models. Specially, the proposed model can support both single-label and multi-label document classification. The proposed NL-LDA performs significantly well on semi-supervised classification, especially under a small amount of labeled data. Further comparisons with related works also indicate our model is competitive with state-of-the-art topic modeling approaches on semi-supervised classification.},

  abstract     = {Nontraditional manufacturing processes (NTMPs) bring the processing capabilities such as machining high strength and hard materials with desired accuracies and surface finish to the manufacturing companies. Therefore, there has been a significant increase in the use and number of NTMPs. Hence, choosing a particular NTMP for a specific application turns out to be a complex decision-making problem, which involves conflicting qualitative and quantitative ranking criteria. In recent NTMP ranking literature, it is noted that fuzzy approaches are better suited for handling uncertainties and incomplete information that exist within the NTMP ranking environment. This paper introduces such a fuzzy approach using the hesitant fuzzy preference selection index (PSI) method for the assessment of the criteria weights and the hesitant fuzzy correlation coefficient principle for ranking and recommending the most appropriate NTMP for a specific application. The proposed methodology and its efficiency in dealing with incomplete information under the fuzzy decision-making environment are explored with a case study. As a result of the study, the proposed model preferred the electron beam machining (EBM) as the most suitable nontraditional manufacturing process. On the other hand, triangular fuzzy TOPSIS methods offered the electrochemical machining (ECM) as the best choice among the alternatives. The differences among the ranking decisions are also analyzed in the paper. It can be concluded from the authors’ various applications of the proposed hesitant fuzzy PSI method that it is extremely effective in representing fuzzy decision-making environments in NTMP ranking decisions.},

To contribute to this area, this paper applies a topological concept called “somewhere dense sets” to improve the approximations and accuracy measure in rough set theory. We firstly discuss further topological properties of somewhere dense and cs-dense sets and give explicitly formulations to calculate S-interior and S-closure operators. Then, we utilize these two sets to define new concepts in rough set context such as SD-lower and SD-upper approximations, SD-boundary region, and SD-accuracy measure of a subset. We establish the fundamental properties of these concepts as well as show their relationships with the previous ones.

Previous studies on FPA assume fixed parameter values based on empirical observations or experimental comparisons of limited scale and scope. In this study, a comprehensive effort is made to identify appropriate values of the FPA parameters that maximize its computational performance. To serve this goal, a simple non-iterative, single-stage sampling tuning method is employed, oriented towards practical applications of FPA. The tuning method is applied to the set of 28 functions specified in IEEE-CEC’13 for real-parameter single-objective optimization problems. It is found that the optimal FPA parameters depend significantly on the objective functions, the problem dimensions and affordable computational cost. Furthermore, it is found that the FPA parameters that minimize mean prediction errors do not always offer the most robust predictions. At the end of this study, recommendations are made for setting the optimal FPA parameters as a function of problem dimensions and affordable computational cost.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a GPU-accelerated implementation of an image encryption algorithm. The algorithm uses the concepts of a modified XOR cipher to encrypt and decrypt the images, with an encryption pad, generated using the shared secret key and some initialization vectors. It uses a genetically optimized pseudo-random generator that outputs a stream of random bytes of the specified length. The proposed algorithm is subjected to a number of theoretical, experimental, and mathematical analyses, to examine its performance and security against a number of possible attacks, using the following metrics - histogram analysis, correlation analysis, information entropy analysis, NPCR and UACI. The performance analysis carried out shows an average speedup-ratio of 3.489 for encryption, and 4.055 for decryption operation, between the serial and parallel implementations using GPU. The algorithm aims to provide better performance benchmarks, which can significantly improve the experience in the relevant use-cases, like real-time media applications.},

One of the most popular strategies to solve such problems is nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms which have presented promising solutions in different fields. The JAYA algorithm is an innovative and promising technique for solving a wide range of optimization problems. Hence, this investigation provides a new hybrid algorithm based on JAYA and crow search algorithm (CSA), known as HJCSA, to enhance its performance. In other words, the mechanism of updating position in CSA is integrated with JAYA algorithm to reinforce the convergence and search capabilities of JAYA algorithm. The proposed hybrid algorithm is evaluated through solving 20 well-known benchmark functions, and obtained results are compared with various up-to-date algorithms, including CSA, JAYA, particle swarm optimization (PSO), dragonfly algorithm (DA), grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), moth-flame optimization (MFO), and sine–cosine algorithm (SCA). In addition, a real-world engineering problem is optimized by the proposed optimization approach and compared with other published works. The results showed that the suggested optimization algorithm is much more vigorous in escaping from local minima, possessing better convergence, and discovering more accurate solutions.},

  abstract     = {Grey wolf optimization (GWO) is a meta-heuristic inspired by the social hierarchy and the hunting behaviors observed in wolves. The GWO algorithm has been successfully applied in many fields, such as finance, engineering and industry. However, the GWO has the disadvantages that it is prone to stagnate in local solutions, and the convergence may be slower. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we re-analyzed the hunting behaviors of wolves and observed that there are very frequent communications between leaders and ω-type wolves during the hunting process. This process is called judging prey. Based on this observation, we propose an improved optimization algorithm, termed decision-making grey wolf optimization algorithm (DGWO). At variance with the original GWO, DGWO includes four steps, instead of three: searching for prey, judging prey, encircling prey and attacking prey. The algorithm is tested using 29 well-known benchmark functions and traveling salesman problem, and compared with the GWO algorithm, as well as to the existing improved algorithms random walk grey wolf optimization and modified grey wolf optimization. Results show that including the judging prey stage in DGWO results in a faster convergence and it effectively prevents the algorithm to stop in local optima.},

Six different well-known benchmark functions have been used to test the performances of the developed algorithm. The proposed algorithm has better performance to reach the global optimum of the objective function which has many local minimums. The proposed algorithm improved the KH and CKH optimization algorithms&#39; performances which already exist in the literature. Proposed novel CKH has been applied to rubber bushing stiffness optimization which is a real automotive industry problem. Obtained results have been compared with KH, CKH, genetic algorithm (GA), differential evaluation algorithm (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The proposed algorithm has better performance to reach the global optimum of the objective function. The performance and validity of the algorithm have been proved not only by using six different benchmark functions but also by using finite element analysis of rubber bushing.

  abstract     = {Recently, the slime mould algorithm (SMA) has become popular in function optimization, because it effectively uses exploration and exploitation to reach an optimal solution or near-optimal solution. However, the SMA uses two random search agents from the whole population to decide the future displacement and direction from the best search agents, which limits its exploitation and exploration. To solve this problem, we investigate an adaptive approach to decide whether opposition-based learning (OBL) will be used or not. Sometimes, the OBL is used to further increase the exploration. In addition, it maximizes the exploitation by replacing one random search agent with the best one in the position updating. The suggested technique is called an adaptive opposition slime mould algorithm (AOSMA). The qualitative and quantitative analysis of AOSMA is reported using 29 test functions that consisting of 23 classical test functions and 6 recently used composition functions from the IEEE CEC 2014 test suite. The results are compared with state-of-the-art optimization methods. Results presented in this paper show that AOSMA’s performance is better than other optimization algorithms. The AOSMA is evaluated using Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test. It also ranked one in Friedman’s mean rank test. The proposed AOSMA algorithm would be useful for function optimization to solve real-world engineering problems.},

This algorithm is similar to particle swarm optimization, but it works differently. The algorithm is very powerful and has better results compared to other common metaheuristic algorithms. This paper aims at improving the performance of FDO; thus, the chaotic theory is used inside FDO to propose chaotic FDO (CFDO). Ten chaotic maps are used in the CFDO to consider which of them are performing well to avoid local optima and finding global optima. New technic is used to conduct population in specific limitation since FDO technic has a problem to amend population. The proposed CFDO is evaluated by using 10 benchmark functions from CEC2019. Finally, the results show that the ability of CFDO is improved. Singer map has a great impact on improving CFDO, while the Tent map is the worst. Results show that CFDO is superior to GA, FDO, and CSO. Both CEC2013 and CEC2005 are used to evaluate CFDO. Finally, the proposed CFDO is applied to classical engineering problems, such as pressure vessel design and the result shows that CFDO can handle the problem better than WOA, GWO, FDO, and CGWO. Besides, CFDO is applied to solve the task assignment problem and then compared to the original FDO. The results prove that CFDO has better capability to solve the problem.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes an intelligent hybridization between the multi-level cross-entropy optimizer (MCEO) and moth-flame optimization (MFO) algorithms to keep a good compromise between exploration and exploitation. The proposed hybrid multi-level cross-entropy-based moth-flame (MCMF) algorithm uses MCEO as a global search engine during the first phase of the optimization process that allows for fast approximation of the global best position (BP). The boundaries of the search space are then adaptively confined within the effective region around the current BP by applying the proposed search space boundaries confining factor (SSBCF). The modified MFO with two different moth generation patterns is then employed as a local search engine to simultaneously probe for new and proper BPs within the confined and overall search space. This prevents MCMF from becoming trapped in local optima while maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation. The hybridization between both algorithms allows MCMF to accelerate throughout the early steps of the search process using the high exploration ability of MCEO, whereas, in the later stages of optimization, promising solutions will possess a high probability to be exploited using the higher exploitation power of MFO in the confined space. The competence of the MCMF is compared with other well-known state-of-the-art algorithms on 15 unconstrained benchmark functions and 5 constrained engineering design problems having a wide range of dimensions and varied complexities. The statistical results on the benchmark functions and the solved engineering examples verify that the proposed algorithm can provide very competitive and promising results. The results demonstrate the comprehensive superiority of the hybrid MCMF compared to both MCEO and MFO in terms of fewer function calls, high escaping ability from local optima, and fast convergence speed.},

To address the issues, the discrete adaptive search whale optimization algorithm is proposed. First, we present the obstacle-avoiding distance estimation method to provide precise task scenario information and reduce the computational complexity. Then, the crossover-based updating method is presented to enable the algorithm to solve discrete problems such as task assignment. In addition, the search intensity adaptive mechanism is presented to optimize and balance the exploration and exploitation intensities in the solution space reasonably, thereby achieving high-quality task assignment results quickly. Further, joint leadership mechanism and local search mechanism are proposed to enhance the exploration ability of the algorithm.

Whenever a new algorithm is proposed, its exploration, exploitation and convergence capabilities are tested; however, in this study, it is highlighted that a metaheuristic should also exhibit invariance to function translation/shifting. Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is a well-reputed and highly referred algorithm in the literature; however, we find that its performance is strongly affected under certain circumstances involving function shifting. Our analysis reveals that WOA performs really well when the global optimum is situated at the origin ( $$0, 0, \ldots , 0$$ ); on the contrary, the performance amazingly degrades whenever the global optimum is situated away from the origin. Moreover, in most cases, our findings reveal that the performance degradation is directly proportional to the distance of the global optimum from the origin. Furthermore, the root cause of the problem is discovered and discussed. Finally, it is suggested how WOA can be made shift-invariant.},

  abstract     = {Defect prediction is a technique introduced to optimize the testing phase of the software development pipeline by predicting which components in the software may contain defects. Its methodology trains a classifier with data regarding a set of features measured on each component from the target software project to predict whether the component may be defective or not. However, suppose the defective information is not available in the training set. In that case, we need to rely on an alternate approach that uses the training set of external projects to train the classifier. This approached is called cross-project defect prediction. Bad code smells are a category of features that have been previously explored in defect prediction and have been shown to be a good predictor of defects. Code smells are patterns of poor development in the code and indicate flaws in its design and implementation. Although they have been previously studied in the context of defect prediction, they have not been studied as features for cross-project defect prediction. In our experiment, we train defect prediction models for 100 projects to evaluate the predictive performance of the bad code smells. We implemented four cross-project approaches known in the literature and compared the performance of 37 smells with 56 code metrics, commonly used for defect prediction. The results show that the cross-project defect prediction models trained with code smells significantly improved $$6.50\%$$ on the ROC AUC compared against the code metrics.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose two deep learning-based architectures tailored for gas identification and quantification, which automatically tune hyper-parameters of the network for optimal performance. The immense success of deep learning in the field of computer vision and natural language processing inspired us to design deep learning-based gas identification and quantification network. The first architecture is proposed for gas quantification, which is based on 1D-CNN. It makes use of raw time-series gas sensor array data and provides the concentration of each gas in a mixture of gases. The second architecture is presented for gas quantification, which is based on a deep belief network combined with drift-aware feature adaptation strategy. The proposed models identify and quantify the gases with improved accuracy despite the presence of sensor drift. Additionally, hyper-parameters of both the networks are automatically tuned for optimal performance. Although several pattern recognition methods related to machine learning, fuzzy logic and hybrid models have been used to identify gas and quantify the gases in the mixture, the performances of these techniques enormously depend on the feature engineering and selection of hyper-parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are an effective technique for identifying gases and quantifying the mixture of gases for e-nose data. We also present that the proposed methods outperforms various other methods and can provide higher identification and quantification accuracy in the pres-ence of sensor drift.},

  abstract     = {Support vector machines (SVMs) are one of the most popular and widely used approaches in modeling. Various kinds of SVM models have been developed in the literature of prediction and classification in order to cover different purposes. Fuzzy and crisp support vector machines are a well-known branch of modeling approaches frequently applied for certain and uncertain modeling, respectively. However, each model can only be efficiently used in its specified domain and cannot yield relevant and accurate results if the opposite situations have occurred. While the real-world systems and data sets often contain both certain and uncertain patterns that are complicatedly mixed and need to be simultaneously modeled. In this paper, a generalized support vector machine is proposed that can simultaneously benefit the unique advantages of certain and uncertain versions of the traditional support vector machines in their specialized categories. In the proposed model, the underlying data set is first categorized into two classes of certain and uncertain patterns. Then, certain patterns are modeled by a support vector machine, and uncertain patterns are modeled by a fuzzy support vector machine. After that, the function of the relationship, as well as the relative importance of each component, is estimated by another support vector machine. Finally, the forecasts of the proposed model are calculated. Empirical results of wind speed forecasting indicate that the proposed method not only can achieve more accurate results than support vector machines (SVMs) and fuzzy support vector machines but also can yield better forecasting performance than traditional fuzzy and nonfuzzy single models and traditional preprocessing-based hybrid models of SVMs.},

  abstract     = {Medicinal plants are used to cure different common and chronic diseases in different Asian countries including India. The easy availability and planting possibility make them popular resources for alternative medicinal practices like Ayurveda. These medicinal plants possess proven healing potential without causing any side effects. The biochemical constituents of the medicinal leaves are the fundamental reasons of their healing power which considerably vary with maturity. The existing practices of maturity detection are largely based on chemical analysis of leaves through different instruments which are expensive, invasive in nature and time consuming. This paper reports a computer vision-based system to classify the medicinal leaves along with the corresponding maturity level. The process reported is advantageous in terms of comparatively easier, faster, less expensive and non-invasive operations. The presented system captures the leaf images in controlled illumination and processed leaf images are fed to the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture-based system for classification of both the type of leaves and maturity stage. The paper also presents application of binary particle swarm optimization ((BPSO) for arriving the values of the CNN hyperparameters. The potential of the system has been assessed with three popular species of medicinal plants, namely Neem, Tulsi and Kalmegh. The classification results were verified with repeated test runs and different standard metrics including tenfold cross-validation method. The paper shows that the presented CNN-driven computer vision framework can provide about 99\% classification accuracy for simultaneous prediction of leaf specie and maturity stage. Such significant performance of the presented method can be considered as a potential addition to the existing chemical and instrumental methods.},

  abstract     = {Humor and pun are widely used in our daily life. Due to the incongruous and inconsistent expressions in humor and pun, humor recognition and pun detection are challenging tasks in sentiment analysis and natural language processing. Pun is usually used as one of the humorous rhetorical devices. Thus, determining the puns in the texts can be pertinent to the successful recognition of humor and vice versa. Existing models of humor recognition and pun detection usually dealt with the two tasks independently. Therefore, we propose an attention-based multi-task learning model (ABML) to train the two tasks jointly. Our model unifies the two highly pertinent tasks, including the humor recognition and pun detection. In the ABML model, we design a Co-Encoder module to capture the common features between the two tasks by weight sharing. Apart from the Co-Encoder module, we also design two Private Encoder modules for the two tasks, respectively. The Private Encoder module is used to capture the private semantic feature of the two tasks. We conduct sufficient experiments on two widely used datasets, including a humor dataset and a pun dataset, to verify the effectiveness of our model. The experimental results show our model can get comparable performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {One of the most important and effective works of water resource planning and management is determining the specific, applicable, regulated operating policies of the Zayandehroud dam reservoir, as a case study, in which it should be user-friendly and straightforward for the operator. For this purpose, different methods have been proposed in which each of them has its limitations. Due to the unique capabilities of the genetic programming (GP) model, here, this method is used to determine the operating rule curves and policies of the dam reservoir. For this purpose, here, two cases are proposed in which, in the first case, each month is individually simulated and modeled. However, in the second case, all months are simulated simultaneously. A second case is proposed here to determine simple and more applicable operation rule curves. In addition, two approaches are suggested for each case in which in the first approach, the influential input variables are selected by presenting the hybrid method. In the proposed hybrid method, the artificial neural network (ANN) model is equipped with non-dominated sorting genetic (NSGA-II) algorithm leading to a hybrid method named the ANN-NSGA-II method. However, in the second approach, the influential input variables are selected automatically using the GP method. Here, the hybrid method is proposed and used to overcome the limitations of existing usual method. In other words, it is proposed to reduce the number of influential input variables of data-driven methods and select the effective ones. The obtained results of all proposed cases and approaches are presented and compared with the standard operation policy method, stochastic dynamic programming, ANN model, and NLP method. Comparison of the results shows the acceptable performance of the proposed cases and approaches. In other words, the best-obtained values of (stability index) SI index and water deficit (objective function value) are 49.3\% and 32, respectively.},

One aim in the present work is to prove that wavelets may be a successful machinery to understand such phenomena by applying a step forward extension of wavelets to multi-wavelets. We proposed in a first step to improve multi-wavelet notion by constructing more general families using independent components for multi-scaling and multi-wavelet mother functions. A special multi-wavelet is then introduced, continuous, and discrete multi-wavelet transforms are associated, as well as new filters, and algorithms of decomposition, and reconstruction. Applied breakthroughs of the paper may be summarized in three aims. In a first direction, an approximation (reconstruction) of a classical (stationary, periodic) example dealing with Fourier modes has been conducted in order to confirm the efficiency of the HSch multi-wavelets in approximating such signals and in providing fast algorithms. The second experimentation is concerned with the decomposition and reconstruction application of the HSch multi-wavelet on an ECG signal. The last experimentation is concerned with a de-noising application on a strain of coronavirus signal permitting to localize approximately the transmembrane segments of such a series as neighborhoods of the local maxima of an numerized version of the strain. Accuracy of the method has been evaluated by means of error estimates and statistical tests.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy support vector machine and their variants are prominent classification techniques that reduce the adverse effects of noises and outliers as compare to classical support vector machine. However, in these methods, only the distance between the training pattern and the class center is considered, and hence, the edge support vectors cannot be distinguished from noises and outliers properly. These limitations are overcome by intuitionistic fuzzy-based support vector machine which allocate two parameters (membership and non-membership degrees) to each pattern of a dataset and hence define score number based on the importance of a pattern. In this paper, an intuitionistic fuzzy proximal support vector machine for multi-category classification problems is proposed. The method significantly reduces the impacts of noises and outliers present in the dataset by assigning the intuitionistic fuzzy score function to each training point based on its location and surroundings. Moreover, the method is computationally efficient as the robust classifiers are obtained by solving the system of linear equations instead of large size quadratic programming problems. In the proposed method, using polynomial and Gaussian kernels, the hyperplanes are also developed in the feature space. The geometrical advantages of the suggested method over the existing techniques are ascertained using the simulated two-dimensional artificial dataset having three target classes. Further, extensive experimental studies on ten UCI benchmark datasets have been performed which demonstrate that the proposed algorithm predicts more precisely about future data as comparison to some well-established algorithms. Figures are also illustrated by varying different parameters involved in the model which confirms the performance of the method over the existing algorithms. Moreover, the analysis of the predictive behavior of the proposed approach is done using the Friedman test, a nonparametric alternative to the analysis of variance test at $$5\%$$ significance level. Further, the proposed method has also been applied to image classification and gesture-phase segmentation problems which confirms the efficiency and handling capabilities of the proposed algorithm in practical applications.},

CIVq-ROFSs allow larger freedom for decision-makers (DMs) to provide their assessment information systematically. To more effectively represent DMs’ evaluation information in complicated multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) process, in this paper, the Muirhead mean and dual Muirhead means operators are proposed under the CIVq-ROF environment. First, we present CIVq-ROF Muirhead mean (CIVq-ROFMM) operator and CIVq-ROF dual Muirhead mean (CIVq-ROFDMM) operator with their weighted form to deal with MAGDM problems. The key advantages of these aggregation operators (AOs) are that they can capture multi-attributes correlations among all attributes and enable the data aggregation procedure more versatile through the parameter vector $$\psi $$ . Moreover, several properties of these AOs and some exceptional cases are discussed, when some different values are taken by the parameter vector. Further, we present the main steps of a novel CIVq-ROF MAGDM method based on the proposed operators. Then, an illustrative example is provided to validate the approach. Finally, we discuss the influence of the parameter vector $$\psi $$ and q on the ranking results and the advantages of the proposed method by comparing them with other existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Zadeh firstly proposed a Z-number with help of both a fuzzy value and a reliability measure in uncertain environment. Its highlight is that the fuzzy value is closely related to the reliability measure. However, the Z-number lacks the indeterminacy and falsity fuzzy values and reliability measures. Although a single-valued neutrosophic set is described by the truth, indeterminacy and falsity membership degrees, it lacks the reliability measures of the truth, indeterminacy and falsity membership degrees. By the hybrid information of the truth, indeterminacy and falsity Z-numbers, a neutrosophic Z-number (NZN) can be introduced to express the inconsistent, incomplete and indeterminate knowledge and judgments of human cognitions in the real world. Then, the similarity measure is an important mathematical tool for decision making (DM) and pattern recognition, but there is no similarity measure of any NZN set in the existing literature. Motivated by this idea, this study firstly proposes NZN sets and generalized distance and similarity measures between NZN sets and then further introduces cosine and cotangent similarity measures based on the weighted generalized distance of NZN sets. Next, a multi-attribute DM method using the proposed similarity measures is established in the setting of NZN sets. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the feasibility and rationality of the proposed method, and then the comparative analysis indicates the two highlighting advantages: (a) NZN enriches the neutrosophic information expression by means of the truth, indeterminacy and falsity Z-numbers and (b) the established DM method based on the proposed similarity measures not only enhances the reliability of DM problems, but also shows its superiority over existing neutrosophic DM methods.},

The traditional recommender system intended to provide recommendations for a single user. However, in certain domains the recommendation is required for a group of users. As to provide better recommendations for a group of users, we leverage the concept of circles in a network. In this work, we use the genetic algorithm (GA) K_Means clustering algorithm to generate social circles in a network. Then, we compute the status of each user in these overlapping circles. Finally, a circle-based group recommendation approach is used to generate the final group recommendation. The results obtained on the Epinions dataset validate the eminence of the proposed model over traditional approaches of group recommendation.},

  abstract     = {Rumor, with the fast speed of transmission, may bring us panic, even economic loss. Thus, it is significant for us to take effective steps to control the rumor spreading. Unfortunately, most of the existing works ignore that the spreading probability is not a constant, but depends on the number of spreaders currently. That is to say, the more spreaders, the larger spreading probability. In order to overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose a novel susceptible–infected–removed (SIR) rumor spreading model with the influence mechanism, called SIR-IM, which first incorporates the number of current spreaders into the spreading probability. Then, it employs time function to describe the rate of people from spreader to stifler as time goes on. Moreover, we not only derive mean-field equations to describe the dynamics of our SIR model, but also give theoretical analysis. Numerical simulations are conducted on social networks, which show that the influence mechanism can accelerate the rumor spreading.},

  abstract     = {For the different degrees of danger caused by different driving habits, a lane departure warning algorithm based on probability statistics of driving habits is proposed in this paper. According to the different driving habits of different drivers, the early warning mechanism can be adaptively adjusted through the method of probability statistics to make lane departure warning more targeted and accurate. Firstly, each frame of image is preprocessed, including gray treatment, edge detection and binarization. Then, Canny operator is used to detect the edge, and Hough transform is applied to detect the lines. And the lane median line equation for the detection and identification of lane also can be calculated. After that, the image coordinate system is transformed into the world coordinate system by means of the formula and matrix of coordinate conversion. According to the theory of Kalman filter, the statistics of lateral acceleration and lateral velocity are updated continuously, and the position of the vehicle in the next moment is predicted by the state transition equation and the forecast equation. From the results of experiments and the comparison with exhaustive algorithms, the advantages of using Kalman filter to predict the location of vehicles and the improved time-to-lane-crossing combined with probabilistic statistics to warning are illustrated clearly.},

Due to the computing power limitation of terminal devices, many analyzing methods of physiological signals are in offline mode. However, in many applications, physiological signal should be analyzed in real time. To overcome this problem, a real-time physiological signal acquisition and analysis method based on fractional calculus and stream computing is proposed. Mobile terminals read the physiological data from sensors and upload them to the stream computing platform. A fractal index is used to estimate the physiological status. Based on the stream computing platform, this index is calculated by distributed parallel computing.

The maximum entropy principle states that the probability distribution with maximal information entropy is the best choice on the basis of partial information. In this paper, the unimodal entropy of uncertain variable is introduced, which unifies most of the classical entropy in uncertainty theory. And the Boundary Decay Condition of an uncertain variable is proposed. Based on the Boundary Decay Condition and Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, the maximum entropy principle of the unimodal entropy is established. Different from the known methods in dealing with the maximum entropy principles in uncertainty theory, we do not apply the Euler–Lagrange equation of the calculus of variations, which is only a necessary but not sufficient condition for the extrema of functionals. As applications, the classical maximum entropy principles in uncertainty theory are deduced from the maximum entropy principle of the unimodal entropy.},

  abstract     = {A generalized form of union and intersection on FFS can be formulated from a generalized t-norm (TN) and t-conorm (TCN). Hamacher operations such as Hamacher product and Hamacher sum are good alternatives to produce such product and sum. The Hamacher operations can generate more flexible and more accurate results in decision-making process due to the working parameter involved in these operations. The intuitionistic fuzzy set, briefly as IFS and its extension involving Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) and Fermatean fuzzy set (FFS), are all effective tools to express uncertain and incomplete cognitive information with membership, nonmembership and hesitancy degrees. The Fermatean fuzzy set (FF-set) carries out uncertain and imprecise information smartly in exercising decision making than IFS and PFS. By adjusting the prioritization of attributes in FF environment, in this course of this article, we first device new operations on FF information using prioritized attributes and by employing HTN and HTCN, we discuss the basic operations. Induced by the Hamacher operations and FF-set, we propose FF Hamacher arithmetic and also geometric aggregation operators (AOs). In the first section, we introduce the concepts of an FF Hamacher prioritized AO and FF Hamacher prioritized weighted AO. In the second part, we develop FF Hamacher prioritized geometric operator (GO) and FF Hamacher prioritized weighted GO. We study essential properties and a few special cases of our newly proposed operators. Then, we make use of these proposed operators in developing tools which are key factors in solving the FF multi-attribute decision-making situations with prioritization. The university selection phenomena are considered as a direct application for analysis and to demonstrate the practicality and efficacy of our proposed model. The working parameter considered in these AOs is analyzed in different existing and proposed AOs. Further, comparison analysis is conducted for the authenticity of proposed &amp; existing operators.},

To get more realistic prediction results, scholars have explored the combination of fuzzy theory and time series. Although some results have been achieved so far, there are still gaps in the combination of n-Pythagorean fuzzy sets and time series. In this paper, a pioneering n-Pythagorean fuzzy time series model (n-PFTS) and its forecasting method (n-IMWPFCM) are proposed to employ a n-Pythagorean fuzzy c-means clustering method (n-PFCM) to overcome the subjectivity of directly assigning membership and non-membership values, thus improving the accuracy of the partition the universe of discourse. A novel improved Markov prediction method is exploited to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model. The proposed prediction method is applied to the yearly University of Alabama enrollments data and the new COVID-19 cases data. The results show that compared with the traditional fuzzy time series forecasting method, the proposed method has better forecasting accuracy. Meanwhile, it has the characteristics of low computational complexity and high interpretability and demonstrates the superiority of this model from a realistic perspective.},

  abstract     = {Natural language, being unstructured, makes the tedious task for building a model to parse it into a query language successfully. An incorrect query for a particular question would lead to an absurd answer. As seen in many semantic parsing approaches, the inaccurate answering of complex questions increases significantly. This leads to many novel effective strategies that can apply to semantic parsing approaches to accurately parse complex natural language questions and generate an appropriate answer over a large knowledge graph. The defense system in a particular country is one of the most crucial components, and the lack of a proper defensive domain interface makes it a significant motivation. Hence, a knowledge graph has been constructed to collect and enquire about all information in one place. In this paper, KG4ASTRA has been designed with a Missile Knowledge Graph consisting of 177 entities linked using 400 relationships. A query-answering model then utilizes this manually created Missile Knowledge Graph, which generates tabular or graph representation for the natural language question. Neo4j platform has been used to prepare the knowledge graph, and Cypher queries are used to execute queries. The modeled knowledge has been evaluated by executing natural language queries on KG4ASTRA query-answering model and compared the search results with other existing knowledge graphs. As of our best knowledge, neither the knowledge graph nor the question-answering model has been designed for Indian Missiles. As a future scope, the proposed knowledge graph will be connected with the existing knowledge graph and extended to automatically extract domain-specific entities.},

In this paper, a multiple-deme parallel genetic algorithm is used for a suitable design of load shedding. The load shedding algorithm is implemented when the voltage stability margin index of the power system is lower than a predefined value. In order to increase the computational speed, the voltage stability margin index is estimated by a modular neural network method in a fraction of a second. In addition, in order to use the exact values of the voltage stability margin index for neural network training, a simultaneous equilibrium tracing technique has been employed considering the detailed model of the components of the generating units such as the governor and the excitation system. In the proposed algorithm, the entire population is partitioned into several isolated subpopulations (demes) in which demes distributed in different processors and individuals may migrate occasionally from one subpopulation to another. The proposed technique has been tested on New England-39 bus test system, and the obtained results indicate the efficiency of the proposed method.},

Data integrity is difficult to ensure since generated data from IoT devices are split into parts and stored in numerous edge servers in various locations. Data loss and improper data storage in edge servers make it difficult to ensure data integrity. The various security challenges and data integrity of edge computing can be handled by integrating blockchain (BC) technologies. BC paradigm provides a new infrastructure and security rules to enable IoT devices to get trusted interoperability for information and business. So, many healthcare institutions based on BC technology have the ability for data storage and support trust. This work aims to presents an IoT-Edge framework for the exchange of data without changing utilizing data processing and BC techniques. IoT devices can monitor follow the patient&#39;s status remotely and subsequently overcome the possibility of difficult cases. The proposed system presents many healthcare institutions&#39; features by providing the complete preservation of patients&#39; data with its confidential transmission and submits the results of the patient examination safely. The proposed system is user-friendly and offers the required utilities for integrity and confidentiality of information. Some simulation and performance experiments are conducted; the findings indicate an acceptable performance as an IoT-Edge framework based on BC technology.},

By using the fusion of object posture and emotional characteristics as the basis for pet emotion identification and analysis, the detected specific pet behaviour states will be actively notified to the owner for processing. Compared with traditional speech recognition, which uses mel-frequency cepstral coefficients for feature extraction, coupled with a Gaussian mixture model-hidden Markov model for voice recognition, the experimental method of this research paper effectively improves the accuracy by 70\%. Prior work on the implementation of smart pet surveillance systems has used the pet&#39;s tail and mouth as features, and has combined these with sound features to analyse the pet&#39;s emotions.

  abstract     = {In project management, agility concept has emerged for overcoming the limitations of traditional methodologies that are sequential and linear. An agile project contains planned processes as well as iterations. In global competitive areas, achieving agility in outsourcing processes enables the companies to cope with changes and dynamic issues. This paper introduces an integrated cognitive map-based intuitionistic fuzzy multiple criteria decision aid to rank agile outsourcing provider alternatives and then determine the best performing one. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets are employed for dealing with uncertain and vague data along with the loss of information that may be occurred in numerical operations with fuzzy numbers. Intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive map tool is used to weight the evaluation criteria that are interrelated with each other with causal links. The most appropriate agile outsourcing provider alternative is identified via intuitionistic fuzzy complex proportional assessment technique, which aims to obtain a solution relative to the ideal solution. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed intuitionistic fuzzy decision aid, a case study is conducted in Turkish white goods industry. As a comparative study, a scenario analysis is provided to understand the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on agile provider evaluation/selection decision. According to the results obtained from the scenario analysis, it is worth noting that home office procedures are appropriate for maintaining agility in outsourcing processes of project management.},

  abstract     = {Inverse kinematic solution is a critical procedure for the control of manipulators; however, only a small number of manipulators that meet certain conditions have closed-form solutions. In this paper, the conventional solution was replaced by the optimization process of a proposed fitness function. The fitness function aims to obtain a set of accurate joint angles for the desired position and orientation of the end effector. The function is based on forward kinematics; hence, this approach can avoid singularities and be suitable for solving many manipulators. For solving this optimization problem, particle swarm optimization algorithm was chosen as the basis due to its easy principle and excellent performance. To enhance the performance of the algorithm in searching global optimum, an adaptive inertia weight strategy applied to adjust the velocity of particles was proposed. Besides, for particles, to avoid trapping in local optimum at the boundary, a special boundary treatment was presented. In this study, two serial robotic manipulators were used to test the performance of adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO). Meanwhile, several powerful PSO variants improved from disparate methods were selected to compare with APSO. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fitness function with APSO can solve the inverse kinematic problem of multi-DOF manipulators efficiently and accurately.},

However, the product update speed for products such as mobile phone and software industries is accelerated, and the manufacturing sales costs, retailer sales costs, collecting costs, consumer demands and the quantities of recycled products are usually uncertain due to the lack or insufficiency of historical data. Considering the effective different recycling channels, two Stackelberg game models led by the manufacturer are developed to analyze the difference between the manufacturer and the third-party recycling channel. We also discussed the optimal decision and maximum expected profit under the centralized decision model. Some corresponding analytical solutions are derived to solve the models. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to examine the impact on customer acceptance of the online channel on pricing decisions. To examine the effects of key uncertain parameters on the optimal decisions, we perform sensitivity analysis on some important parameters.},

To handle such type of data and other problems we introduce the notion of complex picture fuzzy N-soft sets (CPFN-SS) which is the fusion of complex picture fuzzy sets (CPFSs) and N-soft sets (N-SS). CPFN-SS is a vital technique to handle tricky and unreliable information in real-life decision-making problems. We also introduce a novel definition of complex picture fuzzy soft sets which is a combination of complex fuzzy sets and picture fuzzy sets. In CPFN-SS notions of N-soft sets, fuzzy N-SSs, intuitionistic FN-SSs (IFN-SSs), picture FN-SSs complex FN-SSs, complex IFN-SSs are generalized. Furthermore, we describe some basic operations on CPFN-SSs such as complement, extended union, restricted union, extended intersection, and restricted intersection and illustrate them with the help of examples. After that, we define an algorithm to solve the data in the environment of CPFN-SSs. To show the advantages and usefulness of the proposed CPFN-SSs we represent two real-life applications, i.e., performance assessment of e-waste recycling program and predication about the champions of FIFA world cup 2022 through audience poll of our established model in decision making. In the end, we do a comparison of our established CPFN-SS with some existing methods which shows that CPFN-SS is more effective, better, and generalization of the existing ones.},

The constraint of the collocation correlation between prefabricated components and the substitution correlation between transport vehicles is proposed as a substitution equilibrium point method to deploy transportation vehicles.

In this paper, we investigate the use of an iterative rounding strategy-based algorithm for tackling a special knapsack problem: the set-union knapsack problem. First, the approach builds a series of starting partial solutions by using the principle of fractional values related to a series of linear relaxations of the (sub)instance at hand. Second, each step of the rounding procedure is coupled with an enhanced local search procedure, where its goal is to search around a local partial solution by applying the so-called critical element tailored for the problem studied. Third, both degrading and re-optimization strategies are introduced in order to extend the diversified search space. Finally, all strategies are embedded into an iterative search in order to augmenting the quality of the solutions. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on benchmark instances of the literature and new large-scale instances; its provided results are compared to those reached by the Cplex solver and the best methods available in the literature. The method seems competitive, where it is able to achieve new (lower) bounds and matches the rest of the bounds.},

  abstract     = {As a relatively new model, the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) has shown impressive success in solving optimization problems. Nevertheless, its efficiency is still not satisfactory for some complex optimization problems. This paper has modified ABC and its other recent variants to improve its performance by modifying the scout phase. This modification enhances its exploitation ability by intensifying the regions in the search space, which probably includes reasonable solutions. The experiments were performed on CEC2014, and CEC2015 benchmark suites, real-life problems. And the proposed modification was applied to basic ABC, Gbest-Guided ABC, Depth First Search ABC, and Teaching–Learning Based ABC, and they were compared with their modified counterparts. The results have shown that our modification can successfully increase the performance of the original versions. Moreover, the proposed modified algorithm was compared with the state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, and it produced competitive results.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical linear models are widely used in many research disciplines and estimation issues for such models are generally well addressed. Design issues are relatively much less discussed for hierarchical linear models but there is an increasing interest as these models grow in popularity. This paper discusses the G-optimality for predicting individual parameters in such models and establishes an equivalence theorem for confirming the G-optimality of an approximate design. Because the criterion is non-differentiable and requires solving multiple nested optimization problems, it is much harder to find and study G-optimal designs analytically. We propose a nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm called competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) to generate G-optimal designs for linear mixed models with different means and covariance structures. We further demonstrate that CSO is flexible and generally effective for finding the widely used locally D-optimal designs for nonlinear models with multiple interacting factors and some of the random effects are correlated. Our numerical results for a few examples suggest that G and D-optimal designs may be equivalent and we establish that D and G-optimal designs for hierarchical linear models are equivalent when the models have only a random intercept only. The challenging mathematical question of whether their equivalence applies more generally to other hierarchical models remains elusive.},

The traditional layout approach focuses on the factors related to material handling concerning the needed area, workforce, flow distance, and material handling cost reduction. However, health and safety measures have a significant influence on manufacturing layout productivity. These measures enable work satisfaction, employer safety, and avoidance of occupational accidents. The proposed mathematical model integrates safety measures in machine layout design due to occupational health and safety indispensable for machine layout problems. By safety effect, the total cost is reduced approximately by 16\%. A hybridization is suggested to combine new heuristic rule and tabu search algorithm with multiple objectives for benchmarking two problems: single-row machine layout with safety and a traditional single-row machine layout. A multi-objective heuristic rule supported genetic algorithm is developed to improve the results in addition to the multi-objective heuristic rule supported tabu search. The proposed hybrid algorithms are tested on 10 example sets with varieties of 10, 20, and 30 machines, and their results are compared. The computational results with hybrid meta-heuristics show the safety factor should be considered primarily in the machine layout problem .},

  abstract     = {The stock market plays a vital role in the economic and social organization of many countries. Since stock price time series are highly noisy, nonparametric, volatility, complexity, nonlinearity, dynamics, and chaos, the stock market prediction is an important issue for investors and professional analysts. In the financial field, stock market prediction is not only an important task but also an important research topic. For different problems, researchers have proposed many prediction methods. Many papers provide strong evidence that stock prices can be predicted from past price data. In this paper, we propose a hybrid prediction model for stock price based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and variational mode decomposition (VMD). We use the variational mode decomposition method to decompose the complex time series of stock prices into several relatively flat, regular, and stable subsequences. Then, we use each subsequence to train the long- and short-term memory neural network and predict each subsequence. Finally, we merge the predicted values of several subsequences to form the predicted results of the stock price complex original time series. To verify fully the method, we selected four experimental data for testing. Compared with the prediction results of various prediction methods, the prediction accuracy of our proposed model is higher. Especially in the R2 index, the experimental effect is very good. The proposed method achieves good results of more than 0.991 on each data set. Therefore, our proposed hybrid prediction model is accurate and effective in forecasting stock prices and has practical significance and reference value.},

The present study applies an integrated methodology for assessing landslide susceptibility of northern Pakistan (Mansehra and Muzaffarabad districts). Three orthodox machine learning (ML) classification techniques, including support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and random forest (RF), are integrated with convolutional neural network (CNN) used. For training and testing of the models, spatial datasets consisting of 3251 sites of historical slopes are used in a ratio of 70:30. Initially, a total of 16 influencing factors for landslide modelling were established. The training dataset specifically constructs three hybrid models CNN-SVM, CNN-LR, and CNN-RF. Then, final susceptibility maps (LSMs) will be built using these trained models. These models will be implemented. For having a comparison, the LSMs are also prepared using the considered ML models individually. In the end, multiple statistical methods are used to validate and compare the performance of these models. The results of the analysis have revealed the efficiency of applying the projected ML models by combining them with the CNN technique. Therefore, in other sensitive regions with comparable geo-environmental conditions, the future hybrid designs can be used effectively for landslide susceptibility studies.},

  abstract     = {The quality of the defect datasets is a critical issue in the domain of software defect prediction (SDP). These datasets are obtained through the mining of software repositories. Recent studies claim over the quality of the defect dataset. It is because of inconsistency between bug/clean fix keyword in fault reports and the corresponding link in the change management logs. Class Imbalance (CI) problem is also a big challenging issue in SDP models. The defect prediction method trained using noisy and imbalanced data leads to inconsistent and unsatisfactory results. Combined analysis over noisy instances and CI problem needs to be required. To the best of our knowledge, there are insufficient studies that have been done over such aspects. In this paper, we deal with the impact of noise and CI problem on five baseline SDP models; we manually added the various noise level (0–80\%) and identified its impact on the performance of those SDP models. Moreover, we further provide guidelines for the possible range of tolerable noise for baseline models. We have also suggested the SDP model, which has the highest noise tolerable ability and outperforms over other classical methods. The True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) values of the baseline models reduce between 20–30\% after adding 10–40\% noisy instances. Similarly, the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) values of SDP models reduce to 40–50\%. The suggested model leads to avoid noise between 40–60\% as compared to other traditional models.},

  abstract     = {Soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) strongly influences the chemical, physical, and biological properties of soil. As the direct measurement of the CEC is difficult, costly, and time-consuming, the indirect estimation of CEC from chemical and physical parameters has been considered as an alternative method by researchers. Accordingly, in this study, a new hybrid model using a support vector machine (SVM), coupling with particle swarm optimization (PSO), and integrated invasive weed optimization (IWO) algorithm is developed for estimating the soil CEC. The physical and chemical data (i.e., clay, organic matter (OM), and pH) from two field sites of Taybad and Semnan in Iran were used for validating the new proposed approach. The ability of the proposed model (SVM-PSOIWO) was compared with the individual model (SVM) and the hybrid model (SVM-PSO). The results of the SVM-PSOIWO model were also compared with those of existing studies. Different performance evaluation criteria such as RMSE, R2, MAE, RRMSE, and MAPE, Box plots, and scatter diagrams were used to test the ability of the proposed models for estimation of the CEC values. The results showed that the SVM-PSOIWO model with the RMSE (R2) of 0.229 Cmol + kg−1 (0.924) was better than those of the SVM and SVM-PSO models with the RMSE (R2) of 0.335 Cmol + kg−1 (0.843) and 0.279 Cmol + kg−1 (0.888), respectively. Furthermore, the ability of the SVM-PSOIWO model compared with existing studies, which used the genetic expression programming, artificial neural network, and multivariate adaptive regression splines models. The results indicated that the SVM-PSOIWO model estimates the CEC more accurately than existing studies.},

Our model uses two feature generation methods to extract both statistical and textural features. The Tietze graph is considered to create a pattern of the presented local graph structure (LGS). Both statistical and textural feature generations are not enough to present a high-accurate model. Therefore, a multileveled structure must be created. Tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) is employed as a decomposer. The generated/extracted features in each level are merged, and the merged features are selected using NCA. The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classifier is deployed on the chosen features in the classification phase to obtain predicted values. The recommended method was tested on two ECG signal corpora called ECGID and MIT-BIH. The model achieved 99.12\% and 99.94\% accuracies on the used ECGID and MIT-BIH datasets, respectively.},

To predict heterogeneous links between different types of nodes, NRL is not robustly investigated yet. Though existing studies on random walk-based heterogeneous NRL are available, it suffers from three drawbacks: need to specify “templates” (e.g., metapaths), require separate embedding learning in predicting heterogeneous links, and opt to generate low-quality embeddings when networks are incomplete or sparse. This work proposes a novel template-free NRL method, metawalk2vec, to tackle these issues for heterogeneous link prediction. The idea is allowing the random walker to visit diverse types of nodes, instead of following the pre-defined templates. While template-based methods use common context patterns for NRL, nodes depicted by uncommon context types can make their embeddings better distinguish from each other. We conduct the experiments of social (user-user) and adoption (user-item) link predictions on Twitter and Douban datasets. The results exhibit our metawalk2vec can achieve similar and even better performance than template-based models. We also show our model is more robust to the network incompleteness.},

A Blood supply chain (BSC) network is an especial case of the general supply chain usually investigated using single or multi-objective approaches. However, there are always many incompatible targets for this problem in the real world. This paper aims to deal with the problem of BSC network design in emergencies using a six-objective optimization framework. Such a model can appropriately meet and balance the expectations of different stakeholders and the BSC network, considering the immediate and dynamic requirements of a specific emergency event. To formulate the problem at hand, a new mathematical model is developed as a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) model. Since the problem is strongly NP-hard, two recently developed solution algorithms called NSGA-III and FR-NSGA-II are adapted and used to solve the problem in a reasonable time. The proposed solution algorithms provide some proper trade-offs between different objectives that can be valuable for related managers. The result shows that a more stable Pareto-optimal solution can be produced using the FR-NSGA-II. Supplementary analysis indicates the superiority of the proposed approach compared to the previous studies in BSC network design.},

  abstract     = {The approach of dealing with uncertainty is enhancing day-by-day with new rudiments and tools which possess their specific qualities. Usually, aggregation operators can easily manage the information in an exact manner. But each operator has different specifications in each problem. In recent few years, aggregation operators on intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (IFSSs) or generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (GIFSSs) have been investigated but a lot of improvement is needed to obtain more accurate results. In this research, we defined new aggregation operators on GIFSSs which are used to aggregate our multi-criteria decision-making method. Reasonably, we assigned the weights with both intuitionistic fuzzy values of IFSS and intuitionistic fuzzy values of extra input in a GIFSS, and then by establishing new aggregation operators we appraised the computation in a more precise way. We defined the necessary properties of new aggregation operators and preparatory work of decision making in an algorithm. Then we expressed a real-life application by dint of the proposed methodology. Finally, we presented the comparisons of our work with already existing methods and techniques comprising aggregation operators.},

Their eminent characteristic is that the sum of the supremum of the membership degree, the abstinence degree, and the non-membership is equal to or less than 1, so the space of uncertain information they can describe is broader. Under these environments, we propose the picture hesitant fuzzy Bonferroni mean operator, picture hesitant fuzzy weighted Bonferroni mean operator, picture hesitant fuzzy geometric Bonferroni mean operator, and picture hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric Bonferroni mean operator to deal with the decision information, and some important properties of these are proved.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel method of ordering intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, combining the ‘value’ and the ‘ambiguity’ of an intuitionistic fuzzy number, is developed. The value and the ambiguity are calculated at $$(\alpha , \beta )$$ -levels, rather than calculating for the whole range of integration. These levels are termed as flexibility parameters, which allows a decision-maker to take a decision at levels of decision-making. In many studies, the reasonable properties of ranking intuitionistic fuzzy numbers were never tested. However, in this study, every effort is made to investigate the reasonable properties thoroughly. Furthermore, ordering of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers by existing methods relies heavily on intuition and the geometry of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. The proposed method fully complies with the reasonable properties of ranking intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, as well as the coherent intuition and geometry of the intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In addition, newer properties are being developed in this study. This demonstrates the novelty of the proposed method. A few numerical examples are also discussed demonstrating the proposed method. Lastly, the proposed method has been successfully applied to a risk analysis problem.},

It enriches the application of loop-based theory for isomorphism identification. In the kinematic chain, links and joints are connected alternatively and every link corresponds to a fixed link degree. Due to the inherent characteristics, the labeled sequence of links can be random, which does not affect the result of isomorphism identification. By the programming software MATLAB, some examples with 6-, 8-, 10-, 11-, 12-link kinematic chains, and 15-vertex topological graphs are presented. Results show that the proposed method applies to topology graphs and kinematic chains with one or multiple joints. Compared with other methods, the proposed method is confirmed correctly.

The PlantVillage dataset of damaged and healthy plant leaves images is used. The proposed model is trained to identify common plant leaf diseases of 14 species. The experimental results are compared to other well-known models. This study shows that the proposed model based on deep learning provides the best solution in the diagnosis of plant diseases with high accuracy, and that the gated recurrent unit neural network considered as a classifier can improve the accuracy of the convolutional neural network model.

In relation to this requirement, service managers must prioritize actions related to the care, desires and values of patients and their families. It is interesting to understand the ‘equity&#39; and ‘efficiency&#39; requirements. In this case, the company&#39;s managers must observe the priority level over those evaluated with the lowest rating and allocate the company&#39;s resources to the highest priority requirements.

  abstract     = {In order to improve the performance of a clustering on a data set, a number of primary partitions are generated and stored in an ensemble and their aggregated consensus partition is used as their clustering. It is widely accepted that the consensus partition outperforms the primary partitions. In this paper, an ensemble clustering method called multi-level consensus clustering (MLCC) is proposed. To construct the MLCC, a cluster–cluster similarity matrix which is achieved by an innovative similarity metric is first generated. The mentioned cluster–cluster similarity matrix is based on a multi-level similarity metric. In fact, it can be computed in a new defined multi-level space. Then, a point–point similarity matrix which is boosted using the mentioned cluster–cluster similarity matrix is generated. The new consensus function applies an average linkage hierarchical clusterer algorithm on the mentioned point–point similarity matrix to make consensus partition. MLCC is better than traditional clustering ensembles and simple versions of clustering ensembles on traditional cluster–cluster similarity matrix. Its computational cost is not very bad too. Accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are compared with those of the modern clustering algorithms through the experimental tests. Also, time analysis is presented in the experimental results.},

  abstract     = {Cryptographic algorithms are composed of many complex mathematical functions. When analyzing the complexity of these algorithms, one fixes priory the overall complexity of the algorithm as the complexity of the most dominating operations for a group of operations. Generally, it is the count of this operation which determines the complexity of the algorithm in case of compounding operations. We have instead used the weight factor to determine the complexity of an algorithm with many operating functions working simultaneously and have taken time of the operation as a measure of the weight factor. We statistically analyze the two most used operations in RSA, namely “power” and “mod,” through a method of revised difference to compare whether these are statistically similar or dissimilar. We have also calculated the empirical computational complexity of these two operations through the fundamental theorem of finite differences to verify whether these operations are statistically dissimilar and if so then which of the two is dominant. We have also analyzed empirically the complexity of each of the four sub-steps involved in the encryption and decryption of AES-128, to determine which operation dominates the most and consumes most of the time in an overall run time of AES-128.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the liberalization of energy markets (especially electricity) by many countries has led to much attention being paid to their modeling. The energy market modeling under the framework of probability theory is valuable when the distribution function is close enough to the actual frequency. However, due to the complexity and variability of the world, economic reasons and changing government policies, this assumption is not applicable in some cases. Under such circumstances, we propose an uncertain two-factor model based on uncertain differential equations to evaluate the electricity spot price dynamics. Then, several essential indicators of electricity are investigated and generalized moment estimation for unknown parameters is also provided. Two case studies by using electricity data from the Oslo and Stockholm regions illustrate our approach. We also compare the proposed model with one-factor uncertain model driven by Liu process and the electricity stochastic model. A detailed numerical study illustrates the efficiency of the proposed model to evaluate electricity spot prices.},

To provide automation to those UFVs, image or video processing techniques are helpful. Waterline detection from the sky–land–water region is the primary step for UFV autonomous navigation. After detecting the water region, object detection in the water region is the secondary step. In this paper, an object detection algorithm in water for low cost UFVs is proposed. Real-time and accurate waterline detection is done by using the K-means algorithm and Fast Marching method and it is compared with the Hough transform. Objects are detected accurately in the water region by a modified gradient-based image processing algorithm. In this algorithm, instead of Sobel Gradient Operator, Finite Difference Central Gradient Operator is used to achieve high accuracy in detecting objects in the water region. Floating green color weeds are also detected from objects using the green color of the weeds, and weed percentage is also calculated. Experiments were done on Own datasets, and OSF datasets containing freely floating plants, small cluster plants, and birds. Raspberry Pi 3 Model-B processor is used to implement this proposed algorithm. These performance metrics results show that the proposed detection approach is effective, more accurate, and suitable to different lake environments.},

  abstract     = {Human action recognition in the surveillance video is currently one of the challenging research topics. Most of the works in this area are based on either building classifiers on sophisticated handcrafted features or designing deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which directly act on raw inputs and extract meaningful information from the video. To capture the motion information between adjacent frames, 3D CNN extracts features in temporal dimension along with spatial dimension. Even though this technique is very effective in human action recognition but limited to very few fixed frames, all human actions are not limited to a fixed number of frames; they may span several frames. If we increase the size of the input window in CNN, handling all trainable parameters in the network will be very complicated. Hence, it is advisable to encode high-level motion features from different sources to the CNN model. This paper proposed a novel framework to extract handcrafted high-level motion features and in-depth features by CNN in parallel to recognize human action. SIFT is used as handcrafted feature to encode high-level motion features from the maximum number of input video frames. The combination of deep and handcrafted features preserves more extended temporal information from entire video frames present in action video with minimal computational power. Finally, we pass the extracted SIFT into the dense layer and concatenate it with a fully connected layer of CNN for classification. We evaluate the proposed combined CNN framework against regular 3D CNN and traditional handcrafted features like optical flow with SVM, SIFT with SVM on UCF, and KTH human action dataset. We achieve better performance in terms of computational cost and processing time in the proposed CNN framework compared to the other three methods.},

In some cases, the perturbations are so slight that neither human eyes nor detection algorithms can notice them, and this imperceptibility makes them more covert and dangerous. For the sake of investigating the invisible dangers in the applications of traffic DNNs, we focus on imperceptible adversarial attacks on different traffic vision tasks, including traffic sign classification, lane detection and street scene recognition. We propose a universal logits map-based attack architecture against image semantic segmentation and design two targeted attack approaches on it. All the attack algorithms generate the micro-noise adversarial examples by the iterative method of C&amp;W optimization and achieve 100\% attack rate with very low distortion, among which, our experimental results indicate that the MAE (mean absolute error) of perturbation noise based on traffic sign classifier attack is as low as 0.562, and the other two algorithms based on semantic segmentation are only 1.503 and 1.574. We believe that our research on imperceptible adversarial attacks has a certain reference value to the security of DNNs applications.},

  abstract     = {Although the salient object detection method based on the fully convolutional neural network has achieved better performance, how to learn effective feature representations in complex scenes to obtain more accurate saliency maps is still a challenge. In order to cope with the above-mentioned challenges, an addition or cascade structure is generally used to fuse feature information between multiple levels. However, these methods are susceptible to the influence of messy background information. The network may regard non-salient objects with similar salient appearances as target predictions, and the prediction results may be incomplete due to different appearance areas of salient objects. We design a network composed of multiple attention mechanisms to selectively integrate deep and shallow feature information, and more effectively deal with the transfer and fusion of features. In this paper, we propose a multi-attention embedded network (MAENet), which introduces attention mechanisms to give different feature information with different weights for handling the transfer and aggregation of features at different levels. The multi-attention feature aggregation (MAFA) module is proposed, which uses the channel attention mechanism to give different weights to the features to be fused, and then uses the spatial attention mechanism to selectively aggregate shallow edge information and deep abstract semantic features to avoid excessive redundant information which affects the saliency mapping, as well as suppressing non-salient areas with “salient” appearance. In addition, The multi-scale feature extraction (MFE) module and the self-attention (SA) module are also proposed for obtaining sufficiently rich and useful multi-scale context information and enhancing the function of the top layer. Finally, the attentional residual refinement (ARR) module is utilized to refine the saliency map after each feature fusion and further improve the input function. MAENet can accurately segment salient objects and provide clear local details. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves the favorable performance against 14 state-of-the-art methods on popular evaluation metrics.},

Many state-of-the-art studies have been proposed to remove redundancy from the network and to enhance the network efficiency of Internet applications. Still there is a necessity to explore more data redundancy elimination (DRE) techniques, especially for defense-based networks to enhance the data transmission speed and to compress the irrelevant data optimally for reducing the network latency. In order to improve the optimal storage capacity of redundant data over serial hybrid network cascade database, a high-efficiency redundancy elimination method based on the distributed parallel algorithm is proposed in this paper. The distributed storage structure model for handling redundant data of serial mixed network cascade database is designed and tested in simulated environment. The extraction of features of redundant data is performed by using distributed hybrid feature mining technique. The dimensionality reduction of redundant data is also attained by devising the feature transformation method to remove the unwanted features of data. The two benchmarked techniques have been selected for comparative study and to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The simulation results show that the proposed DRE method can significantly reduce the redundancy from the network traffic. The bandwidth utilization is improved, the duplicate data are also compressed optimally and it is proved that the proposed DRE method is viable for large networks to eliminate the redundant data.},

The usage of robots has become an imperative part of the defense-oriented applications. The missions which are difficult to be performed by human beings can certainly be accomplished by the robots nowadays. The most crucial part for an industrial- and defense-based robot is to perform pose movements accurately for optimal usage of robotics as a replacement of human beings. This paper proposes a comprehensive introduction to the proposed hybrid approach PSO–RL which uses reinforcement learning (RL) and Particle swarm optimization (PSO). It summarizes the usage of proposed PSO-RL for pose measurement of robots in defense and industrial manufacturing systems. The hybrid PSO–RL is a promising technique for measuring poses in robots with accuracy and for optimizing obstacle avoidance error. In this paper, robot’s core movements are analyzed; speed of movements is given importance, and an attempt is made to provide more accurate moves with high precision. In order to optimize the efficiency of robotic operations, a full freedom pose measurement method based on PSO–RL is proposed. By using the characteristics of two-wheel independent driving industrial robot, the performance of the robot in three moving modes is evaluated. The experimental results show that the proposed PSO-RL method has the advantages of high accuracy, high measurement efficiency, high success rate of grabbing and avoiding obstacles. It outperforms the existing methods such as least square method and micro-displacement cyclic correction method with respect to maximum error, RMSE score and time complexity.},

  abstract     = {Earlier identification of knee joint pathology helps the therapist to provide the appropriate clinical procedures to control the deteriorating process of arthritis. Beyond usual medical investigations, computational techniques have been used for the diagnosis of knee joint disorder. Among different methodologies, vibroarthrographic technique is employed to identify knee joint disorder. Machine learning contains number of classification methods for the given data. A novel technique called greedy sequential backward feature selection-based radial kernelized least square support vector classification (GSBFS-RKLSSVC) is introduced for accurate detection of knee joint pathology with minimum time. The proposed GSBFS-RKLSSVC technique consists of three processes, namely feature selection, feature evaluation, and classification. Initially, number of VAG signal images is taken from the dataset for detection of knee joint disorder. The relevant feature is selected through the greedy mutual informative regressed sequential backward selection algorithm to reduce an initial dimensional feature space into a low-dimensional feature subspace. Following this, the dichotomous logit regression is applied to select the best features and discard others. Therefore, the feature selection process of the proposed GSBFS-RKLSSVC minimizes the time consumption of the knee joint pathology detection. Once the signal features are extracted, RKLSSVC is applied to detect the normal and abnormal VAG signal. Decision boundary is utilized by the classifier to categorize the samples based on the similarity between the training features and testing features. As a result, the accurate classification is obtained with a minimum error rate. The observed result indicates that GSBFS-RKLSSVC achieves higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity and reduces time than the conventional methods.},

Researchers in different fields are continually working to develop vaccines and prevention strategies. However, an accurate forecast of the outbreak can help control the pandemic until a vaccine is available. Several machine learning and deep learning-based approaches are available to forecast the confirmed cases, but they lack the optimized temporal component and nonlinearity. To enhance the current forecasting frameworks’ capability, we proposed optimized long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to forecast COVID-19 cases and reduce mean absolute error. For the optimization of LSTM, we applied bat algorithm. Furthermore, to tackle the premature convergence and local minima problem of BA, we proposed an enhanced variant of BA. The proposed version utilized Gaussian adaptive inertia weight to control the individual velocity in the entire swarm. In addition, we substitute random walk with the Gaussian walk to observe the local search mechanism. The proposed LSTM examines the personal best solution with the swarm’s local best and preserves the optimal solution by combining the Gaussian walk. To evaluate the optimized LSTM, we compared it with the non-optimal version of LSTM, recurrent neural network, gated recurrent units, and other recent state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results prove the superiority of the optimized LSTM over other recent algorithms by obtaining 99.52\% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The direct measurement of speed in induction motors is costly and requires maintenance. Thus, sensorless techniques for estimating or predicting the speed in three-phase induction motors represent a feasible and economical solution. This work considers a single time delay neural network as a speed estimator in two different strategies of stator field-oriented induction motor drive: direct current and torque control. Time delay neural network makes the estimated signal robust against noise, that is usually found in switched power systems, and against disturbances on the input signals, since the estimator is not dependent only on instantaneous values. The synchronous speed and the electromagnetic torque, which are usual quantities in field oriented drives, are the inputs of the proposed neural estimator. In order to have a robust estimator facing induction motor parameter variations, the procedure of training and validating the neural networks are conducted with three different induction motors, from simulations to the experimental tests. An embedded system is also presented, and the scheme is tested considering various speed and load torque levels with different control strategies.},

  abstract     = {Past present future (PPF) is a new stochastic optimization algorithm inspired by the phenomena of the way an individual learns from a successful person in society. PPF is based on the concept of “future improvement of a person’s life depending on his/her past experience and present work.” The influence of successful persons also affects the improvement of the future life of an individual. This work develops a mathematical model for PPF following the above facts. In this new algorithm, the population is divided into subpopulations and a switching mechanism is followed among the subpopulations to track the change in optimal positions of an individual thereby accelerating the convergence rate. In addition, this switching mechanism also prevents pre-mature convergence. PPF was found to possess low computational complexity with fast convergence characteristics. The proposed PPF is compared with 41 up-to-date meta-heuristic algorithms taking an extensive set of benchmark functions to verify the efficiency. In addition, five classical engineering design problems are simulated to estimate the efficacy of the PPF algorithm in optimizing engineering problems. The results confirm the superior performance of the proposed algorithm to get the optimal solution with less iteration and have shown the best competitive performance compared to all other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Photovoltaic (PV) systems are becoming increasingly significant because they can convert solar energy into electricity. The conversion efficiency is related to the PV models’ parameters, so it is crucial to identify the parameters of PV models. Recently, various metaheuristic methods have been proposed to identify the parameters, but they cannot provide sufficient accurate and reliable performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes a spiral-based chaos chicken swarm optimization algorithm (SCCSO) including three strategies: (1) the information-sharing strategy provides the latest information of the roosters for searching global optimal solution, beneficial to improve the exploitation ability; (2) the spiral motion strategy can enable hens and chicks to move toward their corresponding targets with a spiral trajectory, improving the exploration ability; and (3) a self-adaptive-based chaotic disturbance mechanism is introduced around the global optimal solution to generate a promising solution for the worst chick at each iteration, thereby improving the convergence speed of the chicken flock. Besides, SCCSO is used for identifying different PV models such as the single-diode, the double-diode, and PV module models. Comprehensive analysis and experimental results show that SCCSO provides better robustness and accuracy than other advanced metaheuristic methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurate forecasting of various phenomenon has got crucial importance in the scenario of Indian agriculture as this helps farmers, policy-makers and government to acquire informed decisions. Agricultural time series datasets are mostly nonlinear, nonstationary, non-normal and heteroscedastic in nature. Though the stochastic model like autoregressive integrated moving average and its component models have gained much popularity in modeling linear dynamics, they fail to capture the nonlinearity present in the series. Machine learning (ML) techniques like artificial neural network (ANN) has rapidly emerged within the area of forecasting to take care of nonlinearity in the dataset. But, the presence of high chaotic nature and sophisticated nonlinear structure of the series sometimes distorts the particular model specification. Therefore, preprocessing of the series is required to extract the actual signal in it. Wavelet transformation may be an efficient tool in this scenario. The decomposed and denoised components through wavelet transformation can be modeled using ANN to make wavelet-based hybrid models and eventually, inverse wavelet transform is carried out to obtain the prediction of original series. The incontrovertible fact is that these hybrid models handle nonstationary, nonlinear and non-normal features of datasets simultaneously. The present study discusses the above approach envisaging monthly wholesale tomato price of three major markets in India, namely Ahmedabad, Burdwan and Madanapalli. The improvement over conventional techniques is obtained to a great extent by using wavelet-based combination approach with ML technique as exhibited through empirical evidence.},

  abstract     = {Pavement rutting refers to surface depression in the wheel-path along an asphalt road which causes loss of steering control and consequently leads to serious traffic accidents. Hence, it is necessary to develop powerful methods to accurately recognize pavement rutting during road condition survey. This study presents a novel computer vision-based model to automatically identify rutting on asphalt pavement road. The model is established based on a hybridization of image processing techniques (ITPs), least squares support vector classification (LSSVC), dynamic feature selection (FS) method, and forensic-based investigation (FBI). The ITPs, including Gabor filter and discrete cosine transform were employed to implement texture computation for image data. These techniques are used to generate an initial set of extracted features describing rutting and non-rutting states. The extracted features were then refined by a wrapper-based feature selection (FS) method to determine set of highly relevant features. LSSVC models were used to learn the categorization of rutting and non-rutting based on the refined features and hyper-parameters optimized by the FBI metaheuristic. The final LSSVC prediction model with the most desired prediction accuracy can be obtained once the process of the FBI’s optimization terminates. A dataset of 2000 image samples has been collected during field trip of pavement survey in Da Nang city (Vietnam) to construct and evaluate the newly developed model. The statistical results obtained from a k-fold cross-validation have demonstrated that the hybrid FBI-LSSVC-FS model can achieve the most desired rutting recognition performance with accuracy rate, precision, recall, and F1 score of 98.9\%, 0.994, 0.984 and 0.989, respectively. Therefore, this paper contributes to the body of knowledge by proposing a novel AI-based prediction model to assist transportation agencies in the task of periodic asphalt pavement survey.},

In this work, we show that in an incomplete information system, a novel approach for knowledge reduction is proposed from the discernibility techniques in multigranulation rough set theory. First, we introduce the notions of knowledge reduction in incomplete multigranulation approximation spaces, and prove that pessimistic lower and upper reduct results are different under the surrounding of decision attributes. Second, a decision function mapping each object into the decision options of its neighborhood granule is defined. To find knowledge reducts, three pairs of discernibility matrices and discernibility functions are sequentially measured. Third, the pessimistic lower (upper) approximation granular quality function is employed utilizing the dependent degree. We determine that pessimistic lower and upper consistent sets, respectively, are equivalent to pessimistic lower and upper approximation granular selections, respectively. In other words, these discernibility tools provide a unified standard with respect to knowledge reduction which aims to select valuable and remove worthless knowledges. Finally, numerical experiments using several datasets from UCI are given to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

On the basis of uncertainty theory, this paper presents an equation deformation method for solving unknown parameters in uncertain linear regression equations. We first establish the equation deformation method of one-dimensional linear regression model and then extend it to the case of multiple linear regression model. We also combine the equation deformation method with Cramer’s rule and matrix and propose the Cramer’s rule and matrix elementary transformation method to solve the unknown parameters of the uncertain linear regression equation. Numerical example show that the equation deformation method can effectively solve the unknown parameters of the uncertain linear regression equation.},

In contrast, American warrants enable the buyers to exercise their rights before or on the expiring date. Based on the assumption that the firm’s value follows an uncertain exponential Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process instead of a stochastic process, this paper mainly solves the pricing problems of European and American equity warrants. The most significant advantage of this paper is offering the corresponding formulas to calculate equity warrants, which are not complicated compared with the classical stochastic financial theory.

  abstract     = {This article presents a third-order accurate finite difference approximation for a general nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equation subject to Robin boundary conditions. A quasi-variable mesh with three grid points is constructed by introducing a successive mesh ratio parameter $$\eta$$ . For $$\eta = 1$$ , the mesh turns uniform, and the scheme transforms into a fourth-order one. First, a third-order discretization for the given differential equation is derived at each internal grid point, and further, two fourth-order discretizations are designed at the boundary points. The convergence analysis of the proposed method is discussed in the entire solution domain including two boundary points. Since the scheme involves ‘off-step’ mesh points, it is directly applicable to singular problems, which is its primary advantage. Moreover, the flexibility in the choice of $$\eta$$ enables us to construct a denser grid in the region of boundary layer and a sparser one outside it; hence, the boundary layer problems are effectively dealt with. This is further demonstrated by successful application of the proposed technique over twelve problems of physical significance including singularly perturbed, singular, nonlinear viscous Burgers’ equations and boundary layer problems. Computational results validate the order of the proposed technique, and a comparison with the already existing results in the recent past reveals its superiority.},

  abstract     = {Brushless direct current (BLDC) motor is widely used in many applications for its high reliability and simplicity. The motor fault-tolerant control is important for its continuous operation even under the fault condition. The fault diagnosis should be achieved to implement the fault-tolerant control method. In our proposed work, short-circuit (SC) and open-circuit (OC) faults are detected in brushless direct current (BLDC) motor by using advanced adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (AANFIS). AANFIS is a combination of social ski driver (SSD) and advanced adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for optimal feature selection and training process. There is no need to give entire data to the first (training) layer of ANFIS which reduces operational complexity, rapid learning capacity without expert knowledge as well as less training period and also SSD is used for the reduction of time complexity and fast convergence; thus, the reason for combining the ANFIS with SSD named as AANFIS is used for better output. Initially, BLDC drive speed is measured by signal speed oscillation. Discrete wavelet transform is used to extract the residual signal from BLDC. The amplitude and frequency of residual signal denote the open-circuit and short-circuit faults. Optimal feature selection will be performed by SSD in training stage of ANFIS. Fault diagnosis is performed through the layer of ANFIS structure and detected results are the outcomes of ANFIS. The proposed work will be implemented in Matlab/Simulink working platform. Resultant parameters like BLDC drive voltage and current analysis, fault diagnosis of BLDC drive with OC and SC, motor speed, torque and detection accuracy are evaluated. The power loss and accuracy are compared with ANN existing technique. The power loss of the existing ANN is 5.8\% and the proposed method of AANFIS is 3\% and the accuracy of the existing ANN is 97\% and proposed method of AANFIS is 98.5\%.

  abstract     = {The semantic and XML in document classification are used to develop XML data based on tree-based document classification method. The document classification plays the main role in the information management and its retrieval of data, which is a learning problem. In a development context, document classification has a major role in many applications, especially in classifying, organizing, searching and representing concisely large information volumes. A swarm-optimized tree-based association rule approach is presented for the classification of semi-structured data with the use of soft computing. To improve document classification, a tree pruning technique to prune weak and infrequent rules and a binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) method to optimize tree construction are proposed. An optimized tree-based association rule was proposed to improve XML documents classification based on BPSO, and tree pruning technique to prune weak/infrequent rules is presented. The method was evaluated by Reuters dataset. The Reuters dataset is applied for this method. Results show that the new method performs well for precision and recall compared with current methods.},

The search of long low autocorrelation binary sequences (LABS) is a classical but challenging research problem. Exhaustive sequence search is infeasible for large lengths due to its prohibitively high complexity. Albeit many algorithms on LABS search in the literature, they are effective for lengths up to a few hundred only. In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid algorithm which combines the strength of coordinate descent algorithm and the simulated annealing algorithm. Our proposed hybrid algorithm can efficiently generate long LABS of lengths up to several thousand and outperforms existing approaches in most cases.},

Though recent developments have advanced the theory of optimizations on manifolds considerably, when the unknown low-dimensional manifold is given in the form of a set of data in a high-dimensional space, a practical optimization method has yet to be developed. Here, we propose a neural network approach to these optimization problems. A neural network is used to approximate a neighborhood of a point, which will turn the computation of a next point in the searching process into a local constraint optimization problem. Our method ensures the convergence of the process. The proposed approach applies to optimizations on manifolds embedded into Euclidean spaces. Experimental results show that this approach can effectively solve optimization problems on unknown manifolds. The proposed method provides a useful tool to the field of study low-dimensional structures given by high-dimensional data.},

In this paper, we define the notion of (pre)ideal in bounded EQ-algebras (BEQ-algebras) and investigate some properties. Then, we introduce a congruence relation on good BEQ-algebras by using ideals, and then, we solve an open problem in Paad (2019). Moreover, we show that in IEQ-algebras, there is a one-to-one correspondence between congruence relations and the set of ideals. In the following, we characterize the generated preideal in BEQ-algebras, and by using this, we prove that the family of all preideals of a BEQ-algebra is a complete lattice. Then, we show that the family of all preideals of a prelinear IEQ-algebras is a distributive lattice and becomes a Heyting algebra. Finally, we show that we can construct an MV-algebra from the family of all preideals of a prelinear IEQ-algebra.},

Different classification methods have been used in the intrusion detection systems such as fuzzy, genetic algorithms, decision trees, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines. Moreover, ensemble classifiers have shown more robust and effective performance for various tasks in the field. In this paper, we adopt ensemble models in order to improve the performance of intrusion detection and, at the same time, decrease the false alarm rate. We use kNN for multi-class classification, as well as SVM to approach the classification problem in normal-based detection. In order to combine multiple outputs, we use the Dempster–Shafer method in which there is the possibility of explicit retrieval of uncertainty. Moreover, we utilize deep learning for extracting features to train the samples, selected by the sample selection algorithm based on ensemble margin. We compare our results with state-of-the-art methods on benchmarking datasets such as UNSW-NB15, CICIDS2017, and NSL-KDD.

Since the axiomatic method of approximation operator is of great significance in the research of the mathematical structure of rough set theory, it is a fundamental problem in axiomatic method to find the minimum set of abstract axioms. This paper first introduces the basic concepts, properties and related operations of hesitant fuzzy set, hesitant fuzzy rough set and hesitant fuzzy rough approximation operator. Secondly, by defining inner product, outer product and by exploring their related properties, the single axiomatization problem of the classical hesitant fuzzy rough approximation operator is solved. Furthermore, we study the single axiomatization of hesitant fuzzy rough approximation operators derived from serial, reflexive, symmetric and transitive hesitant fuzzy relations, respectively.

Effects of increasing sizes of sets of data to be classified are analyzed using geometrical properties of high-dimensional spaces. Their consequences on concentrations of values of sufficiently smooth functions of random variables around their mean values are applied. It is shown that the critical factor for suitability of a class of networks for computing randomly chosen classifiers is the maximum of sizes of the mean values of their correlations with network input–output functions.

The Augmented Gaussian Process is trained using only “reliable” information among available sources. A novel acquisition function is defined according to the Augmented Gaussian Process. Computational results are reported related to the optimization of the hyperparameters of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using two sources: a large dataset—the most expensive one—and a smaller portion of it.

The typical trade-off is between the used power and the adherence to a service-level metric subscribed by customers. To this aim, a possible idea is to use an optimization-based placement mechanism to select the servers where to deploy virtual machines. Unfortunately, high packing factors could lead to performance and security issues, e.g., virtual machines can compete for hardware resources or collude to leak data. Therefore, we introduce a multi-objective approach to compute optimal placement strategies considering different goals, such as the impact of hardware outages, the power required by the datacenter, and the performance perceived by users. Placement strategies are found by using a deep reinforcement learning framework to select the best placement heuristic for each virtual machine composing the workload. Results indicate that our method outperforms bin packing heuristics widely used in the literature when considering either synthetic or real workloads.},

  abstract     = {The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) widened its definition to incorporate aquatic conditions. The submarine sensor structures and intelligent underwater linked devices have been built into the IoT environment as the Internet of Underwater Things. Energy-sensitive and accurate data collection is carried out using extremely secure communications in underwater sensor networks that face major drawbacks like timing and place-dependent connectivity. Therefore in this paper, Optimized energy planning based intelligent data analytics has been proposed to offer a programming system for distributing intelligent data analytics underwater with high energy efficiency. IDA implements two stages: the first stage is to overcome a drawback caused by secret and expose terminals by a possibility-based disputing method. The second stage investigates the possibilities for slight specificity recovery by adding a space focused on transmitter and receiver. OEP is used to capture data through an activity that uses intelligent data focused on self-learning to identify highly secure and effective route directions across communication gaps in a sensor network. By balancing data traffic loading in a vast network, the OEP transport system minimizes greater energy usage and delay issues. In a controversial approach, IDA resolves a limitation of confidentiality and reveals terminals based on choice. OEP collects data via smart self-learning information to track safety and productive paths through connectivity holes in a sensor network. The experimental findings illustrate the improved results have been built in terms of the high packet distribution rate of 97.11\% and low latency, and less energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {With the development of science and technology and the improvement of people&#39;s quality of life, film and television animation has gradually become an important means to enrich people&#39;s daily entertainment and cultural exchanges. The inertial motion capture technology developed on the basis of motion capture has accelerated the development process of film and television animation, making film and television animation effects more colorful and precise in place. This paper presents a method of using inertial sensors to capture human arm motion. Using the quaternion information calculated by the inertial measurement unit, the positions of the joint points of the arm wrist, elbow and shoulder are obtained. The inertial data are transmitted to the host computer through the Bluetooth wireless communication method. The OptiTrack optical motion capture device with millimeter-level motion capture accuracy is used to obtain the position data of the human arm and use it as the reference position data. This paper analyzes the source of the zero-speed detection misdetection combined with experiments, and optimizes the detection algorithm based on the Laida criterion. On this basis, a complete trajectory capture Kalman filtering algorithm framework is constructed. Its embedded attitude depth correction module can effectively suppress the attitude of the angular error diverges. Finally, through physical experiments, the feasibility of the trajectory capture algorithm is verified in terms of accuracy and stability. The test shows that the trajectory capture algorithm described in this article can obtain a higher smoothness of the walking trajectory, so it can reduce the animation complex. The shaking of the human body model during the present process has important engineering significance.},

This leads to several environmental challenges, including global warming in which Plants and animals are affected significantly. The hybrid E-motorcycle (HE-M) is a technology that helps sort out these kinds of issues. Two or three power sources for complete rechargeable combustion are used in the hybrid electric motor. This paper used two independent electric power units: the drive unit and the integrated circuit (IC) motor unit. One power unit can be used up to 50–90 km from the electric drive and its eco-friendliness motor. It can be converted to an IC motor that makes the motorcycle more flexible, high-speed and long-distance operations. The initial motorcycle is fitted with continuous variable transmission. HE-M has been introduced to overcome the drawbacks and achieve high automatic mode performance. This paper consists of three HE-M modes, two energy management techniques applied, the HE-M servo motor control system and liquid crystal display monitor are addressed. Furthermore, road testing results explicitly demonstrate that the motor&#39;s pollutant emissions can be minimized at lower speeds or in operation causes and significantly enhanced by inadequate cruising space for electric motors.},

Companies and authorities may exchange state information in real-time concerning logistics. Whenever a stakeholder changes the state of one or more items, like offloading a container from a vessel, anyone who has access will know this immediately. Nowadays, edge computing becomes more and more attractive to offload the blockchain-enabled Internet of Things (IoT). Here, Computation resources trade inevitably takes place in edge-assisted IoT, which is more useful in shared logistic management. Cold start and long return are some of the main problems of successful trading of computing resources. Due to rising cost and emissions compliance with national and international rules, stakeholders have maximized their resources and integrated shipments. Dynamic distributed iterative computational model is presented to solve these issues. This helped in fast computing assets in shared logistic trading for edge-assisted blockchain-based IoT. Therefore, fast payment and daily transactions in IoT nodes can be made by creating resource coins based on the loan values of other IoT nodes. Broker implements special loan price rules to support borrowers and creditors in shared logistics. The hidden information could then be retrieved to achieve the optimum distribution of capital and loan estimate. The proposed algorithm can improve economic performance while protecting privacy for shared logistics payment management. The results showed the proposed algorithm could improve shared logistic security effectively compared to existing models in terms of performance ratio, user satisfaction ratio, repayment ability, etc.},

  abstract     = {Making autonomous driving a safe, feasible, and better alternative is one of the core problems the world is facing today. The horizon of the applications of AI and deep learning has changed the perspective of the human mind. Initially, what used to be thought of as the subtle impossible task is applicable today, and that too in the feasibly efficient way. Computer vision tasks powered with highly tuned CNNs are outperforming humans in many fields. Introductory implementations of the autonomous vehicle were merely achieved using raw image processing, and hard programmed rule-based logic systems along with machine/deep learning were used as secondary objective handlers. With the autonomous driving method proposed by Nvidia, the usability of CNNs is more adequate, adaptable, and applicable. In this paper, we propose the ensemble implementation of CNN-based regression models for autonomous driving. We have taken simulator generated driving view image dataset along with a mapped file of steering angle in radians. After applying image pre-processing and augmentation, we have used two CNN models along with their ensemble and compared their performance to minimize the risks of unsafe driving. We have compared Nvidia proposed CNN, MobileNet-V2 as regression model and Ensemble-M results for comparison of their respective performance, MSE scores and compute time to process. In result analysis, the MobileNet-V2 model performs better in densely featured roads and the Nvidia model performs better in sparsely featured roads, whereas Ensemble-M normalizes the performance of both models and efficiently results in the least MSE score (0.0201) with the highest computation time utilization making autonomous driving better, safer alternative.},

Hence, in this paper, machine vision-assisted effective monitoring analysis (MVEMA) model has been proposed to control total coal consumption under air quality constraints. Machine vision-assisted model (MVA) is nonintrusive and delivers reliable online measurements in a potentially harsh environment. MVA model is to estimate total coal consumption, which leads to air quality constraints. The constraints on air pollution from direct coal use include air quality, emission standards, and location restrictions. The industrial heating systems have air pollution control choices and control economic effects based on the machine vision system. The air quality constraints are evaluated based on the Air Quality Index. The simulation results show that the proposed MVEMA method diagnosing the progression conditions predicts the process performance at 98.33\% for diverse operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {Image segmentation is an essential phase in image analysis and computer vision. In computer vision, image processing denotes the analysis and handling of digital images to enhance their quality. Image processing becomes more challenging because of many complexes, noisy images from various sources in selecting applications, requiring minimal computational time/cost procedures and higher accuracy. Hence, in this paper, Chaos Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CCSA) has been suggested to resolve image segmentation and improve image accuracy. An un-deterministic problem is the challenge of unsure pixel detection and rim formulation for picture segmentation. The use of CV and optimization approaches has reduced the uncertainty about restricted picture characteristics. Ergodicity and stochasticity are formulated in this proposal which fulfill certain pixel and edge detection. Heterogeneous picture patterns solve the insecurity with chaotic maps and an Algorithm of Cuckoo Search. Unlike ordinary cuckoo searches, the chaotic mapping fuses deterministic search and stochastic validations. Chaos belongs to a characteristic of nonlinear models. Chaotic motion ensures homogeneity within a certain range since it has obsessed ergodicity, uncertainty, and stochasticity. The proposed model automates algorithms&#39; settings and delivers optimal parameters for computer vision applications and image segmentation. Furthermore, a local search approach is utilized to enhance the outcomes in the cuckoo search algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed CCSA model enhances accuracy and reduces uncertainty compared to other existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {The careless activity of drivers in logistics transportation is a primary reason inside the vehicle during road accidents. This research aims to reduce the number of accidents caused by a failure of the driver in logistics transportation by incorporating an autonomous system. We propose a convolutional neural network -based architecture to recognize and classify different positions which cause road accidents. The proposed system is evaluated with the State Farm Distracted Driver Database, which included examples illustrating ten different driving positions like reaching behind and talking to the passenger, making up, safe driving, talking on the phone, clothing, checking right/left hand, right/left hand, and running the radio. The proposed approach has also been tested against recent algorithms and evaluated. Our model has obtained 98.98\% accuracy compared to other types of approaches with different descriptors and classification techniques},

  abstract     = {The advent of cloud infrastructure in which third-party cloud services may retain sensitive consumer and company data in storage environments underlines the need to advocate for encryption and multi-tenant shared processing as a primary security mechanism. Digital information movement, storage, and processing are widely defined in terms of &quot;Data in Motion,” &quot;Data at Rest,&quot; and &quot;Data in Usage,&quot; respectively. The implementation of security methods for each of these states can be viewed similarly. Transit data applies to data when being moved from one source of data to another. Transit data contains data sent across the network from back-end clients, programs, and repositories. There could be two data centers inside the same organizational network in the cloud, as a member of completely separate networks. This paper presents a novel architecture data-in-transit defender (DiTD), to protect data in transit; DiTD provides a novel security framework based on high-performance cloud computing. This protocol enables more efficient use of the key strength and time of symmetric block encrypted data, public-key cryptography (PUKC), cryptographic hash, and brief key exchange function.},

  abstract     = {Smart agriculture has been a promising model to supervise farms utilizing contemporary wireless technologies to enhance the quantity and quality of yield at the same time as minimizing the individual labor requirement. Also, the effective utilization of the sensors as communication components is the key one to monitor and manage soil, water, light, humidity, temperature. A mobile ad hoc sensor node comprises sensors to gather a real-time environment from the agricultural land with wireless communication technology and process the data before sharing information with other nodes in the network. On the other hand, the challenges have been enormously high path loss and lack of communication range under the environment when passing through the soil, sand, water, and other climatic conditions. As wireless sensor network (WSN) has self-organized and ad hoc wireless capability to monitor physical or environmental conditions, it can be used effectively in smart agriculture. As sensor nodes have been limited by means of power to be inactive mode always, the design of such energy-efficient agriculture WSN is a paramount issue. Hence, it has been planned to utilize the WSN as well as ubiquitous technology for smart agriculture with energy efficiency. With the purpose of building up a model, a ubiquitous agriculture mobile sensor network-based threshold built-in MAC routing protocol (TBMP) has been proposed to make it fit for minimal resource utilization by comparing with the existing protocols IMR and PTSR. The necessary resources for agriculture sensor network have been temperature, soil, and water. Also, the testing will be done to monitor changes in environmental surroundings in the agricultural land smartly to obtain maximum usage of the ubiquitous concept by applying existing and proposed protocols.},

The IoT technologies in digital marketing have virtually no detailed and interconnected view detecting the growth in E-marketing.

Therefore in this paper, the Internet of things-assisted E-marketing and distribution framework (IoT-EDF) has been proposed to improve the marketing strategies in the different phases of the distribution, procurement, and promotion process E-marketing. IoT-EDF is implemented for customer retention actions and focuses on data that are the strongest sources of information. The IoT offers an unparalleled way to collect data via client support. EDF allows the acceptance of nonprofit e-marketing by nonprofits with soft computing and varies largely from the potential for the preparation of marketing distribution. Moreover, preparation affects the adoption of e-marketing greatly, and adopting capability plays a crucial role in effective acceptance. The results found that top management&#39;s concentration on e-marketing contributes to the acceptance of e-marketing. The Internet of things impacts related marketing fields, including goods, place, price, advertising, procedures, and the hard evidence, based upon the findings from the proposed IoT-EDF .

By considering the significance of the security requirement in smart city applications connected with the Internet of Things, this manuscript introduces a rational attribute-based data fusion trust model. The proposed trust model relies on different timely attributes for identifying the reputation of the available service. This reputation is computed as the accumulative factor of trust observed at different times and details. The attributes and the uncertain characteristics of the service provider in the successive sharing instances are recurrently analyzed using deep machine learning to fuse uncertain-less data. This data fusion method reduces the uncertainties in estimating the precise trust during different application responses and service dissemination.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, smart vehicles can exchange data through various communication protocols in response to technological developments in smart transport systems. Smart vehicles show the perfect model for a cyber-physical system when electronic components and physical devices are embedded in them. The incorporation of computer, network and physical methods are the cyber-physical systems (CPS). Integrated Systems and Network control and manage physical processes, feedback mechanisms that influence physical computation processes and vice versa. Cyber-devices, including hardware, software applications, are protected from cyber-attacks through cybersecurity. Individuals and businesses use this strategy to shield themselves from unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized networks. As the IoT and data remain fundamentally related, virtual vehicle hijacking is possible in the transport network&#39;s evolving design. Hence in this paper, IoT-based Advanced Electronic Cyber-Physical System (AE-CPS) has been proposed to minimize the cyber-attack and enhance security for the smart vehicle. Cyber-assault involves cyber-criminals launching a single computer or several computers or networks with one or more computers. A cyber-attack can maliciously deactivate computers, stolen data, or use a broken computer for other attacks. A cyber-attack happens when a hacker attempt to obtain unauthorized access to a computer or network data. It happens when information without permission is accessed. Personal details, such as social security numbers, passwords, and financial account numbers, may be included. First, a state-space structure reflects the driverless, smart vehicle with the board viewing system. The IoT embedded sensors monitor the device states since the smart vehicles and control center has been far from everyone. The vehicle&#39;s sensing data is sent through an insecure communication channel to the control center, where attacks occur. The optimal status estimate algorithm is derived from the mean square error theory for the vehicle conditions&#39; information and visualization. The optimization algorithm focused on the partial definite programming approach is designed to govern the vehicle states. The experimental results show that there are less delay and a high-performance rate of 98.97\%. high security rate (95.23\%), time stages (8.12\%), state reaction rate (90.9\%), error rate (6.45\%), evaluation metrics (93.6\%), reaction time (1.44\%), feedback period (96.88\%) when compared to other methods.},

Creating a higher degree of communication in automobiles results in the time wastage, fuel wastage, environmental damage, and even death caused by citizens being trapped in the middle of traffic. Only a few researchers work in traffic congestion prediction and control systems, but it may provide less accuracy. So, this paper proposed an efficient IoT-based traffic prediction using OWENN algorithm and traffic signal control system using Intel 80,286 microprocessor for a smart city. The proposed system consists of ‘5’ phases, namely IoT data collection, feature extraction, classification, optimized traffic IoT values, and traffic signal control system. Initially, the IoT traffic data are collected from the dataset. After that, traffic, weather, and direction information are extracted, and these extracted features are given as input to the OWENN classifier, which classifies which place has more traffic. Suppose one direction of the place has more traffic, it optimizes the IoT values by using IBSO, and finally, the traffic is controlled by using Intel 80,286 microprocessor. An efficient OWENN algorithm for traffic prediction and traffic signal control using a Intel 80,286 microprocessor for a smart city. After extracting the features, the classification is performed in this step. Hereabout, the classification is done by using the optimized weight Elman neural network (OWENN) algorithm that classifies which places have more traffic. OWENN attains 98.23\% accuracy than existing model also its achieved 96.69\% F-score than existing model.

  abstract     = {To address the heterogeneity problem of sensor data, it is necessary to conduct the Sensor Ontology Matching (SOM) process to find the mappings among diverse sensor data with the same semantics connotation. Currently, many Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been used to match the ontologies, which aim at finding a set of solutions called Pareto Set (PS) in the Pareto Front (PF) to represent a set of trade-off proposals for different Decision Makers (DMs). Being inspired by the success of MOEA with Inverse Model (IM-MOEA) in solving complicated optimization problems, in this work, an Improved IM-MOEA (I-IM-MOEA)-based matching technique is further proposed to enhance the algorithm’s matching efficiency as well as the alignment’s quality. To overcome the drawback of IM-MOEA that has poor performance on irregular PF, an adjusted selection mechanism is employed to avert the massive reduction in non-domination solutions on irregular PF, a dynamic Reference Vectors (RVs) is used to decrease the computational resources and boost the efficiency of the algorithm, and a local search strategy is introduced to promote the results’ quality. The experiment employs the benchmark provided by Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) and three sensor ontologies to assess the performance of I-IM-MOEA, and the experimental results show that I-IM-MOEA is both effective and efficient.},

  abstract     = {Smart energy management improves the efficiency of the services and computing systems operated in a smart city environment. The heterogeneous environment makes use of artificial intelligence allied technologies for energy management. Depending upon the service data and its processing, energy management is proliferated for providing reliable service outcomes. In this paper, Enduring Data Analytics for Energy Management (EDA-EM) is proposed. The proposed method makes use of data distribution factors for optimal energy distribution. In this process, the cumulative and independent data streams require different energy requirements. This requirement is identified using principal component analysis for identifying other data streams. The data stream is a series of feature vectors describing one or more underlying patterns together. A stream framework demonstrates how the underlying patterns of different stream elements can be reconstructed. The stream classification helps to allocate desired energy without overloaded instances in the big data processing. The remaining and available renewable energy is distributed for the classified streams in handling big data. Big data streaming indicates that Big Data is processed rapidly to gain insight into it in virtual environments. The production data are in movement. The data are in trend. Ideally, big data streaming is a frequency solution that processes a prolonged data stream. In this allocation process, renewable energy available for the successive handling interval is predicted for improving the seamlessness in the data processing. The proposed method&#39;s performance is verified using energy distribution ratio, conservation rate, and data loses, processing rate, and processing delay. In EDA-EM, the achieved distribution ratio is 95.13\% which is comparatively reasonable than other approaches.},

IoT infrastructure requires networks for which 5G network is developed. Indeed global interest and the advancement in 5G networks has transformed the vision of smart cities into reality in terms of smart homes, smart consumer items, driverless cars, and similar daily appliances. Congestion in traffic affected the areas around the world and causing different issues like fuel wastage, anxiety, and delayed conveyances problems. To locate the exact location of congestion is one of the significant problem in the intelligent transportation system. It perceives the variation from the norm of traffic with the assistance of various sensors utilized in the progression of traffic. So far the development of intelligent transportation system given the capacity to researchers to investigate new procedures for finding the congested zones. This paper proposes the novel model for the prediction of traffic congestion in internet of vehicle using information fusion with artificial neural network and support vector machine. The proposed model obtained 98.4\% accuracy, which is greater than previously mentioned approaches in the literature.},

This ABCA applicability can be used as an ad hoc vehicle for minimizing DDoS attacks. A Variant Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (VABCA) is available in this paper for optimizing the selection of a vehicle node for substitution of the damaged DDoS vehicle node. VABCA is an improved ABCA version which uses two search strategies based on differential evolution in the onlooker bee and an integrated Chaotic and opposition learning in scout bee. The principal goal of VABCA is to increase the global optimum detection point in DDoS attacks and to have a good degree of convergence rate and efficiency in order to distinguish the best solutions from the workable solutions. The VABCA simulation findings show that DDoS mitigation is potent by encouraging an approximately 22\% rate higher in convergence than in the comparative research baseline mitigation schemes.},

In this paper, an innovative control-driven autonomous authentication scheme is proposed for improving the access security of P2P industrial systems. The proposed scheme provides authentication based on P2P system control requirements within its access time. The P2P control systems and their functionalities are provided with classified security measures for administering autonomous security. The advantage of offering autonomous protection is to prevent the sequence of security breaches and control sabotage. In this process, the control system requirements and authentications are paired by identifying the machines&#39; operating time and access time. For identification and grouping-based classification, support vector machines are used. It learns the sabotage and control requirements based on access and control time for providing a rupture-less industrial process. It helps to leverage the detection of autonomous adversaries in P2P industrial control systems. Besides, a less complex and latent-free security measure is achievable using the proposed scheme.},

Security of healthcare system is to be considered as an important issue due to the huge volume of users and their secret data availability in this fast internet era and cloud databases. To store the patient’s health data securely in the form of electronic version raises the concerns about the patient data privacy and security. Moreover, handling volume of data is also very complex task today with normal classifiers. For this purpose, many deep learning algorithms are available for classifying the huge volume of data successfully. For these all purposes, we propose a new healthcare monitoring system to monitor the disease level by predicting the diseases according to the original data that are collected from the patients who are available in remote places. Moreover, we propose a secured data storage model for storing the patient’s data securely in cloud databases. Here, we introduce two new cryptographic algorithms for performing encryption and decryption processes. The experiments have been conducted for evaluating the performance of health monitoring system according to the particular diseases such as heart and diabetic diseases. This work considered the UCI medical dataset and the data collected from patients whose are available remotely through IoT devices. The proposed system is evaluated based on sensitivity, specificity, F-measure and prediction accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms the existing e-healthcare systems.},

In this article, a distributed multi-party security computation framework for ensuring the security level of scalable information sharing and communications in heterogeneous IoT. This computation framework uses synchronized security measures through recurrent verification on different communicating ends of the devices. In this verification process, backpropagation learning verifies end-to-end security and the communication session between the connected devices. MPC is generally subject to a significant overhead for correspondence but has the benefit of being confidential even if pursued until a substantial percentage of the participants are aggressive and coordinated. Secret MPC exchanging will protect the specifications of both models and the training/inference information. The multi-party verification relies on both device and service providers for unanimously synchronizing the different security computations in a less complex manner. This framework is reliable in mitigating man-in-middle and information loss adversaries. The performance of the proposed method is verified using the metrics detection ratio, response rate, delay, and overhead.},

The tunnel has an extra-large cross section, and it is a low flat-ration railway tunnel. This paper mainly describes the finite element analysis for this tunnel excavation that was used to guide the construction. Finite element software was used to model the tunnel according to the engineering geological conditions of the tunnel. These engineering geological conditions included the rock mass, system bolts, middle pipe shed, steel arch and shotcrete, grouting layer, second lining and so on. Nonlinear construction phase analysis was adopted. The results showed that the maximum vertical deformation of the tunnel vault and the middle of the invert was about 34 mm. The vertical deformation of the tunnel could be divided into an acceleration deformation section, linear deformation section, deceleration deformation section, and stable deformation section. The maximum horizontal deformation in the middle of the side wall was about 12.3 mm. Under the effect of the initial support, the equivalent stress of the side wall gradually increased with the excavation of the steps and the increase in the support structure. The axial force of the bolt in the middle of the side wall was larger than that in other places and the axial force of the middle pipe shed went along with the excavation of the tunnel in waves. The steel arch and the shotcrete had the maximum effective stress at the arch shoulder, which played the role of the deformation and pressure for the surrounding rock. During the construction, the length and height of the three-step method had to be set reasonably. The middle pipe shed and the system bolt supported the rock mass together. In the construction of the extra-large cross section and the flat tunnel, there was no need to set up temporary support, which was convenient for mechanical excavation.},

To solve this problem, this paper designs a new route planning method for cross-border e-commerce logistics of agricultural products based on recurrent neural network. Firstly, by calculating the speed of logistics vehicles under different traffic flow conditions, on the basis of analyzing the travel time of cross-border e-commerce logistics route of agricultural products, combining with the ratio of the carrying capacity to the maximum carrying capacity of cross-border e-commerce logistics routes of agricultural products, the driving speed of logistics vehicles is derived. In order to select the optimal distribution path, the total fixed cost, transportation damage cost and cargo damage cost in the process of agricultural product distribution are calculated. Combined with the penalty cost, the recursive neural network is used to establish the logistics route planning model and planning process of agricultural products’ cross-border e-commerce. The experimental results show that: the route planning method for cross-border e-commerce logistics of agricultural products based on recurrent neural network can effectively resist the influence of external factors, so as to obtain the optimal route of cross-border e-commerce logistics of agricultural products.},

This research discusses the implementation of a system that allows the acquisition of data to characterize the noise generated by road traffic. First, the methodology for obtaining acoustic indicators with an electret measurement microphone is described, so that it adjusts to the data collection needs for road traffic noise analyses. Then, an approach for the classification and counting of automatic vehicular traffic through deep learning is presented. Results showed that there were differences of 0.2 dBA in terms of RMSE between a type 1 sound level meter and the measurement microphone used. With reference to vehicle classification and counting for four categories, the approximate error is between 3.3\% and -15.5\%.},

The priority based on the job is the fuzzy variable, which shows the status of the job, based on which the next job will be selected for the processing in the machine.

  abstract     = {In this paper, traffic and vehicle density optimization issues are discussed, and a suitable solution for autonomous driving environments is proposed. The problem of scalable traffic flow management is hindered by the unpredictable vehicle density and its navigation. This problem increases the flow congestion at the intersection during the change of lane in particular. This paper introduces density-scaling traffic management for autonomous vehicle driving scenarios. The proposed technique relies on navigation output and the autonomous vehicles&#39; trajectory decisions for predicting their availability and time duration. The traffic flow is streamlines based on the predictions; the prediction error is mitigated by rescheduling the successive traffic flow. In this process, predictive iterated learning is employed for improving the scalable traffic flows in an intersection. The predictive learning handles navigation assistance output change of trajectory independently and correlates the decisions&#39; match. The process of prediction matching is performed for improving the flow management with the time factor. The traffic management technique is useful in providing latency-less travel and errorless decision and flow complexity and collision probability.},

  abstract     = {The ability to efficiently reschedule the trains when disturbances occur is one among the vital factors in attaining higher punctuality on railway traffic systems. Numerous techniques were developed to carry out train rescheduling, but the existing methodologies don&#39;t consider the probability of conflicts (or) disturbance analysis (DA). Thus, in this paper, an efficient method of train rescheduling (TRS) system is proposed utilizing the Brownian motion weighted-based salp swarm optimization (BMW-SSO) algorithm. The proposed technique follows two processes: (i) DA and (ii) rescheduling. Primarily, the track detail is collected as an input, and the disturbances are identified utilizing the modified weight-based deep learning neural network. If any disturbance occurs, then the TRS process is performed utilizing the BMW-SSO. Aimed at this, the current timetable is utilized as an input, and some constraints are extracted from the input utilizing multi-choice mixed integer goal programming. After that, finally, the BMW-SSO chooses and optimizes the best constraints from the extracted constraints as well as reschedules the timetable. Here, the BMW-SSO alternatively chooses the best third rescheduling timetable. Subsequent to generating TRS, the first rescheduled timetable’s feasibility is checked centred on the dictionary-centred checking technique. If the first rescheduled timetable is feasible, then it is signified as the optimal timetable. Otherwise, the second-created rescheduled timetable is utilized. And if the second one is unfeasible, then the thirdly created timetable is utilized. At last, the experiential examination confirms the proposed train timetable rescheduling (TTR) system’s performance regarding the timetable deviation, operation cost, along with dwell time. The proposed TTR consumes low time while analogized with the scheduled table.},

Automatically guided vehicles depend on environmental data for executing target-oriented navigation and movements. The traffic knowledge can be used by automatically guided vehicles by measuring their intensity and delivery date in the green light. Therefore, considering sensor data&#39;s significance in this guided vehicle environment, this article presents the Internet of Things (IoT) assisted automated guided vehicle (IoT-AGV) scheme. IoT-AGV scheme discusses the implementation of an autonomous vehicle traffic control program at crossings. The traffic knowledge operator is ready to retrieve details from the sensor utilizing quick communication through a mobile network to measure optimum travel time and transmit the information collected to automated cars. In an automated guided vehicle (AGV) scheme, the automotive-into-loop model is introduced to eliminate delays. Error indicator integrates various hurdle imbalance statistics calculated from the sensor based on the road slide. A deep neural network focuses on a minimal collection of the most critical features, eliminating the fitting problem. This aids determine the error producing sensor data and alleviate them from fusion to enhance the target&#39;s accuracy. The experimental results show that the suggested system has been validated by the images from BIT vehicle datasets and enhances the accuracy ratio of 96.22\% to measure optimum travel time and transmit the information collected to automated guided vehicles.},

Utilizing a parametric form of triangular fuzzy numbers such as left fuzziness index, right fuzziness index, modal value and by using proposed algorithm, we obtained the initial basic fuzzy feasible solution to the problem without changing to its crisp equivalent form. To obtain the solution, we use fuzzy ranking dependent on left and right spreads at some S-level of fuzzy numbers and fuzzy arithmetic dependent on both location index function and fuzziness index function. We further discuss the more for less solution by obtaining shadow prices to the problem. The more for less situation occurs when we raise the supplies, and demand quantities may cause to reduce the optimal transportation cost. The more for less paradox is very useful to a manager in dynamic, for example expanding an item house loading level or plant age breaking point and publicizing attempts to build request at explicit markets.

Recent advances in detection and classification methodologies have shown phenomenal improvements in accuracy but these systems require a huge number of computational resources making them unviable for deployment requiring real-time feedback. This paper proposes a methodology to develop a reliable and computationally inexpensive real-time automatic accident detection system that can be deployed with minimum hardware requirements. Specifically, we split our AAD system into three major stages (Detection, Tracking and Classification) and propose algorithms for each stage with reduced computational need. For the detection stage, we propose Mini-YOLO, a deep learning model architecture trained using knowledge distillation that has comparable accuracy with its counterpart YOLO(You-Only-Look-Once) with reduced model size and computational overhead. Mini-YOLO achieves an average precision (AP) score of 34.2 on the MS-COCO dataset while outperforming all other detection algorithms in runtime complexity, achieving a staggering 28 frames per second on a low-end machine. For the tracking stage, we adopt SORT (Simple Online Real-time Tracking) and for classification stage, we compare multiple machine learning algorithms and show that a support vector machine with radial basis kernel performs the best with an area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.98, model size of 448 KB (kilobytes) and 12.73 ms (milliseconds) latency.},

In this article, the self-controlled touring and movement (SCTM) method is proposed to design, plan, and execute autonomous vehicle movements. The goal of this method is to improve the output of vehicle movements under controlled operating errors. For this purpose, the user requirement and outputs are identified and estimated beforehand for providing effective vehicle navigation plans. This error, balancing with the demands and outputs, is performed using classification learning wherein the changes of the vehicle’s movements are frequently updated. Further changes are performed within the completion of the tour plan for retaining operational efficiency of the autonomous vehicle. This method is verified using the following metrics: percent of changes, operating error, delay, balancing factor, and response. The proposed SCTM reduces error by 9.73\% and delay by 17.1\%, whereas it increases the balancing factor by 8.3\% for different tour instances.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous transportation is an inevitable means of day-to-day activity that supports a country’s economic growth. Effective communication systems design is an incentive for autonomous vehicles’ protection and comfort to be further extended. Inter-vehicle communication and effective ways for the user to communicate with the autonomous vehicle and the communication systems’ elements for autonomous vehicles need to be considered. Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a prominent roadside communication-assisting technology designed to serve the purpose. Mitigating communication errors in transportation prevent service interruptions and ease information access. External and internal communication lags need to be addressed to sustain uninterrupted communication. To improve communication reliability, an opportunistic data dissemination model is introduced in this paper. This dissemination model observes storage and processing communication demands and time dependency to assist roadside communication. The observations are processed by a neural-network-based learning scheme to respond precisely to users’ requests by pre-estimating vehicular and communication storage and time requirements. The communicating autonomous transport system is notified of the time and storage dependency of the requests to improve data dissemination. The communication status is updated with the infrastructure-assisted connecting technologies to ensure better VANET performance. The experimental results achieve a high resource utilization ratio of 93.4\%, throughput 8.3 Mbps, less response time of 288.53 ms, request loss of 1.9\%, and average delay of 60 ms compared to other existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The efficiency of tunnel boring machines (TBMs) in underground projects has great significance for the mining and tunneling industries, demanding a reliable estimation of the TBM’s performance in different geotechnical conditions. The current research work attempted to suggest an optimal predictor model of TBM performance as a reliable alternative to experimental and numerical techniques. To achieve this target, three data-mining techniques, namely neural network (NN), gene expression programming (GEP), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), were employed for modelling the TBM performance, and then the most robust predictive model was optimized via a metaheuristic search method known as whale optimization algorithm (WOA). For the modelling purpose, an experimental database was compiled by performing a field assessment program in a tunneling project in Malaysia and then conducting laboratory testing on the derived rock specimens. Based on the measured experimental data, the six most influential parameters were identified and served as model inputs to predict penetration rate (PR). In order to indicate the capability of the developed GEP and NN models, a stepwise linear regression model, i.e., MARS, was designed for PR prediction as well. The predictive capacity of the constructed models was quantified using a series of statistical indices, i.e., root mean squared error (RMSE), determination coefficient (R2) and variance account for (VAF). Based on the computed indices for testing records, both the proposed GEP and NN models (with RMSE values of 0.1882 and 0.2120 and R2 values of 0.9058 and 0.8735, respectively) yielded more accurate predictive results than the MARS model with RMSE of 0.2553 and R2 of 0.8346. Hence, by achieving the most robust performance compared to the rest, GEP-based model can provide a new practical equation with a high level of accuracy. In other part of this study, the six input parameters of the GEP model and its equation were, respectively, defined as decision variables and objective function for the WOA technique to find the optimum values of PR. As a consequence of optimizing the GEP equation, the maximum value of PR rose from 3.75 m/h to 4.022 m/h, equivalent to an increase of 7.25\% in PR value. The findings of this study verified the applicability of the proposed hybrid GEP and WOA approach in the site investigation phase of tunneling projects constructed by TBMs.},

We allow for a continuous evolution of the demographic-economic system based on a migration’s rule which is refreshed in discrete time, i.e., at the monitoring times. Therefore, the migration’s probabilities are discretely updated through a technique based on the combinatorial distributions of claims’ arrival in the rating classes. This technique is hierarchical copula-based, a natural tool permitting us to represent the co-movement between claims’ arrivals and distorted due to the formalization of an arrival policy of claims, that restricts the set of combinatorial distributions to those representing the most probable scenarios, therefore distorting the loss function. At every monitoring date, the copula-based model computes the migration’s probabilities and the loss function which accommodates for a discrete-time dynamic of the claims’ reserving and the capital requirements. An empirical application, the evaluation of the claims’ reserving and the capital requirements for different kinds of hierarchies are analyzed, with real data originating with the General Insurance Association of Singapore.},

  abstract     = {Automatic factor extraction is to extract the relevant facts from the case to assist the judge in the intelligent decision-making of civil disputes. Previously, the existing methods mainly focus on context-free word embeddings to deal with extraction tasks in the field of law, which cannot get a better semantic understanding of the text and in turn leads to an adverse extraction performance. Therefore, in this paper, a deep contextualized embeddings-based method called the knowledge-guided civil case fact elements extraction (KGCEE) model to automatically extract civil fact elements in the civil case domain is proposed. This approach is mainly based on the RoBERTa, but a few techniques make a more powerful model. Firstly, the model is retrained with civil domain data to provide more sensitive weight to initialize the model parameters in the downstream task. Secondly, the extraction is transformed into a sentence pairs task and we have incorporated data by leveraging label information to improve the generalization ability of the model. Thirdly, at the beginning of the KGCEE, we propose to inject part-of-speech information to the word embeddings to enhance the ability to capture the semantic and syntactic information, which aims to obtain better text representations. Finally, the KGCEE method is evaluated under civil domain data such as marriage and family, labor disputes and loan contracts originally from Chinese AI and Law (CAIL). The experimental results demonstrate that our KGCEE method outperforms other context-free word embeddings methods and other traditional transformer-based methods.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, people pay increasing attention to health, and the integrity of medical records has been put into focus. Recently, medical data imputation has become a very active field because medical data usually have missing values. Many imputation methods have been proposed, but many model-based imputation methods such as expectation–maximization and regression-based imputation based on the variables data have a multivariate normal distribution, which assumption can lead to biased results. Sometimes, this becomes a bottleneck, such as computationally more complex than model-free methods. Furthermore, directly removing instances with missing values has several problems, and it is possible to lose the important data, produce ineffective research samples, and cause research deviations. Therefore, this study proposes a novel clustering-based purity and distance imputation method to improve the handling of missing values. In the experiment, we collected eight different medical datasets to compare the proposed imputation methods with the listed imputation methods with regard to the results of different situations. In imputation measures, the area under the curve (AUC) is used to evaluate the performance of the imbalanced class datasets in MAR and MCAR experiments, and accuracy is applied to measure its performance of the balanced class in MNAR experiment. Finally, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is also used to compare the proposed and the listing imputation methods. In addition, this study utilized the elbow method and the average silhouette method to find the optimal number of clusters for all datasets. Results showed that the proposed imputation method could improve imputation performance in the accuracy, AUC, and RMSE of different missing degrees and missing types.},

A subset of users among all the available users should be allowed to send their data to the appropriate receive antenna of the base station (BS). The search space for assigning appropriate user with the appropriate receive antenna of the BS is very large. Searching through this large search space is quite time-consuming process which cannot be accomplished within the real-time frame. To overcome this, ACO and GWO soft computing techniques have been implemented for this problem. In this paper, it is shown that both ACO and GWO accomplish this huge task with very low computation complexity. Simulation results presented in this paper are verifying the effectiveness of ACO and GWO for solving such complex problems. Moreover, it has also been showcased that GWO performs better than ACO and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) techniques. Both GWO and ACO attains the system sum-rate very close to that of exhaustive search algorithm.

The main goal of reliability optimization is to construct highly reliable system or to design maximum reliable system so that the system can run smoothly without any hindrance under some restrictions in the form of constraints for a specified period of time maintaining the safety and efficiency. In this paper, we consider Redundancy Allocation Problem (RAP) involving time dependent component reliabilities for optimizing system reliability of the problem designed. Moreover, we have considered a new objective function as the Mission Design Life (MDL) of reliable system. The MDL is found by integrating the system reliability with respect to time from zero to mission time. This consideration makes the problem more realistic by taking the fact into account that reliability of the system varies with time. Here, we have maximized the Mission Design Life of reliable system with the time dependent component reliabilities by implementing the proposed Blended WQPSO (BWQPSO). The BWQPSO is developed by incorporating the Big-M penalty function in the Weighted Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization and it is found to perform highly satisfactorily to solve the highly nonlinear combinatorial problem so designed as a time dependent redundancy allocation problem. Again, to tackle the uncertain behaviour of controlling parameters, we incorporated the fuzziness and intuitionistic fuzziness to develop the imprecise models. The three types of problems designed here are supplemented by numerical examples. The numerical experiments are carried out in each of the environments and comparative studies are presented. The statistical analysis along with computational time and convergence of the proposed algorithm are also produced.},

It is critical to have an accurate estimate of its parameters, as it will impact the company’s revenue. The learning has to be performed very efficiently using a small window of a few test points, because of the rapid changes in price demand parameters due to seasonality and fluctuations. However, there are conflicting goals when seeking the two objectives of revenue maximization and demand learning, known as the learn/earn trade-off. This is akin to the exploration/exploitation trade-off that we encounter in machine learning and optimization algorithms. In this paper, we consider the problem of price demand function estimation, taking into account its exploration–exploitation characteristic. We design a new objective function that combines both aspects. This objective function is essentially the revenue minus a term that measures the error in parameter estimates. Recursive algorithms that optimize this objective function are derived. The proposed method outperforms other existing approaches.},

The results show that inventory and price display a positive relationship. The optimal inventory and price decrease with the return cost, consumers’ travel cost, and the proportion of low-value consumers, while they increase with consumers’ beliefs regarding the inventory availability rate. Online sales outperform store sales when there are more low-value consumers. Adopting a BORS policy may reduce price and inventory but increase profit when consumers’ store return cost is high or the firm’s store return cost is low. In addition, when the long-term additional favorable effect of the store return is large, the firm can derive more profit through BORS policy.},

  abstract     = {Given the escalating healthcare costs around the world (more than 10\% of the world&#39;s GDP) and increasing demand hospitals are under constant scrutiny in terms of managing services with limited resources and tighter budgets. Hospitals endeavour to find sustainable solutions for a variety of challenges ranging from productivity enhancements to resource allocation. For instance, in the UK, evidence suggests that hospitals are struggling due to increased delayed transfers of care, bed-occupancy rates well above the recommended levels of 85\% and unmet A&amp;E performance targets. In this paper, we present a hybrid forecasting-simulation-optimisation model for an NHS Foundation Trust in the UK. Using the Hospital Episode Statistics dataset for A&amp;E, outpatient and inpatient services, we estimate the future patient demands for each speciality and model how it behaves with the forecasted activity in the future. Discrete event simulation is used to capture the entire hospital within a simulation environment, where the outputs is used as inputs into a multi-period integer linear programming (MILP) model to predict three vital resource requirements (on a monthly basis over a 1-year period), namely beds, physicians and nurses. We further carry out a sensitivity analysis to establish the robustness of solutions to changes in parameters, such as nurse-to-bed ratio. This type of modelling framework is developed for the first time to better plan the needs of hospitals now and into the future.},

  abstract     = {In construction industry, general contractors (GCs) need to manage and conduct numerous projects simultaneously. To this aim, they usually have subcontractors conduct available tasks and projects. So, subcontractor management is becoming a major challenge. To deal with this challenge, GCs aim to reduce total costs of projects including employment/subcontracting costs, indirect costs, tardiness penalties, and the money which must be paid for movement of workforce from one project to another. The aim of current research study is to propose a model for selecting subcontractors and assigning available tasks in the project to them in order to reduce the costs of the GC. Then, a genetic algorithm is proposed to solve a real problem. The proposed algorithm is innovative from three points of view: (1) generation of initial population; (2) subcontractor assignment approach; and (3) the objective function. The problem was also solved by means of an exact method. Then, the results of proposed algorithm were compared to the outcomes of the exact method. This comparison shows that the proposed algorithm can efficiently help GCs select subcontractors and assign available tasks to each subcontractor when several projects must be carried out simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, in a competitive market circumstance, a distributor/wholesaler permits a settled trade credit to the retailer(s) for more deal, and in turn, retailer offers a fraction of that credit period to the customers for the quick-moving of the business, i.e. to increase the demand. In reality, all the customers are not fully trustworthy. There are some customers who do not pay the dues after enjoying the trade credit. The number of default customers increases with the increase in trade credit period given to them. Thus, these two contradict each other. There is a decent market with increasing demand for greener (contamination free) item(s), especially for deteriorating item(s). Here, in the present investigation, customers’ demand increases with both the trade credit given to customers and the greenness of the product. Obviously, the price tag will be higher for green items. Increased price always negates the demand. Hence, greenness and the increased price of the green products are contradictory to each other. Once more, to reduce the deterioration rate, the retailer incurs an expenditure termed as preservation technology cost. Due to preservation, deterioration of the items decreases but cost increases. Here, control of deterioration and preservation act contradictory to each other. The base demand, effects (coefficients) of the trade credit, and greenness are taken as fuzzy. Incorporating the above facts, a model is developed with a fuzzy differential equation and solved by Chalco-Cano $$\alpha $$ -cut method. The profit is calculated by assuming two-level trade credit and default customers. In this investigation, a new concept of clearing the supplier’s dues is introduced. Instead of payment of all dues at the end of business cycle period, the retailer clears his dues as and when he has sufficient money for this purpose. Numerical experiments for different cases are performed along with their physical interpretations. Imprecise nature of the profit is shown through its membership function and depicted graphically. Interestingly, it is demonstrated that positive effect of deterioration due to the increase in preservation technology and increase in profit due to greenness are up to certain extent. After that, these have the reverse effects.},

  abstract     = {Localization is the fundamental problem for event detecting and monitoring due to the mobility of nodes $$UWSNs$$ . In the literature, researchers have examined the localization problem through optimization schemes for evaluating the accurate location of unknown target nodes . However, the existing schemes have not considered the failure of anchor nodes during obstacles, natural disasters and environmental interferences. Due to this, the network leads to high localization error and energy depletion. Therefore, in this paper, we considered anchor node failure and bad distance computational between anchor-target pair for better localization. For this, fault-resilient localization using FL and NSGA $$\mathrm{I}\mathrm{I}$$ -based metaheuristic scheme is proposed for $$UWSNs$$ . In this scheme, first, we refined the correction value of an anchor node to improve the distance between anchor-target pair. Afterward, $${\text{FL}}$$ and $${\text{NSGA~II}}$$ are applied to identify the set of optimal anchor nodes for the fault-resilient localization process. Furthermore, we have also incorporated fitness value with the three parameters such as residual energy, modified anchor-target distance and a number of the connected nodes as the input parameters, whereas probability is the output for the selection of optimal anchor nodes. Performance evaluation of the proposed scheme outperforms the existing scheme in terms of average localization error, better coverage positioning, localized and bad node proportion with a fast convergence rate under different network scenarios.},

For experimental work, the authors have collected 14,000 pre-segmented samples of Gurumukhi characters (35-class problem) written by 400 writers where they have used 70\% data as training set and remaining 30\% data as testing set. The authors have also explored fivefold cross-validation technique for experimental work.

  abstract     = {One of the most basic characteristic features of every smart device in a network based on the Internet of Things (IoT) is to gather a larger set of data that has been created and then transfer the gathered data to the destination/receiver server through the internet. Thus, IoT-based networks are most vulnerable to simple or complex attacks that need to be identified in the early stage of data transmission for saving the network from these malicious attacks. The chief goal of the proposed work is to design and form the intelligent intrusion detection system (I-IDS) using the machine learning models such that the attacks can be identified in the IoT network. The model is built considering the normal and malicious attacks on the data that are generated in IoT smart environment. To simulate such a model, a testbed is built where a wireless router, a DHT11 sensor, and a node MCU are being used during the design phase. An attacker or adversarial system is built to perform poisoning and sniffing attacks using a laptop system. The node captures the sensor values and transmits the data to the ThinkSpeak platform, during the normal phase via the wireless gateway, and in the attack phase, the malicious attacker interprets the data, modifies it while transmitting from node to the ThinkSpeak server. Thus, the attack called Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) is performed and classified as abnormal data. Various machine learning algorithms are performed on the data, and finally, the results obtained using a probabilistic model called as Markov model have a high performance evaluated based on the I-IDS IoT network. The results obtained during the experimental analysis show that the Markov model has obtained a 100\% detection rate and 19\% of false alarm rate (FAR) with high precision and low error rate. The algorithms such as naïve Bayes classifier, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and Adaboost are considered in comparison with the Markov model. The optimal solution is obtained concerning other evaluation metrics like sensitivity, F1, and true-positive rate (TPR). Therefore, the integrated network of IoT-WSN with its performance metrics is tabulated to show the potentials of securing a network system. Additionally, the proposed work gives a high level of security for IoT smart environment as compared with the other machine learning algorithms using the novel technique of intelligent IDS.},

  abstract     = {The PQ index is an integrated grouting process parameter that represents the relationship between grouting pressure and grout flow. By tracking the variation in the PQ index, operators can understand and control the grouting process. Therefore, accurate and reliable PQ index prediction is important for grouting process guidance. However, because the original grouting process parameter time series has chaotic characteristics and noise interference, traditional point prediction suffers from inevitable prediction errors and cannot quantify the uncertainties associated with the prediction. In this study, to cope with these deficiencies, a hybrid interval prediction model for the PQ index based on an improved extreme learning machine with a lower upper bound estimation method is proposed. In this model, the lower upper bound estimation method is used to construct an advanced extreme learning machine with interval prediction ability to perceive the uncertainties of the prediction. The improved grey wolf optimizer algorithm is applied to optimize the parameters of the extreme learning machine. Moreover, to enhance the prediction ability, cooperating with the hybrid data preprocessing method based on a noise reduction and decomposition strategy, a feature selection method is developed to identify the chaotic characteristics of the PQ index time series and determine the optimal input form of the interval prediction model. The proposed model is applied to predict the PQ value in the grouting process at a hydropower project in China. The results reveal that the proposed model can construct high-quality prediction intervals, which is superior to the performance of other benchmark models and has high potential for practical applications in grouting projects.},

ANN technique eliminates inappropriate and unnecessary attributes in a significant manner, once the information on calculated characteristics and weight is disseminated to lion optimization classifier. The test results inferred that the artificial neural network is highly efficient than the current OANN algorithm method, based on lion optimization. The study evaluated the data and found that the performance of employees working under normal conditions was higher when compared to the performance of employees who work under stress.

In the sequel, we introduce faithful and fixed set generated by internal states on $${\mathcal {A}}.$$ We demonstrate that each Sheffer stroke basic algebra is also a Sheffer stroke basic algebra under internal state. In addition, we mention about internal state-(filter, compatible filter and prime filter) on $${\mathcal {A}}$$ and their related results. We touch on internal state congruence and investigate its relation with filters. We are interested in finding whether general states have implied Riečan and Bosbach states or not. We handle the notion of general state-morphism and some related results on $${\mathcal {A}}.$$ In order to support mentioned concepts, we give place to some attractive examples.},

  abstract     = {Dempster–Shafer evidence theory plays an important role in multi-sensor information fusion and is widely used in the real world. However, fusing the highly conflicting evidences may emerge counter-intuitive results. Recently, researchers found that weighting evidences based on its corresponding credibility and information volume are effective in dealing with the above problem. So it is still an open issue about how to obtain reasonable weights. In this paper, a new divergence measure method is proposed to measure divergence degree of basic probability assignment based on harmonic mean of Deng relative entropy. In determining information volume, Zhou et al.’s entropy is also introduced with considering the cardinality of the discernment frame. Then the weight for each evidence will be generated by the proposed divergence measure method and the modified information volume. Some numerical examples are illustrated to show the outstanding performance of the proposed divergence measure method, and the optimal weighted evidence combination algorithm also gives the relatively highest belief in multi-sensor target recognition.},

This algorithm formulates fluctuation reduction as an optimization problem. It is combined with the partial transmit sequence method to decreases both the large fluctuations of signals and the search cost for larger sub-blocks at the same time. The search complexity of the proposed hybrid algorithm is polynomial, while the complexity of the exhaustive search partial transmit sequence scheme increases exponentially with the number of sub-blocks. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using different benchmarks and compared with several counterpart methods according to the fluctuation reduction performance and search cost.

  abstract     = {The sugarcane industry is technologically pioneering in the area of food production. On the other side, this industry produces a huge amount of by-products. Proper handling of these by-products has remained a challenge. An efficient multi-echelon Sugarcane Supply Chain Network (SSCN) is designed and proposed in this paper to handle the by-products produced by the sugarcane industry that can be utilized further with little modification. It helps to reduce the overall working cost of the network. Usually, the supply chain problems are complex in nature, and complexity further increases with increasing problem instances. Metaheuristics techniques are, in general, applied to handle such NP-hard problems. This work proposes three hybrid metaheuristics algorithms, namely H-GASA, a hybrid of Genetic Algorithm with Simulated Annealing, H-KASA, a hybrid of Keshtel Algorithm with Simulated Annealing, and H-RDASA, a hybrid of Red Deer Algorithm with Simulated Annealing to handle the complexity of the problem. The algorithms’ performance is probed using the Taguchi experiments, and the best combinations of parameters are identified. This hybrid algorithms’ efficacy is compared with their basic version of the algorithms, i.e. GA, KA, RDA, and SA using different criteria. A set of test problems is generated to ensure the capability of the presented model. The obtained results suggest that H-KASA significantly outperforms in small-sized problems, while the H-RDASA significantly outperforms in medium- and large-sized problem instances. In addition, the sensitivity analysis confirms that by adopting this proposed multi-echelon SSCN, decision-makers can achieve a significant cost reduction of 8.3\% in terms of the total cost.},

  abstract     = {Watershed as a complex and dynamic system is considered to be a functional unit for planning and management strategies. It is important to take all technical, social, economic, physical, ecological and administrative aspects in the process of watersheds planning and management into account. Deciding in the watershed management is quite intricate due to existence of diverse agents and indices there. Therefore, this study focused on the socioeconomic, ecological and physical impacts of management scenarios targeting on water and soil resources management issues in the Hable-Rud River Basin, Tehran Province, Iran. Also provide the best scenario for watershed management to achieve integrated management of resources in the catchment using Improved Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Improved TOPSIS) approach and Best Worst Method (BWM). The study area covers an area of 3269 Km2. In this study, according to managerial problems of the region, four management actions (rangeland exclusion, pitting, contour furrow and pile seeding) and 16 management scenarios were taken into consideration. Also, four standards of social (social acceptance), economic (benefit/cost), ecological (Weighted Average of Patch Size Index (WMPSI) and Weighted Land Cover Area Index (WLCAI)), and physical (runoff and soil erosion) indices are applied. Then, using the Best Worst Method, the weight of each index is met. Following the formation of decision matrix with 16 options (management scenarios) and 6 criteria (evaluation index), the Improved TOPSIS method was used to prioritize management scenarios. The research results showed that the social acceptance index (0.304) has the highest weight and the WLCAI index (0.072) has the lowest weight. The results of the prioritization of the scenarios using the weights estimated by the BWM method showed that the scenario 13 (rangeland exclusion, pitting and pile seeding) and scenario 5 (pile seeding) and scenario 16 (rangeland exclusion, pitting, contour furrow and pile seeding) perform best, respectively. In this research, a novel and logical approach of multi-criteria decision-making processes, i.e., Improved TOPSIS and Best Worst Method, was adopted to prioritize management scenarios for planning and watershed management. Given the results, the Improved TOPSIS method can be used as a suitable technique in prioritizing management scenarios, especially when the decision maker faces contradictory or even conflicting objectives and cannot decide on the best alternative(s).},

  abstract     = {The wide range of applications of particulate materials in the modern industry, as well as growing concerns about their potential risks to human health and the environment, has boosted studies related to the production, control, and classification of nanoparticles. Differential mobility analyzers (DMAs) are one of the main technologies used to characterize the size distribution of nanoparticles in aerosols. However, the high price and complexity of this equipment have been limiting factors for its use. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of a Long-DMA, designed and built with its own technology and to propose and solve an inverse problem to determine the monodisperse aerosol concentration distribution. The polydisperse aerosols were generated by atomization of NaCl solutions with 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 g L−1 concentrations. In order to estimate the theoretical nanoparticle size distributions of monodisperse aerosols, a new mobility balance was proposed. This was based on the Wiedensohler charge distribution associated with a loss parameter, obtained considering a formulation and solution of an optimization problem by using the differential evolution algorithm. The Long-DMA was able to produce monodisperse aerosols for all the saline concentrations evaluated, showing evidence of its potential for classifying nanoparticles. Comparisons between the experimental and theoretical results showed that the proposed mobility balance was able to satisfactorily describe the distributions related to monodisperse aerosols. The proposed methodology was able to estimate the monodisperse aerosol distribution in intermediate solution concentration using only the data about the highest and lowest concentrations. It is worth mentioning that the cost of the designed equipment was approximately 10\% of the commercial equipment value.},

To exploit this encoding structure, two neighborhood strategies that help ABC algorithm in faster convergence towards finding high quality solutions are applied. On a set of Euclidean and non-Euclidean benchmark instances for various diameter bounds, the proposed approach has been compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, there is a great interest in expressing uncertain concepts by means of fuzzy set theory proposed by L.A. Zadeh. The application of the fuzzy sets theory includes a fuzzification process that expresses an uncertain concept by a membership function (MF). However, due to a lack of a general systematic approach for the fuzzification process, its effectiveness and applicability in different domains is still insufficient and difficult to evaluate. The aim of this paper is to propose a general dynamic fuzzification approach for interval type-2 fuzzy sets (DFSIT2), which in general manner identifies and describes the main steps of the fuzzification process. We propose four basic requirements of the fuzzification approach and on their basis developed DFSIT2. Its novelty and relevance is triple. First, it systematizes the fuzzification process independently of understanding of fuzziness, application domain, and techniques for interval type-2 membership function (IT2MF) development. Second, it consists of an extended implementation component, which provides IT2MF development rules, and a refined evaluation component, which allows us to verify and validate the obtained result. Third, DFSIT2 architecture is proposed and implemented into a prototype in a service-oriented enterprise system for an Invoice Submission service. A case study of IT2MF development from the WS-DREAM dataset#1 was carried out using this prototype. The obtained results correspond to the needs of fuzzification process, as well as possibilities for dynamic and flexible IT2MF development. We expect that our results inspire researchers and practitioners for further work aiming at bringing forward fuzzification problem modelling and implementation.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, use of various types of hybrid metaheuristic algorithms attracts the researchers to optimize the average profit or cost of an inventory system to avoid the local optimality due to high nonlinearity of the corresponding optimization problem. This paper deals with an application of binary tournament-based quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithms on an imperfect production inventory problem with shortages. In order to reduce the production of defective items, modern/improvement technology has been incorporated in the production system. Also, the demand of the product is assumed to be dependent on its warranty period and selling price. The main objective of this study is to optimize the production rate, production period, selling price of the product, manufacturer’s improvement technology level and maximum shortage level as well as maximize the average profit of the production system. For this purpose, three hybrid metaheuristic algorithms based on binary tournamenting and different variants of quantum-behaved PSO techniques have been developed. Then to examine the validity of the proposed model, three numerical examples have been solved. Considering each example, nonparametric statistical tests have been performed by using four different methods to analyze the performance of the used algorithms. Finally, sensitivity analyses have been performed to investigate the effects of different parameters on optimal policy.},

Negation reverses the validity of argument to maximize or decrease the doubt regarding the opponent and conjecture. Deep learning recently demonstrated has increased ability to distinguish truthful and non-true knowledge. Moreover, different languages were used in most of the previous approaches. To our understanding, the negative or hypothetical concept in biomedical texts in English is not known in previous work. This work will establish an adaptive visual geometry group network (VGG Net) based on CNN models for the identification and rejection of statements (negated or speculated sentences, etc.).

  abstract     = {In recent decades, researches on optimizing the parameter of the artificial neural network (ANN) model has attracted significant attention from researchers. Hybridization of superior algorithms helps improving optimization performance and capable of solving complex applications. As a traditional gradient-based learning algorithm, ANN suffers from a slow learning rate and is easily trapped in local minima when training techniques such as gradient descent (GD) and back-propagation (BP) algorithm are used. The characteristics of randomization and selection of the best or near-optimal solution of metaheuristic algorithm provide an effective and robust solution; therefore, it has always been used in training of ANN to improve and overcome the above problems. New metaheuristic algorithms are proposed every year. Therefore, the review of its latest developments is essential. This article attempts to summarize the metaheuristic algorithms which have been proposed from the year 1975 to 2020 from various journals, conferences, technical papers, and books. The comparison of the popularity of the metaheuristic algorithm is presented in two time frames, such as algorithms proposed in the recent 20 years and those proposed earlier. Then, some of the popular metaheuristic algorithms and their working principle are reviewed. This article further categorizes the latest metaheuristic search algorithm in the literature to indicate their efficiency in training ANN for various industry applications. More and more researchers tend to develop new hybrid optimization tools by combining two or more metaheuristic algorithms to optimize the training parameters of ANN. Generally, the algorithm’s optimal performance must be able to achieve a fine balance of their exploration and exploitation characteristics. Hence, this article tries to compare and summarize the properties of various metaheuristic algorithms in terms of their convergence rate and the ability to avoid the local minima. This information is useful for researchers working on algorithm hybridization by providing a good understanding of the convergence rate and the ability to find a global optimum.},

We employ the Fourier spectral method to numerically approximate the fractional Laplacian and advance in time with the novel ETDRK4 method. In other to obtain guidelines on the correct choice of parameters when numerically simulating the full reaction–diffusion models, the local dynamics of the systems are considered.

  abstract     = {The estimation of the energy performance of residential buildings has gained importance because of the significant consumption of electricity in housing estate areas. For this aim, different approaches were utilized for robust and accurate prediction of the energy load in buildings. The use of different kind of construction materials, timely change in building parameters lead to imprecise and vague evaluation of energy consumption. For such kind of problems that are characterized with uncertainties, the use of fuzzy set theory is a more suitable approach for the modeling of energy consumption. This paper proposes a novel type-2 fuzzy wavelet neural network (T2FWNN) for modeling the energy performance of residential buildings. Based on the type-2 fuzzy rules, the multi-input multi-output T2FWNN model is proposed. For the construction of the T2FWNN model, the learning algorithm has been designed using cross-validation approach, clustering and gradient descent algorithms. During construction, the adaptive learning procedure was developed to stabilize and speed up the learning process. The proposed model is used for the solution of two problems. At the first stage, based on statistical data, the T2FWNN model has been designed for modeling the cooling and heating load of residential buildings. In the second stage, using T2FWNN the prediction model was designed for the energy consumption of residential buildings in Northern Cyprus. Comparative results have been provided to prove the efficiency of using the designed model in the prediction of the energy load of residential buildings. The obtained results indicated the suitability of using the T2FWNN system for estimation of the energy performance and prediction of the energy consumption of residential buildings.},

Chatter signals generated during the turning of Al 6061 have been acquired using a microphone. The recorded signals have been processed using local mean decomposition. The decomposed signals have been analyzed using different statistical indicators considering Nakagami distribution approach for ascertaining the thresholds of chatter severity. Prediction models of most effective statistical indicator have been developed using artificial neural network to ascertain safe range of cutting parameters. From the analysis and validation experiments, it has been inferred that the obtained safe cutting zone is significant and capable of limiting the chatter.},

The second module describes the different steps required to develop a wearable sign-capture device. The third module discusses the real-time SL recognition approach, which uses a template-matching algorithm to recognize acquired data. The final design of the DataGlove with 65 data channel fulfils the requirement identified from an analysis of MSL. The DataGlove is able to record data for all of the signs (both dynamic and static) of MSL due to the wide range of captured hand features.

  abstract     = {An economic-statistical design with multiple assignable causes following exponential distribution is presented in this paper for linear profiles. For this purpose, a tri-objective optimization model is proposed to minimize the cost with desired statistical performances. Average Run Length (ARL) as the primary statistical measure is employed for the appraisal of the designed linear profiles. The first objective to be minimized is a cost function that models the implementation cost in different states. The second objective is to maximize $${\text{ARL}}_{0}$$ or the in-control average run-length of the monitoring scheme. The third objective to be minimized is $${\text{ARL}}_{1}$$ or the out-of-control average run-length of the control chart. Besides, there are two constraints defined as the lower and the upper bounds on $${\text{ARL}}_{0}$$ and $${\text{ARL}}_{1}$$ , respectively. This model optimizes the sample size, the sampling intervals, and related parameters for assignable causes concerning exponential distribution. As the problem is hard to solve analytically, a parameter-tuned meta-heuristic solution algorithm involving a multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) alongside the response surface methodology (RSM) is employed to find a near-optimum solution. In this meta-heuristic, the response surface methodology is utilized to tune the parameters of the optimization problem. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed approach and assess its performance. Finally, sensitivity analyses of some parameters on the effects of the design parameters are performed. The results show the parameter profiling cost per set-points of a sample has the most effective implementation costs of linear profiles. Also, the proposed model is robust on some parameters such as the cost of identifying and modifying an assignable cause, fixed cost of sampling, and variable cost of the sampling process.},

  abstract     = {Recent developments designate the quick growing of optimization meta-heuristics in the domain of optimization. Sine–cosine optimizer is a stochastic technique that generates various preliminary random research agents global optimal solutions and involves them to fluctuate toward or outwards the superior global optima solution utilizing a mathematical model based on sine and cosine trigonometry functions. Nevertheless, standard SCA provides insufficient global optima results on complex dimension functions illustrating poor convergence rate. The search process of the SCA method holds various shortcomings such as slow convergence, weak balance amid exploration and exploitation, and inefficiency in convergence. To overcome these shortcomings in this work, we are trying to present a new heuristic approach based on merging the features of SCA (sine–cosine approach) with a HS (harmony search approach) known as HSCAHS algorithm. The existing approach integrates the merits of the sine–cosine algorithm and HS algorithm to reduce demerits, like the trapping in local optima and unbalanced exploitation. The new approach presents own work performance in two different stages; firstly, the sine–cosine algorithm starts the explore procedure to augment exploration capability. Secondly, harmony search part starts its search from SCA finds so far to augment the exploitation tendencies. Hence, hybrid approach can find best possible solution in which least time improves the exploitation and exploration. Hence, the newly existing hybrid approach can be quickly convergent, statistically sound and more robust. The capability of the hybrid approach is verified by applying it on eighteen tested benchmark, economic dispatch, three-bar truss design, rolling element bearing design, multiple disc clutch brake design, speed reducer design and planetary gear train design problems. The experimental solutions reveal that the hybrid approach is able to finding the superior quality of optimal goal (or solution) of the optimize functions in most cases in comparison with others.},

  abstract     = {Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is a commonly used method in risk evaluation. In this paper, a novel FMEA model based on neutrosophic analytic hierarchy process (NAHP) is proposed to overcome shortcomings of the risk prioritization of classical FMEA. Neutrosophic sets approach real-world decision-making problems from a three-aspect structure (i.e., truthiness, indeterminacy and falsity). Therefore, initially, AHP is merged with neutrosophic sets to assign importance weights to risk parameters in FMEA. The encountered failure modes are then prioritized with respect to the previously weighted risk parameters. Each element in AHP comparison matrices is considered as triangular neutrosophic numbers, and score functions are used to transform NAHP elements to deterministic values. The flexibility of determining the weight to each parameter of FMEA (severity, occurrence and detection) and evaluation of each failure mode against these parameters are more well-suited to the real decision-making condition. Finally, a case study in the textile industry is provided to show the applicability of the novel model. Sensitivity and comparative analysis are also performed to validate the results.},

  abstract     = {The effective adoption of online learning depends on user satisfaction as distance education approaches suffer from a lack of commitment that may lead to failures and dropouts. The adaptive learning literature argues that an alternative to achieve student satisfaction is to treat them individually, delivering the educational content in a personalized manner. In addition, the sequencing of this content—called Adaptive Curriculum Sequencing (ACS)—is important to avoid cognitive overload and disorientation. The search for an optimal sequence from ever-growing databases is an NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problem. Although some approaches have been proposed, it is challenging to assess their contributions due to the lack of benchmark data available. This paper presents a procedure to create synthetic dataset to evaluate ACS approaches and, as a concept proof, analyzes metaheuristics usually used in ACS approaches: Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Prey–Predator Algorithm using student’s learning goals and their extrinsic and intrinsic information. We also propose an approach based on Differential Evolution (DE). The computational experiments include synthetic datasets with a varied amount of learning materials and real-world datasets for comparison. The results show that DE performed better than the other methods when less than 500 learning materials are used while PSO performed better for larger problems.},

  abstract     = {Runoff–sediment process modeling is highly variable and nonlinear in nature. For sediment yield prediction, the difficulty of rainfall–runoff–sediment yield hydrological processes remains challenging. The present study uses a simple nonlinear dynamic (NLD) model to predict daily sediment yields, taking into account the degree of daily–sediment yield in catchment areas, and its findings were compared to three widely used models including artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and gene expression programming (GEP). The daily measured discharge–sediment data for 25 years were obtained from Shakkar Watershed; Central India as in the current study. The coefficient of correlation (CC), Nash-Sutcliff (NS), and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were employed to assess the performance of the models. The results show that the NLD model was found better than ANN, SVM, and GEP model. These models had correlation coefficient (CC = 0.975, 0.887, 0.843, and 0.901), root-mean-square error (RMSE = 0.748, 1.751, 1.961, and 1.545), and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (0.952, 0.784, 0.673, and 0.814) correspondingly. Hence, the NLD model can be used for predicting sediment. In order to implement appropriate measures of soil conservation in the watershed to reduce the sediment load in the river, predicting the sediment yield is very necessary to maximize the life of the structure.},

A fuzzy inference system is designed as a classifier which adopts the features of the cover image as its crisp input values and produces semantic concepts corresponding to the payload of image sub-classes. Furthermore, least significant bit substitution is used to hide the data adaptively according to the output of fuzzy inference system and the human eye sensitivity to the R, G, B color components. A chaotic method and random sequence scrambling are applied to the secret message to generate the random sequence which prevents the secret message from attackers. The proposed method hides a large amount of data with good quality of stego-image from the human visual system and guarantees the confidentiality in the communication. Experimental results show better mean square error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity and payload, verifying that the proposed method can yield better performance than some state-of-the-art works. The robustness of the method is tested by RS steganalysis and pixel difference histogram analysis.},

Due to the nonlinear characteristics, parameter uncertainties and load disturbance of photovoltaic (PV) systems and the problem of low efficiency due to the variation of environmental conditions, the maximum power point tracking method is required to extract the maximum power from the PV system. So, in this paper a novel indirect adaptive fuzzy fractional-order sliding mode is proposed to tackle this challenge. This method is based on a two-loop method. The first loop is designed to seek the maximum power point, and the second loop is designed to track the maximum power point. At first, a novel fractional-order sliding surface is proposed. Then, chattering in control signal is removed using a continuous function. In this paper, an indirect adaptive fuzzy system is used to estimate the unknown function of the system and adaptation laws are obtained based on the Lyapunov theory. The performance of the photovoltaic system is investigated by applying the proposed method, conventional sliding mode controller, integral sliding mode controller and backstepping sliding mode controller. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The PID controller parameter tuning is a laborious and time-consuming process, and the controllers’ performance depends on the gain values set for the controller. To overcome the said drawbacks, this study develops an adaptive-torque-based PID controller for a two-legged robot that can provide adaptive gains on the basis of the magnitude of input signal received at the input nodes of the neural network (NN). Furthermore, the structure of the feedforward NN has been optimized with the help of the modified chaotic invasive weed optimization (MCIWO) algorithm. Moreover, the concept of zero moment point has been employed to check the balance of the two-legged robot while walking on various terrains (that is, flat, stair, and sloped surfaces). The effectiveness of the developed controller has been verified in both simulations and practical.},

  abstract     = {The concept of software-defined Internet of Things (SD-IoT) is becoming even more widespread. SD-IoT enables us to realize programmable networks and business, simplifying the management of the Internet of Things (IoT) and improving the IoT flexibility and scalability. However, with the promotion of SD-IoT-based applications and services, security issues in SD-IoT networks have become increasingly prominent. Aimed to deal with such issues, in this paper, we propose a two-stage intrusion detection approach for SD-IoT networks. It can more intelligently detect attacks under SD-IoT networks. In particular, we use the differential evolution algorithm&#39;s mutation mechanism to improve the firefly algorithm to solve the existing firefly algorithm&#39;s problems, such as slow convergence speed, easy to fall into local optimum on complex problems, and low accuracy. Next, based on the wrapper feature selection method, the selected features are sent to a novel ensemble classifier, composed of the C4.5 decision tree, multilayer perceptron, and instance-based learning. Again, the proposed approach uses the weighted voting method to determine whether network traffic is abnormal. Our proposal&#39;s detection performance is evaluated in binary and multiclass classifications by adopting the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 public data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed multiclass classification approach&#39;s accuracy is 99.00\% and 88.46\%, respectively, while the false-positive rate is 0.81\% and 4.16\%, respectively. Finally, experimental results show that our proposal outperforms existing methods in terms of detection performance.},

Moreover, the stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis method is utilized to specify the weights of evaluation criteria as it is simple and time-saving. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with a customer satisfaction evaluation of the rail transit network in Shanghai, China. Results showed that Line 7 has the highest customer satisfaction and Line 2 has the lowest customer satisfaction among the considered rail transit lines. Besides, nine evaluation criteria need to be optimized to improve the customer satisfaction level of Line 2 and the most critical one is train crowding.},

VNS is an optimization algorithm which works based on a systematic change of neighborhood while searching the optimal solution of a given problem in both descent and perturbation phases. The performance of the proposed VNS-based algorithm is demonstrated on the 8-bus, 9-bus and 15-bus power system networks with diverse scenarios.

The results indicate that the proposed model based on the combination of SARIMA and LSTM has higher accuracy in inflation forecasts over the SARIMA and LSTM separately.},

  abstract     = {Sustainability and performance assessment are significant aspects for organizations such as healthcare systems in order to make sustainable decisions and to improve the quality. A sustainability framework usually addresses economic, social and environmental impacts. In many real applications, uncertainty and imprecise data are also perceived. Therefore, the current study proposes a novel approach based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) to examine the sustainability performance of systems in the presence of imprecise measures. To illustrate, the performance of systems with fuzzy data from each perspective, economic, social and environmental, is evaluated while weakly disposable undesirable outputs are presented. For this purpose, the constant and variable returns to scale fuzzy non-radial approaches with undesirable outputs are introduced. Fuzzy scale efficiency scores and the returns to scale status are also appraised for each sustainability dimension. Then, the overall sustainability performance is estimated using an alternative fuzzy composite indicators aggregate approach based on DEA. Our proposed approach is applied to measure the sustainability performance of hospitals. The findings disclose informative details about overall sustainability performance in hospitals and also strengths and weaknesses in each dimension.},

  abstract     = {This work investigates the retailers’ sourcing decisions with or without information leakage and studies the impact of the forecasting accuracy on supply chain members’ preferences for information leakage. To derive the retailers’ optimal sourcing quantities under two scenarios, one without and one with information leakage, we formulate a supply chain in which a common manufacturer offers a wholesale price contract to two competing retailers, one of whom (the incumbent) has private forecasting information about the market demand and the other one (the entrant) does not. We find that the incumbent with information advantage may have a worse profit and lower market share than the entrant under no information leakage. We show that the incumbent has an incentive to impact the entrant’s sourcing decision by managing her own sourcing quantity reflecting private forecasting information under information leakage. Then, we compare the supply chain members’ performances under different conditions; counterintuitively, the result shows that information leakage may benefit the manufacturer when the prior probability of the booming market is low enough or the forecasting signal is not sufficiently accurate even if the incumbent’s forecasts that the market will be slack; we show that the information leakage will benefit the incumbent when the forecasting information is not sufficiently accurate and the prior probability of the booming market is high enough even if she forecasts that the market will be booming; we find that information leakage will hurt the entrant’s profit when the incumbent forecasts that the market will be slack, or when the market will be booming under the condition of the forecasting information is not sufficiently accurate and the prior probability of the booming market is high enough. Meanwhile, we find that the many-win condition will never occur in our model setting, and the preferences of all three supply chain members for information leakage will never become concert.},

TOPSIS method is regarded as one of the authentic decision-making strategies that follows the scheme to point out the alternative acquiring favorable distances from the ideal solutions. On the other hand, the pre-eminent feature of the CSFS includes the tendency to handle both aspects of two-dimensional information involved in the satisfaction, abstinence and dissatisfaction nature of human decisions. This study aims to expand the number of multiple criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) techniques by presenting a strategy, named complex spherical fuzzy TOPSIS (CSF-TOPSIS) method that cumulates the novel features of complex spherical fuzzy sets with the potential of TOPSIS method. In proposed method, we merge the independent decisions of all experts about the capabilities of alternatives and priorities of criteria using the CSFWA operator. We rank the alternatives in an ascending order of revised closeness index, evaluated by deploying normalized Euclidean distance. We establish the proposed CSF-TOPSIS method by an explanatory numerical example for the selection of best water supply strategy for Nohoor village in Iran. Further, we conduct the comparative study with spherical fuzzy TOPSIS method and complex spherical fuzzy VIKOR method to explicate the adequacy of the proposed strategy and consistency of the results.},

  abstract     = {Surgical rescheduling is necessary for adjusting initial schedules on surgery day after emergency demand is realized. While people-oriented medical service has been emphasized these years, the traditional rescheduling scheme which is only in pursuit of a great cost-related performance is no longer desirable since patients and medical staff are also highly involved in rescheduling and their preferences should not be ignored. In order to provide a satisfactory and people-centered rescheduling plan, this study considers the preferences of three involved participants (i.e. the operating room manager, medical staff, and elective patients) while designing a rescheduling plan. Based on prospect theory, we introduce three functions to evaluate three participants’ dissatisfaction about rescheduling schemes in terms of their respective preferences. Then a multi-objective rescheduling model is established with multiple resource constraints, emergency lead-time target constraints, and the objective of minimizing the dissatisfaction of three participants caused by rescheduling. A hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) algorithm with two improved strategies—an initial population construction strategy and a local search strategy, is then developed to solve the proposed problem. Several numerical experiments are carried out by leveraging data reported in existing case studies in conjunction with simulated data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of two improved strategies and show that the proposed HPSO algorithm can provide better Pareto solutions for our problem in comparison with the basic non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of soil temperature (Ts) is critical for efficient soil, water and field crop management. In this study, hourly Ts variations at 5, 10, and 30 cm soil depth were predicted for an arid site (Sirjan) and a semi-humid site (Sanandaj) in Iran. Existing machine learning models have high performance, but suffer from uncertainty and instability in prediction. Therefore, GLUE approach was implemented to quantify model uncertainty, while wavelet coherence was used to assess interactions between Ts and meteorological parameters. Standalone machine learning models (adaptive neuron fuzzy interface system (ANFIS), support vector machine model (SVM), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and multilayer perceptron (MLP)) were hybridized with four optimization algorithms (sunflower optimization (SFO), firefly algorithm (FFA), salp swarm algorithm (SSA), particle swarm optimization (PSO)) to improve Ts prediction accuracy and reduce model uncertainty. For both arid and semi-humid sites, ANFIS-SFO produced the most accurate performance at studied soil depths. At best, hybridization with SFO (ANFIS-SFO, MLP-SFO, RBFNN-SFO, SVM-SFO) decreased RMSE by 5.6\%, 18\%, 18.3\%, and 18.2\% at 5 cm, 11.8\%, 10.4\%, 10.6\%, and 12.5\% at 10 cm, and 9.1\%, 12.1\%, 13.9\%, and 14.2\% at 30 cm soil depth compared with the respective standalone models. GLUE analysis confirmed the superiority of hybrid models over the standalone models, while the hybrid models decreased the uncertainty in Ts predictions. ANFIS-SFO covered 95\%, 94\%, and 96\% observation data at 5, 10, and 30 cm soli depths, respectively. Wavelet coherence analysis demonstrated that air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation, but not wind speed, had high coherence with Ts at different soil depths at both sites, and meteorological parameters mostly influenced Ts in upper soil layers. In conclusion, uncertainty analysis is a necessary and powerful technique to obtain an accurate and realistic prediction of Ts. In contrast, wavelet coherence analysis is a useful tool to investigate the most effective variables that strongly affect predictions.},

Many works have addressed those problems, but still they have some lack in their solutions. To address this issue, we propose a new deep learning-based key transmission (DLKT) protocol. This protocol gives the secure group communication in cloud by using autoencoder-based generative adversarial network framework which allows users to transmit their key or message in a secure manner. Both hash and reverse hash techniques are used in this protocol to perform secure session establishment process. A novelty is making by applying deep learning technique into the key transmission protocol for improving the efficiency and security level of the proposed method. The outcome of the work proves that our DLKT protocol reduces the operation time, increases the attack detection rate and accuracy of attack detection compared with existing works and provides very high security.},

  abstract     = {Segmentation of image is a key step in image analysis and pre-processing. It consists of separating the pixels into different segments based on their intensity level according to threshold values. The most challenging job in segmentation is to select the optimum threshold values. Standard multilevel thresholding (MT) techniques are effective for bi-level thresholds due to their simplicity, robustness, decreased convergence time and precision. As the level of thresholds increases, computational complexity also increases exponentially. To mitigate these issues various metaheuristic algorithm are applied to this problem. In this manuscript, a new hybrid version of the Dragonfly algorithm (DA) and Firefly Algorithm (FA) is proposed. DA is an optimization algorithm recently suggested based on the dragonfly&#39;s static and dynamic swarming behavior. DA&#39;s worldwide search capability is great with randomization and static swarm behavior, local search capability is restricted, resulting in local optima trapping alternatives. The firefly algorithm (FA) is influenced by fireflies&#39; social behavior in which they generate flashlights to attract their mates. The suggested technique combines the ability to explore DA and firefly Algorithm’s ability to exploit to obtain ideal global solutions. In this paper, HDAFA is applied on ten standard test images having a diverse histogram, which are taken from Berkeley Segmentation Data Set 500 (BSDS500) benchmark image set for segmentation. The search capability of the algorithm is employed with OTSU and Kapur’s entropy MT as an objective functions for image segmentation. The proposed approach is compared with the existing state-of-art optimization algorithms like MTEMO, GA, PSO, and BF for both OTSU and Kapur’s entropy methods. Qualitative experimental outcomes demonstrate that HDAFA is highly efficient in terms of performance metric such as PSNR, mean, threshold values, number of iterations taken to converge and image segmentation quality.},

One hundred and forty eight experimental samples collected with different geometric, material and physical factors from literature were utilized for SVR-GA with fivefold cross validation. Shear influence factors such as the stirrup spacing, the beam width, the shear span-to-depth ratio, the effective depth of the beam, the concrete compressive and tensile strength, the longitudinal reinforcement ratio, the product of stirrup ratio and stirrup yield strength were served as input variables. The simulation results show that SVR-GA model can achieve highest accuracy in shear strength prediction based on testing set with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9642, root mean squared error of 1.4685 and mean absolute error of 1.0216 superior to that for traditional SVR model with 0.9379, 2.0375 and 1.4917, which both perform better than multiple linear regression and ACI-318. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis reveals the most important variables affecting the result of shear strength prediction are shear span-to-depth ratio, concrete compressive strength, reinforcement ratio and the product of stirrup ratio and stirrup yield strength. Three-dimensional input/output maps are employed to reflect the nonlinear variation of the shear strength with the two coupling variables. All in all, the proposed SVR-GA model can achieve excellent accuracy in prediction the shear strength of medium- to ultra-high strength concrete beams with stirrups in comparison with results obtained by traditional SVR, MLP and ACI-318.},

Accordingly, in terms of accuracy compared to the latest work done, the proposed method has a significant improvement of 34.12\%.

However, most of the existing recommended methods for apps ignore the app functional exclusiveness features, which makes it difficult to further improve the app recommendation performance. To solve this problem, we propose a personalized context-aware mobile app recommendation approach, called PCMARA. Specifically, (1) PCMARA explores the relationship between contextual information and function of apps and constructs the app contextual factors for app which represent the function of app. (2) PCMARA leverages the app contextual factor to design a novel app similarity model, which enable to effectively eliminate the adverse effects that ignore the app functional exclusiveness. (3) PCMARA comprehensively considers the contextual information of users and apps to generate a recommendation list for users based on the target users’ current time and location. We applied the PCMARA to a real-world dataset and conducted a large-scale recommendation effect experiment. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of PMARA over the benchmark methods.},

  abstract     = {The world population continues to increase which imposes rising demand in agriculture production. How to improve crop breeding to feed the growing population is a significant challenge. The traditional crop breeding is resource-intensive and time-consuming. Predictive modeling on crop yield can speed up the breeding process and make it resource-efficient. In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA)-assisted deep learning solution method is proposed for the crop yield prediction. The proposed method consists of two phases, i.e., the global search phase and the local search phase. In the global search phase, GA is used to search for the best initial weights of the neural network. In the local search phase, random perturbation is added to avoid the local optimum and vanishing gradient problems. A case study of crop yield prediction is conducted to compare the proposed method and other gradient-based methods. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the gradient-based methods in terms of convergence speed and prediction accuracy.},

This approach was used to introduce a new concept of separation axioms, from which fundamental properties and theorems of preservation were studied. The relationship between basic properties and preservation theorems was also discussed. New near continuous function definitions have also been developed and their characteristics have been discussed. Through an application presented in the work, the relationship between the simply* alpha open set and near continuous function was justified. The simply* alpha open set was studied by the rough set and accordingly new accuracies were obtained. Moreover, an accurate proposal was examined, which competes with that of the methods of Yao and Pawlak. To obtain the results, MATLAB software has been used.},

  abstract     = {The World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019, was informed of several cases of respiratory diseases of unknown origin in the city of Wuhan in the Chinese Province of Hubei, the clinical manifestations of which were similar to those of viral pneumonia and manifested as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. And, the disease caused by the virus is named the new coronavirus disease 2019 and it will be abbreviated as 2019-nCoV and COVID-19. As of January 30, 2020, the WHO classified this epidemic as a global health emergency (Chung et al. in Radiology 295(1):202–207, 2020). It is an international real-life problem. Due to deaths, globally everyone is under fear. Now, it is the responsibility of researchers to give hope to the people. In this article, we aim to better protect people and general pandemic preparedness by predicting the lifetime of the disease-causing virus using three mathematical models. This article deals with a complex real-life problem people face all over the world, an international real-life problem. The main focus is on the USA due to large infection and death due to coronavirus and thereby the life of every individual is uncertain. The death counts of the USA from February 29 to April 22, 2020, are used in this article as a data set. The death counts of the USA are fitted by the solutions of three mathematical models and a solution to an international problem is achieved. Based on the death rate, the lifetime of the coronavirus COVID-19 is predicted as 1464.76 days from February 29, 2020. That is, after March 2024 there will be no death in the USA due to COVID-19 if everyone follows the guidelines of WHO and the advice of healthcare workers. People and government can get prepared for this situation and many lives can be saved. It is the contribution of soft computing. Finally, this article suggests several steps to control the spread and severity of the disease. The research work, the lifetime prediction presented in this article is entirely new and differs from all other articles in the literature.},

The current core such as foam, honeycomb, and lattice cores have cavity and porosity on its structure which made them vulnerable to catastrophic failure due to high impact. This paper aims to enhance the ballistic resistance of panel using enhanced core configuration. A simulation was conducted using computational method of explicit dynamic under high-speed projectile impact at 980 m/s of 7.62 mm armour-piercing metal. A half-symmetric of three-dimensional sandwich panel with 27 mm thickness including adhesive material was modelled with a mesh refinement of 1 mm and added with the modified Johnson–Cook parameters to describe the ballistic behaviour of each materials. The results show that the use of dimple surface as the core for sandwich panel has increased the ballistic performance by approximately 30\% from the solid core. No macrocrack or petal showed at the back layer except of bulges effect. Magnesium alloy as core material showed high potential to be used as main core for sandwich panel on protection application by decrement in projectile penetration about 4.5\% compared to aluminium alloy. This study proposed that the structural integrity of the metal sandwich panel with proposed core configuration has improved with no significant reduction in ballistic performance compared to the sandwich panel with solid core.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular fog computing (VFC), combining the vehicular ad hoc network with fog computing, is an efficient vehicle communication architecture. However, the user data is often threatened since VFC is an open environment. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is suitable for open scenarios, such as cloud and Internet of Things, because of its confidentiality and access control characteristics. However, the traditional ABE has disadvantages, such as the inability to hide the attributes in the access policy and the use of computationally inefficient composite order bilinear pairing groups to prove adaptive security. Traditional ABE is not practical in VFC. We summarized the existing schemes of full policy hiding ABE and partial policy hiding ABE and then concluded that partial policy hiding ABE is more suitable for VFC. We combine policy hiding technology and the technology of converting bilinear pairing cryptography schemes into prime-order bilinear pairing cryptography schemes and propose an efficient and partial policy hiding ciphertext-policy ABE scheme suitable for VFC. Experiments have proved that our scheme is computationally more efficient than previous policy hiding ABE schemes.},

  abstract     = {Filters are used to achieve frequency selectivity on the spectrum of input signal. Due to the stability of finite impulse response (FIR) filters, they are used in most of the applications. In the conventional FIR filters, the frequency band is fixed and cannot be changed once it is designed. Hence, there is a necessity of an FIR filter with auto-adjustment of band width in modern day communication systems like 5G. The design of FIR filter requires more number of filter coefficients to get the desired bandwidth specification. This results in a large slice for field programmable gate array implementation. Here, it proposed a state machine to select different FIR filters with the designated set of coefficients. Each FIR filter is having different set of coefficients, and based on the frequency of the clock signal, the FIR filter is selected and thereby frequency selectivity can be achieved. The proposed method is to implement reconfigurable FIR (RFIR) filter with control logic for auto-adjustment of frequency selections to achieve better band width requirements. The filter order is initially selected as 4 and presented the simulation results. The order of the filter(n) increased to 24 for verifying the bandwidth selection. The proposed architecture is compared with the existing architecture with 16 bits and 11 taps. The proposed method saves 33.5\% of look-up-tables (LUTs) compared to the existing methods. Simulation results presented are verified using Xilinx ISE design suite 14.7. The total number of four-input LUTs utilized are 630 for order(n) of the filter 24. Power consumed by the overall design is 195 mW.},

In order to address this, we propose a novel scheme for simultaneously estimating the camera model parameters and detecting the object. The object detection phase includes background modeling and its learning. Background is modeled by the proposed spatial kernel density estimation (SKDE) model and the model learning happens in the SKDE feature space. Background modeling and its learning is pixel-based approach. The model histograms learn the new pixel through its histogram representation. Our learning and classification strategy is different from that of the algorithm proposed by Heikkila et al. in the year 2006 in the context of similarity measure. We have developed the correntropy-based similarity measure strategy that is used for model learning and pixel classification. The camera model parameters are estimated by 2D optimization method where we have used the corner features of an object at subpixel accuracy level. These subpixel level features are used in the pipelining framework for model parameter estimation. The estimated model parameters are used to transform the input frame, which in turn is used for model learning and classification. The proposed scheme has been tested with underwater video frames from six datasets. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is compared with seven existing schemes and it is found that the proposed scheme exhibits improved performance as compared to the existing methods.},

The design of antenna arrays is essential as they are capable of controlling the radiation pattern in terms of sidelobe level (SLL), beamwidth (BW), nulls and beam steering. Among several geometries of antenna arrays, the circular antenna arrays have the advantage in terms of inherent capability to control the phase implicitly. In this paper, circular antenna array synthesis is presented using novel metaheuristic techniques like the Social Group Optimization Algorithm (SGOA) and Modified SGOA (MSGOA). The main objective of the synthesis process is to synthesize radiation patterns with suppressed SLL while the BW being equal to the uniform distribution. A comparative study is performed to analyze the performance of various synthesis techniques like amplitude only, inter-element spacing only, and amplitude spacing. The MGSOA and SGOA have proved to be performing well in accomplishing the objective. Further, the CAA synthesis problem is translated into single-variable and multivariable optimization problems following which the obvious advantage associated with the inclusion of additional variable as an additional degree of freedom is demonstrated. The simulation is carried out in Matlab®, and results are analyzed using the plotted radiation patterns.},

  abstract     = {Two-sided matching is a common research topic in our everyday life like marriage problem between men and women, schools and students. However, from the industrial perspective, the matching problem for complex equipment is a special research direction that needs professional participants that involve in the complex equipment production process. In this paper, a two-sided matching model for complex equipment production on the military–civilian integration platform is constructed that considers the reference satisfaction, and the reference satisfaction is firstly proposed which originates from operation management field. Moreover, the main influencing factors for complex equipment production are analyzed based on combined evaluation methods. The combined evaluation methods utilized in this research, one is DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation) method and the other is Grey–TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity for an Ideal Solution) method, are employed to acquire the joint importance results of the main analyzed influencing factors. The analyzed influencing factors are based on the evaluation indicators established in the evaluation indicator system for complex equipment production on the military–civilian merging platform, and the evaluation indicators are collected from relevant exist research. Then, suppliers and the manufacturers involved in the production of complex equipment give preference information to each other, and preference information is given on the basis of comprehensive analysis of the analyzed influencing factors which is by the aid of the aforementioned DEMATEL–Grey–TOPSIS analysis; meanwhile, the real satisfaction value of the suppliers and the manufacturers is obtained based on the preference value; then, the comprehensive reference satisfaction value could be obtained from the combination of the real satisfaction value and the expected satisfaction (real satisfaction value and disappointed satisfaction value), through aforementioned could we build a two-sided matching model for complex equipment on the military–civilian integration platform. Finally, we use a numerical example to illustrate the whole process about supplier–manufacturer matching for complex equipment production on the military–civilian integration platform.},

  abstract     = {Cooperation between upstream suppliers and downstream manufacturers in technology investment is a popular way to improve production technology for reducing suppliers’ production costs of key components. The suppliers’ cooperation strategies are mainly influenced by manufacturers’ technology investments and wholesale price discount contracts provided by suppliers. This paper explores whether a supplier should cooperate with two downstream competing manufacturers to accept their technology investments to reduce the supplier’s production cost of a key component. Specifically, we consider the following three cooperation strategies: The supplier does not accept manufacturers’ technology investments, only accepts one manufacturer’s technology investment and accepts both manufacturers’ technology investments. Our results demonstrate that the wholesale price discount contract and the technology investment can enhance the profits of the supplier and two manufacturers when the discount degree is low. Further, we conclude that when the discount degree is relatively low or when both the discount degree and the technology investment efficiency are relatively high, the supplier’s optimal cooperation strategy with two manufacturers is to accept both manufacturers’ technology investments and both manufacturers are also willing to invest simultaneously. At last, we extend the model to the asymmetric potential market size and show that our theoretical results are robust.},

The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) can be used to rank a set of alternatives based on the different types of criteria. However, this method still needs to be improved; fuzzy set theory and its corresponding extensions are bold in the line of TOPSIS improvement. In this study, the original form of TOPSIS method is extended using Pythagorean fuzzy-based Chebyshev distance measures. Pythagorean fuzzy set has better reflection compared to the conventional fuzzy set theory and Chebyshev distance measures can provide more accurate results, which are used to compute the separation measures in the TOPSIS method. Therefore, the novel improved TOPSIS methods have been developed underlying the ideal of Pythagorean fuzzy-based Chebyshev distance measures. The developed method is applied on a humanitarian case-study to show the efficiency of the approach in an emergency response situation. Results show that the proposed method is efficiently applicable in real-life decision-making situations.},

  abstract     = {The q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets dynamically change the range of indication of decision knowledge by adjusting a parameter q from decision makers, where $$q \ge 1$$ , and outperform the conventional intuitionistic fuzzy sets and Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (Lq-ROFSs), a qualitative type of q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets, are characterized by a degree of linguistic membership and a degree of linguistic non-membership to reflect the qualitative preferred and non-preferred judgments of decision makers. Einstein operator is a powerful alternative to the algebraic operators and has flexible nature with its operational laws and fuzzy graphs perform well when expressing correlations between attributes via edges between vertices in fuzzy information systems, which makes it possible for addressing correlational multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems. Inspired by the idea of Lq-ROFS and taking the advantage of the flexible nature of Einstein operator, in this paper, we aim to introduce a new class of fuzzy graphs, namely, linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy graphs (Lq-ROFGs) and further explore efficient approaches to complicated MAGDM situations. Following the above motivation, we propose the new concepts, including product-connectivity energy, generalized product-connectivity energy, Laplacian energy and signless Laplacian energy and discuss several of its desirable properties in the background of Lq-ROFGs based on Einstein operator. Moreover, product-connectivity energy, generalized product-connectivity energy, Laplacian energy and signless Laplacian energy of linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy digraphs (Lq-ROFDGs) are presented. In addition, we present a graph-based MAGDM approach with linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy information based on Einstein operator. Finally, an illustrative example related to the selection of mobile payment platform is given to show the validity of the proposed decision-making method. For the sake of the novelty of the proposed approach, comparison analysis is conducted and superiorities in contrast with other methodologies are illustrated.},

In this paper, the optimal parametric combinations of back and front zone variables in a ring frame, and input variables in a rotor spinning process are determined based on teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm. The optimization performance of this algorithm is also compared with four other techniques, e.g., firefly algorithm, differential evolution algorithm, cuckoo search algorithm and quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm with respect to accuracy and consistency of the derived solutions. This optimization technique can thus be effectively applied to any of the intermediate processes in a textile mill to obtain the best combinations of different input variables so as to achieve the target quality characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Artificial neural network (ANN) is modeled to predict and classify problems. However, in the training phase of ANNs discovering faultless values of the weights of a network is extremely troublesome. Traditional weight updating methods often get stuck into local optima and converge to optimal solutions very slowly. Therefore, to overcome these drawbacks a modified version of a nature-based algorithm which merges meta-heuristics with weight-updating technique of ANN has been used in this paper. Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is a well-established, efficient and competitive algorithm inspired by the hunting mechanism of the whales including their behavior in finding and attacking their prey with their bubble-net feeding technique. In WOA, the next location of the search individuals or whales is modified depending on some probability. Due to the high exploration rate of WOA, there is a disproportion between exploration and exploitation in the WOA and it also converges to the solution slowly. Thus, to establish an equilibrium between exploration and exploitation a new variant of WOA called modified whale optimization algorithm (MWOA) is proposed to overcome the problem of delayed convergence. In MWOA, roulette wheel selection is combined with WOA to enhance the convergence speed of WOA. MWOA is tested on 11 benchmark functions, and the outcomes are compared with WOA. The results prove that MWOA has gained success in overcoming the problem of the slow convergence of WOA. Also, the results show that the proposed MWOA technique, when applied to ANN, can overcome the problems of traditional techniques and has improved the results.},

However, the ability to balance convergence and diversity and the scalability of objectives are still far from perfect. To address these issues, this paper proposes a strengthened diversity indicator and reference vector-based evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization, termed SDIEA. In the proposed SDIEA, a new adaptive indicator is proposed, namely, strengthened diversity indicator (SDI). The proposed SDI is adopted to effectively emphasize the pressure of convergence and diversity in the many-objective space, by preserving the achievement scalarizing function (ASF) metric and considering angle information between individuals and reference vectors with the number of objectives and generations. Moreover, in order to further enhance the diversity management in global space, the reference vectors are used to guide population partition selection. Finally, the selected solutions based on SDI and reference vector are merged for the next generation. Experimental results show that the proposed SDIEA achieves competitive performance on MaF and WFG, compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, SDIEA obtains good performance on 20-objective test instances and still has the potential to strive for scalability of higher objectives.},

This work presents a new density-based subspace clustering algorithm (S_FAD) to overcome the drawbacks of classical algorithms. S_FAD is based on a bottom-up approach and finds subspace clusters of varied density using different parameters of the DBSCAN algorithm. The algorithm optimizes parameters of the DBCAN algorithm through a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm and uses hashing concepts to discover all non-redundant subspace clusters. The efficacy of S_FAD is evaluated against various existing subspace clustering algorithms on artificial and real datasets in terms of F_Score and rand_index. Performance is assessed based on three parameters: average ranking, SRR ranking, and scalability on varied dimensions. Statistical analysis is performed through the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results reveal that S_FAD performs considerably better on the majority of the datasets and scales well up to 6400 dimensions on the actual dataset.},

  abstract     = {In recent decades, hybridization of superior attributes of few algorithms was proposed to aid in covering more areas of complex application as well as improves performance. Condition monitoring is a major component in predictive maintenance which monitors the condition and identifies significant changes in the machinery parameter to perform early detection and prevent equipment defects that could cause unplanned downtime or incur unnecessary expenditures. An effective condition monitoring model is helpful to reduce the frequency of unexpected breakdown incidents and thus, facilitates in maintenance. ANN has shown effective in various condition monitoring and fault detection applications. ANN is popular due to its capability of identifying the complex nonlinear relationships among features in a large dataset and hence, it can perform with an accurate prediction. However, a drawback is that the performance of ANN is sensitive to the parameters (i.e., number of hidden neurons and the initial values of connection weights) in its architecture where the settings of these parameters are subject to tuning on a trial-and-error basis. Hence, a wide range of studies have been focused on determining the optimal weight values of ANN models and the number of hidden neurons. In this research work, the motivation is to develop an autonomous learning model based on the hybridization of an adaptive ANN and a metaheuristic algorithm for optimizing ANN parameters so that the network could perform learning and adaptation in a more flexible way and handle condition classification tasks more accurately in industries, such as in power systems. This paper presents an intelligent system integrating a Radial Basis Function Network with Dynamic Decay Adjustment (RBFN-DDA) with a Harmony Search (HS) to perform condition monitoring in industrial processes. RBFN-DDA performs incremental learning wherein its structure expands by adding new hidden units to include new information. As such, its training can reach stability in a shorter time compared to the gradient-descent based methods. To achieve optimal RBFN-DDA performance, HS is proposed to optimize the center and the width of each hidden unit in a trained RBFN. By integrating with the HS algorithm, the proposed metaheuristic neural network (RBFN-DDA-HS) can optimize the RBFN-DDA parameters and improve classification performances from the original RBFN-DDA by 2.2\% up to 22.5\% in two benchmarks datasets, which are numerical records from a bearing and steel plate system and a condition-monitoring system in a power plant (i.e., the circulating water (CW) system). The results also show that the proposed RBFN-DDA-HS is compatible, if not better than, the classification performances of other state-of-the-art machine learning methods.},

  abstract     = {Cloud services with the property of elasticity are always bearing different loads over time. The efficiency of cloud management can be improved through the accurate prediction for cloud loads, which can be served as the foundation and recommendation for the future developing of the network scheme. As the basis and premise for management and decision making, a good prediction depends on suitable models and research methods. However, the interaction of users and the cloud network is high variability in the time and spatial dimensions, so traditional linear forecasting models cannot always process cloud computing loads well because of nonlinear changes. In this paper, a novel cloud load prediction model is proposed by improving whale optimization algorithm based on the hybrid strategy (HWOA) and combined with extreme learning machine (ELM) for strong nonlinear mapping ability. The proposed cloud load forecasting model is to employ HWOA optimizer to optimize the ELM model random parameters. Main research work includes that (1) the HWOA optimizer is to solve the whale optimizer local extremum problem; (2) the proposed HWOA optimizer reduces the ELM random parameters on cloud load forecasting; (3) the convergence performance is verified by benchmark testing functions; and (4) three groups of simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the cloud load forecasting results. The results prove that the HWOA optimizer has a good convergence and outperforms the several conventional popular swarm intelligence optimizers. Also, the prediction results verify that our proposed model is more competitive for providing a solid foundation for efficient resource management and maximized economic benefits in cloud environment. For cloud load research groups and practitioners, this paper provides a new idea of cloud load forecasting.},

ICM and ACS are both based on a MRF model to assess the local and the global quality of an arbitrary segmentation. The local optimization is performed by combining Maximum Likelihood (ML) for estimation of the parameters and ICM to find the solution given a fixed set of these parameters. A comparative study is performed to select the combination strategy that gives a better result. The effectiveness of our proposal is proven through experimentation.

  abstract     = {The cuckoo search (CS) algorithm is an effective optimization algorithm, but it is prone to stagnation in suboptimality because of some limitations in its exploration mechanisms. This paper introduces a variation of CS called exploratory CS (ECS), which incorporates three modifications to the original CS algorithm to enhance its exploration capabilities. First, ECS uses a special type of opposition-based learning called refraction learning to improve the ability of CS to jump out of suboptimality. Second, ECS uses the Gaussian perturbation to optimize the worst candidate solutions in the population before the discard step in CS. Third, in addition to the Lévy flight mutation method used in CS, ECS employs two mutation methods, namely highly disruptive polynomial mutation and Jaya mutation, to generate new improved candidate solutions. A set of 14 widely used benchmark functions was used to evaluate and compare ECS to three variations of CS:CS with Lévy flight (CS), CS with highly disruptive polynomial mutation (CS10) and CS with pitch adjustment mutation (CS11). The overall experimental and statistical results indicate that ECS exhibits better performance than all of the tested CS variations. Besides, the single-objective IEEE CEC 2014 functions were used to evaluate and compare the performance of ECS to six well-known swarm optimization algorithms: CS with Lévy flight, Grey wolf optimizer (GWO), distributed Grey wolf optimizer (DGWO), distributed adaptive differential evolution with linear population size reduction evolution (L-SHADE), memory-based hybrid Dragonfly algorithm and Fireworks algorithm with differential mutation. Interestingly, the results indicate that ECS provides competitive performance compared to the tested six well-known swarm optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we develop a new solution approach for the dynamic missile allocation problem of a naval task group (TG). The approach considers the rescheduling of the surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), where a set of them have already been scheduled to a set of attacking anti-ship missiles (ASMs). The initial schedule is mostly inexecutable due to disruptions such as neutralization of a target ASM, detecting a new ASM, and breakdown of a SAM system. To handle the dynamic disruptions while keeping efficiency high, we use a bi-objective model that considers the efficiency of SAM systems and the stability of the schedule simultaneously. The rescheduling decision is time-sensitive, and the amount of information to be processed is enormous. Thus, we propose a novel approach that supplements the decision-maker (DM) in choosing a Pareto optimal solution considering two conflicting objectives. The proposed approach uses an artificial neural network (ANN) that includes an adaptive learning algorithm to structure the DM&#39;s prior articulated preferences. ANN acts like a DM during the engagement process and chooses one of the non-dominated solutions in each rescheduling time point. We assume that the DM&#39;s utility function is consistent with a non-decreasing quasi-concave function, and the cone domination principle is incorporated into the solution procedure. An extensive computational study is provided to present the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Intrusion detection is an important means to deal with network attacks. The traditional neural network needs to preprocess the sample data in intrusion detection, which may cause the loss in data accuracy, thus affecting the performance of intrusion detection. In this paper, a logarithm neuron (LOGN) is designed, and each LOGN is responsible for processing a kind of data feature. Different from the traditional neuron operation rules, the logarithm operation is carried out in the LOGN, and the base number of logarithm operations in each LOGN can be determined by the neural network according to the actual task requirements. Because the increase and decrease of logarithm operation are different under different logarithmic base values, the sensitivity of LOGN to the change of sample data feature values is also different, which makes LOGN have higher capability in data feature extraction. Based on LOGN, the logarithmic neural network layer (LOGL) is designed. Logarithmic neural network (LOGNN) is constructed by combining LOGLs with traditional deep neural network. To prevent the gradient of LOGNN from disappearing, a loss function of anti-gradient vanishing (AGLF) is proposed. Experimental results show that LOGNN has obvious advantages over traditional machine learning and deep neural network methods in terms of performance indices on NSL_ KDD and UNSW_ NB_15 data sets.},

A smart queue management can be the key to the success of any sector. In this paper, we focus on edge deployments to make the smart queuing system (SQS) accessible by all also providing ability to run it on cheap devices. This gives it the ability to run the queuing system deep learning algorithms on pre-existing computers which a retail store, public transportation facility or a factory may already possess, thus considerably reducing the cost of deployment of such a system. SQS demonstrates how to create a video AI solution on the edge. We validate our results by testing it on multiple edge devices, namely CPU, integrated edge graphic processing unit (iGPU), vision processing unit (VPU) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

Measuring sentence similarity has attracted researchers over the last few years, although determining the performance and effectiveness of measuring sentence similarity is a key issue. The similarity between sentences can be syntactic or semantic; syntactic similarity is based on string matching, while semantic similarity implies similar meaning between sentences. Sentence representation in the distributional space involves measuring sentence similarity based on the similarity between vectors. In this section, we propose a new approach that measures sentence similarity by including lexical, semantic, and syntactic–semantic features and applying linear regression and support vector machine regression. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, experiments are conducted on two datasets, namely, Arabic paraphrasing benchmark, MSRvid, and SMTeuroparl from SemEval 2017. The proposed approach achieves a correlation of 0.354 when applied to Arabic paraphrasing benchmark because of the complexity of this dataset, while it achieves a correlation of 0.743 and 0.467 on the MSRvid and SMTeuroparl dataset, respectively.},

According to the characteristics of the actual urban road network, we proposed measurement of travel time reliability under uncertain random environment, that is, the travel time belief reliability. By extracting the information of traffic service subject and object, this method takes into account the influence of cognitive and random uncertainty on reliability. Next, we established the belief reliability model of travel task under the uncertain random road environment.

In addition, the impact of road objective factors and driving state factors on the travel time threshold is discussed by using the uncertainty regression analysis method.

The estimated brain tissue volume between the AD and CN/N brain tissue clearly quantifies the brain tissue reduction and it is compared with existing automatic estimation method statistical parametric mapping (SPM).

Genetic algorithm (GA), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II and NSGA-III), and modified Self-Adaptive Multi-Population Elitism Jaya Algorithm (SAMPE JA) are utilized to solve the problem. We compared obtained compromise solutions of the problem by evolutionary algorithms with population size, the maximum number of generations, crossover probability, mutation probability, and computational time. Sensitivity analysis for supply, demand, and carbon cap parameters is incorporated in the model’s solution, which helps the decision maker make the appropriate decision. These evolutionary algorithms (NSGA-II and NSGA-III) give Pareto-optimal solutions, and it helps management decide on the selection of p-facility locations. They could transport their product to the facility locations easily, with minimum transport, CE costs, and transportation time. As a result, management can give equal attention to their profit and environment, which helps to build world market credibility. At last, the paper concludes the results.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes a novel implicit fourth-order approximation for solving the 2D quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations on an irrational domain. In this technique, we use 9-grid points compact cell with half-step unequal mesh discretization in both x- and y-coordinates. We also study fourth-order explicit approximations for the solution of normal derivatives on an irrational domain. The proposed method has been extended to solve quasilinear elliptic equations in vector form. Stability analysis is discussed in order to verify the convergence of the proposed computational method. On applications, we solve several benchmark nonlinear elliptic problems including steady-state Burgers’ and Navier–Stokes equations. The outcome of numerical results is shown the reliability, accuracy and the stability character of the method even for high values of Re.},

Relevant statistical reports from World Health Organization notify that air pollution play a major role in cause of diseases like asthma, lung cancer, stroke, early death and premature birth. Apart from diseases pollution also influence dangerous climate, weather conditions and may cause acid rain, global warming, ozone layer depletion, rainfall declines, etc. Therefore, it is essential to take necessary and preventive measures against air pollution. A comprehensive study is required to assess quality of ambient (outdoor) air, based on the observations of the major pollutants concentration drawn from different monitoring stations. Aiming at this problem, we proposed an ensemble based model to assess the air quality of United States from the period 2000 to 2016. In this article, we resolved the issues related to preprocessing of imbalanced dataset and improved the performance of the entire system through ensemble methods. We compared the recommended model with the existing ones. The experimental results show that the suggested model is superior to other systems and yield high accuracy, low error rate.},

Prioritization of test case arranges the regression test suite to detect the faults earlier in the testing process. The test cases necessary for validating the recent changes and finding the maximum faults in minimum time are selected. In this manuscript, an optimization algorithm (Bee Algorithm) based on the intelligent foraging behavior of honey bee swarm has been proposed that can enhance the rate of fault detection in test case prioritization. The bee algorithm, along with the fuzzy rule base, reduces the test cases’ volume by selecting the test cases from the pre-existing test suite. The proposed algorithm developed for enhancing the fault detection rate in minimum time is inspired by the behavior of two types of worker bees, namely scout bees and forager bees. These worker bees are responsible for the maintenance, progress, and growth of the colony. The proposed approach is implemented on two projects. The prioritization result is quantified by using the average percentage of fault detection (APFD) metric. Compared with other existing prioritization techniques like no prioritization, reverse prioritization, random prioritization, and previous work, the proposed algorithm outperforms all in fault detection rate. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is represented by using the APFD graphs and charts.},

  abstract     = {The fuzzy rough set (FRS) acts as a powerful mathematical tool to deal with uncertain data, and it has many applications in feature selection, dimensionality reduction and classification. The fuzzy rough set based on robust nearest neighbor (FRS-RNN) is one of the vital classifiers which has been successfully applied to handle real-valued datasets. From the literature, it is very clearly evident that no research attempt has been made on FRS-RNN to text document classification. Generally, the document classification process consists of two crucial phases, namely feature extraction and classifier model construction. Mainly TF-IDF and convolutional neural network (CNN)-based techniques are used for efficient feature extraction. The CNN provides the best feature engineering through effective preprocessing the documents for better representation using pre-trained word embedding. In this paper, we proposed a modified CNN structure for both text document classification and feature extraction. Then, both FRS and FRS-RNN have been implemented for text document classification on the benchmark datasets like 20 Newsgroup and Reuter-21578 using both TF-IDF and modified CNN-based feature extraction techniques. The classification performance of the FRS, CNN and FRS-RNN is evaluated and compared using well-defined metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1-measure. Finally, the classification performance of FRS-RNN is compared with state-of-the-art traditional classification models such as SVM, KNN, Naïve Bayes, DNN, CNN and RNN and with some recently developed classification models. The experimental results followed by empirical evaluation show that the proposed FRS-RNN outperforms all the aforementioned classification models.},

Shuyang Li and Hongxing Li have studied the approximation of conventional intuitionistic fuzzy numbers in which the membership function is bounded and nonmembership function is unbounded in nature. The concepts of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs) have bounded membership function and bounded nonmembership function. As the generalization of both IFSs and IVIFSs, the notion of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers of new type with bounded membership function and bounded nonmembership function has been introduced by Lakshmana et al. In this paper, the procedure for weighted triangular approximation of intuitionistic fuzzy number of new type is provided with some suitable illustrations. Moreover, some useful properties of the triangular approximation on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers have also been discussed.},

  abstract     = {Numerical analysis of turbulent air flow structure through a rectangular channel along with multiple and different types of baffle plates has been performed, which is an important issue for heat exchangers and for that the flow characteristics and pressure drop are need to be identified. Finite Volume Method are employed to solve the governing equations using FLUENT with the Standard $$k-\epsilon $$ turbulence model. The present study has been validated at $$\text {Re}=87{,}300$$ with the studies of Dermitini et al. The aim of this study is to investigate the dynamic behavior of turbulent air flow, baffle height, baffle thickness and arrangement of baffle in different locations for high values of $$\text {Re}=88{,}000$$ . Moreover, flow structure and pressure drop characteristics are discussed in the presence of trapezoidal and plane shape baffles. Normalized velocity profiles and skin friction coefficients have been studied at different locations for trapezoidal and plane baffle plates. Finally, it has been concluded that pressure drop attains its maximum value at the upstream of the channel and minimum value at the downstream of the channel for both the plane and trapezoidal shape baffles. It is ensured that in trapezoidal case axial velocity is higher than plane baffle when four baffles are alternately placed at lower and upper walls. Furthermore, it has also been revealed that the separation of boundary layer is influenced by baffle height (h) and baffle thickness (b). At $$x=0.170 \ \mathrm{m}$$ , normalized velocity profiles $$(u/u_{0})$$ are presented for wide range of Reynolds number, $$\text {Re}\in [44{,}000-176{,}000]$$ to reveal that increase of $$\text {Re}$$ causes the increase in vortexes.},

We show that these posets can be represented by means of commutative meet-directoids with an antitone involution satisfying certain identities and implications. In the case of a finite distributive or strongly modular consistent poset, this poset can be converted into a residuated structure and hence it can serve as an algebraic semantics of a certain non-classical logic with unsharp conjunction and implication. Finally we show that the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of a consistent poset is a consistent lattice, i.e., a bounded lattice with an antitone involution satisfying the above-mentioned properties.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) is gaining significant prevalence in every field of study due to its domination in training large data sets. However, several applications are utilizing machine learning (ML) methods from the past several years and reported good performance. However, their limitations in terms of data complexity give rise to DL methods. Intrusion detection is one of the prominent areas in which researchers are extending DL methods. Even though several excellent surveys cover the growing body of research on this subject, the literature lacks a detailed comparison of ML methods such as ANN, SVM, fuzzy approach, swarm intelligence and evolutionary computation methods in intrusion detection, particularly on recent research. In this context, the present paper deals with the systematic review of ML methods and DL methods in intrusion detection. In addition to reviewing ML and DL methods, this paper also focuses on benchmark datasets, performance evaluation measures and various applications of DL methods for intrusion detection. The present paper summarizes the recent work, compares their experimental results for detecting network intrusions. Furthermore, current research challenges are identified for helping fellow researchers in the era of DL-based intrusion detection.},

  abstract     = {User-preference based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have attracted much attention recently because it helps save computational cost, make better use of the knowledge offered by the decision-maker, and offer more insight into solutions in the region of interest (ROI). Weight vectors based MOEAs can be converted to their user-preference based versions by offering a set of evenly distributed weight vectors located in ROI. Yet existing weight design methods can only generate weight vectors in the whole unit plane in the weight space. To generate an arbitrary number of weight vectors in ROI, this paper proposes a tri-objective user-preference based uniform weight design method using Delaunay Triangulation (PUWD-DT), so that weight vectors can be fine-tuned to uniformity in ROI. Furthermore, the proposed PUWD-DT based preference method with the achievement scalarizing function is assembled into MOEA/D to convert it into its user-preference based version (MOEA/D+PUWD-DT) and the convergence of population in ROI for optimization problems with irregular shaped Pareto front is also promoted. Finally, the MOEA/D+PUWD-DT is applied to the reservoir flood control operation problem, and our experimental results indicate that the proposed preference-based MOEA method performs better than the state-of-the-art.},

At the very coronary heart of the copula, the concept is the well-known theorem of Sklar. It states that any multivariate distribution function can be disintegrated into the marginal distributions and a copula, which comprises the reliance between variables. On the other hand, the decision tree is a renowned nonparametric dominant modeling approach used for both regression and labeling problems. A decision tree represents a tree-structured classification of the data into surprising instructions for simplicity and prediction reason. In this paper, we are going to appraise with novel nonparametric copula-based decision tree organization using a measure of dependence: maximal information coefficient as classification index for two related variables which best classify the data concerning looking at the factors, but additionally ranked the factors in line with their inferences. Additionally, we pre-test the splitting criteria value to anticipate growing branches of the decision tree at each infant node. For example, we followed our proposed method to credit card records for Taiwan and coronary heart disease records of Pakistan and acquired the desirable outcomes. As a result, the anticipated method of initiating two-variable decision trees is tested using constructive tools for classification, prediction and reconnecting critical factors in statistics, finance, fitness sciences, machine learning, and many other associated fields.},

In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial network structure called Cascading Residual–Residual Attention Generative Adversarial Network (CRRAGAN). First, this paper proposes a novel and efficient feature extraction module: Cascading Residual–Residual Block, which can extract multi-scale information and low-level cascade information to high-level information. CRRAGAN directly uses the channel attention module to capture low-resolution image key information and fuse it into the next stage feature. Second, a new loss combination function is proposed, a weighted sum of image loss, adversarial loss, perceptual loss, and charbonnier loss, to make the network training more stable. In the end, we compare our proposed method with 15 previous state-of-the-art methods and discuss the performance of different training datasets.

In this paper, a novel framework based totally on identity vector is introduced for the online writer identification task. In the proposed framework, the sequence of extracted feature vectors from each handwriting sample is embedded into a fixed-length vector, referred to as identity vector (i-vector), to capture the long-term sequence-level writer-related characteristics, and then passed to the next stage for classification. Several techniques for feature normalization and intra-class variation reduction techniques in the i-vector domain such as within-class covariance normalization and regularized linear discriminant analysis are also investigated. We extensively evaluate the introduced framework on the popular database, CAISA, for English and Chinese language in various scenarios, such as multi-language and cross-language. Experimental results show, in the best cases, the proposed framework could achieve 98.68\% accuracy on English dataset and 96.03\% on Chinese dataset of the CAISA database. These obtained results indicate an improvement over the best reported result of the current state-of-the-art approaches with the exception of fully end-to-end approaches which have their own serious limitation in the real applications. In addition to the accuracy improvement, due to its low computational load it has the potential to be implemented on the handheld digital devices.},

Well-known approaches include the analytic hierarchical/network process (AHP/ANP), ratio method, Delphi method, etc., and other modifications and extensions have been proposed to address situations that are more complicated, e.g., fuzzy, grey, etc. Generally speaking, the ANP is the most popular method and derives the weights of criteria by considering interdependent and feedback effects. However, a problem with ANP is the cumbersome process of calculating the weights of the network relationships between criteria. More critical problem with ANP is the issue of divergence when absorbing criteria exist. Although several methods, such as the DEMATEL-based ANP and diminishing utility decision model, have been proposed to address these issues, these approaches have several limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel way to overcome the limitations of the above approaches and provide a possible solution for determining the weights of criteria via network influence maps (NetIM) with pseudonodes. The results of the numerical examples show NetIM is more rational, flexible, and useful than other methods.},

  abstract     = {Proper response selection is a crucial challenge in retrieval-based chatbots. The state-of-the-art methods match a response with the word sequence of a context, or match the response with each utterance in the context and then accumulate matching information. The former architecture could lose some important local matching information in utterance–response pairs and does not explicitly capture the relationships and dependencies among utterances. The latter architecture does not consider the important global matching information because there is no match between the response and the context at word level. Hence, the above methods have a problem, without considering the fact that matching a response with different levels of a context could match different information for multi-turn response selection. In this work, we propose a hierarchical matching network to match a response with the word and utterance level of a context. At word level, we concatenate the multi-turn context as a long word sequence and then adopt a text matching model to match the response with the word sequence which can capture important matching information at word level. At utterance level, we employ the identical text matching model to match the response with each utterance in the context to capture important matching information for each utterance–response pair and then accumulate the matching information by a recurrent neural network to model the relationships of utterances. At last, the hierarchical matching information is fused to get the final matching information. Experiments on two large-scale public multi-turn response selection datasets show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models.},

One notable original aspect of the new MOSOSS algorithm is that it evolves partial (incompletely scheduled) solutions. For this purpose, we propose evolutionary operators specially constructed to deal with both incomplete and complete schedules.

The linearized chance-constrained counterparts are developed using a transformation approach to reduce the model complexity and solve the models linearly. Several numerical experiments are performed to test the effectiveness of the proposed models. The results are compared with the results of modified ant colony optimization and a piecewise-linear programming model.

Our proposed method utilizes two meta-heuristic techniques, the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and the firefly algorithm (FA), by combining their features to perform this task. The hybrid model is called WOAFA. For more detail, the operators of the FA are employed to improve the exploitation ability of the WOA by serving as a local search. Moreover, the quality of the proposed WOAFA method is tested by comparing with well-known meta-heuristic algorithms over six machines and six jobs, namely (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 machines) and (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 jobs).},

  abstract     = {Recently, gene-culture coevolutionary multitasking, i.e., the multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA and MFEA-II), has become increasingly popular in the area of evolutionary computation. One of the most fascinating aspects of the MFEA is that it can obtain better optimization performance by exploiting underlying complementarities and/or commonalities between different tasks synchronously. In this area, tournament selection is an important ingredient in the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) not only for a single task but also in multitasking. When it is used in the NSGA-II, it mainly concerns individual selection for a single task. However, the selection mechanism has to be reformulated in evolutionary multitasking with different cultural characteristics. Unfortunately, until now, there has been no relevant research discussing tournament selection mechanisms in gene-culture coevolutionary multitasking. Accordingly, to clarify its selection mechanism by fully considering the cultural characteristics built into multitasking, in this paper, a novel tournament selection method based on multilayer cultural characteristics in evolutionary multitasking is proposed. In the presented method, the concept of overall rank (OR) representing a comprehensive cultural indicator is given based on the rank of the Pareto front (PF) and crowding distance. Then, the each task, PF and OR of every individual are defined as the multilayer cultural characteristics that determine the selection order. Finally, the new selection mechanism is stated clearly based on the three proposed binary tournament selection methods. The efficacy of the developed mechanism is demonstrated through testing on several benchmark functions as well as aluminum electrolysis process design in evolutionary multitasking.},

This paper investigates a modified version of the GSK algorithm to find the best feature subsets. Firstly, it represents a binary variant of GSK algorithm by employing a probability estimation operator (Bi-GSK) on the two main pillars of GSK algorithm. And then, the chaotic maps are used to enhance the performance of the proposed algorithm. Ten different types of chaotic maps are considered to adapt the parameters of the GSK algorithm that make a proper balance between exploration and exploitation and save the algorithm from premature convergence. To check the performance of proposed approaches of GSK algorithm, twenty-one benchmark datasets are taken from the UCI repository for feature selection. The performance is measured by calculating different type of measures, and several metaheuristic algorithms are adopted to compare the obtained results. The results indicate that Chebyshev chaotic map shows the best result among all chaotic maps which improve the performance accuracy and convergence rate of the original algorithm. Moreover, it outperforms the other metaheuristic algorithms in terms of efficiency, fitness value and the minimum number of selected features.},

Their coordination involves the fulfilment of multiple objectives that are directly dependent on dynamic, unpredictable and uncontrollable phenomena. In this paper, two systems are presented and compared based on their ability to reposition fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles to maintain a useful airborne wireless network topology. Genetic algorithms and non-cooperative games are employed for the generation of optimal flying solutions. The two methods consider realistic kinematics for hydrocarbon-powered medium-altitude, long-endurance aircrafts. Coupled with a communication model that addresses environmental conditions, they optimise flying to maximising the number of supported ground-based units. Results of large-scale scenarios highlight the ability of genetic algorithms to evolve flexible sets of manoeuvres that keep the flying vehicles separated and provide optimal solutions over shorter settling times. In comparison, game theory is found to identify strategies of predefined manoeuvres that maximise coverage but require more time to converge.},

The crow search algorithm (CSA) is a new and effective meta-heuristic algorithm that emulates crows’ intelligent group behavior in nature. However, it suffers from several problems, such as trapping into local optimum and premature convergence. This paper proposes an improved crow search algorithm (ICSA), which has been tested and evaluated by a set of well-known benchmark functions. A new update mechanism that uses the merits of the global best position to move toward the best position is proposed. This mechanism increases the convergence of the algorithm and improves its local search-ability. Twenty benchmark functions are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed ICSA. Moreover, the ICSA algorithm is compared with the conventional CSA and other meta-heuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), dragonfly algorithm (DA), grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), gray wolf optimizer (GWO), moth-flame optimization (MFO), and sine-cosine algorithm (SCA). The experimental result shows that the proposed ICSA algorithm has produced promising results and outperformed conventional CSA and other meta-heuristic algorithms. Also, the proposed ICSA has a more robust convergence for optimizing objective functions in terms of solution accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of multi-objective optimization is to simultaneously optimize several objective functions that are usually in conflict with each other. An acceptable solution is one that can strike a trade-off between the results of these functions. Although, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have a good history in solving multi-objective problems, how to find more accurate and diverse solutions set at an acceptable time is still a challenge. In this study, a quantum-inspired multi-objective harmony search algorithm is proposed to solve multi-objective optimization problems. In this algorithm, a new quantum mutation strategy is proposed, which is a combination of harmony improvisation operators and a quantum adaptive rotation gate. While the use of the rotation gate leads to the move to further solutions and complete coverage of the problem space, the improvisation operators (PAR and BW) trigger tiny impulses and mutate into neighbor solutions. The advantage of such an algorithm is to strengthen the balance between the exploration and exploitation processes. Also, the crowding distance metric of the elitism strategy ensures the production of solutions with maximum variety in the problem space. The results of the implementation of this algorithm on multi-objective benchmark functions indicate significant improvement in criteria such as the distance to Pareto optimal, the scattering, and the convergence rate compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the energy obtained from different generating units in modern power systems must be suitably planned for optimal power system operating conditions. One of the methods applied for this is the optimal power flow (OPF). Thus, the optimal power flow (OPF) problem has become one of the most important power system planning and operation challenges once renewable energy sources are integrated with modern electrical power systems which have a highly nonlinear complex structure. In addition, usage of high-voltage direct current systems increases the complexity of the network in the modern power system. Using a symbiotic organisms search (SOS) algorithm, this paper focused on a solution to the security-constrained AC–DC OPF with regard to the uncertainty of wind, solar and plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) energy systems with thermal generating units. Uncertain wind speed, solar irradiance, and PEV power were modeled using Weibull, Lognormal, and Normal probability distribution functions (PDFs), respectively. Moreover, our study presents solutions to the security-constrained AC–DC OPF by involving test cases of stochastic wind, solar, and PEV energy systems on IEEE 30-bus and 57-bus test systems under various operational conditions. These can be listed as minimization of different total cost functions, improvement of voltage stability, voltage deviation and minimization of fitness function for determined N-1 contingency conditions. The SOS algorithm results were compared to the artificial bee colony, imperialist competitive, moth swarm, shuffled frog-leaping, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization algorithms. These comparison results demonstrated that the SOS algorithm exhibited the capability to provide high-quality solutions to the OPF problem by satisfying both equality and inequality constraints. In addition, nonparametric Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were applied to show the statistical validity of the results obtained from the algorithms.},

Thereafter, the conduct and the inclinations of the learners are examined via completing the mining of the arrangements watched every now and again by the IWO calculation. Rather than a learner effectively looking for data, recommender frameworks give counsel to students about articles they may wish to analyze. At last, the proposal of the e-learning depends on the appraisals comparing to these arrangements watched often. This proposed system is going to implement and validate in numerous e-learning entries against the client inclinations over some undefined time frame and demonstrated to be more proficiency and exactness contrasted with the customary recommender framework. This strategy can help learners to grasp the knowledge system and learning direction, and improve their learning efficiency.

  abstract     = {Efficient face recognition can realize fast and accurate face recognition and make it widely used in essential fields such as human–computer interaction and access control. At present, there are many face recognition methods whose recognition rate can reach high accuracy, but the training of the model and the recognition of samples take much time, which leads to insufficient real-time performance. This paper designs a fusion facial semantic feature (FFSF) and an incremental learning mechanism (ILM) for efficient face recognition. FFSF feature is a fusion of facial contour features and facial semantic component features, which can extract contour features and interior features of facial organs (eyes, mouth, nose, and eyebrow) according to facial organs’ position. FFSF features can ensure that the extracted features are concentrated in the face’s most discriminative region, making the extracted features have good discriminative characteristics. Then, we use a clustering algorithm to construct a hierarchical incremental learning tree (HIL-Tree) with a hierarchical structure and use the HIL-Tree to implement the ILM. ILM achieves fast and accurate sample classification by retrieving the nodes in HIL-Tree, and the training samples can be directly added to the HIL-Tree by retrieval instead of rebuilding the HIL-Tree during the training process. Extensive experiments on several public data sets demonstrate the proposed efficient face recognition method’s excellent accuracy and efficiency.},

Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and kappa index were calculated from ROC analysis, and SCAI was computed from the classification of map by natural break method and flood pixels in that classification. Since the predicted results of the methods applied did not point out the same model for each criterion, a simple method was selected to determine the most preferable method. Analysis showed that, IoE model was found to be the best model considering the ROC parameters, while PCA and AHP methods gave more reliable results considering SCAI.

  abstract     = {Label-specific features learning can effectively exploit the unique features of each label, which alleviates the high dimensionality and improves the classification performance of multi-label. However, most existing label-specific features learning algorithms assume that label space is complete, ignoring the effect of missing labels on the classification accuracy. Some methods try to recover the missing labels first and then learn the mapping between the completed label matrix and the feature matrix. However, early intervention in the recovery of missing labels may affect the distribution of original labels to a certain extent. In this paper, feature-label dual-mapping for missing label-specific features learning is proposed. According to the information that the label depends on the feature, the dual-mapping weight of the complete feature space and the missing label space is jointly learned. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is to conduct latent missing labels recovery by feature-label dual-mapping to directly obtain target weight in this paper, avoiding the negative influence of early label recovery intervention. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods in 10 benchmark multi-label data sets, the results show that the proposed algorithm is reasonable and effective.},

  abstract     = {Dealing with partially known or missing data is a common problem in machine learning. This work is interested in the problem of querying the true value of data to improve the quality of the learned model, when those data are only partially known. This study is in the line of active learning, since we consider that the precise value of some partial data can be queried to reduce the uncertainty in the learning process, yet can consider any kind of partial data (not only entirely missing one). We propose a querying strategy based on the concept of racing algorithms in which several models are competing. The idea is to identify the query that will help the most to quickly decide the winning model in the competition. After discussing and formalizing the general ideas of our approach, we study the particular case of decision trees in case of interval-valued features and set-valued labels. The experimental results indicate that, in comparison with other baselines, the proposed approach significantly outperforms simpler strategies in the case of partially specified features, while it achieves similar performances in the case of partially specified labels.},

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown remarkable effects for various computer vision tasks. Standard convolution plays an important role in the GAN-based model. However, the single type of kernel with a single spatial size limits the learning ability of the model and does not explicitly consider the dependencies among channels. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a pyramidal convolution attention GAN for image denoising, a model that uses a residual structure with a pyramidal convolution attention block (PyCA) instead of the stacked standard convolution as a generator within the GAN setting. The proposed PyCA considers the channel-wise dependencies while extracting multi-scale features. Besides, we also design a data augmentation method for image denoising. The experimental results show that our model achieves better denoising performance than other competing methods.},

  abstract     = {In the industry of agricultural farming, defected fruits are the major reason for financial calamities across the globe. It affects both the quality and competence of the fruits. Quality detection is a post-harvest process that requires highly skilled labor and time. Therefore, the automatic detection of quality of fruits is an important step in the harvesting process which helps to save the man power and time consumption. Different systems have been designed using image processing and learning techniques that detect the quality of fruits and classify them. To speed up the fruit sorting process, a system has been designed using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The proposed system works with total nine types of fruits: apple, banana, pear, guava, grape, mango, pomegranate, orange and tomato. Recurrent neural network is used as a proposed deep learning classifier which is trained using good and bad extracted features through implementation of principal component analysis. A simple contrast enhancement technique, preceded by grayscale conversion, has been used for balancing the unstable light in the input fruit image that can suppress the object definition. In the segmentation phase, canny edge detection is used for discovering the boundaries of the fruits. The comparative analysis with existing multi-fruit or single-fruit systems clearly shows that the proposed general purpose system overshadows them by achieving better accuracy (98.47\%), precision (98.93\%), recall (75.44\%) and mean square error (1.53\%) values.},

  abstract     = {In recent times, the question of employability has become a critical concern not only for degree holders but for educational organizations. Hence, employability prediction models play an important role in analyzing the student’s capability to get employment. In this paper, a hybrid model of deep belief network and soft max regression (DBN-SR) is proposed for student employability prediction. Initially, pre-processing is performed on student’s data for removing irrelevant attributes to achieve data consistency. Further, to enhance the accuracy of the prediction model, the crow search algorithm-based feature selection model is employed to select the optimal subset of features from original features. Then, the selected subset of features is taken as the input of the deep belief network (DBN) for intrinsic feature learning to obtain high-level feature representation. Finally, the soft max regression (SR) is used to predict the class of students as employed or unemployed. The proposed employability prediction model achieves above 98\% of accuracy which is comparatively 2.5\%, 5\% higher than the deep autoencoder and deep neural network-based models. The performance outcomes proved that the proposed DBN-SR model has been well suitable for predicting student’s employability.},

All the existing works use either stem-base or proper-premise approach to find the implication base in exponential time. Hence, we introduce a distributed algorithm to find the implication base quickly in larger datasets in polynomial time. In this paper, we propose a scalable algorithm to find the implication base using machine learning technique FP-growth, big data processing framework Apache Spark and executed on large formal contexts.

The problem of air pollution in China is becoming more and more serious, which poses a great threat to people’s health. Therefore, the prediction of air quality concentration is very important. PM2.5 is the primary indicator for evaluating the concentration of smog. Currently, studies have been proposed to predict the concentration of PM2.5. Before, most methods use traditional machine learning or real-time monitoring to predict pollution of PM2.5 value. However, the previous prediction methods cannot meet the requirement of the accuracy. For this end, this paper uses Convnet and Dense-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit to predict PM2.5 value which combined Convnet, Dense and Bi-GRU. The feature in air quality data was extracted from convnets without max-pooling instead another convolutional layer and Bi-GRU with additional Dense could provide a more accuracy result. Experiments show that the effectiveness of our method PM2.5 mass concentration prediction model provides a more superior method for PM2.5 mass concentration prediction.},

  abstract     = {As a kind of particulate matter which is very detrimental to human health, the prediction of $$\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$$ has attracted increasing attention in air pollution forecasting and early warning. In this paper, density peaks clustering (DPC) is employed to select the individual models for combination forecasting, and a novel high-precision combination forecasting model named DPC-based combined model is proposed to predict $$\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$$ concentrations. Firstly, CEEMD is introduced to decompose the original $$\mathrm PM_{2.5}$$ data into three intrinsic mode functions ( $$\mathrm IMFs$$ ) with different features. Then, 125 individual models are obtained by applying SVR and GRNN to these three $$\mathrm IMFs$$ , and the intelligent optimization algorithms are adopted to optimize the parameters of SVR. Finally, the 125 individual models are clustered by DPC based on five model evaluation indexes to select the individual model for combination forecasting. The experimental results of four Chinese cities demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the optimal individual model and can greatly improve the prediction accuracy. Taking Dalian as an example, the MAE of the proposed model is 2.2 by clustering the 125 individual models into two groups, and the result reveals that the accuracy is increased by 65.73\% compared with the minimum MAE (6.42) of the individual models.},

This paper presents a new distance measure among intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) using the generalized difference sequence spaces within p-summable intuitionistic fuzzy bounded variation (IFBV). The IFBV is a procedure used to approximate the arc-length of an intuitionistic fuzzy-valued function (IFVF) over the IFS, i.e. distance function of all data points of IFS distributed over the geometrical structure of IFBV with power p. The topological uniqueness in the proposed distance measure made it distinguishable, independent from the reflective relationship, and free from the reflective symmetry. All distance measure characteristics are satisfied, and various situations showing the inclusive relations within distance metrics are drawn. Moreover, the proposed distance measure is applied for multi-attribute decision-making approaches, namely the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and GRA (Grey Relational Analysis) techniques. An improved Intuitionistic Fuzzy TOPSIS (IFTOPSIS) and Trapezoidal Intuitionistic Fuzzy GRA (TrIFGRA) techniques are developed to demonstrate the superiority of proposed distance measure with several established ones. With suitable examples, we thoroughly illustrate the functioning of the IFTOPSIS and TrIFGRA decision-making procedures. Extensive comparisons with other popular distance measures are performed to check the effectiveness of our proposed distance measure.},

Life cycle sustainability evaluation of hydrogen can help the experts choose the desirable sustainable methodology for hydrogen production in life cycle standard over various options. This paper proposes a sustainable approach for selecting apt hydrogen production methodologies by integrating life cycle sustainability evaluation and an uncertain linguistic multi-attribute decision-making approach. As a useful extension to linguistic models, probabilistic uncertain linguistic term sets (PULTSs) have attracted many scholars. Elicitation of precise occurring probability value for each uncertain linguistic term is an interesting and open challenge. Occurring probability values are considered interval numbers with lower and upper limits associated with each uncertain linguistic term to form interval-valued probabilistic uncertain linguistic term sets (IVPULTSs). Various operations and axioms of the IVPULTS concept are discussed. Next, a novel aggregation operator is proposed under the IVPULTS context for aggregating decision expert’s preferences. Criteria weights are computed using the extended statistical variance approach on the IVPULTS environment, and the popular VIKOR method is extended on IVPULTSs for the best hydrogen production methodology selection. Here, four hydrogen production methodologies are chosen viz., coal gasification, steam reformation of methane, biomass gasification, and water electrolysis to realize the developed framework&#39;s applicability. Biomass Gasification is considered a viable option in this study. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of the introduced approach are discussed by comparing it with other approaches.},

In this article, some limitations of the said Dombi operational laws for SPFNs are investigated as the aggregated information that came out using existing aggregation operators deviate from the range. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to present some improved Dombi operational laws for SPFNs. Further, keeping the advantages of the power aggregation operators that it takes into account the relationship of the information being aggregated, we aim to develop the spherical fuzzy Dombi power average operator, the spherical fuzzy Dombi weighted power average operator, spherical fuzzy Dombi power geometric operator, and spherical fuzzy Dombi weighted power geometric operator and their desirable properties are discussed. The main advantage of these developed Dombi power aggregation operators is that they eliminate the effect of awkward data and are more flexible due to general parameters involved in aggregation process. Moreover, based on these Dombi power aggregation operators, a novel multi-attribute group decision-making approach is instituted followed by a numerical example to show the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach and comparison with the existing approaches is also given.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a simple global optimisation algorithm inspired by Pareto’s principle. This algorithm samples most of its solutions within prominent search domains and is equipped with a self-adaptive mechanism to control the dynamic tightening of the prominent domains while the greediness of the algorithm increases over time (iterations). Unlike traditional metaheuristics, the proposed method has no direct mutation- or crossover-like operations. It depends solely on the sequential random sampling that can be used in diversification and intensification processes while keeping the information-flow between generations and the structural bias at a minimum. By using a simple topology, the algorithm avoids premature convergence by sampling new solutions every generation. A simple theoretical derivation revealed that the exploration of this approach is unbiased and the rate of the diversification is constant during the runtime. The trade-off balance between the diversification and the intensification is explained theoretically and experimentally. This proposed approach has been benchmarked against standard optimisation problems as well as a selected set of simple and complex engineering applications. We used 26 standard benchmarks with different properties that cover most of the optimisation problems’ nature, three traditional engineering problems, and one real complex engineering problem from the state-of-the-art literature. The algorithm performs well in finding global minima for nonconvex and multimodal functions, especially with high dimensional problems and it was found very competitive in comparison with the recent algorithmic proposals. Moreover, the algorithm outperforms and scales better than recent algorithms when it is benchmarked under a limited number of iterations for the composite CEC2017 problems. The design of this algorithm is kept simple so it can be easily coupled or hybridised with other search paradigms. The code of the algorithm is provided in C++14, Python3.7, and Octave (Matlab).},

  abstract     = {In a globalized world, the banking sector has been forced to advance not only in financial performance, but also in non-financial performance, especially in sustainability criteria. For this purpose, multicriteria decision methods are especially suited to evaluate efficiency and to make a stable ranking of the most outstanding banks in the Spanish financial system. However, we are aware of the difficulties involved due to the inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of this process. For this reason, the use of fuzzy models is proposed, especially intuitionistic fuzzy numbers combined with the Analytic Hierarchy Process and the TOPSIS. The combination of financial criteria based on the CAMELS rating system with non-financial sustainability criteria makes it possible to order the Spanish banking system based on global efficiency. The most relevant contributions are: first, the use of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers in the performance evaluation process, whereby the quality of the information available can be quantified; and the most important one, a simplification of the process in the implementation of the intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS. Finally, through a sensibility analysis, it is possible to isolate the relevance of the sustainability process to obtain the global performance evaluation.},

As the public’s awareness of environmental protection becomes stronger and stronger, the managers of companies ought to consider the maximum economic benefits. Meanwhile, they are supposed to focus on the green image of enterprises, so as to win in the market competition. The probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) are useful for expressing uncertain and fuzzy cognitions of the DMs over attributes. In this paper, we extend the Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) method to the multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) with PLTSs. Firstly, concept, comparative formula, and distances of PLTSs are introduced in a nutshell. Then, the extended EDAS method is used to cope with the problems of MAGDM in PLTSs. In addition, for the sake of verifying the applicability of the expanding method, a calculation example about the sorting of green supplier is utilized. Consequently, the example shows that the method is easy to understand and operate. This method can be employed to choose the appropriate solution in other problems of selecting.},

In this manuscript, an improved differential evolution algorithm is proposed by using a novel individual evaluation scheme as well as a designed constraint handling technique. Firstly, the constrained optimization problem is converted into a biobjective optimization model in which all constraints are taken as an integrated function and further optimized just like the original objective. Then, based on the present individuals, both a reference point and a dynamic line are generated. The distances from any individual to the reference point as well as the dynamic line are adopted to evaluate the individual, and used to categorize individuals for evolving into groups. In addition, in order to improve the feasibility of individuals, a novel constraint handling technique is presented by utilizing the locations of some infeasible points. Finally, the proposed algorithm is executed on some recent benchmark functions as well as the system reliability redundancy allocation problems, and the computation results show the effectiveness of these presented techniques.},

To further examine the performance of the designed rule-based model under different granularity levels, a model with the finer information granules is designed for rule extraction in each cluster. The proposed models are assessed on the synthetic and ship datasets, where the comparison between the granular output and the original data value is considered as the evaluation metric based on the converge and specificity of information granules. Numerical results show that the rule-based models, which incorporate information granules to form representative rules, perform better in analyzing the structure of the arbitrary-shaped datasets and offer a potential application in ship management.},

The model is an autoencoder built using the LSTM network and trained with non-aggressive comments only. Any aggressive comment (direct or indirect) will be regarded as an anomaly to the system and will be marked as Overtly (direct) or Covertly (indirect) aggressive comment depending on the reconstruction loss by the autoencoder. The validation results on the dataset from two popular social media sites: Facebook and Twitter with bilingual (English and Hindi) data outperformed the current state-of-the-art models with improvements of more than 11\% on the test sets of the English dataset and more than 6\% on the test sets of the Hindi dataset.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the high dropout rate of massive open online course (MOOC) has seriously affected its popularity and promotion. How to effectively predict the dropout status of students in MOOC so as to intervene as early as possible has become a hot topic. As we know, different students in MOOC have big differences in learning behaviors, learning habits, and learning time, etc. This leads to different student samples having different effects on the prediction performance of the machine learning-based dropout prediction model (DPM). This is because the performance of machine learning-based classifiers heavily depends on the quality of training samples. To solve this problem, in this paper, a new DPM based on machine learning is proposed. Since the traditional neighborhood concept has nothing to do with the label of the sample, a new neighborhood definition, i.e., the max neighborhood, is first given. It is not only related to the distance between samples, but also related to the labels of the samples. Then, the calculation and realization algorithm of the initial weight of each student sample is studied based on the definition of the max neighborhood, which is different from the commonly methods of randomly selecting initial values. Next, the optimization method of the initial weight of the student sample is further studied using the intelligent optimization method. Finally, the classifiers trained by the weighted training samples are used as DPM. Experimental results of direct observation and statistical testing on public data sets indicate that the training sample weighting and intelligent optimization technology can significantly improve the predictive performance of DPM.},

For a long time, the earned value management system is helping project managers in achieving this objective. However, its predominant focus on project cost and other limitations paved the way for the development of the earned duration management (EDM) system. The EDM system examines the performance of a project in term of time and can also measure the effectiveness of the project schedule at different stages. Since, in real-life, projects are frequently surrounded by uncertainties, the EDM system was extended to fuzzy EDM to make project performance evaluation more realistic but at the expense of increased computational costs and assumptions. Grey system theory is a promising soft computing approach for situations involving uncertainties and can be employed with the least possible information and assumptions. Unlike the fuzzy set theory, it does not require a membership function, thus facilitating data processing. By benefiting from these advantages, the current study aims to propose grey earned duration management (EDM-G) system and compares it with fuzzy EDM and the original EDM systems. The results suggest, the EDM-G system is a convenient and reliable system while it does not require sophisticated computations, large datasets, and membership functions. Finally, its execution on a real-life industrial case study confirmed its validity and reliability, even when multiple experts are involved in performance measurement.},

  abstract     = {The essential protein detection on protein–protein interaction (PPI) network can not only promote the research of life science, but also have important applications in disease diagnosis and drug target cell identifying. A large number of computation-based essential protein detection algorithms have been presented recently. Most of those methods detect the essential proteins according to the centrality measures of the nodes in PPI networks. Those centrality-based essential protein detection methods only consider the topological information of the PPI networks and neglect the biological features of the proteins which are crucial in recognizing the essential proteins. This paper presents a random walk-based method named EPD-RW to identify essential proteins by integrating network topology and biological information extracted from GO (gene ontology) data, gene expression profiles, domain information and phylogenetic profile. EPD-RW uses both the topological structure of the PPI and biological information of the proteins to guide the random walk for computing their essentialness. An iterative method is presented to efficiently integrate the topological and biological features at each step of the random walk. We test our method EDP-RW by experiments on yeast PPI datasets. We also compare the test results of EDP-RW with those of other methods. The experimental results demonstrate that EPD-RW can achieve the best performance among all the methods tested. The biological illustration of the results shows that our random walk-based method effectively increases the accuracy of essential proteins detecting results, and the biological features of the proteins can greatly enhance the performance of essential protein detecting.},

In modern financial market, Asian rainbow option is an effective instrument for asset allocation and risk management. The investor with Asian rainbow option enjoys an entitlement to select a max or min from multiple assets with an exercise price at maturity date. The investor has to defray fee to acquire this right, which raises the option pricing issue. This paper mainly explores the pricing of Asian rainbow option in the uncertain financial environment, in which the underlying assets prices are treated as uncertain processes. Here, the pricing formulas of Asian rainbow option are derived under the condition that stock prices obey uncertain differential equations driven by independent Liu processes. Furthermore, some numerical examples are designed to compute the prices of these options.},

We believe that—similar to relatively pseudocomplemented lattices—these structures can serve as an algebraic semantics of certain intuitionistic logics. The aim of the present paper is to define congruences and filters in these structures, derive mutual relationships between them and describe basic properties of congruences in strongly sectionally pseudocomplemented posets. For the description of filters in both sectionally pseudocomplemented lattices and posets, we use the tools introduced by A. Ursini, i.e., ideal terms and the closedness with respect to them. It seems to be of some interest that a similar machinery can be applied also for strongly sectionally pseudocomplemented posets in spite of the fact that the corresponding ideal terms are not everywhere defined.},

In this work, an adaptive sequential-filtering learning system for credit risk modeling. It is basically a three-stage sequential system for credit risk and business failure classification is presented. First, different statistical filters are applied separately to perform a preselection of relevant patterns. Second, genetic algorithms are applied to preselected patterns for refinement purpose. Finally, structural risk minimization approach based on support vector machine uses refined patterns for prediction purpose. We used three credit databases and two data partition schemes: (i) random split with 80\% for learning and 20\% testing, and (ii) tenfold cross-validation technique. Results from all three data sets and for all partition techniques show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive sequential-filtering learning system for credit risk modeling against single support vector machines each with specific statistical filter-based patterns. In addition, it outperformed various models validated on the same databases. It is concluded that the presented adaptive sequential system is promising for credit risk monitoring.},

  abstract     = {Concrete is a material of utmost importance in construction, and therefore various numerical models have been developed to satisfactorily represent its observed behavior. Within this perspective, damage models stand out, especially isotropic damage ones that can satisfactorily represent the nonlinearity characteristics resulting from stiffness deterioration having the added advantages of a few parameters to be identified. However, these models are dependent on experimental observations to determine the constitutive variables which greatly influence the accuracy of the obtained response. Therefore, using more robust identification techniques can improve the process of determining these internal variables. In this sense, this paper intends to contribute to the literature by using swarm intelligence bioinspired optimization techniques combined with a concrete damage model to determine its constitutive variables. Observable sources are obtained from complete stress–strain curve proposals obtained from the literature, and the optimization firefly and bee colony algorithms are used. The efficiency of these optimization algorithms is verified, as well as that of the damage model in uniaxial tension and compression situations. Willmott&#39;s correlation indexes reveal values close to 0.97, which indicates an excellent correlation between the generated numerical data and reference responses.},

These algorithms have the problem that some relevant features are considered as redundant and removed. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a feature subset selection algorithm based on equal interval division and three-way interaction information. Symmetric uncertainty between each feature and the class label is first calculated and compared with zero, and irrelevant features are removed. Then, symmetric uncertainty between features is calculated and compared with symmetric uncertainty between features and the class label. The method of equal interval division and ranking is adopted to process symmetric uncertainty between features and the class label as well as symmetric uncertainty between features, and these processed parts are then compared. Three-way interaction information among features and the class label is calculated and compared with zero. The three results of the comparisons are employed to remove redundant features. To validate the performance, the proposed algorithm is compared with several feature subset selection algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve better feature selection performance.},

  abstract     = {This research integrates business analytics with enterprise risk management to help firms implement a decision support war-room. In particular, this study explores the hidden states of the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which financial performances tend to intensively rise and fall. In practice, managers need to know what indicators can be good predictors to predict bankruptcy and what actions should be taken before bankruptcy? Thus, a novel framework is presented to achieve the following goals: (1) hidden Markov model is constructed to relate firms’ hidden states (healthy, risky, and sick) to observable variables (ROA—return on asset, EPS—earnings per share, and NPBT—net profit before tax). (2) Ensemble learning (EL) like random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AB), and gradient boosting (GB) is used to conduct business forecasting. (3) Probabilistic Bayes network (PBN) is used to conduct stochastic risk simulation. Data samples collected from various industry sectors (semiconductor, optoelectronics, consumer electronics) are used to justify the validity of this research. Experimental results identify cash equivalents, gross sales profit, and operating revenue can efficiently enhance the SMEs from risky states to healthy firms. In contrast, operating profit margin and net income margin are more effective to improve the SMEs from sick states to risky firms. Managers are suggested to continually monitor and track these key indicators.},

Compared to the traditional grid-search-based method, the optimal parameters have been computed 6.5 times faster for recurrent neural network (RNN) and 8 times faster for convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed approach is capable of tuning multiple hyper-parameters simultaneously. The second phase finds an appropriate subset of the training data for near-optimal prediction performance, providing an additional speedup of 75.86\% for RNN and 41.12\% for CNN over the first phase.},

In this paper, we propose a scalable incremental fuzzy consensus clustering (SIFCC) algorithm for a big data framework. It has been implemented on Apache Spark cluster framework, a distributed data stream environment for handling big data by considering the data as a set of data subsets that are processed incrementally. Sparks work great for iterative algorithms by supporting in-memory calculations, scalability, etc. SIFCC not only facilitates efficient big data clustering, but also improves the quality of clusters, performs storage space optimization, and time complexity during clustering. To establish the comparison, we designed and implemented the scalable model of existing fuzzy consensus clustering (FCC) on Apache Spark cluster, named as a scalable fuzzy consensus clustering (SFCC). Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the SIFCC algorithm achieves the better potential for clustering of Big Data in comparison with SFCC.},

The methodology was carried out through the utilization of a three-phase hybrid approach, considering a pre-processing filtration using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) followed by the metaheuristic and classification algorithms. Comparably, five different classification algorithms were used in each phase of analysis. It was seen that the application of PCCMA filter has acted upon reducing the computational complexity of overall analysis. The comparative study showed that BPSO outperformed GA and CS in terms of accuracy.

  abstract     = {Handwritten signature verification is one of the most fast, intuitive and cost-effective tools for user authentication. However, the analysis of the handwritten signature may become complicated due to the large dimensionality. Feature selection is treated as one of the most commonly applied preprocessing techniques in data mining to deal with the dimensionality. Since the feature selection can be considered as an optimization problem, we propose a wrapper metaheuristic framework for the handwritten signature verification, which uses the k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm to guide a metaheuristic optimization algorithm in order to find the best subset of features. The following metaheuristics are used in the work: swallow swarm optimization (SSO), binary dragonfly swarm optimization (BBA), population algorithm with memory (PAO), genetic algorithm (GA), binary bat algorithm (BBA), binary whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The experiments are carried on the SVC2004 dataset by comparing the employed metaheuristics with each other from different perspectives, including the classification performance, the relatives frequencies of selected features and the feature subset size. According to results, the proposed wrapper framework obtains extremely promising results for handwritten signature verification. In particular, the proposed framework can increase the classification accuracy at least or more than 8\%, even though selecting between 2 and 6 features among 100 features in most cases. It is also observed that the proposed framework with PSO can achieve slightly better results than with the other metaheuristics in most cases.

  abstract     = {Foreign currency has been a dynamic instrument in financial market, and currency option has become a momentous hedging tool in foreign exchange market. Additionally, the barrier option, which spends less than ordinary options, is increasingly favored by investors in foreign exchange market. Different from the existing pricing methods, this paper aims to price European barrier options of uncertain currency model, in which the exchange rate is viewed as an uncertain process. The pricing formulas are given for the barrier currency options including two knock-in options and two knock-out options, respectively. Finally, the numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the use of formulas and the impact of parameters on option prices.},

It is shown by the FLM that it is possible to approximate continuous functions which are satisfied at the interpolation points. To obtain the function as the approximation of the solution of the RDEs, fuzzy linguistic model (FLM) was used. In numerical approaches, in order to find an approximation for a function that exists on a particular interval, just a limited number of points are utilized. However, the distinctive feature of the FLM in comparison with other approaches is that in this method all points in the arbitrary interval are used. Five examples along with their approximate solutions have been presented to show the suitability, convenience, simplicity and performance of the method. The outcomes demonstrate that the advantage of this approach compared to other methods is that there are no limiting conditions for nonlinear differential equations of order one or two with initial conditions or boundary conditions.},

Some properties of the proposed distance measure are also proved from the perspective of metric spaces. Based on the proposed distance measure of three-parameter interval numbers, a new type of distance measure of LR-type fuzzy numbers is introduced. By considering different left and right shape functions in the proposed distance measure of LR-type fuzzy numbers, some new distance measures of triangular fuzzy numbers and normal fuzzy numbers are obtained.

It was proposed as a generalization of picture fuzzy sets and Pythagorean fuzzy sets in order to deal with uncertainty and fuzziness information. This paper presents a multi-attribute group decision making method based on novel sine aggregation operators to help decision makers choose the optimal alternative. Moreover, the well-known sine trigonometry function preserves the periodic and symmetric nature about the origin, and hence, it satisfies the decision makers preferences over the multi-time phase parameters. Keeping these features and the importance of the spherical fuzzy (SF) sets, the objective of this paper is to present some robust sine trigonometric (ST) operation laws for SF sets. Associated with these laws, we define some series of new aggregation operators (AOs) named as ST-weighted averaging and geometric operators to aggregate the spherical fuzzy information. Afterward, we present group decision making techniques to solve the multi-attribute group decision making problems based on proposed AOs and illustrate with a numerical example of an internet finance soft power evaluation problem to validate it. Also, we conduct some comparison analysis to study the reasonability and practicality of the proposed method.},

Thus, many enterprise begun to invest in consumer preference information based on big data (CPIBD) and green production technology. These will add their extra costs, and cost-sharing model is an effective way to improve chain members’ benefits. However, in the new environment, how to price can improve their outcomes in different cost-sharing models? And which model is the best? Aims of this paper are to solve the proposed issues considering CPIBD input and the green technology R&amp;D cost. We chose a green supply chain with one green manufacturer and one retailer as study subject. Then, based on game theory, we proposed three cost-sharing models, and their benefit functions were developed. Using the reverse induction, we analyzed and discussed the change rules of the retail price and the wholesale price with the product green degree and the unit CPIBD cost. Then, using Matlab2014, a numerical example based on actual data was implemented. Findings: (1) with the increase of the unit CPIBD cost, the optimal retail prices will grow in the proposed three models, and the change trend of the wholesale price has a relationship with the situation whether the retailer undertakes the unit CPIBD cost or the green technology R&amp;D cost. (2) With the growth of the product green degree, the optimal retail price and the optimal wholesale price in the three models will decrease. (3) With the increase of the unit CPIBD cost and the product green degree, benefits of supply chain members in the proposed three models will reduce. If the retailer can undertake the unit CPIBD cost or the green technology R&amp;D cost, benefits of supply chain will be higher.},

This paper presents a novel weighted support vector machine to improve the noisy sensitivity problem of standard support vector machine for multiclass data classification. The basic idea is considered to add a weighted coefficient to the penalty term Lagrangian formula for optimization problem, which is called entropy degree, using lower and upper approximation for membership function in fuzzy rough set theory. As a result, noisy samples have low degree and important samples have high degree. To evaluate the power of the proposed method WSVM-FRS (Weighted SVM-Fuzzy Rough Set), several experiments have been conducted based on tenfold cross-validation over real-world data sets from UCI repository and MNIST data set. Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior than the other state-of-the-art competing methods regarding accuracy, precision and recall metrics.},

Thus, it can be applied to two-dimensional imprecise, indeterminate and inconsistent data which appear in most real-life problems. Graph theory has now become a major branch of applied mathematics, and it is generally regarded as a branch of combinatorics. In this research paper, we introduce the concept of $$Q$$ -neutrosophic soft graphs (Q- $${\mathcal{N}\mathcal{S}}Gs$$ ) that are made by combining $$Q$$ -neutrosophic soft sets with graphs and describe different methods of their construction. A $$Q$$ -neutrosophic soft graphs model is very much efficient for such real word problems which can construct more precise, flexible, and comparable system as compared to the classical, fuzzy and neutrosophic graph models. In this paper, we first define the concept of $$Q$$ -neutrosophic soft graph (Q- $${\mathcal{N}\mathcal{S}}G$$ ).

The new concept is called Q- $${\mathcal{N}\mathcal{S}}G$$ multicriteria decision-making method (Q- $${\mathcal{N}\mathcal{S}}GMCDM$$ for short). Finally, we describe the utility of the $$Q$$ -neutrosophic soft graph and its applications in communication network and decision-making problem.},

Relatedly, the concepts and operating laws of the bipolar trapezoidal neutrosophic set are defined. Some priority aggregate operators for the aggregation of bipolar trapezoidal neutrosophic information are discussed. In addition, priority aggregation operators based on Dombi operations are developed: bipolar trapezoidal neutrosophic Dombi weighted averaging operator and bipolar trapezoidal neutrosophic Dombi weighted geometric operator. The desirable properties of these operators and the relationship between them are investigated. Two approaches are proposed to address multiple criteria for decision-making problems in the bipolar trapezoidal neutrosophic environment. The sensitivity of the proposed approaches is analyzed using examples, and a multiple comparison test is conducted to demonstrate their effectiveness.},

The proposed restricted bridge (RBRIDGE) estimator simultaneously estimates parameters and selects important variables when a piece of prior information about parameters are available in either low-dimensional or high-dimensional case. Using local quadratic approximation, we approximate the penalty term around a local initial values vector. The RBRIDGE estimator enjoys a closed-form expression that can be solved when $$q&gt;0$$ . Special cases of our proposal are the restricted LASSO ( $$q=1$$ ), restricted RIDGE ( $$q=2$$ ), and restricted Elastic Net ( $$1&lt; q &lt; 2$$ ) estimators. We provide some theoretical properties of the RBRIDGE estimator for the low-dimensional case, whereas the computational aspects are given for both low- and high-dimensional cases. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted based on different prior pieces of information. The performance of the RBRIDGE estimator is compared with some competitive penalty estimators and the ORACLE. We also consider four real-data examples analysis for comparison sake. The numerical results show that the suggested RBRIDGE estimator outperforms outstandingly when the prior is true or near exact.},

Fuzzy set theory provides a soft computing framework for precise and rigorous study of vague conceptual environment. In this paper, a new hybrid multi-criteria decision-making method consists of group fuzzy COPRAS, and fuzzy BCM is proposed. The aim of the proposed method is to enhance the practical approach of soft computing in selection of stocks for portfolio construction and better return. This method has been executed in two phases. First, using a novel base-criterion method with triangular fuzzy number, the relative optimal weights of specified criteria are extracted from group decision-making process. Then, an approach based on the combination of fuzzy set theory and the complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) is applied to rank the alternatives in uncertain and ambiguous environment. A practical implementation of proposed method in stock selection is another realistic approach of our study. Portfolio is constructed by using the ranking obtained by proposed model. The weight allocation of the stocks is calculated using the ranked assets algorithm. Execution of the proposed model is found to be dominant when compared with the previous studies. The result ensures that the portfolio is capable of giving better returns based on the proposed ranking.},

Two major drawbacks in existing techniques are accuracy and lack of actionable knowledge from results. To overcome these problems, a novel algorithm called Multi-Branch Ferns (MBFerns), and R-package has been developed to build multi-branch ferns (multi-branch decision tree) and to generate key features from training dataset employing Naïve Bayesian probabilistic model as classifier. The proposed algorithm performs well for general classification problems and extracting actionable knowledge from training data.

  abstract     = {With the extensive growth of data that has been joined with the thriving development of the Internet in this century, finding or getting valuable information and knowledge from these huge noisy data became harder. The Concept of Knowledge Graph (KG) is one of the concepts that has come into the public view as a result of this development. In addition, with that thriving development especially in the last two decades, the need to process and extract valuable information in a more efficient way is increased. KG presents a common framework for knowledge representation, based on the analysis and extraction of entities and relationships. Techniques for KG construction can extract information from either structured, unstructured or even semi-structured data sources, and finally organize the information into knowledge, represented in a graph. This paper presents a characterization of different types of KGs along with their construction approaches. It reviews the existing academia, industry and expert KG systems and discusses in detail about the features of it. A systematic review methodology has been followed to conduct the review. Several databases (Scopus, GS, WoS) and journals (SWJ, Applied Ontology, JWS) are analysed to collect the relevant study and filtered by using inclusion and exclusion criteria. This review includes the state-of-the-art, literature review, characterization of KGs, and the knowledge extraction techniques of KGs. In addition, this paper overviews the current KG applications, problems, and challenges as well as discuss the perspective of future research. The main aim of this paper is to analyse all existing KGs with their features, techniques, applications, problems, and challenges. To the best of our knowledge, such a characterization table among these most commonly used KGs has not been presented earlier.},

A series of six different variants of enhanced GOA is proposed by integrating GOA with six different variants of the mutation operator. The new enhanced metaheuristic optimization method is called EGOAs. EGOA aims to address the problems of slow convergence and trapping into local optima, by achieving a good balance between exploration and exploitation, using a special mutation operator that enhances the diversity of the standard GOA, to find the best solution for global optimization problems. The implementation process for enhancing the GOA algorithm is presented and the effectiveness of the enhanced algorithm is evaluated against 60 of the optimization benchmark functions, and compared to that of the standard GOA, as well as to other metaheuristic optimization algorithms. The performance of EGOAs was compared with the other improved methods based on GOA. Experimental results show that EGOAs is clearly superior to the standard GOA algorithm, as well as to other well-known algorithms, in terms of achieving the best optimal value, convergence speed, and avoiding local minima, which makes EGOAs a promising addition to the arsenal of metaheuristic algorithms.},

In the proposed strategy, the MOP at the lower level is first converted into a single-objective optimization formulation through adopting adaptive weighted sum scalarization, in which the lower-level weight vector is adjusted adaptively while the iteration progressing. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions are used to the lower-level single-objective scalarization problem, thus the original BLMOP can be converted into a single-level MOP with complementarity constraints. Then an effective smoothing technique is suggested to cope with the complementarity constraints. In such a way, the BLMOP is finally formalized as a single-level constrained nonlinear MOP. A decomposition-based constrained multiobjective differential evolution is developed to solve this transformed MOP and some instances are tested to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the solution methodology.

  abstract     = {The problem of identifying the top-k influential node is still an open and deeply felt issue. The development of a stable and efficient algorithm to deal with such identification is still a challenging research hot spot. Although conventional centrality-based and greedy-based methods show high performance, they are not very efficient when dealing with large-scale social networks. Recently, algorithms based on swarm intelligence are applied to solve the problems mentioned above, and the existing researches show that such algorithms can obtain the optimal global solution. In particular, the discrete bat algorithm (DBA) has been proved to have excellent performance, but the evolution mechanism based on a random selection strategy leads to the optimal solution&#39;s instability. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a clique-DBA algorithm. The proposed algorithm is based on the clique partition of a network and enhances the initial DBA algorithm&#39;s stability. The experimental results show that the proposed clique-DBA algorithm converges to a determined local influence estimation (LIE) value in each run, eliminating the phenomenon of large fluctuation of LIE fitness value generated by the original DBA algorithm. Finally, the simulated results achieved under the independent cascade model show that the clique-DBA algorithm has a comparable performance of influence spreading compared with the algorithms proposed in the state of the art.},

  abstract     = {This study designs a novel decision support model to address group decision-making (GDM) problems with Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic information. To do so, a new concept of Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic preference relations (PFLPRs) is first introduced to describe fuzzy and uncertain information, where the Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic values (PFLVs) are represented by the linguistic membership degree and linguistic non-membership degree. Then, we also give the definitions of multiplicative consistency of PFLPRs, consistency index (CI), individual consensus degree (IGD) and group consensus degree (GCD). Subsequently, a consistency-adjustment approach is proposed to convert unacceptable multiplicative consistent PFLPRs into acceptable ones, as well as, derive the optimal normalized Pythagorean fuzzy priority weight vector (PFPWV) for alternatives. Furthermore, we design two algorithms in group decision support model. The first algorithm is used to check the multiplicative consistency of original PFLPRs and transform the unacceptable multiplicative consistent PFLPRs into the acceptable ones. The second algorithm is designed to aid the GCD to achieve the predefined level. The most innovative features of the proposed decision support model are following two points. One is that the GCD reaches the predefined level, while each PFLPR still keeps multiplicative consistency. The other is that it can preserve decision makers’ original preference information as much as possible. Finally, we give a numerical example to illustrate validity and practicality of this proposed approach.},

This paper attempts to integrate a GP with a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) framework to allocate economic resources of an economy among alternative sectors in order to achieve a number of goals. To do so, although the goals and limitations of regions are determined with respect to their situations, the supply and demand for products of economic sectors, as well as Gross Regional Products (GRP); employment for different educational groups of human forces; and income distribution inequality in addition to the personal income mean are formulated as the first to third goals of the research, respectively. The model has been examined by using the SAM Table for the Golestan Province of Iran. The result of implementing the model demonstrates that integrating SAM instead of I-O with GP will increase the capability of the integrated model.},

  abstract     = {Consequence of decision making problems under fuzzy domain mostly necessitate choosing the best alternative among the sets of alternatives. This requirement is generally fulfilled through the methodology called the ranking of fuzzy numbers. In this paper, an attempt under fuzzy domain to develop a coherent methodology of ordering fuzzy numbers is thrived. The ill-defined quantity ‘value’ and the amount of uncertainty in the ill-defined quantity ‘ambiguity’ of a fuzzy number constituted the important tools in ranking fuzzy numbers. As such, an effort has been made to employ these quantities in ranking interval type-2 fuzzy numbers constructing a novel value-ambiguity ranking index. A through comparative study with the existing method and the present method is executed to exhibit the essence of the proposed ranking method. The comparative study exhibit the superiority of the present method of ranking interval type-2 fuzzy numbers over the existing method. Further, the method is not just limited to interval type-2 fuzzy numbers, it can be broadly applied to arbitrary fuzzy numbers. Finally, a risk analysis problem has been discussed and the proposed novel value-ambiguity ranking index of ranking interval type-2 fuzzy numbers has been applied successfully.},

  abstract     = {Subsurface structure identification and modeling in three-dimensional dataset is a very complex problem for the geoscientist. Manual dealing of seismic data involves different complexities and requires more time and effort in order to address the errors and mistakes associated with the quality of seismic data. It is sometimes not straightforward to classify the features of interest especially when the data are of poor quality or associated with complex micro-tectonic regime. This brings the need of automatic working engine which can handle such issues and can find the target-oriented features with the more accuracy. Therefore, advance machine learning approach has been considered as a powerful tool which extensively used in different fields of data science to enhance the quality of data and fast processing. In this study, a new technology has been introduced in the seismic processing and development to make processes in automated routine. This method is based on deep neural network (DNN) that directly translates the raw seismic data into final fault models. A test example of deep semi-supervised learning method was performed for seismic faults and reflector identification without prior information and without going into complete dataset for labeling. This example explains the challenges to the issue and gives the solution to the problem related to the structure and tectonic modeling to explain the performance gain. In this approach of semi-supervised learning, only one of any reflectors and one or two of the faults has been introduced in the learning phase to identify such features in the complete 3D cube. This is an example of deep learning neural network for machine seismic in real case study and allows exploration geoscientists to easier mark the hot spots of their interest before mining or drilling.},

Focusing on the same objective, this paper proposes a novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by heat transfer relationships based on the second law of thermodynamics. Imitating the heat transfer behavior of solid objects, the proposed method is called the heat transfer relation-based optimization algorithm (HTOA). This behavior was modeled on a heat transfer function used to measure temperature differences between the selected solutions and the best solution. This function was employed to determine and add the heat capacity transferred between those solutions. Finally, all the solutions were heat-exchanged with the best solution to select the fittest solution and exclude the rest. This procedure continued until the best solution or solutions were found. The proposed method is challenged by many famous benchmark problems in two categories as well as two real-world problems (PID controller and linear regression). The HTOA was then compared with a number of well-known and state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. Selecting better solutions and requiring shorter computation time, the proposed HTOA outperformed the other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {As a useful performance evaluation and decision-making tool, data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been proven to be an excellent data-oriented efficiency analysis method when there are multiple inputs and outputs. However, when working with large datasets, DEA requires more time to solve and calculate the optimal values for each decision-making unit (DMU). To close this methodological gap, this study proposes a new integrated fuzzy nondiscretionary DEA (FNDEA) model and artificial immune system (AIS) to predict and find the optimal values of DMUs. In so doing, we first modify an FNDEA model to classify the set of all DMUs into efficient and inefficient, and immune system (AIS) is used to predict and find the optimal values of DMUs. Then, a modified fuzzy nondiscretionary additive DEA model, which is designed as a middle chain, is used for sensitivity analysis of inefficient DMUs to determine their target outputs, which are called antigens. Finally, we try to reduce the distance between these two steps in order to predict the optimal values (with nearest distance to antigens) of inefficient DMUs and improve their efficiency by using a combined AIS and FNDEA model called the FNDEA–AIS approach. To illustrate the advantages of the proposed FNDEA–AIS approach, a dataset from 24 Iranian forest management units is collected; the results indicated that our new FNDEA–AIS approach (in comparison with other well-established performance prediction techniques) exhibits better convergent validity and high correlation with low error rate to predict optimal values of inefficient DMUs. The main conclusion is that our new applied method, developed for the first time herein, provides a suitable improvement over previously developed methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), to detect inefficiency and to improve the overall performance when analyzing different types of real-life problems.},

  abstract     = {The fuzzy linear regression (FLR) modeling was first proposed making use of linear programming and then followed by many improvements in a variety of ways. In almost all approaches, researchers put many efforts to change the meters, objective functions, or restrictions to improve the fuzzy goodness of fit (GOF) measures. However, conditions and restrictions in the methods of estimating parameters can reduce efficiency. In this paper, from a different viewpoint, we develop shrinkage strategy, frequently used in classical regression modeling, in the existing FLR to improve GOF measures. In fact, by adding an extra factor to the estimated parameters, without altering the estimation method, the performance of the resulting model is tuned and the GOF measures are improved. However, this method cannot be directly applied since it may give negative spreads for the estimates. Hence, to combat this disadvantage of the shrinkage method, we make refinement and propose an integrated fuzzy shrinkage (IFS) approach. For this approach, an optimal boundary for the shrinkage parameter selection is obtained for which the IFS performs better, comparatively. Further, a fuzzy hypothesis testing procedure is developed to significantly select important coefficients in the FLR model using the p value. Using a simulation study and some illustrative examples, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed estimation method. In this respect, we show the IFS improves GOF measures dramatically compared to the existing methods.},

Based on Dempster–Shafer structures and classic Shannon entropy, the interval uncertainty of an unknown object is determined, which provides reference for theoretical research and provides help for industrial applications. Although the interval-valued entropies for Dempster–Shafer structures can solve the uncertainty interval of an object very efficiently, its application scope is only a traditional probability space. How to extend it to the evidential environment is still an open issue. This paper proposes interval-valued belief entropies for Dempster–Shafer structures, which is an extension of the interval-valued entropies for Dempster–Shafer structures. When the belief entropy degenerates to the classic Shannon entropy, the interval-valued belief entropies for Dempster–Shafer structures will degenerate into the interval-valued entropies for Dempster–Shafer structures. Numerical examples are applied to verify the validity of the interval-valued belief entropies for Dempster–Shafer structures. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed entropy can obtain the interval uncertainty value of a given uncertain object successfully and make decision effectively.},

However, DPC and most of its improvements still encounter some challenges such as parameter dependence, unreasonable metric and cluster center determination difficulty. Aiming at these issues, we propose a novel clustering algorithm based on cluster center selection model (CA-CSM). Firstly, we calculate the density parameter automatically according to the local information of the object to reduce the parameter dependence. Subsequently, we propose the concept of boundary degree to discriminate core objects from non-core objects. With the local density metric, we establish a model (CSM) with high expansibility to automatically detect the cluster centers from core objects. We test CA-CSM on 21 datasets using five benchmarks and compare it to 7 state-of-the-art algorithms. Extensive experiments and analysis show that our algorithm is feasible and effective.},

  abstract     = {Sometimes, there is a need to transport very heavy equipment, so heavy that the resulting load is several times larger than the maximal load that the corresponding road segment was designed to withstand. Such super heavy load vehicles decrease the remaining service life of the road segment, and sometimes even make the segment unusable and needing repairs. In both cases, the need for earlier-than-expected repairs means additional costs. It is therefore desirable to estimate the expected value of this additional cost. In locations where the owner of the super heavy load vehicle pays for the vehicle passage, this is necessary to decide how much to charge the owner. In other locations, where the agreement is that the cost of additional repairs comes from the additional taxes that the vehicle owners pay, such an estimate is needed to the road owners—e.g., to the county or to the state—so as to select the route for which the expected additional cost of repairs is the smallest.},

In many situations, the corresponding prices are indeed uniquely determined by the supply–demand relation. From the purely mathematical viewpoint, there are situations when the equilibrium is not unique, but most economists believe that in practical situations, equilibrium prices are usually uniquely determined. In this paper, we provide a simple but realistic example in which the equilibrium is not unique.},

  abstract     = {In many economic applications, it is desirable to estimate how effective is a given country, a given plant, a given farm. In some cases, such an estimate is easy; for example, if we have a similar farm which is much more productive, then it is clear than the original farm is not effective. However, in many situations, such a direct comparison is not possible; for example, most countries are different, so while their productivity is different, the difference in productivity may be due to difference in climate, etc., and not necessarily caused by insufficient effectiveness. To estimate effectiveness in such situations, special Stochastic Frontier techniques have been invented. The problem with the currently use Stochastic Frontier techniques is that these techniques are based on reasonably arbitrary assumptions about the probability distribution of effectiveness—assumptions which are motivated mostly by computational efficiency and which do not have any convincing economic motivations. Because of this arbitrariness, the conclusions of Stochastic Frontier analysis are often not convincing to users. To make these conclusions more convincing, we propose to use different families of distributions—families which are economically motivated. Interestingly, while for the new families, the corresponding computational complexity may increase slightly, the corresponding estimation algorithms are still very efficient—especially since they are based on such actively used-in-economics techniques as least squares and linear programming.},

  abstract     = {Since the early 2000s, there has been a long-term price increase trend in the Istanbul housing market, and this situation also has led to price bubble speculations. Since the housing sector was caught with a high level of unsold housing stock to the economic slowdown emerging in the second half of 2018, housing price bubble speculations have increased even more, especially for the Istanbul market. In this period, housing loan interest reduction campaigns were implemented by the government through state banks to stimulate the housing demand, and a probable collapse in the housing market was prevented. On the other hand, house prices continued to rise during this period due to the stimulated demand. In this paper, we perform a price bubble research on the selected districts in the Istanbul housing market over the 2007–2019 period using LSTM autoencoder model. The first analysis on monthly data is performed by using housing price index, housing rent index, consumer prices index, stock market index, return on government debt securities, USD/TRY exchange rates, BIST price index, monthly deposit interest rates, mortgage interest rates and consumer confidence index, and the second analysis on quarterly data is carried out by adding building construction cost index and GDP data to the previous dataset. In the first analysis, the bubble formations differ regionally and periodically and disappeared toward the end of 2019 in some districts, while in the second analysis, the housing bubble formations have a more common and continuous appearance. Experimental results show that LSTM autoencoder model can be used to detect housing bubbles effectively.},

We further examine three scenarios in which government subsidies on public medical insurance, insurance coverage rates, and registration rates increase respectively. Our simulation based on the constructed FCM shows that government subsidy increases have the largest impacts on households. We demonstrate both flexibility and extensibility of FCM by assessing different scenarios.},

Researchers generally use the production function of constant elasticity of substitution, i.e., the C–D (Cobb–Douglas) production function and the CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution) production function, to explore economic growth, but rarely use the VES (Variable Elasticity of Substitution) production function. The paper gives an extended VES production function model in the case the elasticity of substitution is a time linear function. With regard to the parameter estimation, the paper uses a modern intelligent algorithm, i.e., the PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm. The conventional PSO algorithm has a low rate and the poor accuracy of convergence, so the paper proposes an improved PSO algorithm. In the final part, the paper calculates the contribution rates of influencing factors to Chinese economic growth, and the results are consistent with the actual situation.},

The need for such negation arises when a knowledge-based system can use the terms like NOT HIGH, where HIGH is represented by a probability distribution (pd). For example, HIGH PROFIT or HIGH PRICE can be considered. The application of this negation in Dempster–Shafer theory was considered in many works. Although several negations of probability distributions have been proposed, it was not clear how to construct other negations. In this paper, we consider negations of probability distributions as point-by-point transformations of pd using decreasing functions defined on [0,1] called negators. We propose the general method of generation of negators and corresponding negations of pd, and study their properties. We give a characterization of linear negators as a convex combination of Yager’s and uniform negators.},

Inspired by recently achievement of deep reinforcement learning, we explore feasibility to construct a hedging strategy automatically by leveraging cooperative multi-agent in reinforcement learning techniques without advanced domain knowledge. In this work, we use 10 popular stocks on Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange, and VN30F1M (VN30 Index Futures contracts within one month settlement) to develop a stock market simulator (including transaction fee, tax, and settlement date of transactions) for reinforcement learning agent training. We use daily return as input data for training process. Results suggest that the agent can learn trading and hedging policy to make profit and reduce losses. Furthermore, we also find that our agent can protect portfolios and make positive profit in case market collapses systematically. In practice, this work can help Vietnam’s stock market investors to improve performance and reduce losses in trading, especially when the volatility cannot be controlled.},

  abstract     = {There have been many recent fears of severe house-price decreases in some provinces in China causing a nationwide collapse of the housing market. Therefore, this paper aims to clarify the linkage structure of China’s housing market and its risk contagion routes. Given monthly data of provincial housing and stock-market capital returns from 2001M01 to 2019M12, on the basis of graph theory, this paper first explores the linkage structure of provincial housing markets. Relying on the linkage structure, this paper then simulates the effect of unexpected negative shocks from the stock market on the probabilities of a housing-market collapse based on the epidemic model. The results show that (i) consistently with practical evidence, the probability of housing-market collapse is relatively high in the southwest of China and (ii) reducing housing-market linkage, such as through a blocking mechanism, to prevent collapse is helpful.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the interval approach for Markov switching capital asset pricing model (MS-CAPM) is proposed to quantify the beta risk in two different regimes, namely a bull and a bear regimes. Instead of fitting a MS-CAPM on specific fixed reference points, such as midpoints (center method), and lower and upper bounds (MinMax method), this study suggests choosing the reference points that better represent the intervals of excess stock return and excess market return. Therefore, the convex combination (CC) method is introduced to fit the interval MS-CAPM. The proposed interval MS-CAPM performance based on the CC method is assessed and compared with the center method and the MinMax method through a simulation study and two application studies.},

  abstract     = {When modeling the kink regression model, it is possible to have an excessive number of explanatory variables and their corresponding coefficients, thereby leading to the over-parameterization and multicollinearity problems. Motivated by these problems, five sparse estimation methods, namely LASSO, sparse Ridge, SCAD, MCP, and Bridge, are considered to perform simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation, as alternatives to the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), in the kink regression model. To compare the performance of these sparse estimators, both simulation and real data applications are proposed. According to the simulation results, we demonstrate the superior performance of sparse estimations in terms of selection accuracy and prediction by comparing them to the non-sparse estimations. However, it is not apparent which sparse estimations are more appropriate for estimating the kink regression. However, in an application study, the comparison result indicates that the SCAD penalty would be a preferable penalty function for the application of kink regression to the life expectancy data as the lowest EBIC and the highest $${\text{Adj - }}R^{2}$$ are obtained.},

Then we measure the distance between these local trend cycles conducting similar practices between different assets.

Consumers’ expectations are examined in qualitative surveys. The key task is to transform consumers’ survey responses into quantitative proxies of expectations. In this examination, we investigate an alternative method to quantify consumers’ inflation expectations using fuzzy rule-based systems. In order to generate rules in the learning phase, we compare two methods: the Wang-Mendel method based on space partition and the subtractive clustering method. The learning data are information about past inflation and consumers’ opinions as expressed in surveys. The system is built and tested on data from January 2002 to June 2019 for non-euro member states of the EU. The fuzzy rules-based system returns results that outperform a benchmark—the standard quantification procedure—in terms of correlation with a raw approximation of consumer expectations, which is survey balance statistics. The results are robust regarding the benchmark choice. We find the method more promising for economies with lower stability, as it gives more room for the training phase of the algorithm application.},

We found that the MSE is less under dependence, under the assumption that elements in both samples are identically distributed related to the population distribution. In addition, increasing skewness and increasing sample size also decrease the MSE. Finally, the largest differences in MSE between dependence and independence occur under moderate skewness.},

  abstract     = {A central problem in customer relation management (CRM) is to cluster customers into meaningful groups. The problem is often called customer segmentation and is of paramount importance in the twenty-first century due to the rapid development of E-commerce which generates databases containing millions of customers. Recent algorithms in machine learning have been successful in clustering a wide range of datasets such as images, text documents, news and so on. Inspired by those accomplishments, we design a new segmentation model based on a combination of a deep neural network and a self-supervised probabilistic clustering technique. The new model is more flexible and more adaptive to the diversity of customer datasets compared to current heuristic algorithms in CRM. Moreover, feature engineering is the process to clean, prepare and transform raw data into features which are then fed into a model to produce clusters. To perform feature engineering, we combine a novel categorical encoding method in economics and an autoencoder, a recent machine learning data transformation method, to extract useful patterns from the original data. Our experiments with the full model on a set of retail transaction data from a supermarket chain in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam, show the capabilities of our algorithm to produce useful, explainable customer clusters.},

We have experimented with four different granularities for each series: quarterly, monthly, weekly and daily. The results show that our neural network models can manage these raw series without first removing seasonality or trend. We also highlight the ability of neural models to work with a fixed input size of one year, being able to make good predictions using the same input size for all granularities. The two deep learning models have globally improved the benchmarks of the M4 Competition of forecasting.

A person’s decisions are also affected by possible consequences for others. In decision theory, people’s preferences are described by special quantities called utilities. In utility terms, the above phenomena mean that the person’s overall utility of an action depends not only on the utility corresponding to the action’s immediate consequences for this person, it also depends on utilities corresponding to future consequences and on utilities corresponding to consequences for others. These dependencies reflect discounting of future consequences in comparison with the current ones and to empathy (or lack of) of the person toward others. In general, many formulas involving utility are nonlinear, even formulas describing the dependence of utility on money. However, surprisingly, for discounting and for empathy, linear formulas work very well. In this paper, we show that natural symmetry requirements can explain this linearity.},

NN can achieve high classification accuracy on highly imbalanced and complex datasets, but lacks in explanation of its reasoning process which limits its applicability in various domains which require transparent decision along with good accuracy. There are some techniques which extract rules from NN and make it transparent; however, attribute pruning, rule pruning and class overlap algorithms are not sufficiently effective. Therefore, this paper proposes a rule extraction algorithm, called Transparent Rule Extraction using Neural Network (TRENN) to convert NN into white box with greater emphasis on attribute pruning and rule pruning. The proposed TRENN is a pedagogical approach and an extension of one of the existing algorithms named Rule Extraction from Neural Network using Classified and Misclassified data (RxNCM). The proposed TRENN extends the RxNCM with sequential floating backward search for feature and rule selection to improve the comprehensibility of the generated rules. Besides, the proposed TRENN uses probabilistic approach for the treatment of class overlapping problem in the rule updating phase instead of reclassification used in RxNCM where the overlap may persist. Experiments are conducted with eight real datasets collected from the UCI repository. Performance of the TRENN is measured with Precision, Recall, FP-Rate, F-measure, and local and global comprehensibility. It is observed from the experimental results that TRENN performs better than Re-RX, RxNCM and RxREN.},

The aim of the paper is to provide an analysis of fuzzy transform of higher degree applied to stochastic processes with a focus on its autocorrelation function. We introduce a higher-degree fuzzy transform of a stochastic process and investigate its basic properties. Further, we introduce a higher-degree fuzzy transform of bivariate functions in the tensor product of polynomial spaces and demonstrate its approximation ability. In addition, we show that the bivariate higher-degree fuzzy transform of multiplicative separable functions is a product of univariate fuzzy transform of the respective functions, which is a desirable property in the processing of functions of higher dimensions. The obtained results are used to demonstrate an interesting identity between the autocorrelation function of the fuzzy transform of a stochastic process and the bivariate fuzzy transform of the autocorrelation function of the stochastic process. This identity provides two ways to determine the autocorrelation function of the fuzzy transform of a stochastic process, which can be useful, especially in a situation where its direct calculation becomes complex or even impossible, for example, the calculation of a sample autocorrelation function.},

  abstract     = {Today, there are a lot of useful algorithms for covering array (CA) generation, one of the branches of combinatorial testing. The major CA challenge is the generation of an array with the minimum number of test cases (efficiency) in an appropriate run-time (performance), for large systems. CA generation strategies are classified into several categories: computational and meta-heuristic, to name the most important ones. Generally, computational strategies have high performance and yield poor results in terms of efficiency, in contrast, meta-heuristic strategies have good efficiency and lower performance. Among the strategies available, some are efficient strategies but suffer from low performance; conversely, some others have good performance, but is not such efficient. In general, there is not a strategy that enjoys both above-mentioned metrics. In this paper, it is tried to combine the genetic algorithm and the Augmented Lagrangian Particle Swarm Optimization with Fractional Order Velocity to produce the appropriate test suite in terms of efficiency and performance. Also, a simple and effective minimizing function is employed to increase efficiency. The evaluation results show that the proposed strategy outperforms the existing approaches in terms of both efficiency and performance.},

  abstract     = {Several biometric cryptosystem techniques have been proposed to protect biometric templates and preserve users’ privacy. Although such techniques can thwart different attacks, it is difficult to achieve well non-linkability between biometric cryptosystems. In this paper, we propose a novel biometric cryptosystem scheme based on random projection (RP) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) to perform the task of biometric template protection. With the help of RP, an original biometric feature vector can be projected onto a fix-length feature vector of random subspace that is derived from a user-specific projection matrix. This process is revocable and produces unlinkable biometric templates. The proposed scheme further utilizes a BPNN model to bind a projected feature vector with a random key. Based on BPNN, a robust mapping between a projected feature vector and a random key is learned to generate an error-correction-based biometric cryptosystem. The security of the proposed scheme is analyzed and the experimental results on multiple biometric datasets show the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Sparse representation (SR) has been widely studied and successfully applied to many areas of computer science in recent years. However, whether sparsity is essential to improve the classification performance is still an open question. Some studies reveal that it is the collaborative representation (CR) rather than SR that truly improves the classification performance. In this paper, the advantage of CR is further investigated and exploited, and a CR-based coding method is proposed. This method improves the classification performance by applying CR to the traditional nearest subspace (NS) method. Compared to the other NS method which codes the test sample on each class separately, the proposed method employs all samples to code the test sample collaboratively and preserves the subspace structure at the same time. The test sample is then classified to the class with the smallest representation error. Besides, a corresponding dictionary learning algorithm is also proposed so that the coding can be conducted on a dictionary learned from the training dataset. Since analytical solutions for coding and dictionary learning have been derived, our algorithm can be implemented efficiently. Experiments are conducted on seven face databases and the USPS handwritten digit database, and the results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms many state-of-the-art coding methods and dictionary learning methods, which demonstrates the power brought by CR.},

  abstract     = {Accurate modeling and prediction of suspended sediment load (SSL) in rivers have an important role in environmental science and design of engineering structures and are vital for watershed management. Since different parameters such as rainfall, temperature, and discharge with the different lag times have significant effects on the SSL, quantifying and understanding nonlinear interactions of the sediment dynamics has always been a challenge. In this study, three soft computing models (multilayer perceptron (MLP), adaptive neuro-fuzzy system (ANFIS), and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)) were used to predict daily SSL. Four optimization algorithms (sine–cosine algorithm (SCA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), firefly algorithm (FFA), and bat algorithm (BA)) were used to improve the capability of SSL prediction of the models. Data from gauging stations at the mouth of the Kasilian and Talar rivers in northern Iran were used in the analysis. The selection of input combinations for the models was based on principal component analysis (PCA). Uncertainty in sequential uncertainty fitting (SUFI-2) and performance indicators were used to assess the potential of models. Taylor diagrams were used to visualize the match between model output and observed values. Assessment of daily SSL predictions for Talar station revealed that ANFIS-SCA yielded the best results (RMSE (root mean square error): 934.2 ton/day, MAE (mean absolute error): 912.2 ton/day, NSE (Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency): 0.93, PBIAS: 0.12). ANFIS-SCA also yielded the best results for Kasilian station (RMSE: 1412.10 ton/day, MAE: 1403.4 ton/day, NSE: 0.92, PBIAS: 0.14). The Taylor diagram confirmed that ANFIS-SCA achieved the best match between observed and predicted values for various hydraulic and hydrological parameters at both Talar and Kasilian stations. Further, the models were tested in Eagel Creek Basin, Indiana state, USA. The results indicated that the ANFIS-SCA model reduced RMSE by 15\% and 21\% compared to the MLP-SCA and RBFNN-SCA models in the training phase. Comparing models performance indicated that the ANFIS-SCA model could decrease MAE error compared to ANFIS-BA, ANFIS-PSO, ANFIS-FFA, and ANFIS models by 18\%, 32\%, 37\%, and 49\% in the training phase, respectively. The results indicated that the integration of optimization algorithms and soft computing models can improve the ability of models for predicting SSL. Additionally, the hybridization of soft computing models with optimization algorithms can decrease the uncertainty of models.},

In this work, an evolutionary algorithm is constructed, relying on the convexity properties of the version space, to evolve a population of perceptron classifiers in order to find a solution that approximates the maximum margin. Unlike other methods whose solutions explore the problem’s dual formulation, usually requiring the solution of a linear constraint quadratic programming problem, the proposed method requires only the evaluation of the margin values. Hyperspherical coordinates are used to guarantee feasibility when generating new individuals and for the population to be uniformly distributed through the search space. To control the number of generations, we developed a stop criteria based on a lower bound function which asymptotically approximates the margin curves providing a stop margin that satisfies a $$\beta $$ -approximation of the optimal margin. Experiments were performed on artificial and real datasets, and the obtained results indicate the potential to adopt the proposed algorithm for solving practical problems.},

  abstract     = {Multiagent system (MAS) is gaining popular attention in various applications especially with the rapid expansion of internet and computing. In general, MAS considers the collaboration of several agents working in the same environment together to achieve common objectives and also plays a critical role in supporting humans for attaining a comfortable life. Multiagent systems are used in numerous applications such as robotics, cloud computing, e-health, military, etc. Under such circumstances, trust among agents is crucial to ensure successful completion of a task especially when the task could only be completed through sharing of information and resources among the agents. This paper presents for the first time a study on the development of trust estimation models as a part of a decision-making framework that empirically computes and evaluates the trustworthiness of agents in MAS where the agent could choose to cooperate and collaborate only with the other trustworthy agents. The novelty of this study lies in the incorporation of beta reputation system into the Markov Games-based temporal difference learning framework and the development of a novel heuristic computation techniques adapted based on averaging methods. These models function as the integral part of the proposed MAS decision-making framework that chooses agents to collaborate with based on trustworthiness. The developed models and the framework are tested for their accuracy, efficiency and effectiveness using several analyses such as the time steps analysis, root-mean-square analysis and interaction analysis. The performances of the proposed models were better than the performances obtained using the trust models reported in the literature. Further real-world experiments are carried out to test the viability of the developed models in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Big data (BD) approach has significantly impacted on the development and expansion of supply chain network management and design. The available problems in the supply chain network (SCN) include production, distribution, transportation, ordering, and inventory holding problems. These problems under the BD environment are challenging and considerably affect the efficiency of the SCN. The drastic environmental and regulatory changes around the world and the rising concerns about carbon emissions have increased the awareness of customers regarding the carbon footprint of the products they are consuming. This has enforced supply chain managers to change strategies to reframe carbon emissions.. The decisions such as an optimization of the suitable network of the proper lot sizes can play a crucial role in minimizing the whole carbon emissions in the SCN. In this paper, a new integrated production–transportation–ordering–inventory holding problem for SCN is developed. In this regard, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model in the multi-product, multi-level, and multi-period SCN is formulated based on the minimization of the total costs and the related cost of carbon emissions. The research also uses a chance-constrained programming approach. The proposed model needs a range of real-time parameters from capacities, carbon caps, and costs. These parameters along with the various sizes of BD, namely velocity, variety, and volume, have been illustrated. A lot-sizing policy along with carbon emissions is also provided in the proposed model. One of the important contributions of this paper is the three various carbon regulation policies that include carbon capacity-and-trade, the strict capacity on emission, and the carbon tax on emissions in order to assess the carbon emissions. As there is no benchmark available in the literature, this study contributes toward this aspect by proposing two hybrid novel meta-heuristics (H-1) and (H-2) to optimize the large-scale problems with the complex structure containing BD. Hence, a generated random dataset possessing the necessary parameters of BD, namely velocity, variety, and volume, is provided to validate and solve the suggested model. The parameters of the proposed algorithms are calibrated and controlled using the Taguchi approach. In order to evaluate hybrid algorithms and find optimal solutions, the study uses 15 randomly generated data examples having necessary features of BD and T test significance. Finally, the effectiveness and performance of the presented model are analyzed by a set of sensitivity analyses. The outcome of our study shows that H-2 is of higher efficiency.},

Advance reservation (AR) is obligatory on initial-delay-tolerant services, like e-science and grid computing, that are having a remarkable involvement in next-generation internet traffic. In this paper, the authors proposed a routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) algorithm, which improves spectrum utilization by minimizing the blocking probability. This technique ensures spectrum availability for each connection request, but depending on the call arrival time and slot availability, there may be some delay and it is referred as spectrum allocation using reservation. The other proposed algorithm considers reservations based on prediction called as spectrum allocation using prediction and reservation. The simulation results show that the latter technique increases spectrum utilization even more and decreases call blocking compared to existing RSA algorithms. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first effort of spectrum assignment using prediction and reservation.},

Intuitionistic fuzzy entropy measures the average amount of imprecision and ambiguity present in an intuitionistic fuzzy set. In this work, we propose flexible (generalized) measure of intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) entropy and establish its superiority over some existing IF-entropies. We introduce a generalized IF-dissimilarity measure and prove some of its properties.

  abstract     = {A survey on the technologies employed in the modern agriculture and agri-food supply chains lately appeared, but only one paper using a fuzzy-based approach was cited. The aim of the present mini-review is to complement the above-mentioned survey and to show the application of different fuzzy-based approaches for agri-food supply chains. Agri-food supply chains represent linked events in the agricultural production of food, where all the stages of production, processing, trading, distribution and consumption are involved. These supply chains are expected to provide sustainable, affordable, safe and sufficient food and other derivatives to the consumers. Hence, it is critical to ensure that they operate properly and successfully in the volatile business environment. A first concern is to assess the service ability of the whole supply chain to preserve agri-food quality, eliminate deterioration and meet the demands of customers. Due to their complex structure, agri-food supply chains are susceptible to several vulnerabilities and risks, such as breakdowns, operational difficulties, and credit loss and economic losses due to various uncertain factors. A risk analysis can help to identify and categorize the risks. In this era characterized by the rapid industrialization of the agriculture and the increased global food demand, the sustainability and transparency of supply chains have become key factors. The new focus on sustainability emphasizes the issue of striking a balance between ecological and economic aspects in the agri-food business. In this context, problems such as the green supplier selection gained special attention.},

  abstract     = {The pipes as one of the main and important components of a water distribution network break during operation due to various factors. Developing models for pipes failure rate prediction can be one of the most important tools for managers and stakeholders during optimal operation of the water distribution network. In this study, the statistical and soft models such as Linear Regression, Generalized Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN), Radial-Based Function Neural Network (RBFNN), and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) were studied in order to predict the pipes failure rate based on the characteristics of Gorgan city water distribution network including diameter, length, age, installation depth, and number of failures of each pipe. In order to determine the optimal values of the parameters of each model, appropriate error indices including correlation coefficient (R), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Correlation Mean Square Error Ratio (CMSER) for training and test data were calculated, and the values of the parameters related to the model with the highest value of the CMSER index were considered as the model optimal values. Furthermore, in the validation stage, the values of R and MSE error indices for each of the above models were considered as a criterion for selecting the most appropriate model for predicting pipe failure rate. The findings show that among the soft and statistical models investigated, ANFIS with MSE of 0.071 and R of 0.92 can predict the failure rate of the studied network pipes more efficiently and more accurately than other models. Yet, despite the superiority of this model over other models, this model cannot accurately predict the failure rate of the studied network pipes due to its relatively high MSE value. Therefore, a new approach was developed based on the hybridization of trained models to provide a more efficient model for a more accurate prediction of the pipe failure rates of water distribution network. In this approach, the values of the network pipe failure rate predicted by each of the soft and statistical models are considered as independent input variables, and the observational failure rate values are considered as the dependent output variable of the ANFIS model. A comparison between the values of non-hybrid model validation data indices and the results of the proposed hybrid prediction model reveals that the use of the developed hybrid model increased the R error value from 8.1\% (compared to the ANFIS model) to 260\% (compared to the RBFNN model). It also decreased the MSE error value from 37\% (compared to the FFNN model) to 58\% (compared to the RBFNN model). Moreover, the hybrid model, compared to the superior non-hybrid ANFIS model, decreased MSE error rates by 45\%. The findings show that the proposed model can significantly raise the accuracy of predicting the failure rate of pipes, compared to other existing models.},

In this study, the mathematical models of another five simplest fuzzy PI/PD controllers are obtained, and their properties and computational aspects are investigated. Sufficient conditions for Bounded-Input-Bounded-Output stability of a closed-loop system containing one of these controllers in the loop are also established using the Small-Gain theorem.

  abstract     = {An AC microgrid (MG) system links the distributed generation (DG) based on renewable energy resources and local electrical loads in modern power systems. Intermittent characteristics of wind and solar resources influence not only the availability of energy but also the stability of the entire AC microgrid. This matter as well makes a challenge on the load frequency control (LFC) problem in an islanded MG system, and consequently, the fixed structure controllers are unable to provide a proper performance over a wide range of operating conditions. Therefore, it is required to design a dedicated controller for LFC to ensure the capability of maintaining a generation–load balance by managing the intermittent resources. In this paper, an adaptive type-2 fuzzy PID (T2FPID) controller is suggested for LFC in an AC MG system to enforce the frequency deviation to zero by supplying the load demands. The designed T2FPID controller is a nonlinear controller that can handle the system nonlinearities and uncertainties in the MG system in a better way. Using a Lyapunov function, the stability of the system is evaluated and parameter tuning laws for the T2FPID controller are derived using this function. It has been illustrated that the adaptive parameters are bounded and the frequency deviation reaches to zero properly. The proposed adaptive T2FPID controller has been applied for LFC of a MG system, and the simulation results have been compared with those obtained by type-1 fuzzy (T1F) PI and nonadaptive fuzzy PID controllers, which is the latest research in the problem in hand. The simulation results indicate the efficiency of the proposed adaptive controllers in dealing with intermittent resources and changing in the power system parameters.},

Shrimp as a well-known, rich, and sought-after seafood, is generally obtained from either marine environments or aquaculture. Central prominence of Shrimp Supply Chain (SSC) is brought about by numerous factors such as high demand, market price, and diverse fisheries or aquaculture locations. In this respect, this paper considers SSC as a set of distribution centers, wholesalers, shrimp processing factories, markets, shrimp waste powder factory, and shrimp waste powder market. Subsequently, a mathematical model is proposed for the SSC, whose aim is to minimize the total cost through the supply chain. The SSC model is NP-hard and is not able to solve large-size problems. Therefore, three well-known metaheuristics accompanied by two hybrid ones are exerted. Moreover, a real-world application with 15 test problems are established to validate the model. Finally, the results confirm that the SSC model and the solution methods are effective and useful to achieve cost savings.},

The local spatial membership is estimated to decide the correlation among neighbors, which is playing a responsible role for dramatic reduction of noise and misclassification in the resultant unmixed spectra and segments as well. The intensity-based distances in estimating the membership value has been concisely replaced by Gaussian based distance to reduce the effect of noise. The spatial attributes, entropy and weighted function have been considered as important correlation parameters to optimize the objective function by minimizing the degree of randomness. The estimated results of the proposed method and considered recent fuzzy based methods as Spectral Angle Distance, Partition Coefficient (Vpc), Partition Entropy (Vpe) and qualitative outcomes have been thoroughly compared for hyperspectral and brain MRI datasets.

In this paper, it is shown that proper aggregation of weights generated by carefully selected basic weighting methods improves retrieval of the relevant documents with respect to the user’s needs. Toward this aim, it is shown that even using simple central tendency measures such as average, median or mid-range over an appropriate subset of basic weighting methods provides term weight that not only outperforms using each basic weighting method but also results in more effective weights in comparison with recently proposed complicated weighting methods. Based on exploiting the proposed method on various datasets, we have studied the effects of normalization of the basic weights, normalization of the vector lengths, the use of different components in the term frequency factor, etc. Results reveal the criteria for selecting an appropriate subset of basic weighting methods that would be fed to the aggregator in order to achieve higher retrieval precision.},

  abstract     = {With the advent of the era of big data, data privacy protection has become a valuable topic in the field of data publication. Unfortunately, traditional methods of privacy protection, k-anonymity, and its extensions are not absolutely secure as an adversary with background knowledge can determine the owner of a record. The emergence of differential privacy provides a reasonable alternative for privacy security, but the existing solutions ignore the correlation between sensitive attributes and other attributes. In this paper, we propose a new differential privacy scheme based on quasi-identifier classification for big data publication (DP-QIC). It is a new data publishing scheme based on the obfuscation of attribute correlation. We innovatively present quasi-identifier classification based on sensitive attributes and the privacy ratio for evaluating the data set vulnerability. DP-QIC achieves data privacy-protecting through four steps: data collection, grouping and shuffling, generalization, merging, and noise adding, which retains the overall statistical characteristics of the data set. Moreover, the exponential mechanism and the Laplace mechanism are integrated to ensure higher flexibility and a stronger level of privacy protection, so DP-QIC can be used for privacy processing of different data groups in future development. Finally, we have compared the performance of our scheme with the other two famous schemes in the industry. Experimental results demonstrate that DP-QIC has obvious advantages in data utility, privacy protection, and processing efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Bug localization is the automated process of finding the possible faulty files in a software project. Bug localization allows developers to concentrate on vital files. Information retrieval (IR)-based approaches have been proposed to assist automatically identify software defects by using bug report information. However, some bug reports that are not semantically related to the relevant code are not helpful to IR-based systems. Running an IR-based reporting system can lead to false-positive results. In this paper, we propose a classification model for classifying a bug report as either uninformative or informative. Our approach helps to lower false positives and increase ranking performances by filtering uninformative information before running an IR-based bug location system. The model is based on implicit features learned from bug reports that use neural networks and explicit features defined manually. We test our proposed model on three open-source software projects that contain over 9000 bug reports. The results of the evaluation show that our model enhances the efficiency of a developed IR-based system in the trade-off between precision and recall. For implicit features, our tests with comparisons show that the LSTM network performs better than the CNN and multilayer perceptron with respect to the F-measurements. Combining both implicit and explicit features outperforms using only implicit features. Our classification model helps improve precision in bug localization tasks when precision is considered more important than recall.},

Under the condition of the premise in which the controller and the control system partake the same rules, the method does not inquire the same number of membership functions and mathematical rules. In addition, the improved control is used for large-scale nonlinear systems, where the stability criterion of the closed T–S fuzzy system is obtained through LMI and rearranged through the membership function for machine learning . The close-loop controller criteria are derived by using the Lyapunov energy functions to guarantee the stability of the system .

The demand in the retail end is assumed to be multivariate function of unit selling price and the level of on-hand inventory. The model is analyzed under decentralized and centralized chain structures. An analytic solution approach and an algorithm are developed to solve the problem. The proposed structure is illustrated through experimental results with factual growth patent. Sensitivity analysis and graphical illustrations are carried out to investigate the impact of different input parameters. The results support the claim that centralized chain structure can provide the partners with more benefits if an appropriate coordination mechanism is applied. Moreover, it is shown that the unit purchasing cost of each echelon has a significant effect on the profit in comparison with the other cost factors.

  abstract     = {Symbolic execution is one of the most important testing techniques to ensure the quality of software systems that need to be dependable and reliable. This technique systematically explores the program of the subject system which is represented by an Inter-procedural Control Flow Graph (ICFG). An ICFG is a graph that combines Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) of the program procedures by connecting each CFG with its call nodes. The existence of unreachable CFGs and infinite loops increases the complexity and runtime of a program, while they have no effect on testing the program. In this paper, we present an approach to convert the ICFG of a program to the corresponding finite automaton, called ICFG-automaton. Then, we construct a quasi-ordering hypergroup on the set of states of the ICFG-automaton and prove that the inner irreducibility in hypergroups is equivalent to the connectivity in CFGs. Moreover, we show that if every sub-automaton of an ICFG-automaton is a sub-hypergroup, then the program has an infinite loop. These results identify the parts of a program that should be modified to decrease the complexity of the testing activity.},

  abstract     = {The heavenly bodies are objects that swim in the outer space. The classification of these objects is a challenging task for astronomers. This article presents a novel methodology that enables an efficient and accurate classification of cosmic objects (3 classes) based on evolutionary optimization of classifiers. This research collected the data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey database. In this work, we are proposing to develop a novel machine learning model to classify stellar spectra of stars, quasars and galaxies. First, the input data are normalized and then subjected to principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality. Then, the genetic algorithm is implemented on the data which helps to find the optimal parameters for the classifiers. We have used 21 classifiers to develop an accurate and robust classification with fivefold cross-validation strategy. Our developed model has achieved an improvement in the accuracy using nineteen out of twenty-one models. We have obtained the highest classification accuracy of 99.16\%, precision of 98.78\%, recall of 98.08\% and F1-score of 98.32\% using evolutionary system based on voting classifier. The developed machine learning prototype can help the astronomers to make accurate classification of heavenly bodies in the sky. Proposed evolutionary system can be used in other areas where accurate classification of many classes is required.},

In this study, the criteria being effective on surface protection processes have been identified, and an approach based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the process capability ( $$C_{p}$$ ) values have been developed in order to identify the significance level of these criteria on the surface quality. The approach developed has been applied to the immersion phosphating process of a large-scale company. First of all, the significant levels of sub-processes were identified through the AHP method based on the quality parameters followed by the company. Then the $$C_{p}$$ values were calculated based on the measurement criteria in order to understand the competence of each sub-process. Important sub-processes affecting the final quality of the immersion phosphating process have been identified by means of the PPN (Process Priority Number) index developed by using the AHP results and $$ C_{p}$$ values.},

  abstract     = {The study on multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) reconnaissance task allocation problem is an important research field, which is significant for both military and civilian applications. This problem has often been considered as a multiple traveling salesman problem where the targets are considered as points. In this paper, we present a novel mathematical model that classifies heterogeneous targets as point targets, line targets and area targets to improve the fidelity of the model. It is a complex combinatorial optimization problem, for which we can hardly get an optimal solution as the scale of the problem expands. A new heuristic algorithm called grouping ant colony optimization algorithm is proposed for this new model. Compared with traditional ant colony algorithm, pheromone is divided into membership pheromone and sequence pheromone corresponding to grouping and permutation characteristics of the model, respectively. Also, negative feedback mechanism is introduced to accelerate convergence speed of the algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the new algorithm can consider comprehensively the performance of different UAVs and the characteristic of heterogeneous targets. It outperforms existing methods reported in the literature in terms of optimality of the result, and the advantage gets more obvious with the scale of reconnaissance task allocation problem expanding.},

As the number of jobs and number of machines employed increases, so does the difficulty of finding an accurate solution to scheduling problems. For this reason, a variety of heuristic and metaheuristic solution methods have been developed for this type of problems. In this study, chaotic hybrid firefly and particle swarm optimization are used with a developed version of local search for scheduling of flow shop production environments. Maximum completion time was taken as the objective function. In order to develop the solutions reached, the initial solution was adapted with NEH method.

Therefore, a distributed ensemble of relevance vector machines on the Spark framework (DE-RVM) is proposed. In this approach, a data set is divided into a number of disjoint subsets of data, and on each subset, a set of RVM classifiers are trained using the AdaBoostRVM based on sample type (STAB-RVM) according to the concept of ensemble learning. A final classifier is generated by the combination method with a diversity measure for the RVM classifiers. The smallest empirical loss of the combinatorial classifier is obtained in the quadratic programming problem. The algorithm was applied to both artificial data sets and real data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method offers good classification performance and can effectively improve the ability of the RVM to process large-scale data sets.},

Thus, the goal of this paper is to develop a two-sided matching method for the second-hand goods exchange matching. In the method, not only the characteristic of loss aversion of buyers/sellers and the benefit of e-brokerage are considered, but also the suggested exchange prices that meet the requirements of buyers and sellers are determined. Specifically, the description of second-hand goods exchange matching problem is firstly presented, in which the 2-tuple including the ideal level and the lowest acceptable level is used to quantify the expected demands of buyers and sellers for attributes. Then, several models maximizing the perceived values of buyers and sellers are derived to determine the suggested exchange price of goods. Next, according to the expectation information of buyers and sellers, and the real information of goods, the perceived value matrix for each attribute of buyers and sellers can be obtained by using the prospect theory. Furthermore, a model can be constructed and solved to determine the maximum number of exchange of buyers and sellers in e-brokerage, and an optimization model with the constraint of the exchange number threshold is constructed, and the optimal exchange matching results can be obtained by solving the optimization model. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the practicality of the proposed method. The method can be used to improve the operational performance of intelligent exchange platforms.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian networks in their Factor Graph Reduced Normal Form are a powerful paradigm for implementing inference graphs. Unfortunately, the computational and memory costs of these networks may be considerable even for relatively small networks, and this is one of the main reasons why these structures have often been underused in practice. In this work, through a detailed algorithmic and structural analysis, various solutions for cost reduction are proposed. Moreover, an online version of the classic batch learning algorithm is also analysed, showing very similar results in an unsupervised context but with much better performance; which may be essential if multi-level structures are to be built. The solutions proposed, together with the possible online learning algorithm, are included in a C++ library that is quite efficient, especially if compared to the direct use of the well-known sum-product and Maximum Likelihood algorithms. The results obtained are discussed with particular reference to a Latent Variable Model structure.},

  abstract     = {Due to the importance of correlation coefficient in data analysis, researchers have shown interest in the concept of correlation coefficient for the extensions of fuzzy sets, in particular, for a recent established extension known as hesitant fuzzy set (HFS). Most of the existing correlation coefficients for fuzzy sets return the value one to reflect a perfect linear relationship between objects, but they do not give us sufficient information about the scale with that the objects are correlated. This can be regarded as a disadvantage from the decision-making viewpoint. Moreover, some of the existing correlation coefficients were undefined in the case that the two objects are the same. To overcome such drawbacks, we propose an approach for deriving the modified correlation coefficients of HFSs based on hesitancy degree and then extend the approach to that of interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets. Furthermore, we put forward a number of new correlation coefficients for HFSs based on Jaccard’s and Dice’s similarity criteria. Then, we give a practical example to illustrate the application of the improved correlation coefficients for HFSs in medical diagnosis. However, comparing the results of the proposed correlation coefficients with those of the other existing definitions shows that the diagnosis results may be quite different, and this is due to their orientation.},

  abstract     = {Multilevel thresholding-based image segmentation plays a vital role in image processing. It significantly impacts many applications, such as remote sensing, pattern recognition, and medical image diagnosis. Premature convergence due to stuck into the local optima is the main challenge of any evolutionary algorithm-based multilevel image thresholding. Most of the evolutionary algorithms use their stochastic property to comprehensively utilize the search space, which strongly influences premature convergence. This paper presents a novel chaotic symbiotic organisms search (CSOS) optimization for multilevel image segmentation that maintains a strategic distance from premature convergence and improves the performance of conventional symbiotic organisms search (SOS) optimization in multilevel image segmentation. We have analyzed the performance of the proposed CSOS using state-of-the-art entropies such as Kapur’s, Tsallis’, Renyi’s, and Masi’s entropy as objective functions. The experiments on standard used color images are presented to establish the practicality of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the CSOS algorithm with Masi’s entropy is more effective and has wide adaptability to the high-dimensional optimization problems than the other recently proposed algorithms considered in this paper.},

  abstract     = {Sensor network-based home automation systems are familiar over the recent decades. Incorporating the benefits of the sensor network, energy management systems (EMS), is introduced to benefit end-user through periodic information sharing and remote access. WSN opted for energy harvesters to reduce the maintenance costs and maximize the lifetime of network. It is a perfect match for wireless devices and WSNs. Energy management system designed for effective use of harvested energy. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) coupled with EMS and grid-based applications serve as a support for smart home appliances. The integrated system architectures are cost effective and are energy harvesting that is profitable for end-user applications. Identifying optimal devices and defining an energy management policy are a tedious task as the devices are interfaced through different application support. This manuscript proposes a reward-based energy harvesting (REH) approach for identifying reliable devices in order to frame minimal-allocation energy for its operation. The rewards for the devices are estimated through observations carried out using reinforced learning that determines the operation state of the device. The reward function is computed using a variant function evaluated using the enduring energy and storage metrics of a device. Unlike the other learning methods, this approach operates in variable communication interval retaining the reward from the previous history of the devices. With a distributed WSN support and recursive knowledge of the sensor devices, REH is intended to improve the energy conservation rate with lesser retransmissions. The curtailed number of retransmissions minimizes delay with more preferable ideal devices in a home management system. The performance of the proposed REH is evaluated through simulations considering the following metrics: end-to-end delay, energy utilization, packets forwarded, expected TTL and number of retransmissions.},

  abstract     = {The capsule network (CapsNet) is a promising model in computer vision. It has achieved excellent results on MNIST, but it is still slightly insufficient in real images. Deepening capsule architectures is an effective way to improve performance, but the computational cost hinders their development. To overcome parameter growth and build an efficient architecture, this paper proposes a tensor capsule layer based on multistage separable convolutions and a dense capsule architecture. Multistage separable convolutions can effectively reduce the parameters at the cost of a small performance loss. In the dense capsule architecture, the use of dense connections allows the capsule network to be deeper and easier to train. Combining these two can achieve a novel lightweight dense capsule network. Experiments show that this network uses only 0.05\% of the parameters of the CapsNet, but the performance is improved by 8.25\% on CIFAR10. In addition, the full tensor capsule method is proposed to solve the problem of capsule network parameters changing with image scale. Experiments prove that this method can keep the parameters unchanged while affecting the performance in a small amount. In order to lighten the fully connected capsule layer, a dynamic routing based on separable matrices is proposed. In addition to applying it to our models, this algorithm also compresses the CapsNet by 41.25\% while losing only 0.47\% performance on CIFAR10. The parameter utilization index is proposed to quantify the relationship between parameters and performance. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to study lightweight capsule network.},

The goals of the present work are to build a family of new aggregation operators (AOs) under q-ROF environment and apply them to MADM problems. First, the extended Archimedean copula (EAC) and extended Archimedean co-copula (EACC) are proposed to handle q-ROF information; consequently, the operational law of q-ROFNs is defined based on EAC and EACC. In order to comprehensively consider the relationship between attributes, the q-rung orthopair fuzzy Banzhaf–Choquet-copula AOs ( $$BCCA^q$$ ) and q-rung orthopair fuzzy Banzhaf–Choquet-copula geometric operators ( $$BCCG^q$$ ) are introduced on the basis of the operation of q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-ROFNs); consequently, some special cases of $$BCCA^q$$ / $$BCCG^q$$ operators are investigated when the generators of copula take different functions which satisfy the condition of the generators of copulas. In addition, to determine the fuzzy measure (FM) of attribute sets objectively, the improved maximum deviation method and Banzhaf function model are built. Finally, the corresponding decision-making approaches are constructed based on the proposed AOs and proposed models. Proposed approaches can effectively address the some decision-making problems (DMPs), in which the weights of attributes are incompletely unknown (completely unknown), and the correlation also exists among all attribute sets.},

Besides, we intensively investigate theoretical and mathematical properties of the K-topological rough set operators. This research area can be considered as a part of geometric-based rough set theory. These obtained results can promote the studies of rough set theory associated with information geometry, object classification, artificial or computational intelligence, and so on.

In addition, the similarity IVRL-filters (S-IVRL-filters) were investigated and introduced in the similarity triangle algebras, and the similarity triangle logic $$(\mathcal {STL})$$ was presented, which is a system of several-valued logic capturing the tautologies of similarity triangle algebras to prove the completeness theorem. According to the results, $$\mathcal {STL}$$ is a conservative extension of triangle logic ( $$\mathcal {TL}$$ ).},

  abstract     = {Endosymbiosis is a type of symbiosis where one species inhabits another species, and both are benefited. It is not trivial to develop models of endosymbiosis because the interaction might involve complex mechanisms, consisting of various steps, and occurring at different levels of the organisms activity. Reaction networks can be applied to model complex ecological interaction mechanisms that can hardly be represented by traditional network approaches. Namely, entities of the reaction network represent either ecological species, resources, or conditions for the ecological interactions to happen, and ecological interaction mechanisms are represented by sequences of reactions (processes) in the reaction network. Hence, an ecological interaction is modeled as a reaction pathway. In this article, we present a mechanistic model of an endosymbiotic interaction using reaction networks. The model includes three representation layers at different timescales (intracellular, intercellular and organismic) model of the interaction. As an example, We provide a numerical analysis of the effects of the endosymbiotic interaction at the intracellular layer.},

  abstract     = {As quantum computing approaches its first commercial implementations, quantum simulation emerges as a potentially ground-breaking technology for several domains, including biology and chemistry. However, taking advantage of quantum algorithms in quantum chemistry raises a number of theoretical and practical challenges at different levels, from the conception to its actual execution. We go through such challenges in a case study of a quantum simulation for the hydrogen (H $$_2$$ ) and lithium hydride (LiH) molecules, at an actual commercially available quantum computer, the IBM Q. The former molecule has always been a playground for testing approximate calculation methods in quantum chemistry, while the latter is just a little bit more complex, lacking the mirror symmetry of the former. Using the variational quantum eigensolver method, we study the molecule’s ground state energy versus interatomic distance, under the action of stationary electric fields (Stark effect). Additionally, we review the necessary calculations of the matrix elements of the second quantization Hamiltonian encompassing the extra terms concerning the action of electric fields, using STO-LG-type atomic orbitals to build the minimal basis sets.},

This paper introduces a semantics for FAS, focusing on the weighted parallel interpretation of its conditional statement. The proposed construction is based on the notion of a fuzzy multirelation which associates with each state in a program a fuzzy set of weighted possible evolutions. The latter is parametric on a residuated lattice which models the underlying semantic ‘truth space’. Finally, a family of dynamic logics, equally parametric on the residuated lattice, is introduced to reason about FAS programs.},

The dynamical aspect is captured by a transition function which updates the values of the graph after an edge has been crossed. The update process takes into account aggregation functions. The paper proposes a notion for bisimulation for such graphs and briefly shows how modal logic can be used to verify properties of systems modeled with FSGs.

  abstract     = {A smart city (SC) is a sustainable and efficient urban center that provides a high quality of life to its inhabitants through optimal management of its resources that nowadays have been wider and wider. In modern societies, municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is an important part of SCs, the main problem of MSWM is the cost that it generates and must be reduced. To solve this situation in this paper are considered two sub-models. The first sub-model uses vehicle routing problem (VRP) for routing fleet among generation waste to separation facilities. The second sub-model is designed to allocate resources from separation facilities to set of recovery plants or landfill centers. From the best of our knowledge, most of the past studies related to this topic have focused only on deterministic implementations. Also, recent studies usually focus on uncertain parameters in the area of waste generation. In addition, a few related studies have developed the uncertain parameter which has focused on facilitating separation. This study considers the uncertain parameters in the output rate of separation facilities as well as the importance of value recovery from each bin; the aim is to enhance the efficiency of operations. The purpose of this study is to minimize the total transportation cost and to maximize recycled revenue. Chance-constrained programming has been used to deal with stochastic optimization model. Four metaheuristic algorithms are employed to identify the best solution. Besides, the performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated. Finally, sensitivity analyses along with number of scenarios have developed to measure the tightness of the proposed problem. The results of the study illustrate the optimized number of vehicles that can help the managers and decision-makers in various tightness conditions.},

We study a supply chain with an e-commerce platform and one manufacturer, in which they can cooperate via reseller or marketplace formats. Meanwhile, we employ a new cost function of emission reduction by incorporating the manufacturer’s emission reduction efficiency (ERE). We find that in the absence of low-carbon preference, the manufacturer’s and the platform’s profits both increase as the manufacturer’s ERE improves in reseller format; but in marketplace format, the platform is worse off as the manufacturer’s ERE improves if the efficiency is larger than a threshold. Besides, under which format the platform or the manufacturer is better off is related to the product category. For some product categories, low-carbon preference could alter the retailing format under which the platform or the manufacturer gains a higher profit. Moreover, the platform and the manufacturer are both better off in the presence of low-carbon preference, regardless of retailing formats.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the fuzzy event-triggered adaptive control problems for a class of nonlinear systems with input hysteresis are investigated. Fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are applied to address the uncertain part of the systems. Combined with adaptive control, a class of smooth functions are introduced to deal with the approximation error of FLSs, which could improve the system control accuracy. Further, different from the existing event-triggered strategy, a two-bit signal transmission mechanism is proposed to economize system communication resources. With the proposed mechanism, each time when the control signal is updated, only two-bit of digital numbers need to be sent. The convergence and asymptotic tracking performance of the closed-loop system could be guaranteed. Finally, simulation demonstrates the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {This article presents an improved version of the coyote optimization algorithm (COA) that is more compatible with nature. In the proposed algorithm, fitness-distance balance (FDB) and Lévy flight were used to determine the social tendency of coyote packs and to develop a more effective model imitating the birth of new coyotes. The balanced search performance, global exploration capability, and local exploitation ability of the COA algorithm were enhanced, and the premature convergence problem resolved using these two methods. The performance of the proposed Lévy roulette FDB-COA (LRFDBCOA) was compared with 28 other meta-heuristic search (MHS) algorithms to verify its effectiveness on 90 benchmark test functions in different dimensions. The proposed LRFDBCOA and the COA ranked, respectively, the first and the ninth, according to nonparametric statistical results. The proposed algorithm was applied to solve the AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) problem incorporating thermal, wind, and combined solar-small hydro powered energy systems. This problem is described as a constrained, nonconvex, and complex power system optimization problem. The simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm exhibited a definite superiority over both the constrained and highly complex real-world engineering ACOPF problem and the unconstrained convex/nonconvex benchmark problems.},

  abstract     = {Due to its effective search mechanism, gravitational search algorithm (GSA) has become a very popular and robust tool for the global optimization in a very short span of time. The search mechanism of GSA is based on its two features, namely $$K_\mathrm{best}$$ archive and gravitational constant G. The $$K_\mathrm{best}$$ archive stores the best agents (solutions) at any evolutionary state and hence helps GSA for global search. Each agent interacts with exactly same agents of $$K_\mathrm{best}$$ archive without considering its current impact on the search process, which results a rapid loss of diversity, premature convergence and the high time complexity in GSA model. On the other hand, the exponentially decreasing behavior of G scales the step size of the agent. However, this scaling is same for all agents which may cause inappropriate step size for their next move, and therefore leads the swarm towards stagnation or sometimes skipping the true optima. To address these problems, an improved version of GSA called ‘A novel neighborhood archives embedded gravitational constant in GSA (NAGGSA)’ is proposed in this paper. In NAGGSA, we first propose two novel neighborhood archives for each agent which helps in increased diversified search with less time complexity. Secondly, a novel gravitational constant is proposed for each agent according to the distance-fitness based scaling mechanism. The performance of the proposed variant is tested over different suites of well-known benchmark test functions. Experimental results and statistical analyses reveal that NAGGSA remarkably outperforms the compared algorithms.},

However, many algorithms perform ill in maintaining diversity and convergence simultaneously. In this paper, we devised a novel operator selection framework based on two collaborative indicators, generational distance (GD) and maximum spread (MS) to improve the diversity while maintaining a good convergence. By calculating the variation of GDs and MSs over the past 7 iterations, an instruction is conveyed to select a proper operator to execute next 7 iterations. This process is repeated until it reaches the maximum iteration. Two operators are embedded in this algorithm which are differential evolution operator (DE/rand/1) and our proposed crow search operator which is deemed to be efficient in explorating the search space. MOEA/D is utilized as the basis framework of our proposed algorithm. Experiments indicate that our proposed algorithm is valid and outperforms other famous algorithms in terms of diversity and convergence.

The research study is carried out by employing fuzzy-based multi-criteria decision-making processes in order to evaluate the environmental performance of suppliers. Firstly, the criteria are identified for assessing the environmental performance of suppliers and secondly, the rating of selected criteria and its alternatives (suppliers) are framed as per the expert’s opinion, by combining the qualitative criteria through fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and fuzzy VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) to generate an overall score for each alternative. The supplier obtained the highest score which is ranked one. It means that the supplier has the highest environmental performance. Fuzzy TOPSIS differentiates between benefit (higher the better) and the cost (lower the better) criteria. VIKOR method selects and ranks the best supplier among the alternatives in supply chain, whereas TOPSIS method chooses the best alternatives which are closest to the positive ideal solution and the worst alternative is farthest to the negative ideal solution. Sensitivity analysis is performed to analyze the effect of criteria weights on environmental performance. Radar diagrams of fuzzy TOPSIS and fuzzy VIKOR are developed from sensitivity analysis for varied criteria weights.

In this study, the prediction ability to forecast models is enhanced by generating virtual samples. Considering the integrated effects of attributes, a new data augment approach, called ITNN-VSG, which integrates virtual sample generation (VSG) with input-training neural network (ITNN), was put forward to enlarge training datasets for improving the performance of forecasting models. In the absence of any available domain-specific knowledge about target models, a query-driven interpolation process was first developed to explore the overall tendency of data distribution in both sparse regions and dense regions. Second, an ITNN with fixed weights was used to calculate the input corresponding to the virtual output generated by the interpolation process. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, several in silico experiments were carried out on a benchmark dataset from sinc(x) function, followed by a real-world application to purified terephthalic acid (PTA) solvent system. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach outperformed other existing approaches such as mega-trend-diffusion and tree-based-trend-diffusion.},

  abstract     = {This study aims to compute low-frequency energy with Hölder singularities in vibration signals of suspension system to predict the durability of coil spring. High frequencies in vibrations often had minimal contribution towards fatigue damage due to low amplitude range and thus induce errors in energy analysis of vibration signals. Since traditional low-pass method had not only been ineffective in reducing high frequencies, it also resulted in the loss of signal information. This study had therefore proposed characterising low-frequency energy for road excitations using Hölder singularities and power spectral analyses. Singularities and low-frequency energy of road vibration signals would first be identified through Hölder local regularity analysis. This was then followed by fatigue life prediction using the strain-life approaches (i.e. Coffin-Manson, Morrow and Smith–Watson–Topper models). The energy-based fatigue life prediction models had not only shown good fit with R2 values higher than 0.8, but had also demonstrated an accurate prediction of fatigue life with more than 95\% of the data being within the acceptance boundary. The Morrow-based model provided the highest accuracy in fatigue life prediction because of its highest R2 value of 0.8625 and 100\% data survival in the fatigue life correlation study. This showed that energy-based fatigue life prediction models provide an accurate and effective prediction of the durability performance. This study proposed a more precise energy characterisation method for energy-based durability prediction of suspension coil spring under random loading conditions.},

We also consider liquidity, cardinality, and upper and lower bound constraints to obtain a more realistic model. Furthermore, to solve the proposed model efficiently, an improved multiobjective bat algorithm termed IMBA is designed, in which three new strategies, i.e., the global best solution selection strategy, candidate solution generation strategy, and competitive learning strategy, are proposed to increase the convergence speed and improve the solution quality. Finally, comparative experiments are presented to show the applicability and superiority of the proposed approaches from two aspects. First, the designed IMBA is compared with seven typical algorithms, i.e., multiobjective particle swarm optimization, multiobjective artificial bee colony, multiobjective firefly algorithm, multiobjective differential evolution, multiobjective bat, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and strength pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2), on a number of benchmark test problems.

Therefore, in the present study, we proposed a fuzzy inference system based on user preferences, consisting of a set of rules according to distinguishing features for each user. Also together with fuzzy inference system, this method is proposed based on feature extraction and feature selection in order to predict the images which are liked by different users. In the proposed method, the features from user preferred images are extracted. Then, feature selection is used to determine the most discriminant features for each user, and accordingly fuzzy inference system is employed to learn user preferences. We used fuzzy clustering to generate soft clusters and fuzzify user preferences. Then, this system is used to predict images that should be recommended to the user. Experimental results on datasets from Flickr and Pinterest indicated that the proposed method can significantly improve Recall@k and Precision@k for personalized image recommendation compared to some related works.},

It is also a challenging task; however, if every large customer of a special transformer is modeled and forecasted for power load, a huge amount of calculation work is needed and it is not practical. Therefore, in this study, we propose a boost clustering-based approach for the prediction of power load. The traditional k-means algorithm is enhanced, and the initial cluster centers are determined in advance instead of random selection. Then, the enhanced k-means paired with the HAC algorithm are used for the clustering of power consumption users. Next, the power load of each group is predicted after the users are clustered into the different groups, and the predicted results of each group are finally summed to obtain the prediction value of the power load. Experimental findings demonstrate the validity of the proposed procedure, and the boost clustering-based approach significantly outperforms the direct prediction approach in the empirical analysis.},

Although feature selection methods in the literature which utilize support vector machines have provided acceptable results, noisy samples and outliers may affect the performance of SVM and feature selections method, consequently. Recently, we have proposed relaxed constrains SVM (RSVM) which handles noisy data and outliers. Each training sample in RSVM is associated with a degree of importance utilizing the fuzzy c-means clustering method. Therefore, a less importance degree is assigned to noisy data and outliers. Moreover, RSVM has more relaxed constraints that can reduce the effect of noisy samples. Feature selection increases the accuracy of different machine learning applications by eliminating noisy and irrelevant features. In the proposed RSVM-SBS feature selection algorithm, noisy data have small effect on eliminating irrelevant features. Experimental results using real-world data verify that RSVM-SBS has better results in comparison with other feature selection approaches utilizing support vector machines.},

  abstract     = {In this study, two nature-inspired optimization techniques such as firefly algorithm (FA) and butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA) are combined with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and group method of data handling (GMDH) models for optimal prediction of the complex phenomenon of volumetric concentration of sediment (Cv) in sewer systems. Three different scenarios based on the methods of dimensional analysis and forward selection are implemented for determining the input structure of ANFIS, GMDH, and regression models (multiple linear regression, MLR; stepwise regression; SR) regarding 13 independent hydraulic and geometric input variables. Several statistic criteria including the root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), index of agreement (AI), coefficient of determination (R2), and comprehensive synthesis index (SI) as well as Taylor diagram were used to further quantify simulating and predicting accuracies. In comparison with the regression models and two empirical equations, the results obtained by standard machine learning models (ANFIS and GMDH) were very promising. However, such integration of FA and BOA noticeably improved the performance of ANFIS (around 7\% improvement in RMSE criterion) and slightly optimized the performance of GMDH (less than 1\% improvement in RMSE criterion) in modelling the process of Cv prediction.},

This limitation is attributed to the highly nonlinear relation between the mortar’s compressive strength and the mixed components. In this paper, the application of artificial intelligence techniques for predicting the compressive strength of mortars is investigated. Specifically, Levenberg–Marquardt, biogeography-based optimization, and invasive weed optimization algorithms are used for this purpose (based on experimental data available in the literature). The comparison of the derived results with the experimental findings demonstrates the ability of artificial intelligence techniques to approximate the compressive strength of mortars in a reliable and robust manner.},

In fact, a chance distribution can be expressed based on expectation with respect to probability distribution functions. Thus, chance distributions are computed via Monte Carlo simulation. And consequently, value at risk is obtained via statistical quintile index. As an application in finance, portfolio selection problems of uncertain random returns are optimized via mean–value at risk models.},

Uncertainties of the blood supply and demand, perishability of blood over time and compatibility of blood types are some factors that make the problem difficult. This paper presents a novel multi-objective mixed-integer location-allocation model for a blood supply chain design problem. Unlike many studies on blood supply chain design in the literature, supply chain network consisting of mobile and permanent units is planned together effectively with our mixed-integer programming model. Multi-objective structure of the model minimizes distances between the blood supply chain elements and the length of the mobile unit routes. The objectives are prioritized by experts using the Analytical Hierarchical Process. Finally, the model is implemented on a real life case study using real data from the Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey for various supply demand scenarios. The solutions offered by the model are compared with the current situation in the region. It is shown that the proposed model gives at least\%25 more effective solutions. Moreover, sensitivity analysis on the budget constraint is conducted, and robustness of the model is empirically illustrated.},

To increase the capacity of robot modernization of its motion is inexorable, and finding the obstacle-free and shortest path for the robot in minimum time becomes essential. To solve this mobile robot path planning problem, many exact, heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms were designed and developed. Here, a metaheuristic algorithm based on chemical reaction optimization (CRO) is proposed to find the obstacle-free minimum path in minimum computational time. To get this outcome, basic operators of CRO are redesigned and two new repair operators have been introduced. These repair operators help to reduce the path length, increase the path smoothness and minimize the number of points in a path, respectively,. They have great influence because the four fundamental operators of CRO are not sufficient enough to produce better results in all situations. To prove the supremacy of the proposed algorithm, the results are compared with ant colony optimization algorithm, probabilistic road map method, particle swarm optimization algorithm and genetic algorithm. The comparison shows that the proposed algorithm has the best results in the improvement of path length, smoothness and execution time. The superiority of the proposed algorithm over the compared algorithms has been proven using a statistical test. Besides this, the empirical outcomes of 10 complex maps are revealed in this research work for which nobody did any experiment in our conjecture.},

  abstract     = {Cellular evolutionary algorithms (cEAs) use structured populations whose evolutionary cycle is governed by local interactions among individuals. This helps to prevent the premature convergence to local optima that usually takes place in panmictic populations. The present work extends cEAs by means of a message passing phase whose main effect is a more effective exploration of the search space. The mutated offspring that potentially replaces the original individual under cEAs is considered under message passing cellular evolutionary algorithms (MPcEAs) as a message sent from the original individual to itself. In MPcEAs, unlike in cEAs, a new message is sent from the original individual to each of its neighbors, representing a neighbor’s mutated offspring whose second parent is selected from the neighborhood of the original individual. Thus, every individual in the population ultimately receives one additional candidate for replacement from each of its neighbors rather than having a unique candidate. Experimental tests conducted in the domain of real function optimization for continuous search spaces show that, in general, MPcEAs significantly outperform cEAs in terms of effectiveness. Specifically, the best solution obtained through MPcEAs has an importantly improved fitness quality in comparison with that obtained by cEAs.},

  abstract     = {In this manuscript, wind speed multistep forecasting model using a hybrid decomposition technique and a selfish herd optimizer-based deep neural network is proposed. The reliability and hygiene standards of wind energy are obtaining large stake. Indeed, it is difficult to ascertain a scientific and robust forecasting method due to the variability and the wind speed intervention. To wind farm operational scheduling, accurate and consistent prediction is crucial. Therefore, the wind speed array usually has dynamic characteristics including nonlinearity and variability, rendering the estimation of wind energy exceptionally challenging. The proposed hybrid decomposition technique incorporates the multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) with the specific enhanced empirical wavelet transform and is primarily utilized to progressively decompose MEMD’s high-intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, strengthened DNN is widely used for the forecasting of all decomposed IMFs, so the components are using selfish herd optimizer algorithm. The data from Tamil Nadu region for certain coastal and hilly areas are used for multiforecasting to ascertain the predicting potential of the proposed method. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the hypothesized model executes substantially better in the one five-step wind speed predicting than all other perceived models, suggesting that the proposed prototype is well suited to standardized multistep wind speed prediction.},

  abstract     = {Current national and international regulations, along with growing environmental concerns, have deeply influenced the design of supply chain networks. These decisions stem from the fact that decision-makers try to design the supply chain network to align with their economic and environmental objectives. In this paper, a new closed-loop supply chain network with sales agency and customers is formulated. The proposed model has four echelons in the forward direction and five echelons in the backwards direction. The model not only considers several constraints from previous studies, but also addresses new constraints in order to better explore real-life problems that employ different transportation modes and that rely on sale agency centers. The objective function is to maximize the total profit. In addition, this study firstly considers distinct cluster of customers based on the product life cycle. These customers are utilized in different levels of the proposed network in order to purchase the final products, returned products, and recycled products. The structure of the model is based on linear mixed-integer programming, and the proposed model has been investigated through a case study regarding the manufacturing industry. To verify the model efficiency, a set of metaheuristics and hybrid algorithm are applied in various test problems along with a data from a real-world case study in a building construction industry. The findings of the proposed network illustrated that using the attributes of sale agency centers and clusters of customers both increase the problem total revenue and the number of the collected returned products.},

A balanced lumping (between body and tail angles) plays a significant role in capturing the prey in a shot. In formulating the optimization problem, a swarm of lizard are considered that are hunting for the prey. To study the performance of the proposed ALSO, it has been simulated. A comparative study is done with some well-known nature-inspired optimization techniques on classical unimodal, multimodal and other benchmark functions. Further, the algorithm is also tested on an object detection application. The result proves the effectiveness of the proposed ALSO algorithm over other nature-inspired state of the art.},

  abstract     = {Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is a commonly used step-by-step approach to assess potential failures existing in a product or process design. In this paper, a modified FMEA model based on an interval-valued spherical fuzzy extension of technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (IVSF-TOPSIS) is proposed to cope with drawbacks of the traditional risk priority number (RPN) computation. Spherical fuzzy sets are the integration of Pythagorean fuzzy sets and neutrosophic sets. They provide more freedom to experts in decision making by including the degree of membership, non-membership, and hesitation of fuzzy sets. Therefore, initially, TOPSIS is merged with a special branch of spherical sets “interval-valued spherical fuzzy sets” to determine priorities of emerged failures. As a novelty to traditional RPN of FMEA, three parameters called cost, prevention, and effectiveness in addition to the existed parameters of severity, occurrence and detection are attached to the proposed approach. Weights of these parameters are determined via an interval-valued spherical weighted arithmetic mean operator (IVSWAM). As a demonstration, a case study in a marble manufacturing facility is provided to show the applicability of the novel model. Results show that the most crucial failure modes concern with the maintenance and repairing works of the factory and the lack of technical periodic checks of lifting vehicles regarding “block area: crane” failures. Some comparative and validation studies are also performed to test the solidity of the approach.},

Before the cooperation relationship was formed, the profit for a single priori union (i.e., firm) could be obtained based on the former cooperation history. However, it is difficult to get the feasible coalition worth among multiple firms. Hence, a cooperative game with a coalition structure under the limited feasible coalition (IFCS game) is defined. For the solution of IFCS game, two different methods are used. Firstly, a Limited Owen value is defined by known values, and a generalized extension of Limited Owen value (i.e., q-probabilistic value) is given by distribution matrices of players. Some axioms are used to characterize Limited Owen and q-probabilistic value, such as I-Efficiency, I-Symmetric within coalitions, I-Symmetric across coalitions, I-Null player property, I-Linearity, I-Null coalition property and I-Proportionality. In the second solution, unknown coalition values are also estimated to make Owen value usable. By defining the lower and upper limit values of IFCS game, IFCS game is transformed into the coalition structures cooperative games. An interval Owen value is represented by the lower and upper limit values of IFCS game, which is a range of all the possible Owen values. Finally, the relationship between two methods is discussed},

  abstract     = {Malawi is located within the southern branch of the active East African Rift System, where earthquakes of moment magnitude (Mw) 7.0 or greater can occur along major faults. The majority of dwellings in the country are non-engineered unreinforced masonry constructions, built by local artisans with little input from engineers. These constructions are highly vulnerable to seismic events due to poor-quality materials and lack of construction detailing. This study presents a new methodology to assess the seismic fragility curves of typical dwellings located in the Central and Southern Malawi. On-site inspections of buildings are carried out to assess geometrical and structural features of 646 façades, and an experimental campaign is performed to characterise the mechanical properties of local construction materials. The collected data allow the identification of different building typologies in terms of quality of materials and construction techniques. The critical failure modes for each of the inspected façade at their ultimate limit state are evaluated analytically. Damage limit states are defined and adopted to derive simplified Static Push-Over (SPO) curves, transformed into incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) curves by using SPO2IDA. The IDA curves are then used to obtain fragility curves for the specific damage limit states. The fragility curves presented herein are the first to be calculated for these building typologies, based on local data, and unfortunately, they show that buildings in Malawi are far more vulnerable to earthquakes than estimated from previously available international reference data.

  abstract     = {In the literature, most of the researchers studying assembly line balancing have only considered task assignments. However, resources are needed to perform the tasks. Therefore, assigning resources related to tasks becomes more realistic when assigning tasks to stations. In the general case of the problem, the task is performed with a specified amount of resources. If resource types such as a, b, c are required to perform tasks in an assembly line, the combination of tasks required from these resources should also be assigned to the stations. This type of problem is defined as general resources-constrained assembly line balancing problem (GRCALBP). In this study, GRCALBP is addressed to minimize cycle time and resource usage for a given number of stations. New constraint programming (CP) models based on conjunction normal form are proposed. The CP models are tested with generated problem instances from the data set in the literature. The experimental results show that CP is an efficient and effective modeling technique to solve GRCALBP. Finally, suggestions are made regarding alternative objective functions.},

Also, multiparty privacy management is absent in social media, which leads the users incapable of managing to whom the data are shared. Because of the privacy conflicts, it is not easy to combine the privacy preferences of multiple users. For resolving the privacy conflicts in social media, more methods are required. This study promotes a fuzzy-based multiparty privacy management in social media using modified elliptic curve cryptography. The evaluation model used a method based on secure multiparty computing. Next, the fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (fuzzy TOPSIS) method is used to rank and select the participants. Finally, data encryption is performed using a modified elliptic curve encryption (MECC). Here, the optimal selection of private key is performed using the cuckoo search optimization algorithm (CSOA). With these presented techniques, the users can manage who the data are shared. In order to overcome privacy conflicts, users may first rank and select the participants based on fuzzy TOPSIS. Also, the privacy of the users is not affected by using the MECC-based data encryption framework. The presented work is implemented on the JAVA platform. The outcomes of the experiment prove that the presented approach outperforms the other existing approaches.},

Further, the similarity variables associated with one of the optimal algebra are used to reduce the governing fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs) to fractional ordinary differential equation (FODEs). Subsequently, we obtain the power series solution for the reduced FODEs which in turn produces the solution for the given FPDEs.

However, there is still a lack of research that addresses advances in ACC tools headed for the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) perspective and that point out practitioners’ perceptions concerning the current application of these technologies. In this sense, this paper aims to conduct a systematic review to identify the main automated code-checking tools to regulatory compliance in the I4.0 era, indicating new trends and possible gaps, and then ranking the selected technologies with the support of two soft hybrid multi-criteria decision-making techniques. By content analysis, we identified and categorized seven main technologies used to ACC in several industrial areas. As a practical example of group decision-making and modeling of uncertainty, we implemented fuzzy analytical hierarchical process to aggregate different perspectives and obtain the criteria weights and combined it with TOPSIS and VIKOR methods. To do this, by means of expert panel, we evaluated practitioner’s perception about the surveyed technologies concerning the ISO/IEC 9126 standard. The results indicate that both methods have shown similar rankings, and although portability was considered the most relevant criterion, open-source tools are key issues when choosing ACC technologies. Several further research trends were also pointed out through this theoretical–empirical approach, such as the use of natural language processing, declarative rule processing and flow-based processing.},

In this work, a new imputation method for symbolic regression with incomplete data is proposed. The method aims to improve both the effectiveness and efficiency of imputing missing values for symbolic regression. This method is based on genetic programming (GP) and weighted K-nearest neighbors (KNN). It constructs GP-based models using other available features to predict the missing values of incomplete features. The instances used for constructing such models are selected using weighted KNN. The experimental results on real-world data sets show that the proposed method outperforms a number of state-of-the-art methods with respect to the imputation accuracy, the symbolic regression performance, and the imputation time.},

The present study examines the performance of model tree (MT) data-driven technique in predicting streamflows for an intermittent and a perennial river in a physio-climatically heterogeneous river basin. The correlation and mutual information analyses of predictor (hydrometeorological) variables are performed to determine the model input structure. Overall, seventy-two model configurations are formulated for each stream gauging station based on the combination of input variables, MT variants and variable lengths of calibration and validation datasets. The model simulation results are analysed by estimating a suite of statistical performance indices for each model configuration. The influence of parameter sensitivity on model performance is also assessed. The results indicate that selection of input variables play a governing role in capturing the interplay of hydrological processes in a catchment. The model outputs displayed more sensitivity to pruning than smoothing in MT, and minimal sensitivity towards data portioning, since the datasets were homoscedastic. The study also proposes a procedure for model evaluation considering multiple criteria, such as forecasting error, efficiency, predictability and false alarms, and enabling multi-model comparisons for better decision making. The proposed procedure was successfully applied for selection of best-fit model to predict one-day ahead streamflows at each stream gauging station.},

However, it was difficult to guarantee the waveform parameters on the neighbor of optimal solution, because of the limited amplitude range. In addition, waveform parameters were usually set by the amplitude and location of inflection points, which may enlarge the difference between decomposed and original waveforms. Hence, a novel waveform decomposition technique based on wavelet function and differential cuckoo search algorithm is proposed, where wavelet function has a high-order vanishing moment, cuckoo search algorithm has a strong optimization ability, and differential operator avoids trapping into the local optima. The proposed technique is tested on airborne FWL point cloud and compared with other corresponding approaches, experimental results demonstrate that the decomposed waveforms are obtained with a reasonable convergence rate and feature characterization, as the rRMSE is lower than 7\% for all of waveforms, the whole process of waveform decomposition only takes 0.3s, and waveform parameters are used as the features to recognize different objects from point cloud.},

Studies of traditional sustainable tourism supply chain management generally focus on the relationship between two parties, and few consider cases where there is collaboration between three or more stakeholders. In drawing on the nucleolus concept taken from cooperative game theory, this paper applies the network loss allocation method to study cooperation issues in a triadic relationship that involves airlines, tourist attractions and travel agencies. We specifically analyze the costs and benefits of these three different stakeholders in the tourism industry, and we provide numerical calculations and examples to support our analysis.},

  abstract     = {An important aspect of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in a clinical application is the localization and detection of tumors and lesions by administering a predetermined amount of radiotracer. This allows detailed 3D imaging of a wide range of molecular processes in the human body. The quality of the PET image is dependent on the amount of radiotracer administrated and the patient’s body parameters. As the amount of injected radiotracer increases, an overall improvement in the quality of the reconstructed PET images and lesion detectability is expected, but it is accepted that any radiotracer doses are associated with the risk of radiation and it could be harmful to the patient if essential PET imaging is not performed because of the fear of radiation risk. To ensure the highest-quality diagnosis and the smallest radiation risk, the patient should receive the smallest amount of radiotracer that provides an image of sufficient quality. Our study proposed a PET simulation tool to predict the smallest amount of radiotracer that allows for a reliable diagnosis based on patients’ significant body parameters (weight, age) within a fixed total scan time to improve diagnostic processes for detecting and localizing tumors. We built a model of a particular PET scanner and patient, based on real MRI images and a digital anthropomorphic phantom of the brain. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of PET data acquisitions. A dataset of 60 patients was used, and 11 independent dose prediction simulations were performed for each patient. We concluded that our simulator estimated injected radiotracer doses 28\% smaller than the standard clinical doses that yielded PET images of clinically acceptable quality. We also found that the total injected radiotracer dose for adult patients was affected by considering the patient’s weight rather than age.},

Crowdsourcing has made different kinds of chances for some trying issues by utilizing human knowledge. In order to attain an optimal global assignment technique, it is necessary to gather information regarding the location of the entire workers. There occur few security issues during information gathering that causes severe threat to all workers. To overcome the concerns based on privacy-preserving, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving model based on Fuzzy with the Black widow and Spider Monkey Optimization (BW–SMO). The fuzzy can be used to cluster the query solution. To optimize the query selection, we exploited the Black widow optimization algorithm incorporated with the Spider Monkey optimization algorithm. The parameters of both algorithms are controlled by the Fuzzy logic controller. Thus, our proposed frameworks of Fuzzy with BW–SMO effectively solve optimizing selection and join queries with low cost, latency, and securing data. The proposed model will be compared with the existing models to show the system&#39;s effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {This paper is about a novel representation based on lossless encoding for medical images. It relies on directional codes for efficient storage and transmission. Image compression is a recent research, where removal or elimination of redundant information is carried out in an image. In this paper, for medical image compression, an edge- and texture-based entropy coding is presented. The proposed work is partitioned into two stages. In the first stage, a novel lossless hex-directional chain code or chain code 16 (C16) boundary representation approach is applied for edge encoding. In this C16 method, a set of pixels are connected along the edge of an image based on the direction code. Eliminating redundant information and retaining the topological information is the basic idea of chain code. It concerns the shape and the structure of the object which helps in preserving the quality of an image. In the second stage, predictor-based entropy coding is applied for adopting texture feature as a basic primitive. Finally, the outcome of the two stages is provided to the entropy coder for attaining compression. The proposed method is tested with standard benchmark chain code dataset and medical image datasets for various modalities of different sizes. Performance metrics such as compression ratio (\%), encoding time and mean square error are used to evaluate the proposed technique. From the results attained, it is evident that the proposed technique results in better compression performance when compared to the existing methods.},

But traditional finite automata are defined on a fixed finite set of states. They will be invalid when a different application needs to change the states. However, semantic computing always asks for more robust automata that can modify itself according to the changes of states. Therefore, in this paper, we redefine traditional automata in more robust forms by semantic computing. The intuitive idea is when the state which an automaton is supposed to enter has changed, we drive automata into a state that is similar to the original one. We can find another similar state in the original state set to replace the changed state by semantic similarity. Based on the theories of semantic similarity, there always exists a similar state. Therefore, once a state has changed, we can always find a similar state to replace it, which means that we can empower automata to adapt to the changes of states. Our new automata bridge the gap between semantic computing and the theory of computation. Furthermore, we also redefine fuzzy finite automata and pushdown automata in more robust forms. Finally, we provide an application about the weather forecast, which indicates how to overcome the limitations of traditional automata.},

Virtual force is integrated into the random movement to adjust the location of readers during the search process of PSO. Moreover, we consider four objective functions in a hierarchical manner.

In total, 321 datasets were collected from various literature sources for different pile group configurations also including the gap between piles and pile groups non-aligned with the flow direction. Results through training and testing phases showed that the MARS technique with Index of Agreement (IOA) of 0.984, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.483, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.250 provides more accurate estimates of the scour depth (normalized by the pile diameter) than EPR (IOA = 0.976, RMSE = 0.579, and MAE = 0.195), GEP (IOA = 0.972, RMSE = 0.628, and MAE = 0.295), and M5MT (IOA = 0.965, RMSE = 0.704, and MAE = 0.259) models. Conversely, the most frequently used literature formulas demonstrate unconvincing efficiency when wide range experimental data are considered. The sensitivity analysis, in terms of Sobol’s index, revealed that the ratio U/Uc, between the approach flow velocity, U, and the flow velocity, Uc, at the inception of sediment motion, is the most influential parameter with Total Sobol Index (TSI) of 0.514 and an opposite trend of scour with the ratio m/n (TSI = 0.023), between the number, m, of piles inline with the flow and that, n, of piles normal to the flow, was found.},

This paper proposes a novel lane detection and tracking approach for ADAS by using the line segment detector (LSD), adaptive angle filter and dual Kalman filter. In the lane detection process, the region of interest (ROI) within the inputted image is transformed into grayscale image, which is further preprocessed with median filtering, histogram equalization, image thresholding and perspective mapping. Then, the fast and robust LSD algorithm is applied on the ROI with the proposed adaptive angle filter to eliminate incorrect line segments more efficiently. In addition, a new three-level classifier based on the color, length and quantity of detected line segments is designed for lane classification. Finally, two Kalman filters are applied to track the detected lane and predict the following ROIs to improve the robustness and processing speed. The experimental results on four datasets show that the proposed method has robust performance in complex environments with the presence of shadows or other artifacts. It has average correct rate of lane detection higher than 94\%, while the processing time is reduced by about 50\% compared with a state-of-the-art method, and the average success rate of lane classification is above 85\%.},

  abstract     = {The feature representation of images is the key to bridge the semantic gap and make computer understand images in the tasks of image retrieval. In image recognition, semantic regions and salient targets are irreplaceable parts of image cognition. The purpose of segmenting semantic regions is to analyze the connections between image targets, while some distinctive targets are able to highlight the important semantics. However, the semantic regions and salient targets were often ignored in previous retrieval methods. Considering the two aspects, this paper proposes an unsupervised image retrieval method based on multi-semantic region weighting and multi-scale flatness weighting. Firstly, we divide the semantic regions by using the Fully Convolutional Network and calculate the multi-Semantic weight map (S-mask) to obtain the global features. Secondly, we introduce a flatness-weighted strategy to weight feature maps and aggregate the multi-scale features to obtain the local features. Finally, we cascade the global features and the local features to construct the final image representation. There are two main contributions in this paper. One is that the S-mask assigns different weights to the semantic regions. It distinguishes the importance of the semantic regions and balances the weight within the semantic region. The other is that the flatness-weighted strategy suppresses the background and highlights the target region. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Paris and Oxford databases.},

In case retrieval stage, K similar cases to the new problem were retrieved using K nearest neighbor method. By means of the K similar cases, support vector regression machine (SVR) model was established to give the solution of the new problem in case of the reuse stage of ICBR method. Artificial neural network (ANN) was introduced to estimate the influence of machining parameters and tool wear on machining performance. As the ANN and SVR models contain unknown parameters, the novel particle swarm optimization algorithm was proposed to train these models for its capability of fast convergence and global optimum. The proposed ICBR method was used to predict the surface roughness and cutting force. The results showed the proposed ICBR method can give superior prediction accuracy and lower Mean square error than other popular intelligent models. Meantime, the ICBR method possesses good robustness and can be used for the actual machining process.},

  abstract     = {IoT or Internet of Things can improve the possibility of interaction between various smart components in real time. In the infrastructure of IoT, wireless sensors can be used in order to reduce communication costs. Despite having positive effects, using wireless nodes add some challenges to the system. Limited resources, such as energy, CPU power and memory, are the main concerns in this technology. Energy consumption is the most challenging one. Designing an optimized routing pattern through heuristic algorithms is a common way to tackle this problem. Therefore, in the proposed algorithm, a WOA-based method has been proposed to expand the life span of the system. Also, a novel fitness function is defined for reducing the energy consumption of the network, load balancing and node coverage. Clustering is done unequally; it means that cluster heads (CHs) nearer to the base station (BS) have more energy for data relay. In this paper, for reducing the number of messages, a clustering stage is added at the beginning of each metaround. The number of rounds in a metaround is variable. The status of each node is analyzed by BS before each round. Low energy level causes a new metaround. Moreover, the CH–BS interaction is implemented through multi-hop pattern. Results suggest that there is an enhancement instability, energy-saving, throughput and lifespan.},

  abstract     = {The existing crisp and fuzzy multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods exhibit consistency, complexity, and reliability issues. To address these challenges, we propose a new MCDM method called fuzzy technique for best–worst analysis (FTBWA). In FTBWA, a decision-maker (DM) first identifies a set of criteria and then determines the best–worst criteria. Next, the DM performs the fuzzy reference comparisons between the best-to-other (BtO) and the others-to-worst (OtW) criteria using the linguistic expressions. The process results in fuzzy BtO and fuzzy OtW vectors, which are then defuzzified to obtain quantifiable values. Afterward, a maximin problem is built and solved to obtain the weights of criteria and alternatives. The best alternative can be selected based on the final score obtained by aggregating the weights of different sets of criteria and alternatives. Further, we propose a consistency ratio to check the reliability of the results of FTBWA. To verify the practicality and consistency of FTBWA, we perform two illustrative case studies. Moreover, we perform a comprehensive analysis considering a comparative analysis, rank reversal analysis, and support for group decision making. From the results, we observe that FTBWA outperforms existing fuzzy/crisp MCDM methods.},

To solve the shortcomings of traditional grid search algorithms such as too many invalid search ranges and sensitivity to search step, an improved grid search algorithm is proposed to optimize SVR for prediction. The improved grid search (IGS) algorithm is used to optimize the penalty parameter and kernel function parameter of SVR by automatically changing the search range and step for several times, and then SVR is trained for the optimal solution. The available of the method is proved by predicting the values of soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD) in rice leaves. To predict SPAD values more quickly and accurately, some dimension reduction methods such as stepwise multiple linear regressions (SMLR) and principal component analysis (PCA) are processed the training data, and the results show that the nonlinear fitting and prediction performance of accuracy of SMLR-IGS-SVR and PCA-IGS-SVR are better than those of IGS-SVR.},

If a developer wants to collaborate on a project, he/she will fork the repository, make modifications on the forked repository and send a pull request to the development team to ask for a merge of the code changes to the official repository. When the development team receives a pull request, the team members will review the changes and make a decision on whether to accept the changes or not. However, efficiently finding suitable pull request reviewers is a challenge. In this paper, we propose a multi-instance-based deep neural network model to recommend reviewers for pull requests. Given a pull request, our model extracts three features, which pull request title, commit message, and code change. The proposed model extracts the three features automatically from the code changes of every commit in the pull request. The features of different commits are then merged to predict the likelihood that a reviewer candidate is the appropriate reviewer. We use CNN and LSTM-network to learn features since the pull requisition and commit message feature have different structures than code change, written in a programming language. To test the effectiveness of our model, we performed a set of experiments using 43,986 pull requests extracted from 12 open-source projects. We compare our model with two baselines approaches, CoreDevRec and Majority Classes. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines. For instance, for the TensorFlow project, our model’s accuracy in determining the appropriate reviewers is 50.80\%, 74.70\%, and 84.04\%, respectively, in Top-1, Top-3, and Top-5 recommendation.},

Secondly, we propose a voting-based detection method based on physical rules, in order to detect FDIA collaboratively. This method improves the detection rate while reducing the computational cost at control center. We also make extensive experiments on real-time data that are collected from the PowerWorld simulator.

  abstract     = {Risk management is considered as a critical project management activity that needs to be performed for successful software development. Within risk management, risk prioritization is an important process which helps the software team to effectively manage the risks at early stage of the project. In agile-based software environment, it is necessary to prioritize the risks in an effective manner in order to address the risks in shorter duration of time. In recent times, swarm intelligence techniques are widely popular in solving various optimization problems in software development process. The main reason is due to its convergence accuracy toward global optimal solution and faster computational time. In this study, an efficient risk prioritization technique termed as ARP–GWO (agile risk prioritization–grey wolf optimization) has been proposed for prioritizing the risk factors present in the agile software development using grey wolf optimization (GWO). The proposed ARP–GWO method helps the organization to mitigate the risks and ensures successful delivery of software products with good quality, in lesser cost and time. The effectiveness of ARP–GWO is analyzed using two performance metrics, namely Index of Integration and Usability Goals Achievement Metric, for which case studies are performed on five industrial projects from two different organizations. The experimental results indicate that ARP–GWO is most effective in prioritization of risks and offers better enhancement with high degree of satisfaction among developers and users as compared with the existing agile process.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a passive target localization problem based on the noisy time of arrival measurements obtained from multiple receivers and a single transmitter. The maximum likelihood (ML) estimator for this localization problem is formulated as a highly nonlinear and non-convex optimization problem, where conventional optimization methods are not suitable for solving such a problem. Consequently, this paper proposes an improved adaptive hybrid firefly differential evolution (AHFADE) algorithm, based on hybridization of firefly algorithm (FA) and differential evolution (DE) algorithm to estimate the unknown position of the target. The proposed AHFADE algorithm dynamically adjusts the control parameters, thus maintaining high population diversity during the evolution process. This paper aims to improve the accuracy of the global optimal solution by incorporating evolutionary operators of the DE in different searching stages of the FA. In this regard, an adaptive parameter is employed to select an appropriate mutation operator for achieving a proper balance between global exploration and local exploitation. In order to efficiently solve the ML estimation problem, this paper proposes the well-known semidefinite programming (SDP) method to convert the non-convex problem into a convex one. The simulation results obtained from the proposed AHFADE algorithm and well-known algorithms, such as SDP, DE and FA, are compared against Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB). The statistical analysis has been performed to compare the performance of the proposed AHFADE algorithm with several well-known algorithms on CEC2014 benchmark problems. The obtained simulation results show that the proposed AHFADE algorithm is more robust in high-noise environments compared to existing algorithms.},

To analyse the key factors affecting population aging effectively and predict the development trend of population aging timely are of great significance for formulating relevant policies scientifically and reasonably, which can mitigate the effects of population aging on society. This paper analyses the current situation of population aging in Wuhan of China and discusses the main factors affecting the population aging quantitatively, and then establishes a combination prediction model to forecast the population aging trend. Firstly, considering the attribute values of the primary influence factors are multi-source heterogeneous data (the real numbers, interval numbers and fuzzy linguistic variables coexist), a two-tuple correlation coefficient analysis method is proposed to rank the importance of the influencing factors and to select the main influencing factors. Secondly, a combination prediction model named Multiple Linear Regression Analysis-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average is established to predict the number and the proportion of aging population in Wuhan. By using the statistical data of Wuhan in the past 20 years, this combination prediction model is used for empirical analysis, and a prediction result of the number and the proportion of aging people in Wuhan in the future is obtained. Based on these quantitative analysis results, we propose some countermeasures and suggestions on how to alleviate the population aging of Wuhan from aspects of economic development, pension security system design and policy formulation, which provide theoretical basis and method reference for relevant population management departments to make scientific decisions.},

In order to solve this problem, we proposed novel fine retinal vessel segmentation by combining Nest U-net and patch-learning in this study. The special extraction strategy was designed to effectively generate massive training samples including fine retinal vessels, and these samples had a great advantage in the fine retinal vessel segmentation. Nest U-net which directly fast-forwarded high-resolution feature maps from the encoder to the decoder network was designed as a new image segmentation model. This model was trained by the k-fold cross-validation strategy, and the testing samples were predicted, and the final retinal vessel was reconstructed by the sequential reconstruction strategy. This proposed method was tested on the publicly available datasets DRIVE and STARE. Sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), accuracy (ACC), area under each curve (AUC), F1-score, and jaccard similarity score (JSC) were adopted as evaluation metrics to prove the superiority of this proposed method.

A good alternative would be to plan a spatial distribution of plants, with higher number of females than males. Determining the gender of seedlings would provide important information for a possible strategy. Another common problem that researchers in this field very often face, in order to perform their experiments, is the lack of a representative database. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a new database in this work, which is composed of nuclear magnetic resonance of adult Araucaria angustifolia plants. In order to gain better insight into this database, we have tested different strategies and classifiers. A first set of experiments took three classifiers trained to discriminate males from females considering the original database. A second round of experiments applied the genetic algorithm technique to select subsets of attributes based on single-objective and two-objective functions. After analyzing the achieved results, we have also proposed a new strategy based on statistical measures for selecting subsets from the attributes. A comprehensive set of experiments has shown that the proposed selecting strategy has achieved better performances, with an accuracy of 80.3\% (AUC = 79.4). We believe that researchers will find this database a useful tool in their work on determining the Araucaria angustifolia gender. On the other hand, the proposed selecting strategy would be useful for reducing the complexity of databases and accelerating the process of building classification models.},

Recognizing emotions by facial expression is an imperative action to design control-oriented and human computer interactive applications. Facial expression recognition is probable by the motion of facial muscles resulting in the appearance variation of face features. Accurate feature extraction is one of the extreme challenges that should be scrutinized for an admirable facial expression recognition system. One of the extensive key techniques used for feature extraction mechanism in facial expression recognition is wavelet transform. The features extracted from the wavelet transform incorporate both spatial and spectral domain information which is best adequate for identifying human emotions through facial expressions. In this paper, the statistical parameters from the proposed subband selective multilevel stationary biorthogonal wavelet transform are estimated and are used as features for effective recognition of emotion. The potency of the feature extraction algorithm is boosted by calculating the mean and maximum local energy wavelet subband of stationary biorthogonal wavelet transform. SVM classifier is used for classification of emotion using the preferred chosen features. Protracted experiments with well-known database for facial expression such as JAFEE database, CK + database, FEED database, SFEW database and RAF database demonstrates a better promising results in emotion classification.},

Here, a directional mutation operator is proposed for real-coded genetic algorithm (RGA) along with a directional crossover (DX) operator to improve its performance. These evolutionary operators use directional information to guide the search process in the most promising area of the variable space. The performance of an RGA with the proposed mutation operator and directional crossover (DX) is tested on six benchmark optimization problems of different complexities, and the results are compared to that of the RGAs with five other mutation schemes. The proposed IRGA is found to outperform other RGAs in terms of accuracy in the solutions, convergence rate, and computational time, which is established firmly through statistical analysis. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed IRGA is compared to that of a few recently proposed optimization algorithms. The proposed IRGA is seen to yield the superior results compared to that of the said techniques. It is also applied to solve five constrained engineering optimization problems, where again, it has proved its supremacy. The proposed mutation scheme using directional information leads to an efficient search, and consequently, a superior performance is obtained.},

Selecting compelling multi-modality features is the core of visual question answering. In multi-modal learning, the attention network provides an effective way that selectively utilizes the given visual information. However, the internal relationship of modalities is often ignored in VQA, and most previous models focus on the relationship between visual and language features. To address such an issue: (1) we propose a cross-modality co-attention networks (CMCN) framework, such a network framework aims to help in learning both intra-modality and cross-modality relationships. (2) Cross-modality co-attention (CMC) module is the core of the whole network framework, composed of self-attention blocks and guided-attention blocks. The self-attention block learns the relations of intra-modalities, while the guided-attention block models cross-modal interactions between an image and a question. The cascaded network of multiple CMC modules not only improves the fusion of visual and language representations, but also captures more representative image and text information. (3) To prove that the proposed model can improve the results to some extent, we have carried out a thorough experimental verification. Experimental evaluations on the VQA 2.0 dataset confirm that the CMCN has significant performance advantages over existing methods.},

  abstract     = {In previous studies, customer survey data were commonly adopted to perform the modelling of customer satisfaction (CS). However, it could be time-consuming to conduct surveys and obtain their data. On the other hand, respondents’ responses are quite often confined by preset questions. Nowadays, a huge number of customer online reviews on products can be found on various websites. The reviews can be extracted easily in a very short time. Customers can freely express their concerns and views of products in their online reviews. Those reviews provide a valuable source of information for manufacturers to improve their existing products and develop their new products. Previous studies have attempted to develop CS models based on survey data by using various computational intelligence techniques. However, no attempt at developing explicit CS models based on online reviews was reported in the literature. In this paper, a methodology for the modelling of CS based on customer online reviews and a multigene genetic programming-based fuzzy regression (MGGP-FR) approach is proposed. In the proposed methodology, relevant textual reviews of products are extracted from e-commerce websites. Then, opinion mining is conducted on the reviews and sentiments scores of customer concerns are derived. A MGGP-FR approach is then introduced to develop CS models based on the derived sentiment scores. A case study on developing CS models for electronic hairdryers is conducted to illustrate the proposed methodology and validate the effectiveness of MGGP-FR in the modelling of CS. The validation results show MGGP-FR outperforms the other three modelling approaches, fuzzy regression, genetic programming, and genetic programming-based fuzzy regression, in the CS modelling in terms of prediction accuracy.},

The advanced object detection models are mainly data driven, which depend on large-scale databases. The well-labeled datasets have proved to be of profound value for the effectiveness and accuracy in various object detection tasks. Thus, the first step of detecting UAVs is to build up a dataset of UAVs. In this study, we collect and release a dataset for UAV detection, called UAVData. To maintain the universality and robustness of the trained models, balloons and 6 types of UAVs are recorded in the dataset which totally consists of 13,803 well-labeled and recognizable images. We further conduct strong benchmarks using several advanced deep detection models, including faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLOv3. In addition, we utilize 4 different convolutional neural network models as the backbone models of these object detection methods to learn UAV-related features in images. By providing this dataset and baselines, we hope to gather researchers in both UAVs detection and machine learning field to advance toward the application.},

This study provides two multi-criteria decision-making methods for comparison and selecting the optimal SRGM for a particular dataset.

Researchers have proposed some schemes of hybrid user similarity and applied them to recommendation systems (RSs). However, hybrid user similarity measures suffer from a time-consuming issue when searching neighbor users using these schemes. To solve the issue, this paper proposes a fast neighbor user searching (FNUS) method for NBCF with hybrid user similarity schemes. FNUS first generates three item subspaces: interested item, neither interested nor uninterested (NINU) item, and uninterested item subspaces. In these subspaces, we calculate co-rated item numbers between a target user and other users and then use these numbers to find three subsets of neighbor users for the target user. The final neighbor user set is obtained by finding the union of the three neighbor user subsets. As the calculation of co-rated item numbers is much simpler than that of hybrid user similarity, FNUS can fast search neighbor users. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed method can greatly improve the performance of RSs.},

The cryptographic techniques based on chaos theory reveal some novel and effectual orders to develop secure image encryption approaches. Images are the most attractive kinds of data in the encryption domain. In current years, the chaos-based cryptographic techniques have provided an efficient way to expand secure image encryption frameworks. This proposal temps to develop an optimized HCM for promoting novel image encryption. The proposed image encryption model involves 4 steps, such as image pre-processing, key generation, image encryption using optimized HCM, and image decryption. In the pre-processing, the RGB image is converted into a grayscale image, and the key is generated by the SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm. Further, the encryption of the image is performed by HCM with the integration of 2DLCM, and PWLCM. While hybridizing the two chaotic maps for image encryption, parameter tuning or optimization is performed for improving its performance. Moreover, Information entropy is considered as the objective model that has to be maximized while tuning the parameters, and the maximum value of information entropy will mean the best performance. An improvement in the well-known optimization algorithms termed as CI-WOA is adopted for performing the parameter optimization of HCM. Hence, the optimized HCM-based image encryption can be confirmed as an efficient and secure way for all types of image transmissions.},

To improve these performances, an improved differential evolution algorithm with neighborhood mutation operators and opposition-based learning, namely NBOLDE, is developed in this paper. In the proposed NBOLDE, the new evaluation parameters and weight factors are introduced into the neighborhood model to propose a new neighborhood strategy. On this basis, a new neighborhood mutation strategy based on DE/current-to-best/1, namely DE/neighbor-to-neighbor/1, is designed in order to replace large-scale global mutation by local neighborhood mutation with high search efficiency. Then, a generalized opposition-based learning is employed to optimize the initial population and select the better solution between the current solution and reverse solution in order to approximate global optimal solution, which can amend the convergence direction, accelerate convergence, improve efficiency, enhance the stability and avoid premature convergence. Finally, the proposed NBOLDE is compared with four state-of-the-art DE variants by 12 benchmark functions with low-dimension and high-dimension. The experiment results indicate that the proposed NBOLDE has a faster convergence speed, higher convergence accuracy, and better optimization capabilities in solving high-dimensional complex functions.},

Therefore, we need to compute the critical normal form coefficients to verify the non-degeneracy of the listed bifurcations. Using the critical normal form coefficients method to examine the bifurcation analysis makes it avoid calculating the central manifold and converting the linear part of the map into Jordan form. This is one of the most effective methods in the bifurcation analysis that has not received much attention so far. So in this article, we turn our attention to this method. In this study, the dynamic behaviors of the discrete Bonhoeffer–van der Pol (BVP) model are discussed. It is shown that the BVP model undergoes codimension one (codim-1) bifurcations such as pitchfork, fold, flip (period doubling) and Neimark–Sacker. Besides, codimension two (codim-2) bifurcations including resonance 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 and Chenciner have been achieved. For each bifurcation, normal form coefficients along with its scenario are investigated thoroughly. Bifurcation curves of the fixed points are drawn with the aid of numerical continuation techniques. Besides, a numerical continuation not only confirms our analytical results but also reveals richer dynamics of the model especially in the higher iteration.},

In this paper, the VMs consolidation is abstracted to two-dimensional bin-packing problem and also is formulated to an integer linear programming. Since the papers in the literature scarcely are aware of skewness in resources of requested VMs and for discrete nature of search space, this paper presents the resource skewness-aware VMs consolidation algorithm based on improved thermodynamic simulated annealing approach because resource skewness potentially compels the algorithm to activate additional servers. The proposed SA-based algorithm is validated in extensive scenarios with different resource skewness in comparison with two heuristics and two meta-heuristics. The average results reported from different scenarios proves superiority of proposed algorithm in comparison with other approaches in terms of the number of used servers, TPC, and total resource wastage of datacenter.},

However, there remain technical challenges to explain the mechanism of the accumulative sum operator in nonlinear grey modelling process and estimate structural parameters independent from the initial values. This paper aims to reconstruct the modelling process of the NGBM model so as to explain the modelling mechanism better by utilizing the integral matching approach, which consists of an integral formula and the numerical discretization-based least squares. First, the integral formula is employed to investigate the accumulative sum operator and further reconstruct the NGBM model to a generalized form, referred as to INGBM model. Then, a novel parameter estimation strategy, estimating structure parameters and initial values simultaneously, is developed by utilizing the numerical discretization-based least squares approach. Next, Monte Carlo simulation studies are designed to evaluate the finite sample performance of both models. Comparisons show that the INGBM model outperforms to the original one in terms of parameter estimation accuracy, forecasting accuracy and robustness to noise. Finally, we apply the INGBM model at a coal consumption in China study to further illustrate the usefulness of this model.},

Despite the advantages of multi-cloud environments, there are always some security risks that mostly threaten the cloud consumers’ data, which makes the identification of suitable services a challenging task. In this work, we propose a security-aware multi-cloud service composition approach using fuzzy formal concept analysis (fuzzy FCA) and rough set theory (RS), which are two techniques with a strong mathematical background. To guarantee a high security level of the hosting clouds and the selected services, we exploit the fuzzy relations of fuzzy FCA and the approximation of RS. These techniques will help reducing the search space, by eliminating the disqualified clouds and insecure services.

  abstract     = {Financial forecasting using computational intelligence nowadays remains a hot topic. Recent improvements in deep neural networks allow us to predict financial market behavior better than traditional machine learning approaches. In this paper, we propose three novel deep learning-based financial forecasting frameworks, all of which considerably outperform existing approaches, yielding a much better annual financial return on DOW-30 stocks and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) tested between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2016. The first framework Convolutional Neural Networks with Technical Indicator Clustering (CNN-TIC) creates images with multiple channels corresponding to the technical indicator clusters and employs the take profit and stop loss techniques to obtain a superior annual financial return. The second model Evolutionary Optimized CNN-TIC (EO-CNN-TIC) computes the optimal values in the take profit and stop loss techniques using one of the recently created evolutionary optimization algorithms, Cuckoo Search. Finally, the third model Residual Network with Technical Analysis (ResNet-TA) applies residual blocks to the convolutional part of the neural network architecture to extract more useful features from deeper layers. Both CNN-TIC and EO-CNN-TIC are based on clustering the technical indicators by their similarity in behavior and creating separate five distinct images based on the five clusters, while ResNet-TA takes advantage of going deeper in the network with residual blocks. All three models further improve their performances by hyperparameter tuning. On DOW-30 stocks, we were able to achieve annual returns of 20.45\% , 29.54\% , and 36.70\% for CNN-TIC, EO-CNN-TIC, and ResNet-TA, whereas for ETFs, 16.56\% , 19.20\% , and 32.09\% annual returns were observed, respectively. We conclude with future work that can be done in order to further improve the computational and financial performances of the models.},

This paper emphasizes utilizing the LIPM plus flywheel model (LIPPFM) for analysis of the complete dynamic motion of the humanoid robot. Inclining toward a more realistic case, the model is improvised to remove the COM’s height constraint (center of mass) and consider the effect of the upper body part using the mass of the pendulum. Furthermore, the double support phase is being discussed in the locomotion phase of the humanoid robot. MPC (model predictive control) approach has been used in this paper, which is tuned with the ACO (ant colony optimization) technique. The desired trajectory, joint angles, has been imparted to the MPC, which provides the robot’s joint motion. This joint motion has been further transferred to ACO, optimizing the step adjustment and providing an expected trajectory to walk over an uneven surface. The simulation has been carried out in an uneven environment based on ACO tuned MPC controller, and further, it has been validated using real-time experiments on humanoid robot NAO. The controller shows a reasonable degree of efficiency in both the real NAO and simulated NAO with a deviation under 5\%. The comparative study among various controller shows that the proposed controller lowers the peak overshoot and the settling time. In comparison with the previously developed controller, the deviation in roll angle and pitch angle justifies the selection of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {One important task of analyzing remote sensing satellite imagery is to categorize the pixels according to various landcover regions. This unsupervised segmentation task can be posed as a problem of pixel intensity clustering, considering the different spectral bands as different features. Due to the presence of noise and overlapping clusters present in remote sensing images, fuzzy clustering is popularly applied for the segmentation task. However, fuzzy C-means like fuzzy clustering algorithms suffer from random initialization that often causes them to get stuck into some local optimum results. In this article, a game theory-motivated approach based on Shapley value to initialize the cluster centers for FCM clustering has been adopted which provides more stability and improved performance. The proposed method explores and exploits the advantages of both game theory and fuzzy technique for pixel classification. The superiority of the approach has been demonstrated over a numeric satellite image data set as well as different real-life remote sensing satellite images both visually and numerically with statistical support. The results have been compared with several popular centroid-based clustering techniques, viz. K-means, K-means++, fuzzy C-means (FCM) and probabilistic FCM, using $$J_m$$ and I indexes as well as visual cluster plots.},

Because the roaming environments are very complex, the planning path of the intelligent camera should meet other constraint conditions in addition to the path length constraint and the obstacle-free constraint. In this study, a new fitness function was developed in the genetic algorithm, which can consider the constraint conditions in terms of free obstacle, path length, path smoothness, and the visibility of the objective of interest in advance during the camera roaming. In addition, a new evolving operator was introduced into the genetic algorithm, so that the number of iteration can be significantly reduced, and thus, the efficiency of the genetic algorithm can be improved. Experimental results show that the proposed genetic algorithm can obtain a high-quality path under multi-constraint conditions for intelligent camera with less numbers of iteration as compared with several conventional methods.},

We conclude from the comparison and sensitive analysis that the proposed decision-making method is more effective and reliable than other existing models.},

  abstract     = {To realize an accurate and efficient route planning for ships in a complex marine environment, the novel double ant colony algorithm (NDACA) based on dynamic feedback is proposed in this work. The planning process to identify the lowest energy consumption route is used as an example to introduce the applications of the proposed algorithm. First, the energy consumption model is established by analyzing the ship&#39;s motion, which is used in the pheromone updating strategy. Next, based on the energy consumption information of the route, the ant colony is divided into exploratory and optimized ants. Using a closed-loop feedback strategy, the number of ants in each colony is continuously adjusted, which ensures the solution quality and speed of convergence of the algorithm. Simulations in the working attribute environment show that NDACA has an all-round good performance. Compared with other algorithms, NDACA can plan a more energy-saving route while considering the influence of marine environmental factors, which has great practical significance for ship operations management.},

It is a difficult and hot topic in dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to accurately predict the direction of population movement after environmental changes. In this paper, the ensemble Kalman filter is introduced into dynamic multi-objective optimization problems to predict the population center point after environmental changes. ensemble Kalman filter is a four-dimensional assimilation method that uses Monte Carlo short-term ensemble prediction method to estimate the prediction error covariance and has achieved great success in many fields. In the proposed algorithm, the new population center point is predicted by the ensemble Kalman filter prediction model according to the historical population information when the environment changes, and then the population is reinitialized according to the predicted population center point. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to other comparison strategies in most test instances.},

  abstract     = {Disease prediction and classification play a significant role in clinical informatics for analyzing the risk in a specified region. The objective is to assess and evaluate the features that correspond to coronary heart disease (CHD). The proposed model developed using weighted ranked correlation and regression along with data classification techniques—medical records corresponding to CHD patients for normal and abnormal cases used for experimentation. The findings have noticed concerning the variations in the plane, residuals and coefficients of lower order. The weighted factor makes the violation of error estimates, which considered being the process of heteroscedasticity. The features corresponding to the marginal distributions eliminated, and the expected values were calculated in a linear relation. For the values with Spearman’s correlation, the value was found to be higher and perfect for the features selected. From the chosen set of features, data classification has made, and the measurement was observed using accuracy, precision, recall, kappa statistics and RMS error. From the experimental results, Gaussian Bayesian and neural network classifier performs well with the determination of dominant risk such as exang, cholesterol levels, and chest pain type. The adherent risk factors identified are thalach, prior stroke, and family history. Validation and efficacy of the predicted risk factors made using Fisher’s F-statistic test, which then proved that the identified risk factors found to be significant with Pvalue &lt; 0.001. The interpretation of the model by medical experts conveys that the risk level prediction and its predominance, for a specific region, can be identified and assessed for non-communicable disease.},

The delay in the filtering system is supposed to be random. The interim and parameter uncertainties are measured with a linear fractional transformation structure. Furthermore, another intention of this article is to establish the filters containing network communication delays with uncertainties under the sensor fault. To construct the fuzzy singular filters with these considerations, a new version of fuzzy Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is implemented for the performance and stability analysis of the resultant error. Linear matrix inequalities characterize original stability conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by an example of the DC motor application.},

These OWA operators due to their versatility are very useful to model many real world situations. Several extensions of OWA operators are presented in the literature which can handle a situation with uncertainty. Although many queuing models have been proposed in numerous healthcare studies, the inclusion of OWA operators is still rare. In this research study, we propose a novel method using the uncertain generalized ordered weighted average and illustrate its application to the uncertain queue modeling in a hospital emergency room; where incoming flux of patients and the required level of service for each patient is unknown and uncertain. The model with multilateral decision making process has been described which will provide several alternatives to decision makers to select the best alternative for their challenging situations. The proposed method has resulted an improved performance of the queuing system, increased customer satisfaction as well as a significant reduction in the operational cost. This study will enable decision makers to operate a flexible and cost-effective system in the event of uncertainty, uncontrollable and unpredicted situations.},

In the article, the influence of uncertainties represented by the lack of knowledge of initial disease cases and the change of the contacts network by a rewiring process on the vaccination optimization is studied. Results of experiments show that evolutionary optimization of vaccinations can outperform vaccination strategies when enough information is provided. When many disease cases remain unknown or when the changes in the contacts network are large, the performance of the optimization algorithm is adversely affected.

  abstract     = {Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is a multidisciplinary team-based reliability analysis tool used in a wide range of industries. However, the conventional FMEA technique has been criticized for some important deficiencies regarding risk assessments, the weights of experts and risk factors, and risk priority. Although numerous fuzzy-based modified FMEA models have been developed to improve the classical FMEA, the previous approaches lack the ability to handle internal and external uncertainties simultaneously, and they rely on extra assumptions. Hence, this study develops a novel integrated FMEA model, which can manipulate various uncertainties and unknown weights of experts and risk factors and contains more risk factors. In this model, a combination of intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) and rough number theory, namely intuitionistic fuzzy rough numbers, is developed to handle internal and external uncertainties of risk assessments, where IFS is used to deal with internal uncertainty, and rough number theory is employed to handle external uncertainty. Then, experts and risk factors’ overall weights involving in the FMEA technique are calculated by considering both subjective and objective aspects. In addition, a two-tier structural model containing seven risk factors is established to capture the risk information of failures more comprehensively. Finally, three practical cases to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed FMEA method are presented along with several comparisons to existing approaches. The results demonstrate that the developed method enhanced the results in terms of precise risk assessment and rational failure rankings. Additionally, its performance is superior or at least significantly compared with the original RPN, fuzzy set, intuitionistic fuzzy set, or rough number-FMEA methods.},

Firstly, in this model, the linear transformation operator of interval number is used to normalize the original decision information, and the positive and negative clouts of interval number are designed. Secondly, after the space projection distance between each scheme and the positive and negative clouts is considered comprehensively, the off-target distance is taken as the basis of vector analysis in space to obtain a new comprehensive off-target distance. The existing interval number grey target decision-making model ignores the important influence of interval distribution and the correlation between the attributes in scheme evaluation, and there are some fuzzy errors when setting the weight of attributes. In order to solve the above problems, this paper combined with the uncertainty analysis of the attribute weights, a goal programming is constructed for the objective function based on the comprehensive off-target distance minimization to solve the attribute weight vector, and finally determine the order of the scheme. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed grey target decision model are verified by an example of venture capital projects.

  abstract     = {The training of stacked auto-encoders (SAEs) consists of an unsupervised layer-wise pre-training and a supervised fine-tuning training. The unsupervised pre-training greedily learns internal data representations, initializes network connection weights and brings high generalization. But in the condition that the saliencies of input data are different, the unsupervised pre-training will preserve unimportant contents, lose useful contents and degrade the performance of SAE. In the light of the problem, an iterative stacked weighted auto-encoder (ISWAE) is proposed. To provide robust and discriminative data representations in the unsupervised pre-training, SAE data weighting is embedded in the SAE network by combining the weighting with data reconstruction in an iterative approach. The SAE weights reflect the global saliencies of input data, which are evaluated through transforming implicit weights to explicit weights based on a trained SAE. The weights gained from the current trained SAE are fed into the next SAE through a weighted data reconstruction function. Further, two iterations can yield satisfactory results and an ISWAE is simplified to a two-iteration stacked weighted auto-encoder. Experiments are carried out on MNIST database, CIFAR-10 database and UCI repository. The results show that ISWAE is superior to state-of-art methods: the classification accuracies of ISWAE are in the first place on the chosen data sets; the iterative SAE weighting can be combined with other SAE variant models, producing higher-performance models; it can effectively resolve the problem of data weighting, feasibly to implement without the need of extra coefficients; its computation complexity is controllable, twice that of SAE.},

According to the stability criterion, the selection range of reservoir parameters of DFO-ESN can be expanded, such that we can build the DFO-ESN without considering the initial conditions. For the candidate discrete-time Lyapunov function, it is shown that the reservoir states of DFO-ESN are asymptotically stable when time tends to infinity. Finally, two examples demonstrate the feasibility of stability criterion and the learning performance of DFO-ESN.},

  abstract     = {Multi-parent crossover algorithms (MCAs) are widely used in solving optimization problems in many fields relying on encoding, crossover, variation and choice operators to produce iterative offspring chromosome. In this paper, a real-coded schema to support this genetic optimization process is considered. At each crossover stage, a linear combination of coefficients at the same scale hybridizes a fixed number of parent chromosomes. If parent chromosomes are iteratively selected, then coefficients will indicate these parent chromosomes: how to propagate. Essentially, all MCAs differentiate one algorithm from others through coefficient restriction. However, little work exists on analyzing techniques that efficiently create within-bound coefficients. The existing MCAs build coefficients following a uniform distribution, but at the same time, these coefficients violate constraints, thus propagating error. The error will cascade exponentially as the hybrid scale rises even slightly, leading to increased time consumption. To address this problem, an empirical distribution-based framework (EDBF) is proposed which takes multiple MCAs as its constituent members. Numerical results showed that proposed EDBF outperforms its members in terms of time consumption. As a general framework rather than a specific algorithm, EDBF is easy to implement and can easily accommodate any existing MCA.},

  abstract     = {Aquifer parameters are the important factors for assessing groundwater potential in any area. Yet estimation of aquifer parameters is expensive and time-consuming. This study proposes an optimal and improved model to make a quantitative and qualitative correlation between pumping test data set and aquifer parameters by integration of artificial neural network training algorithms and the supervised committee machine concept. This supervised committee machine with training algorithms (SCMTA) combines Levenberg–Marquardt (LM), Bayesian regularization (BR), gradient descent (GD), one-step secant (OSS) and resilient back-propagation (RP) algorithms using a supervised combiner to estimate non-leaky confined aquifer parameters using pumping test data set. Each of these algorithms has a weight factor showing its contribution in overall prediction. The results reveal that RP, BR and LM have more contribution than OSS and GD. The developed SCMTA model trained with 2000 training sets of the Theis well function and tested with 800 sets of synthetic time-drawdown generated from the aquifers parameters. In situ observation data from the time-drawdown at station Katasbes in Shiraz plain, Southwest of Iran, are further adopted to test the applicability and reliability of the proposed method. The results of this study suggest that the SCMTA model performs better than the individual artificial neural networks differing in training algorithms, the simple averaging and weighted averaging committee machine methods and the type-curve matching technique. Additionally, results indicate that the SCMTA method corrects the concept of the superimposed plot by applying a supervised combiner to determine the optimal match point and estimate aquifer parameters more precisely. The proposed SCMTA method is recommended as an alternative to the type-curve graphical method and the existing ANN approaches.},

Then, we introduce the symmetric cross-entropy of hesitant fuzzy soft sets considering the relative entropy. In addition, we provide the axiomatic definitions of the similarity measure and entropy of hesitant fuzzy soft sets. Meanwhile, we develop a novel similarity measure and an entropy formula of hesitant fuzzy soft sets by using the concept of the symmetric cross-entropy. Furthermore, we present two different decision-making methods for multi-attribute decision making and multi-attribute group decision making where multi-attribute index information is described by hesitant fuzzy soft sets. Finally, practical examples are presented in order to illustrate the validity and practicability of the similarity measure and entropy.

The uncertain and dynamic nature of the real-time scenario imposes a challenge for the autonomous systems to navigate in the environment, avoiding collision with the moving obstacles without compromising on the energy-time trade-off. Motivated by this challenge, an efficient gain-based dynamic green ant colony optimization (GDGACO) metaheuristic has been proposed in this paper. The energy consumption while path planning in a dynamic scenario will be humongous owing to its nature. The proposed algorithm reduces the total energy consumed during path planning through an efficient gain function-based pheromone enhancement mechanism. The memory efficiency of Octrees is incorporated for workspace representation because of its ability to map large 3D environments to limited memory. Comprehensive simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of GDGACO. Results are analysed through comparison with other methods in terms of path length, computation time, and energy consumed. Also, the results are verified for statistical significance.},

Volatile cases commonly were studied by using pre-known information in which fuzzy theory or probability theory was applied. In the absence of knowledge for probability and fuzzy theories, it is possible to use an expert’s belief degrees for modeling. For such cases, uncertainty theory can be applied which was introduced by Liu (Uncertainty theory, Springer, Berlin, 2007). In this study, a basic two-stage model was extended to consider uncertain conditions. Several theorems were presented to discuss some features of the introduced model.

  abstract     = {Identifying the critical risk factors in train accidents play a vital role in the prevention of their recurrence in the future. However, this is a complex procedure due to the fact that it includes decision making and depends on a large number of relevant factors. In order to resolve this problem, first, this study made an effort to identify the risk factors in the collision of two passenger trains near the “Haft Khan Station” between Semnan and Damghan using the interview technique and the questionnaire survey technique which focused on railway industry experts’ opinions and treated them as decision makers. Second, it developed a new framework of risk assessment by prioritizing the identified risk factors in the collision of two passenger trains in order to remedy all of the deficiencies and to improve the safety of railway transportation. Therefore, risk assessment of contributory factors in the collision was based on multi-criteria decision-making approaches such as fuzzy complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) and fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). Accordingly, the study prioritized the risk factors in the collision of two passenger trains including management, individual and environmental conditions, and reaction to events regarding Fuzzy COPRAS and Fuzzy DEMATEL. Finally, sensitivity analysis indicated that the fuzzy DEMATEL had a better performance than the fuzzy COPRAS method. More specifically, it: (a) prioritized the risk factors in a better way due to its higher Spearman’s ranking correlation coefficient; (b) facilitated the cause-effect analysis; and (c) was in line with the real collected observation data. In regard to Fuzzy DEMATEL model, the results showed that the critical risk factor with the highest rank was the stop of the front train at the back of the hill. Moreover, the critical risk factor with the lowest rank was the absence of the installation of the Balise system.},

In MIMO channel allocation, it is found that utilization of resources tends to be a dangerous issue which could be tackled by identifying secondary users in addition to primary user for disseminating the information. This paper focuses on allocating the dynamic channels effectively by applying a centralized heuristic algorithm which is referred as cuckoo search with improved elephant herding optimization. In the previous approach, poor resource allocation causes desperate issue in MIMO channel allocation while calculating the energy of each user available in the network. Substance near multicast protocol has been applied for optimizing the energy along with elephant herding optimization algorithm in order to allocate channels dynamically for global optimization process. An improved elephant herding optimization algorithm for multiuser MIMO framework is integrated in the overall remote region.

We are aware that the source domain can also be involved in the training process and promote the matching to the data distribution in the target domain. In this paper, we present a novel adversarial network for unpaired image-to-image translation, adopting one generator and two discriminators. With the constraint of our newly introduced adversarial loss, one of the discriminators targets at matching the model distribution to the target domain distribution, while the other one pushes the model distribution away from the source domain distribution, thus boosting the whole model learning efficiency. Experiments show that our proposed GAN loss can replace the vanilla GAN loss, which has been used in many state-of-the-art methods for image-to-image translation. Moreover, compared to vanilla GAN, the framework of our GAN can contribute to a better translation result.},

  abstract     = {5G ultra-dense network (UDN) systems consist of massive deployment of small cells. This technology allows increasing spectral efficiency and solving the spectrum scarcity problem. However, as small cell count increases, the probability of severe interference increases, causing a network capacity degradation. The resource allocation (RA) algorithms distribute the available spectrum resources with the least interference. It is modeled as an optimization problem, and allocating the different resources results exceedingly complex. In this work, a new design approach for RA is proposed. The strategy is based on allocating a single block of channels to either users or cells instead of disjoint channels across the available spectrum. We call them user block allocation and cell block allocation, respectively. They consider a filtered search space of channel allocations providing two-dimensionality reduction levels to the channel allocation problem. The scenario evaluation consists of an unplanned UDN and a uniform small cell deployment, where at least one active user is present for each cell. The results obtained through the genetic algorithm solution on the network’s spectral efficiency, cell’s average capacity, and subchannel allocation rate show that the proposed arrangements alleviate the high complexity of the channel allocation problem and find feasible solutions for UDN scenarios.},

This group is pivotal in our paper. Circulant intuitionistic fuzzy matrices is defined also in this paper via the group $$ (I_{n} , * ) $$ as a new way for defining circulant matrices. However, we study and investigate several properties of circulant intuitionistic fuzzy matrices. The first row (column) of a circulant matrix plays an important role in our studying. From any intuitionistic fuzzy matrix R (not necessarily circulant) we can construct two circulant intuitionistic fuzzy matrices $$ R_{L} $$ and $$ R_{U} $$ such that $$ R_{L} \le R \le R_{U} $$ . We also show that some compositions of circulant intuitionistic fuzzy matrices are also circulant. Moreover, we proved that $$ RS = SR $$ for two circulant intuitionistic fuzzy matrices $$ R $$ and $$ S $$ . However, we give some examples to clarify our results.},

  abstract     = {The extended belief rule-based (EBRB) system is an enhancement of the traditional belief rule-based (BRB) system, which extends the belief distribution of the antecedent attributes. Compared with BRB system, EBRB system has stronger knowledge expression ability. EBRB system uses relational data to generate rules based on traditional belief rule base, which is simple and effective. However, EBRB system needs to traverse all the rules in the rule base and has the problems of inefficiency and inconsistency. Although the existing search optimization methods can solve this problem to some extent, they generally have the shortcomings of insufficient generalization ability. In view of this, this paper proposes a new rule search optimization algorithm based on K-means clustering tree (KMT-EBRB). By combining with the bagging algorithm, an EBRB system based on random clustering forest (RKMF-EBRB) is implemented. To evaluate the performance of the developed model, this paper chooses 12 common UCI datasets for two groups of experiments. Firstly, the properties of EBRB system based on K-means tree and K-means forest are studied, and then the new method is compared with existing methods. The experimental results show that K-means tree can improve the search efficiency of EBRB system, while random K-means clustering forest can further improve the accuracy and stability of EBRB reasoning.},

By adopting a suitable harmonic elimination technique, the MLI produces stepped sinusoidal waveforms with reduced total harmonic distortion (THD) without using any filter-based applications. MLI will be an apt choice for industries operating under medium- and high-power alternating current (AC) drives, and this finds application in interfacing non-conventional energy sources with power grid lines. This paper emphasizes a novel design of performance-enhanced cascaded MLI (PEC-MLI) with less quantity of switching devices for renewable energy system. The desired switching of MLI cost function is calculated using Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the appraised firing angle is calculated and the same is given as input to the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique coded with chosen Nearest Voltage Level (NVL) control scheme. The gating signals generated for switching devices with the control strategies of NVL—PWM and hybrid PWM techniques using Genetic Algorithm. The MATLAB/Simulink model successfully evaluates the performance of proposed MLI. The simulated results analyze the system efficiency by comparing it with other similar MLI configuration cited in recent research articles.

  abstract     = {Heart disease prevention is one of the most important tasks for healthcare problems since more than 50 million people around the world are at the risk of cardiovascular disease. Traditionally, electrocardiography (ECG) signals play an important role in the diagnosis of cardiac disorder and arrhythmia detection since they reflect all the electrical activities of the heart. In the present study, we propose a novel technique for automatic detection of cardiac arrhythmia with one-lead ECG signals based upon tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT), variational mode decomposition (VMD), phase space reconstruction (PSR), and neural networks. First, ECG signals are decomposed into a set of frequency sub-bands with a number of decomposition levels by using the TQWT method without any preprocessing of QRS detection. Second, VMD is employed to decompose the sub-band of ECG signals into different intrinsic modes, in which the first four intrinsic modes contain the majority of the ECG signals’ energy and are considered to be the predominant intrinsic modes. They are selected to construct the reference variable for analysis. Third, phase space of the reference variable is reconstructed, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear ECG system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrates significant difference in ECG system dynamics between normal versus abnormal individual heartbeats. Fourth, neural networks are then used to model, identify and classify ECG system dynamics between normal (healthy) and arrhythmia ECG signals. Finally, experiments are carried out on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, in which 436 ECG signal fragments for one lead (MLII) from 28 persons of five classes of heart beats were extracted. By using the tenfold cross-validation style, the achieved average classification accuracy is reported to be 98.72\%. Compared with various state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance and has the potential to serve as a candidate for the automatic detection of myocardial dysfunction in the clinical application.},

So, lots of efforts are put to recognize handwritten words using efficient classifiers based on extracted features that rely on the visual appearance of the handwritten text. Due to numerous real-time applications, handwritten word recognition is an important research area which is seeking a lot of attention from researchers for the last 10 years. In this article, the authors have proposed a holistic approach and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) technique to recognize offline handwritten Gurumukhi words. In this direction, four state-of-the-art features like zoning, diagonal, intersection &amp; open-end points and peak extent features have been considered to extract discriminant features from the handwritten word digital images. The proposed approach is evaluated on a public benchmark dataset of Gurumukhi script that comprises 40,000 samples of handwritten words. Based on extracted features, the words are classified into one of the 100 classes based on XGBoost technique. Effectiveness of the system is assessed based on several evaluation parameters like CPU elapsed time, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and area under curve (AUC). XGBoost technique attained the best results of accuracy (91.66\%), recall (91.66\%), precision (91.39\%), F1-score (91.14\%) and AUC (95.66\%) using zoning features based on 90\% data as the training set and remaining 10\% data as the testing set. The comparison of the proposed approach with the existing approaches has also been done which reveals the significance of the XGBoost technique comparatively.},

Current sentimental analysis approaches focus only on the upward and downward movement of the price, which is not sufficient for more precise prediction of stock sentiments. Previous studies have focused on the trend (valence) regarding stocks because it represents the upward and downward trend of a stock. However, investors should be attention on trading (arousal) because the stock price increases or decreases even quickly or slowly; they may not to do trade. Therefore, this paper applies the concept of dimensional valence–arousal to define sentiments which intensities of trading and trends of the stock market for data annotation. The paper proposes a deep learning prediction model to predict the intensities of stock dimensional valence–arousal (SDVA), called the hierarchical title–keyword-based attentional hybrid network (HAHTKN).

Using a combination of Shi-Tomasi, SIFT and SURF features, the authors have achieved a recognition accuracy of 85.9\%, 80.8\% and 74.8\% with random forest, decision tree and K-NN classifier, respectively. In this paper, the authors have also computed true positive rate, false positive rate and area under curve in all cases. Finally, the authors have applied the adaptive boosting methodology to improve the recognition accuracy. Authors have reported improved recognition accuracy of 86.4\% using adaptive boosting with random forest classifier and a combination of Shi-Tomasi, SIFT and SURF features.},

  abstract     = {Clustering is considered to be the most significant method for resolving conflicts of data transmission and maximizing the life span of the network in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The sensor nodes are densely deployed to satisfy the coverage requirement; this causes some nodes to lazy mode. Some algorithms of cluster heads (CHs) selection were already proposed for sufficient energy management. However, it remains as a challenging task in WSN due to network scalability, protocol characteristics, and data transfer rate. This paper aims to propose a novel clustering model is proposed by this research work for cluster head selection (CHS) that considers four primary constraints: namely energy consumption, delay, distance, and security. In addition, for optimal selection of CH, a novel algorithm, which is the hybridization of the Dragon Fly (DA) algorithm and firefly algorithm, is proposed. The proposed hybrid algorithm is named as FireFly replaced Position Update in Dragonfly (FPU-DA). The performance of the proposed work is compared with conventional algorithms. Subsequently, a parametric analysis is performed by varying the weight factor of the proposed FPU-DA model to investigate its impact on the performance of the CHS problem. The proposed FPU-DA model at round 2000 shows 9\%, better than KNN and SOM. Thus, the analysis results proved that the proposed model attains a better life span when compared to that of other conventional models.},

The complementary information can not only compensate the limitations of each image effectively, but also enhance visual effect to human eyes. To preserve structure information and perform detailed information of each source multi-modality image, a novel fusion framework with two-scale image reconstruction is proposed. In the proposal, an improved guided image filtering (GIF)-based weighted average via Gabor energy is put forward for the fusion of base layers contained large scale structure information, and a sparse representation-based separable dictionary learning is recommended to capture small scale detailed information of detail layers. Finally, according to the texture enhancement fusion rule, the fused base and detail layers are integrated to obtain the fusion image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits significant performance than the basic GIF algorithm, and also outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of better edge texture clarity. Moreover, the fusion results show abundant information and better visual effect.},

The efficiency of an access procedure is exposed using the methodological evaluation which supports the deep facts of fetal ECG which gives useful data. In this survey, research-revealed methods to extract the FECG signals are reviewed. The use of an adaptive filter in the abdominal ECG signal provides an efficient and effective mode of FECG signal extraction. Similarly, the effectiveness of the FECG extraction can be improved through different methodologies. In this document, the most modern investigations related to the FECG extraction are effectively analyzed and briefed on so as to effectively furnish the traits and classifications. The performance of each FECG extraction technique is confirmed quantitatively by working out SNR and PRD.

The existing state-of-the-art algorithm, AutoGAN, is an example in discovering GAN’s architecture using reinforcement learning (RL)-based NAS. However, performance differences between the candidate architectures are not taken into consideration. In this paper, one new ImprovedAutoGAN algorithm based on AutoGAN is proposed. We found that which candidate architectures to use can affect the performance of the final network. So in the process of architecture search, compared with AutoGAN, in which candidate architectures are selected randomly, our method uses gradient bandit algorithm to increase the probability of selecting networks with better performance. This paper also introduces a temperature coefficient in the algorithm to prevent the search results from getting trapped in the local optimum. The GANs are searched using the same search space as AutoGAN, and the discovered GAN has a Frechet inception distance (FID) score of 11.60 on CIFAR-10, reaching the best level in the current RL-based NAS methods. Experiments also show that the transferability of this GAN is satisfying.},

However, these have also opened new avenues for malicious and unauthorized use. This paper presents an intrinsic profiling-based technique for the assessment of authorship verification and its application toward detection of compromised accounts. For the same, efficiency of different textual features has been examined. Four categories of features, namely content free, content specific, stylometric and folksonomy, are extracted and evaluated. Experiments are performed with 3057 twitter users taking 4000 latest tweets for each user. Various feature selection techniques are used to rank and select optimal features for each user which are further combined using a popular rank aggregation technique called BORDA. The problem of authorship verification in this paper is studied as a unary classification problem. Performance of various one-class classifiers, namely Local Outlier Factor, Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM, is analyzed on the basis of different evaluation metrics. Experimental results depict that OCC-SVM with rbf kernel outperformed other one class classifiers attaining an average F-score of 87.29\% and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 74.42\% under varied parameter settings.},

Therefore, a spatiotemporal database regarding probability is introduced to investigate the processing and also to detect probabilities concerning uncertainties. In this proposed approach, a periodic pattern tree miner is employed to find all eventual periodic patterns. In addition to this, a novel global pollination artificial fish swarm approach which is the integration of global flower pollination algorithm and artificial fish swarm algorithm is employed in the clustering process to obtain the best dense cluster. On the other hand, the novel global pollination artificial fish swarm approach provides a dynamic, high quality and an exact number of better clusters. We also presented the experimental analysis to obtain eventual periodic pattern mining by means of a modified frequent pattern tree, and the testing is done by utilizing the trucks and bus datasets. Then the comparative analysis is done with a sub-pattern tree to prove the memory usage and time consumption.

  abstract     = {The creation of high-quality software is of great importance in the current state of the enterprise systems. High-quality software should contain certain features including flexibility, maintainability, and a well-designed structure. Correctly adhering to the object-oriented principles is a primary approach to make the code more flexible. Developers usually try to leverage these principles, but many times neglecting them due to the lack of time and the extra costs involved. Therefore, sometimes they create confusing, complex, and problematic structures in code known as code smells. Code smells have specific and well-known anti-patterns that can be corrected after their identification with the help of the refactoring techniques. This process can be performed either manually by the developers or automatically. In this paper, an automated method for identifying and refactoring a series of code smells in the Java programs is introduced. The primary mechanism used for performing such automated refactoring is by leveraging a fuzzy genetic method. Besides, a graph model is used as the core representation scheme along with the corresponding measures such as betweenness, load, in-degree, out-degree, and closeness centrality, to identify the code smells in the programs. Then, the applied fuzzy approach is combined with the genetic algorithm to refactor the code using the graph-related features. The proposed method is evaluated using the Freemind, Jag, JGraph, and JUnit as sample projects and compared the results against the Fontana dataset which contains results from IPlasma, FluidTool, Anti-patternScanner, PMD, and Maeinescu. It is shown that the proposed approach can identify on average 68.92\% of the bad classes similar to the Fontana dataset and also refactor 77\% of the classes correctly with respect to the coupling measures. This is a noteworthy result among the currently existing refactoring mechanisms and also among the studies that consider both the identification and the refactoring of the bad smells.},

However, the existing LOF-based models have two major problems: (1) need a large amount of memory to store data; (2) unsatisfactory detection results in high-dimensional data. To this end, we propose a new data streams anomaly detection algorithm extract local outlier factor (ELOF). To reduce data storage, we first design a memory window mechanism to limit the amount of data storage; then, we design a new sub-data extraction model to extract the sub-data of the original data information. Through these two designs, the amount of data storage can be effectively reduced. Moreover, the model framework is based on the density discriminant method, and it can be widely applied to different real scenarios without any prior information or assumptions of data distribution. The final comprehensive experimental results show that the ELOF model has a great improvement than many common models in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, the running time of ELOF algorithm is less than 1\% of the original LOF algorithm under the same data set. These results indicate that the ELOF improved model consumes less memory in real-time data streams anomaly detection and works better in high-dimensional data streams detection.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces an optimal design of finite impulse response-type Riesz fractional-order digital differentiator (FODD) of orders p = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.75. A very little study on Riesz-based differentiator has been reported so far. Moreover, none of the published Riesz FODD-based literature has studied the optimal design of Riesz FODD, which is explored in this article. In the reported literature, the Riesz FODD is realized by adopting conventional mathematical approaches, which are not efficient for the Riesz FODD-type design problem where the nature of the search landscape is multidimensional, multimodal, non-uniform, and nonlinear. To solve this problem, the design parameters of the proposed Riesz FODDs are estimated by using three independent metaheuristic optimization algorithms called salp swarm algorithm (SSA), gases Brownian motion optimization (GBMO), and gravitational search algorithm (GSA). In SSA, the adaptive variation of the iteration-dependent parameters helps the search agents not only to avoid the suboptimal solutions, but also ensures the faster convergence to reach the near-global optimal solution compared to GSA- and GBMO-based design approaches. The maximum phase error (MPE) and maximum absolute magnitude error (MAME) of the proposed SSA-based Riesz FODD are as low as 3.7119E−014 degree and − 9.6824 dB, respectively, for p = 0.3; 3.1523E−014 degree and − 15.6443 dB, respectively, for p = 0.5; and 3.5780E−014 degree and − 18.7525 dB, respectively, for p = 0.75. In terms of MPE and MAME, the proposed SSA-based Riesz FODD significantly outperforms the GSA- and GBMO-based Riesz FODD designs. The proposed SSA-based Riesz FODD of order p = 0.5 is also implemented on the TMS320C6713 digital signal processor, and its precise zero-phase performance is tested on real electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Moreover, the proposed Riesz FODD is utilized in the ECG QRS complex identification system to demonstrate its real-time application.},

The applicability and performances of these two control systems were examined in 15 different traffic situations according to 4 different intersection geometries. Fixed-time and optimized fuzzy logic traffic controller (FLC) developed by Dogan were used as the reference control systems in performance comparison. The optimum cycle length search system can achieve approximately 18\% improvement over the fixed-time system, but showed lower performance than the FPA and FLC control systems. The FPA system has proven its applicability by achieving the best performance with about a 30\% improvement compared to the fixed-time system and about 3\% improvement compared to the FLC system. The FPA approach, which has a fast and effective performance, has been found to be an alternative method for intersection control, and it is foreseen that it can increase the intersection capacity and reduce the negative effects such as delay and fuel consumption.},

Interval-valued fuzzy soft set, depicted by membership degree with interval form, is a more resultful means for capturing uncertainty. In this paper, the comparison issue in interval-valued fuzzy soft environment is disposed of by proposing novel score function. Later, some new properties for interval-valued fuzzy soft matrix are investigated in detail. Moreover, the objective weight is calculated by CRITIC (Criteria Importance Through Inter-criteria Correlation) method. Meanwhile, the combined weight is determined by reflecting both subjective weight and the objective weight. Then, interval-valued fuzzy soft decision-making algorithm-based CoCoSo (Combined Compromise Solution) is developed. Lastly, the validity of algorithm is expounded by the healthcare management industry evaluation issue, along with their sensitivity analysis.

  abstract     = {This paper suggests a new method for solving the cost to go with time penalization. We consider the Lagrange approach in order to incorporate the restrictions of the problem and to solve the convex structured minimization problems. The solution is based on an improved version of the proximal method in which the regularization term that asymptotically disappear involves a penalization time parameter. By assuming that the set of equilibria is non-empty, we show that the proximal algorithm involving time penalization generates a sequence that converges to a saddle point of the Lagrange functional. This method improves the traditional approach of proximal algorithms and its applications. Our approach is implemented using continuous-time Markov chains. We analyze a queueing model with applications to waiting time of customers in the branch of a bank, for showing the effectiveness of the method.},

  abstract     = {The very large scale integration (VLSI) chip design includes a crucial phase called floorplanning. Several nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms were developed depending on swarm intelligence for VLSI floorplanning. But, the energy consumption and heat generation of floorplanning in VLSI design were not improved using existing metaheuristic algorithms. In order to improve the performance of floorplanning with minimum energy consumption and heat generation, multi-objective firefly optimization-based floorplanning (MOFO-FP) technique is introduced. The main aim of MOFO-FP technique is to reduce the heat generation, space occupied and wire length with the fixed outline constraints for VLSI floorplanning. After constructing the floorplan design, optimization is performed using energy and heat-aware firefly optimization (EHAFO) algorithm. In EHAFO algorithm, the multi-objective function such as heat generation, space occupied and wire length is calculated for efficient floorplanning in VLSI design. Based on the objective functions, the light intensity of each firefly is calculated. From that, the lower brightness fireflies are moved towards higher brightness firefly to identify the optimized position. Lastly, the ranking process carried out to rank the fireflies depends on the intensity to find the optimal tree structure for VLSI floorplanning. This, in turns, proposed MOFO-FP technique which reduces the energy consumption, wire length and heat generation. Experimental evaluation of MOFO-FP technique is carried out with the performance metrics such as wirelength, heat generation, and space consumption compared to the state-of-the-art works. The results are observed that the MOFO-FP technique reduces the space occupied by the circuits with minimum heat generation as well as wire length than the state-of-the-art methods.},

Furthermore, in many papers some notions are introduced by different ways and it would be good to give a unified approach for a transfer of topological notions to a soft set theory and to create a bridge between general topology and soft set theory.

  abstract     = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the tumor diagnostic tools in any part of the body. Nowadays, the brain tumor is becoming a major cause of the death of many individuals. The seriousness of a brain tumor is very big among all the variety of cancers, so to save a life immediate detection and proper treatment to be done. Detection of these cells is a difficult problem, because of the formation of the tumor cells. It is very essential to compare brain tumor from the MRI treatment. It is very difficult to have a vision of the abnormal structures of the human brain using simple imaging techniques. To overcome a problem, in this paper, automated brain tumor detection and classification approaches are proposed. The proposed work consists of five stages, namely preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. In the first step, preprocessing is performed to extract the region of interest (ROI) using manual skull stripping, and noise effects are removed by the median filter. Then, the tumor is segmented in the second step by improved modified region growing algorithm (MRG), which contains both orientation constrains and intensity constraints. Then, GLCM-based texture features are extracted in the third step. After that, the best features are selected by the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA). Finally, the adaptive support vector machine (ASVM) is to classify types of tumors. Experimental results are analyzed in terms of different metrics. Results and experiments show that the proposed method accurately segments and classifies the brain tumor in MR images.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional (3D) printing presents numerous opportunities for improving rapid prototyping and mass customization. However, the existing methods for assessing the performance of a 3D printer are associated with several problems. To solve these problems, a fuzzy collaborative intelligence fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) approach is proposed in this study for assessing the performance of a 3D printer. In the proposed methodology, the alpha-cut operations method is first applied to derive the fuzzy priority of each criterion for each decision maker. Based on the derived priorities, the fuzzy-weighted average is then computed to assess the overall performance of each 3D printer for each decision maker. Thereafter, fuzzy intersection is applied to aggregate the assessment results of the decision makers. Finally, the center-of-gravity method is applied to defuzzify the aggregation result. By using the proposed methodology, the consensus among decision makers can be guaranteed. The proposed fuzzy collaborative intelligence FAHP approach has been applied to a real case of 10 3D printers. The experimental results indicated that the accuracy of the proposed methodology is superior to that of the existing methods, which yielded different ranking results owing to the use of approximation.},

The performance of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models have been boosted using gray wolf optimization (GWO). To train the models, data were used from 100 driven piles in c-φ soil in different locations. The input parameters were pile area (m2), pile length (m), flap number, average cohesion (kN/m2) and friction angle (°), average soil specific weight (kN/m2) and average pile–soil friction angle (°), and the output was UBC. The results showed that both the MLP and ANFIS methods had good abilities to predict the UBC of the piles; however, the MLP-GWO model with a topology of 7 × 10 × 10 × 1 provided better results. The performance indices of this model were a RMSE of 1.86 kN and R2 of 0.991 for the test data. The validity of the MLP-GWO model was tested using a new experimental dataset, and the difference between actual and estimated UBC was very low (about 2\%) and confirmed the high accuracy of the model. It was observed that the theoretical methods underestimated the UBC significantly, while the proposed model estimated the UBC with high accuracy. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that the pile area and length were the most effective factors for estimation of UBC.},

In the proposed approach, a new distance measure based on cross-evaluation of Pythagorean fuzzy sets is introduced to overcome the disadvantages of existing distance measures. Unlike existing MCDM approaches, in which either subjective or objective weights of criteria are used, in this method AHP is modified using Pythagorean fuzzy information to calculate subjective weights of criteria, as well as Pythagorean fuzzy entropy weight model is applied to compute objective weights of criteria. Finally, both the weights of criteria are simultaneously taken into consideration to obtain final ranking of the alternatives. To demonstrate the application potentiality of the proposed method, a numerical example is considered with Pythagorean fuzzy input in the context of selecting the best transportation company which is one of the most important parts of transportation management.

International organization of motor vehicle manufacturers submitted manufactured vehicle list that reaches 97 million vehicles in a year. However, million people are died in road accidents each year and this number also increases in parallel. Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) should be used to gather and distribute safety information to reduce the accident growths. Recently, several protocols have been proposed to address these issues, but the trade-off between energy and delay is major issues. In this paper, we propose a perspective on road safety adopted routing protocol for hybrid VANET-WSN communication (PRAVN) based on threefold contributions. The first contribution of PRAVN protocol is to perform clustering using improved water wave optimization (IWWO) algorithm. The second contribution is to compute the cluster head (CH) node of SN among multiple nodes based on multi-constraint features that are gathered from the SNs. Third contribution is to introduce the rider optimization (RO) algorithm for neighborhood selection, which provides the network lifetime and lossless connection. Finally, the PRAVN protocol used to forward correct information from source to destination that enhances the road safety. PRAVN protocol is implemented on network simulator (NS2) tool with the simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) for traffic generation. The simulation results prove that the proposed PRAVN protocol can outperform other conventional routing protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio, number of drops, throughput, routing overhead, energy consumption, end-to-to delay and network lifetime.},

  abstract     = {Salp swarm algorithm (SSA) is a recent optimization technique inspired by behavior of the salp chains in deep oceans. However, the SSA is efficient, simple and easy to implement, it is susceptible to stagnation at local optima for some cases. The main contribution of this paper is proposing an improved salp swarm algorithm algorithm (ISSA) for enhancing the search capabilities of the original SSA to solve the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. In the proposed ISSA, both of exploration and the exploitation processes are enhanced. The exploration process is achieved by applying a random mutation to find new searching areas while an adaptive process is developed to enhance the exploitation process by focusing on the most promising search area. This strategy will balance the transformation between exploration and exploitation. The ISSA is employed to achieve OPF with non-smooth and non-convex generator fuel cost functions such as; minimizing quadratic fuel cost, piecewise quadratic cost, quadratic fuel cost considering the valve-point effect and prohibited zones. The main advantages of the ISSA are avoiding stagnation at local optima and can solve nonlinear and non-smooth optimization problems where its adaptive operators balance between the exploration and exploitation phases of this algorithm. However, the parameters of ISSA need to be carefully defined before application of algorithm. The proposed algorithm is validated using the standard IEEE 30-bus, IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems. The performance of proposed algorithm is comprehensively compared with moth-flame optimization algorithm, improved harmony search algorithm, genetic algorithm and other reported optimization techniques. The results prove the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm compared with other optimization techniques.},

  abstract     = {In the bioinformatics field, the classification of unknown biological sequences is a key task that is fundamental for simplifying the consistency, aggregation, and survey of organisms and their evolution. We can view biological sequences as data components of higher non-fixed dimensions, corresponding to the length of the sequences. Numerical encoding performs an important function in DNA sequence evaluation via computational procedures such as one-hot encoding (OHE). However, the OHE method has drawbacks: 1) it does not add any details that may produce the additional predictive variable, and 2) if the variable has many classes, then OHE increases the feature space significantly. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper presents a computationally effective framework for classifying DNA sequences of living organisms in the image domain. The proposed strategy relies upon multilayer perceptron trained by a pseudoinverse learning autoencoder (PILAE) algorithm. The PILAE training process does not have to set the learning control parameters or indicate the number of hidden layers. Therefore, the PILAE classifier can accomplish better performance contrasting with other deep neural network (DNNs) strategies such as VGG-16 and Xception models. Experimental results have demonstrated that this proposed strategy achieves high prediction accuracy as well as to a significant degree high computational efficiency over different datasets.},

  abstract     = {For the traditional portfolio optimization problems, the return rates of risky assets are described by random variables or fuzzy variables. Due to the complexity of real asset market, this assumption may not always be satisfactory, for example, when there are not enough available data. Hence, return rates can be treated as uncertain variables in many cases. In this paper, we consider an uncertain portfolio optimization problem under different risk preferences. First, an optimistic value–variance–entropy model is formulated, where optimistic value and entropy are used for measuring investment return and diversification, respectively. Then, a three-step method is proposed for solving the formulated model with considering different risk preferences. Finally, a comparison is presented in numerical simulation for illustrating the practicality and effectiveness of our models and solution method.},

In matrix factorization method, the latent features of users and items are determined in such a way that the inner product of the latent features of a user with the latent features of an item is equal to that user&#39;s rating on that item. This model is solved using alternate optimization algorithm. The solution and the prediction error of this algorithm depend on the initial values of the latent features of users which are usually set to small random values. The purpose of this paper is to propose a fast alternate optimization algorithm for matrix factorization which converges to a good solution. To do so, firstly, we show experimentally that if the latent feature vector of each user is initialized by a vector of which elements are equal, we can also obtain a proper solution using the alternate optimization algorithm. Then, we prove that if our proposed initialization method is used, the alternate optimization algorithm for matrix factorization can be simplified using Sherman–Morrison formula. Experimental results on 5 real datasets show that the runtime of our proposed algorithm is 2–45 times less than the traditional method.},

  abstract     = {Disaster management is one of the most important issues in service organizations, especially in healthcare sector. Due to the occurrences of natural or human-made incidents, requirements of assistance and rescue increase gradually. Hospitals have the vital role in addressing these requirements and therefore should enhance their skill to provide a punctual and appropriate response to these events. An important prerequisite for this level of responsiveness is agility. This study aims to introduce and implement a new approach in order to estimate the agility level of hospitals in disaster management. Founded on the four phases of disaster management, a hospital agility framework is established which showcases the relations between hospital agility factors and phases of disaster management. A new Flowsort-based approach is also introduced through the integration of the conventional Flowsort method with interval type-2 fuzzy sets. This approach is applied for a case study consisting of 30 hospitals seeking to improve their agility in disasters. We use upper and lower control limits (UCL and LCL) to define the categories of Flowsort method. The results show that 40\% of the hospitals position in between the $$ \pm \,2\delta $$ and $$ \pm \,3\delta $$ limits, i.e., the best and the worst categories. Results also approve the ability of the proposed method in evaluation of hospitals based on their agility factors and represent a geographical observation on the hospitals. Some indications about required actions for hospitals of each category in order to increase or maintain their agility level in disaster management are also provided.},

In addition, there are some novel characteristics that make the designed model remarkable regarding the literature including: (1) multi-plant location; (2) allocation of plants capacity to fulfill multiple markets demand; and (3) the integration of dynamic cell formation, PP and LA decisions. The objective function terms are to optimize the sale revenue and total costs of machine operating, machine overhead, inter-cell material handling, inventory holding, outsourcing, machine installation/uninstallation, products transportation, dispersing machines, establishing plants, and forming cells. A sample test problem is solved by CPLEX solver to show the achievement obtained by the characteristics incorporated into the model. Since the proposed model is NP-hard, two meta-heuristics algorithms as grey wolf optimization and genetic algorithm are developed. To verify the computational effectiveness of the employed meta-heuristics in comparison with that of CPLEX solver, its performance is tested using a number of test problems.},

  abstract     = {Efficiency evaluation is a desirable kind of a decision making analysis for experts in various fields because if something can be measured, it can also be improved more easily. Measuring efficiency has been a topic of many research studies, and many quantitative methods to deal with this problem under various assumptions have already been established. However, most methods struggle with barriers limiting their use in practice. The aim of this paper is to establish a method for efficiency evaluation which is as traceable as possible, provides a graphical representation of the results, and yields results that are easily interpretable for problems with uncertain input data expressed by fuzzy evaluations. In particular, a new hybrid method for efficiency evaluation is presented. This method is based on a combination of the PROMETHEE (i.e. outranking multi-criteria decision making method) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) under uncertainty, similar to the study published by Ishizaka et al. (Soft Comput 22(22):7325-7338, 2018) who, however, worked only with deterministic data. The PROMETHEE method allows a computationally easy and traceable evaluation of alternatives. The DEA method is currently the most popular method for efficiency evaluation. However, its original version provides a graphical representation only for very simple models. In addition, the results are usually not easy to interpret because it mixes scale-dependent and scale-independent data together. Fuzziness in the DEA model is handled using measures of possibility and necessity, which provide easily interpretable results for a decision maker. In particular, the results reveal to what extent each unit under evaluation can possibly be, or certainly is, efficient. The proposed algorithm is applied to one artificial and one real-life numerical example, and the results are compared with the pure DEA model.},

The spectacular property of the proposed controller is that the upper bound of the convergence time exists as an explicit parameter in the control&#39;s law, thus the true fixed stabilization time can be set in advance.

The failure mode of the bus body structure is analyzed based on the “Risk Priority Number (RPN)” which is the criteria to decide the risk priorities of the failure modes. Usually, the evaluation of RPN is based on the risk factors like “Severity(S), Occurrence (O), and Detection (D)”. To improve the failure mode analysis and ranking of bus body structure, a simulation technique i.e., fuzzy logic (FL) is proposed where the optimal RPN is achieved. With the goal of optimizing the generated rules based on the failure modes, hybrid teaching and learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is presented with three distinctive metaheuristics updating behaviors. The optimal outcome demonstrates that the attained error rate between the output of desired and predicted values are firmly equivalent to zero. The proposed FL with hybrid TLBO achieves promising results in terms of the failure modes determination and risk prioritization.},

Flip buckets, using as hydraulic structures for dissipation of the excess energy outflow, are usually constructed at the end of the chute of the spillways. In this research, based on experimental studies of large hydraulic models, five well-known soft computing methods including artificial neural networks (ANN), gene expression programming (GEP), classification and regression trees (CART), M5 model tree (M5MT), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) approaches are examined. Mathematical expressions are obtained by these methods to predict $$ P^{*} $$ in flip buckets. Compared to ANN and GEP expressions, explicit formulas derived by CART, M5MT, and MARS demonstrated more straightforward calculations. In addition, linear and nonlinear equations are generated for better comparison with the outcomes of the proposed soft computing methods. The obtained results showed the high performance of the suggested soft computing methods for the prediction of $$ P^{*} $$ in flip buckets. It is found that the GEP approach culminated in more accurate results than other proposed soft computing methods and conventional linear and nonlinear regression techniques. Error measures in the testing stage showed that the formula provided by GEP with root mean square error (RMSE = 0.095), scatter index (SI = 13\%), and mean absolute error (MAE = 0.073) has the best accuracy among the other predictive equations.},

In addition, platforms and application development languages have diversified and started to be differentiated according to their intended use. However, the selection of an appropriate model development environment has become an important decision problem. This study guides the selection of suitable tools for optimization problems, especially in management science. The main objective is to identify the key attributes of the frameworks from the researcher’s point of view in management science and assign a total utility score to measure the relative importance of frameworks for evolutionary algorithms. For that reason, we propose a conjoint analysis model upon the preferences of management scientist for the appropriate framework that meets the needs in optimization problems. We also aim at providing effective usage of relevant frameworks for appropriate types of problems, facilitating the work of researchers and therefore increasing the quality of the optimization procedure. By doing so, losing time and effort resulting from the wrong platform and framework selection, as well as ineffective model results, will be avoided. Moreover, the frameworks are also evaluated by calculating the weights of criteria with one of the recent multi-criteria decision-making method called Euclidean best–worst method and compared with the findings obtained from conjoint analysis. This study not only provides review of existing software tools developed for optimization problems but also contributes to research and practice in the field of optimization algorithms in general and helps the researchers in management science for meeting their needs while searching for the appropriate framework.},

Since the volume of traffic to cloud-based applications grows, the resource provisioning as one of challenging issues to serve time-varying and heterogeneous workloads in resource management scope to be considered. In this paper, we propose a workload clustering-based resource provisioning mechanism for executing cloud-based applications with heterogeneous workloads. Our proposed mechanism utilized biogeography-based optimization (BBO) technique with K-means clustering to classify the cloud workloads according to their quality of service (QoS) requirements. Besides, we used Bayesian learning technique to specify suitable resource provisioning actions to satisfy the QoS requirements of cloud-based applications. The simulation results obtained through simulation demonstrate that the proposed solution reduces the delay, SLA violation ratio, cost, and energy consumption compared with workload clustering-based resource provisioning mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {With the development of distribution logistics, the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery (VRPSPD) has garnered attention in recent years due to its higher capacity-usage rate and transportation efficiency. This study proposes a novel dynamic multi-stage failure-specific cooperative (DMS-FSC) recourse strategy for solving the route failure which occurs in the VRPSPD. In the case of simultaneous transportation, the proposed DMS-FSC strategy allows a pair of cooperative vehicles to revisit each other’s customers with unmet demands by dividing the whole transportation route into multiple stages. An extended genetic algorithm with a new multi-stage paired vectors representation scheme is offered to more effectively deal with the proposed DMS-FSC strategy. It explores a more ideal a priori transportation plan for the VRPSPD by incorporating an acceptance criterion based on simulated annealing. Two sets of cases with middle and corner located depots are used to verify the proposed algorithm’s effectiveness in solving the presented problem. Furthermore, a comparison between the DMS-FSC strategy and the baseline strategy, which involves no cooperation, is also made to evaluate the cost savings generated from the proposed DMS-FSC strategy.},

  abstract     = {Heuristic computational intelligence techniques are widely used in combinatorial optimization problems, essentially in large size configurations. Bio-inspired heuristics such as PSO, FA or FPA showed their capacities to solve such problems. Bi-heuristic optimization consists of using a couple of techniques and a collaboration mechanism. This paper reviews the major contributions in solving TSP with bi-heuristics and presents a new hybridization scheme based on FPA, ACO with Ls, ant supervised by flower pollination with local search, ASFPA-Ls; as well as the impact of social and cognitive PSO for the ant supervised by PSO with local search, ASPSO-Ls. AS-chaotic-PSO-Ls which stands for ant supervised by chaotic PSO local search is also investigated. The meta-heuristic algorithms (FPA, PSO or chaotic PSO) and ant colony optimization are used with a hierarchical collaboration schema in addition to a local search mechanism. In this work, the local search strategy, Ls, used is the 2-opt method; the proposals are called, respectively, ASFPA-Ls, cognitive ant supervised by PSO with local search, Co-ASPSO-Ls, social-ASPSO-Ls and AS-chaotic-PSO-Ls; where ACO is coupled with a local search heuristic mechanism called 2-opt, and a set of meta-heuristics, FA, FPA and PSO asked to adapt ACO parameters while running. Comparative experimental investigations are conducted using the TSP test bench. Proposed hybridizations attended fair solutions for the TSP problems used in the experimental investigations including berlin52, St70, eil76, rat 99, eil101, KroA100, Ch150 and kroA200. A good balance performance/time is found with the social ant supervised by PSO with local search, So-ASPSO-Ls. The cognitive ant supervised by PSO with local search, Co-ASPSO-Ls comes in the second position in terms of time effectiveness with close performances to AS-chaoticPS0-LS, all proposed approaches returned low rate errors or BKS for used test benches: berlin52, st70, eil76, rat99, kroA100 and kroA200.},

This paper presents an algorithm to improve the convergence speed of picture fuzzy clustering for large-scale data. According to the existing suppression fuzzy clustering idea, the maximum value of picture fuzzy partition information of picture fuzzy clustering is further increased and other values are decreased. The modified picture fuzzy partition information is used to update the cluster center of the sample, which speeds up the convergence speed of the algorithm. The adaptive selection of suppression factors makes the picture fuzzy clustering obtain faster operation efficiency and better segmentation performance. In order to further improve the performance of picture fuzzy clustering algorithm for noise image segmentation, an adaptive robust suppression picture fuzzy clustering algorithm with neighborhood spatial information constraints is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm not only shortens the operation speed of existing picture fuzzy clustering, but also improves the robustness to noise.},

  abstract     = {The present study investigates an inventory system for seasonal products under variable demand rate and partial backordering in a competitive market. Among various demand rate functions used in the existing literature of economic order quantity (EOQ) models, the logistic-growth function is best known to estimate market already captured and fraction of market remaining to be captured by new seasonal and technology driven items. Weibull distribution well represents the seasonality and versatility of these products. Due to retailers’ reluctance to purchase and store these perishable products, supplier offers the delay in payment. In view of the above, the proposed EOQ model suitable for those items considers the logistic-growth demand rate, Weibull distribution deterioration rate and partial backordering along with fully permissible delay in payment. Since the neutrosophic set quantifies the imprecise information in real-life scenarios, the proposed EOQ model is optimized in neutrosophic environment. A general unconstrained nonlinear mathematical model with neutrosophic coefficients is optimized using the weighted arithmetic mean function, subject to specified neutrosophic norm. A special case with the neutrosophic conjunction norm along with four lemmata is considered to minimize the cost functions with neutrosophic coefficients to proposed EOQ model across various trade-credit intervals. Here, the managerial insights identified through sensitivity analysis advocate to reduce the expenses on early promotions for foreshortening the demand at the beginning of cycle. Also, the present study demonstrates the optimal inventory depletion time to depend on the demand during the shortages in neutrosophic environment.},

Now, many e-commerce sites try to process reviews in their native languages. In this paper, we propose an enhanced dictionary in our native language (Tamil) that aims at building contextual relationships among the terms of multi-domain datasets that tries to minimize the feature mismatch problem. The proposed dictionary employs both labeled and unlabeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. More precisely, the initial dictionary explores pointwise mutual information for calculating contextual weight then the final dictionary estimates the rank score based on the importance of terms among all the reviews. This work intends to classify reviews of multiple target domains in Tamil by using the unified dictionary with a large number of vocabularies. This extendible dictionary significantly improves the accuracy of DA with the other baseline methods and handles many words in multiple domains with ease.},

This classification is based on the visual content of the images. In other words, the keystone of such a solution is the choice of the visual descriptor(s) used to encode the visual characteristics of the smoke into numerical vectors. In this paper, we propose to learn a new feature space to represent the visual descriptors extracted from the video frames in an unsupervised manner. This mapping is intended to yield better discrimination between smoke-free images and those showing smoke patterns. The proposed approach is inspired by the linear hyperspectral unmixing techniques. It defines the axes of the new feature space as the vertices of a minimum-volume simplex enclosing all image pixels in the frame. The obtained empirical results prove that the proposed feature mapping approach reinforces the discrimination power of the visual descriptors and produces better smoke detection performance. In addition, the proposed approach exhibits the valuable ability to automatically determine the most relevant visual descriptors.},

So, this study introduced the promisingly efficient and fast RVFL network as base models to the framework of ensemble learning and explored diversity strategies in the proposed RVFL network ensemble forecasting model to obtain good performance. Specifically, the impacts of five different strategies including data quantity diversity, sampling interval diversity, parameter diversity, ensemble number diversity and ensemble method diversity on the performance of RVFL network ensemble learning have been examined and analyzed. Experimental results found that the accuracy of ensemble learning models would be increased if diversity strategies were carefully selected.

  abstract     = {Cooperative coevolution (CC) is an effective evolutionary divide-and-conquer strategy that solves large-scale global optimization (LSGO) by decomposing the problem into a set of lower-dimensional subproblems. The main challenge of CC is to find an optimal decomposition. Differential Grouping (DG) is a competitive decomposition method to identify the variable interaction with several improved versions like GDG and DG2. Although DG-based decomposition methods have shown superior performance compared to the other decomposition methods, they still have difficulty to deal with the overlapping problems since their optimal decomposition is unknown. To address this issue, instead of pursuing the high accuracy of decomposition, we propose a novel fuzzy decomposition algorithm that groups the variables according to their interaction degree. In the proposed fuzzy decomposition algorithm, the interaction structure matrix and the interactive degree for a LSGO problem are calculated at first according to the interaction among all the decision variables. Then the number of subgroups is determined based on the interactive degree. Based on the interaction structure matrix, a spectral clustering algorithm is proposed to decompose the decision variables with regard to the number of subgroups in order to achieve a better balance between high grouping accuracy and suitable group size. The proposed decomposition algorithm with DECC has been proven to outperform several state-of-the-art algorithms on the latest LSGO benchmark functions.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of population density and people demand based on railway services increases day by day. Hence, the maintenance (i.e., degradation and aging) and the decision-making processes of rail wheels are troublesome. There has been an impact of degradation stage for a system such as a repair, replacement, and inspection time. In this paper, an adaptive neural-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) rail wheel maintenance model is proposed using the modified spider monkey algorithm, with the parametric update. As the design of the wheel maintenance strategy, the degradation stage increases with system aging and it can be minimized using repair. In this way, this article presents the development of system reliability that is dealing with the establishment of a maintenance strategy. A higher running cost rate reduces the main contribution of the reparation cycle using an optimum maintenance model, and the locomotive wheels are employed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology. Under optimal inspection time, the impact of system failures such as aging and degradation is determined successfully. The proposed model can able to identify the precise time when rail tracks fail to minimize the maintenance cost/time. This ANFIS and MSMA can increase the efficiency of maintenance activities and decrease the cost of maintenance in the long term. Similarly, the results demonstrate that the proposed maintenance model is more flexible, and the capability of gauge value prediction using real and estimated values is accurate.},

  abstract     = {In various medical imaging studies, the segmentation of the medical image is a crucial step. Due to the inherent behavior of the images, the computerized tomography (CT) scan/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are not clear. As the medical images are captured using electronic devices, these images are ambiguous and unclear. This ambiguity in the images is due to factors related to noise and the environment while capturing images. A fuzzy set is a valuable method to deal with data uncertainty. In this paper, a novel clustering approach based upon a fuzzy concept is proposed, which enhances the vague MRI/CT scan image before segmentation. Initially, the image noise is minimized by processing eight immediate neighborhood pixels around each pixel in an image. After noise processing, upper and lower membership levels of the image are computed. Hamacher T-conorm is used as an aggregation operator to construct a new membership function using upper and lower membership levels. The enhanced image, created using the new membership function, is then segmented using Gaussian kernel-based fuzzy c means clustering. The experiment is performed on MRI/CT scan brain tumor images. Real data experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better performance when compared with existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. It is observed that even in the presence of noise, the proposed method exhibits better efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Faults in software can be of varied severity and so is the priority with which they are fixed. Hence, these two factors impact the reliability of the software to a large extent and is worthy of being taken into consideration while framing the software reliability growth model (SRGM). In this paper, a stochastic differential equation-based SRGM has been formulated where detection of faults has been associated with severity of fault occurrence and the process of correcting them have been knit with priority of defect fixing. Another matter of concern is the determination of the optimal time to release the software in the market with high reliability figures keeping the development cost margin minimum. Release time determination in the literature is done mainly using crisp or type-1 fuzzy system approach wherein the cost constraint in the optimization framework is considered to be of deterministic nature which is something highly unrealistic. In this study, the cost constraint is considered to comprise of a randomized cost budget with variable coefficients being interval type-2 fuzzy numbers which can represent the dynamicity associated with changes in specification during software development process in a much more realistic fashion. This encourages the release time determination problem to be framed as a multi-objective chance constrained optimization problem, which is thereby solved using fuzzy goal programming approach based on Taylor series method. The proposed SRGM and the release time approach have been validated on real time data, which show much promising results than many of those available in the literature.},

  abstract     = {In the modern chemical industry, the process data collected are high-dimensional and complex. All measured variables are usually incorporated in statistical process monitoring models because these models generally perform dimension reduction. However, if modeling involves variables that do not contain useful information about faults, that is, variables that are not relevant to faults, monitoring performance may be degraded. In typical process monitoring methods, offline modeling only uses normal data without any fault information, making monitoring performance unlikely to be optimal. Hence, a novel stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) monitoring model based on fault-related variable selection was proposed. From the point of view that correlation characteristics between measured variables will change when faults occur, strongly fault-related variables are selected. Mutual information was used to calculate correlations between measured variables, including normal and fault data. Euclidean distance was adopted as a similarity index to measure the similarity between each correlation vector of measured variables in a normal state and that in a fault state. Only variables strongly related to fault effects were retained, and other uninformative variables were excluded from model development. Then, SSAEs were used to construct a monitoring model for selected data. The proposed method can utilize historical fault data to select strongly fault-related variables, making the model contain useful process information and features extracted by SSAE have high interpretability. A case study on the Tennessee–Eastman process demonstrated its availability.},

  abstract     = {As a robust generalization to fuzzy set, the interval-valued dual-hesitant fuzzy set (IVDHFS) was put forward, which provided several possible membership and non-membership interval values to be associated with a specific substance. But IVDHFS does not couple the membership and non-membership values with their corresponding weights/importance degrees to assess a variable, which is irrational. To circumvent this issue, this study introduces the weighted interval-valued dual-hesitant fuzzy set (WIVDHFS) which describe the membership and non-membership values in the form of interval along with their weights. These assigned weights give more detail about the level of agreeness and disagreeness and thereby can help the decision makers (DMs) to obtain precise, rational, and consistent decision consequences. After introducing the pioneer notion of WIVDHFS, several related terms, viz. connected weighted interval-valued dual-hesitant element (WIVDHFE), score function, and accuracy function are defined. Using Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm, some basic operational laws for WIVDHFEs are constructed. Next, to aggregate WIVDHFEs, two types of aggregation operators based on Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm, namely the generalized weighted interval-valued dual-hesitant fuzzy-weighted averaging operator and the generalized weighted interval-valued dual-hesitant fuzzy-weighted geometric operator are designed along with their relevant properties. Meanwhile, some of their special cases and relationships are also explored. On the basis of special cases, a novel multi-criteria group decision-making approach under weighted interval-valued dual-hesitant fuzzy environment is then constructed. Finally, an application case about teaching quality assessment is presented, and some analyses and comparisons are provided to validate the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Monarch butterfly optimization (MBO), which is a simple and widely used algorithm, has some limitations, such as utilizing the obtained experiential knowledge about the search space inefficiently, the lack of exploration, and being rotational variance. This paper proposes a new variation of MBO, which is called knowledge-based MBO (KMBO), to address these limitations. KMBO is proposed by introducing new operators that are linearized and can utilize the population&#39;s experimental knowledge. Furthermore, KMBO adopts the re-initialization operator to enhance the exploration ability and increase the diversity of the population. To verify KMBO’s performance, it is tested on 23 well-known optimization benchmark functions and compared with MBO and five other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms. Experimental results confirm the superior performance of our proposed algorithm compared with MBO in terms of solution accuracy and convergence speed. Also, results demonstrate that KMBO performs better than or provides competitive performance with the other six algorithms. In addition, the real-world application of KMBO on clustering optimization is presented. The results prove that KMBO is applicable to solve real-world problems and achieve superior results.},

Clustering is an important technique for exploring data structures used in many fields, such as customer segmentation, image recognition, social science, and so on. However, in real-world applications, there are a lot of noises or outliers which will seriously influence the clustering performance in the dataset. Besides, the clustering results are susceptible to the initial centroids and algorithm parameters. To overcome the influence of outliers on clustering results, this study combines the advantages of probability c-means and fuzzy c-ordered means to propose a fuzzy possibilistic c-ordered means (FPCOM) algorithm. In order to solve the problem of parameters and initial centroids determination, this study employs a sine cosine algorithm (SCA) combined with FPCOM to improve the clustering results. The proposed algorithm is named SCA-FPCOM algorithm. Ten benchmark datasets collected from the UCI machine repository were used to validate the proposed algorithm in terms of adjusted rand index and the Silhouette coefficient. According to the experimental results, the SCA-FPCOM algorithm can obtain better results than other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The internet technology needs high-speed (Internet Protocol) IP addressing system and IP matching in router. The IP addressing speed depends on the size of address and destination. Until now, IPV4 address matching performs with various algorithms such as binary trie, LC trie, prefix tree, priority trie, DTBM, and multi-prefix tree. The above algorithms suit for IPV4 address matching and never suit for IPV6 address matching. The IPV6 consists of 128 bits with different header structures when compared to IPV4. The IPV6 address matching needs a robust algorithm with high processing speed IP matching and uses low memory and high accuracy in IP address matching with less operation time. In this paper, we propose DNA-based sequence matching lookup (DSML) algorithm for IPV6 address matching with reduced searching time. The DSML algorithm performs better than existing algorithms such as disjoint prefix tree and multi-index suffix trie because of direct computation of IPv6 matching through DNA folding sequence. The proposed DSML algorithm does the direct computation due to hit score method and never splits the prefix of IPV6. The splitting of prefix in the existing algorithm consumes more time and reduces the accuracy in IPv6 matching. From the experimentation, when compared to existing algorithms the proposed DSML algorithm provides 80\% result in terms of speed and scalability.},

However, the efficacy and outcomes of an SVM-based classification model is influenced by the proper selection of SVM parameters in addition to the nature of the datasets. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to enrich the efficacy of the SVMs based on simultaneous optimization of the parameters and feature weighting of these models. In this paper, an improved evolutionary variant of competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) is proposed to evolve the parameters of SVMs and optimize the weights of features. Simulations and experiments are performed based on various datasets from UCI repository to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid CSO-based SVM model versus genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimizer and the classical grid-based search. Results and analysis reveal that the proposed crossover-based mechanism inside CSO has improved the classification capabilities of the hybrid CSO-SVM technique.},

  abstract     = {By improving the efficiency of the long-range maritime search and rescue (LRMSAR), this paper uses the independence of GIS and optimization algorithm to establish calculation module respectively. Firstly, the GIS is used to project the geographic coordinates of past merchant vessels and alternative islands where the maritime search and rescue (SAR) base can be built. Secondly, the K-means clustering algorithm is used to obtain the location of the SAR dynamic duty points. Then, the obtained coordinate data of the alternative islands and the SAR dynamic duty points are input to the optimization algorithm module. Based on the traditional plant growth simulation algorithm, a multi-objective plant growth simulation algorithm is designed by adding the key technologies of fast non-dominated sorting, dominant strength, crowding distance, elite strategy, and partially ordered set. The optimal scheme considering the position of the SAR dynamic duty points, the allocation of SAR vessels and the location of SAR bases is obtained. Finally, taking the construction of SAR base in Spratly Islands of the South China Sea and the allocation of SAR ships as an example, the better results are obtained. To verify the effectiveness of the model and the algorithm in this study, different scales calculating examples were selected for comparison. The calculation results show that the improved algorithm is better in terms of optimization result, solution distribution and adaptability. The research shows that combining the location of SAR bases, the allocation of SAR resources and the spatial analysis function of the GIS for comprehensive optimization can effectively make up for the deficiencies of previous studies and obtain a better optimization scheme. The research results of this study can provide new analysis methods and optimization scheme for the location of SAR bases and the allocation of SAR vessels in remote oceans.},

  abstract     = {An emerging problem regarding tea and health has been pyramidally addressed as research concerns from limited literature reviews to identify an important and interesting challenge. Although past studies activated for various topics and diverse purposes of tea and health, a gap for using hybrid intelligence-based techniques to discover useful information from literature analysis exists in the exploration of curative effects on tea against fatal diseases other than Western medicine therapies. This study is motivated to bridge this gap by solving this research issue for healthcare applications between tea and health. Thus, this study proposes a hybrid method of an intelligent/objective text mining technique and topic modeling principally by latent Dirichlet allocation with VEM method and Gibbs sampling as along with measurements for three evaluation metrics for model performance from published articles. In the experiment materials, this study sets conditions to collect 2109 journal articles from the Web of Science from 2010 to 2017. We divided this into three datasets that each corresponded to the three periods to differentiate discrepancies in future trends. This study contributes eight beneficial directions as follows: (1) From a technical view, the figure of VEM’s perplexity has a screen plot, but Gibbs sampling is smooth and good; and, interestingly, the greater the number of topics, the lower the perplexity is; (2) in empirical results, the terms for primary topics are tea and tea compounds, and secondary topics are associated with terms for issues regarding tea and health; (3) this study yields five research findings with key empirical evidence that tea has a natural and important preventive impact on treating diseases, especially cancer; (4) as to any managerial implications, early preventions and treatments by greater tea consumption as a valuable healthcare activity with medicinal purposes; (5) regarding the novelty of this research, this study fills the gap in a hybrid knowledge-based objective text mining and topic modeling technique than past researchers have as regards tea and health issues that were only based on traditional content analysis methods; (6) for this study’s strengths, it achieved manpower cost reductions and relative objectivity because the objective LDA method is rarely used for topic modeling when compared to past studies; (7) for the research significance, the proposed method benefits efficient analysis from massive amounts of extant data for exploring latent information, accelerates research processes quickly, improves understanding for new hypotheses, and identifies key questions for further research; and (8) for conclusive research importance, this study offers new rationales for medical application and discovers differentiations and gaps for studying research trends.},

  abstract     = {To improve ant colony optimization (ACO) for traveling salesman problem (TSP), its two main strategies which are tour construction and pheromone updating have been modified, and one modified ACO (MACO) has been proposed. For the first strategy (tour construction strategy), one new method to construct tours by combining paths of two meeting ants has been applied. And for second strategy (pheromone updating strategy), one new method to polarize pheromone density of all paths has been proposed. Based on the applications for 40 standard benchmark TSP instances (datasets) ranging from 29 to 13,509 cities, the good performance of the MACO is verified. To verify the MACO deeply, based on the applications for some standard TSP instances, the computing results of MACO are compared with three typical state-of-the-art algorithms based on ACO methods. Moreover, based on the applications for some standard TSP instances, the computing results of MACO are compared with 10 state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms. The comparison studies show that the MACO can attain the optimal solution with higher accuracy, no matter how complicated the TSPs are. And its performance is the best, comparing to all state-of-the-art algorithms. At last, two new strategies used in MACO have been analyzed comprehensively by the applications for 25 TSPs. The results show that the first strategy is mainly used to improve the computing efficiency, and the second one is mainly used to improve the computing effect.},

For this purpose, both nonlinear parametric and nonparametric methods were utilized. The left and right spreads of unknown fuzzy smooth function were estimated via a popular kernel-based curve-fitting method, while the center was estimated using both parametric and nonparametric curve-fitting methods. In fact, two techniques were suggested and compared in terms of estimating the center of fuzzy smooth function: (1) nonparametric method (similar to the left and right spreads) and (2) parametric method adopted with a common nonlinear regression model called truncated spline regression. Each stage was separately estimated the unknown components were addressed via the conventional statistical regression methods. The proposed method managed to provide a simple and fast estimation/prediction approach for the fuzzy univariate regression analysis for any types of LR-fuzzy numbers. Some common goodness-of-fit criteria were also employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The effectiveness of the developed method was further illustrated through three numerical examples including a simulation study based on a common kernel. The proposed method was also compared with several common fuzzy linear/nonlinear regression models. The numerical evaluations indicated that the proposed parametric method for centers exhibited more accurate results as compared with the nonparametric method.},

  abstract     = {Spatial feature matching is the key to detecting incremental changes in spatial data and extracting the updated information. The accuracy of spatial feature matching can depend on the structural organization of the data being compared; inconsistent data structures make comparison more difficult. OpenStreetMap (OSM) road network data, for example, is updated frequently to the point of being unstable, making the matching process used in information extraction susceptible to interference. To use OSM for comparison with other road data sources, this problem must be addressed. This paper proposes a new multi-scale dynamic matching algorithm based on a hierarchical stroke mesh (HSM) to detect matches between OSM data and professional surveying and mapping data and to update the change information. By improving the integrity and continuity of the stroke generation method and its algorithm for evaluating the importance of information, the algorithm proposed in this paper identifies the spatial hierarchy contained in the road network and abstracts the road network. The result is the HSM. The algorithm is based on multi-scale matching constraint rules designed from coarse to fine in terms of both resolution and granularity. It is used to detect one-to-one or one-to-many mapping relationships among different mesh levels (mesh, mesh boundary segment, and mesh inner segment). This allows progressive iterative matching between the older survey data and the newer OSM data. The results show that the HSM algorithm proposed in this paper can detect incremental changes between the two vector data sources quickly and accurately. Compared with others, this algorithm can effectively improve matching accuracy while sacrificing little performance.},

These algorithms depend on the arrangement of pulse width modulation and direct pulse width modulation system to be with MPPT performance based on fuzzy controller to control the multilevel DC link inverter. Under the partial shading conditions, the proposed algorithm is applied on single-phase seven-level inverter with isolated maximum power point tracking techniques. The maximum power recovery of photovoltaic sources is enabled by several maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques like modified perturb and observe (P&amp;O), incremental conductance and voltage hold P&amp;O. The spectral quality of the inverter output is observed through the simulation studies of MATLAB/Simulink working platform.

  abstract     = {The rapid volume of digit texts and images motivates researchers to build solid and efficient prediction models to recognize such media. The Arabic language is considered one of the difficult languages regarding the way of writing characters and digits. Recent research focuses on such language for building predictive approaches to recognize written materials. The Arabic (Indian) digit recognition task has been a challenging task and has gained more attention from researchers who build optimal predictive models from historical images that are used in many applications. However, transfer learning approaches exploit deep pre-trained models that could be re-used for similar tasks. So, in this paper, we propose an adapted deep hybrid transfer model developed using two well-known pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN) models. These are further adapted by adding recurrent neural networks especially long short-term memory (LSTM) architectures to detect Arabic (Indian) Handwritten Digits (AHD). The CNN model learns the relevant features of Arabic (Indian) digits, while the sequence learning process in the LSTM layers extracts long-term dependence features. The experimental results, using popular datasets, show significant performance obtained by the adapted transfer models with accuracy reached up to 98.92\% as well as with precision and recall values at most cases reached to 100\% with statistical t test using p-value ( $$p\le 0.05$$ ) compared to baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {The diagnosis of cancer is presently undergoing a change of paradigm for the diagnostic panel using molecular biomarkers. MicroRNA (miRNA) is one of the most important genomic datasets presenting the genome sequences. Since several studies have shown the relationship between miRNAs and cancers, data mining and machine learning methods can be incorporated to extract a large amount of knowledge from cancer genomic datasets. However, previous research works on the identification of cancers from miRNAs have made it possible to diagnose cancer, and the accuracy of some classes is not quite satisfactory. Therefore, this research is aimed at promoting a super-class (meta-label) approach and deep learning in a three-phase method to diagnose cancers from miRNAs. The steps in the first phase of the proposed method, named Representation learning, are partitioning data into super-classes, meta-data creation and super-classes classification. This phase helps data to be split into some subsets to improve classification accuracy. In other words, the first phase groups labels based on the separability of classes into a meta-label, and then a multi-label learner is built to predict these meta-labels. In the second phase, a feature selection to reduce the dimensions of the problem is applied to each super-class to help to focus the attention of an induction algorithm in those features that are more important to predict the target concept. In the third phase of the proposed method, an evolutionary deep neural network for the classification of labels in each super-class is performed. The last two phases are done separately for each subset in which five super-classes and subsequently five deep neural networks are trained. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method achieved more efficient results than 19 recent machine learning methods. Despite the fact that evaluating the dataset which consists of 29 types of cancers provides a more complicated situation for the convolutional neural network to be learned, the performance of the method is noticeably better than other existing methods. The other success which can be considered here is a significant reduction in running time comparing to other methods.},

Then, the intelligent background music system is applied to the Intelligent Home. On this basis, a feature extraction algorithm based on the middle-level feature structure is proposed, which extracts the underlying features of the scene images. Afterward, the critical functional components of the intelligent background music system are explained. Based on the actual operations, an intelligent background music system is designed based on deep learning and IoT. The results show that the recognition rate of indoor scenarios by the middle-level feature construction-based feature extraction algorithm is the highest, which is about 87.6\%. The Gabor feature algorithm classifies and identifies the scenarios, and its recognition rate is always around 20\%. In the bathroom, the recognition effect of the saliency map feature algorithm is similar to that of the middle-level feature construction-based feature extraction algorithm; however, in the bedroom, the recognition effect of the middle-level feature construction-based feature extraction algorithm is significantly better due to problems such as the lighting and room orientation. The effects of middle-level feature construction-based feature extraction algorithm on the classification and recognition of indoor scenarios are sound. In contrast, the proposed feature extraction algorithm based on deep learning has an optimal effect. The designed and implemented intelligent background music system is stable and effective, which provides a new idea and a new theoretical basis for the future research of intelligent background music system.},

  abstract     = {Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of millions of deaths across the world, mainly due to growth of drug-resistant strains. Anti-tubercular peptides may facilitate an alternate way to combat antibiotic tolerance. This study describes a novel approach for enhancing the prediction of anti-tubercular peptides by feature extraction from sequence of the peptides, selection of optimal features from the extracted features, and selection of suitable learning algorithm. Firstly, we extract different sequence features by using iFeature web server. Then, the optimal features are obtained by using a novel divergence measure-based intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets-assisted feature selection technique. Furthermore, an attempt has been made to develop models using different machine learning techniques for enhancing the prediction of anti-tubercular (or anti-mycobacterial peptides) with other antibacterial peptides (ABP) as well non-antibacterial peptides (non-ABP). Moreover, the best prediction result is obtained by vote-based classifier. Using 80:20 percentage split, the proposed method performs well, with sensitivity of 92.0\%, 96.4\%, specificity of 83.3\%, 88.4\%, overall accuracy of 87.80\%, 92.90\%, Mathews correlation coefficient of 0.757, 0.857, AUC of 0.922, 0.914, and g-means of 87.5\%, 92.3\% for anti-tubercular and ABP (primary dataset), anti-tubercular and non-ABP (secondary dataset), respectively. Finally, we have evaluated the performances of different machine learning algorithms by using the reduced training sets as produced by our proposed feature selection technique as well as already existing intuitionistic fuzzy rough set based and ensemble feature selection technique. Moreover, the performance of our proposed approach is evaluated on few benchmark and AMP datasets. From the experimental results, it can be observed that our proposed method is outperforming the previous methods.},

The diversity, discrimination, and inevitable uncertainty due to human intervention characterize such problems that add to this complexity. To circumvent this challenge, there is an urge for an appropriate knowledge representation and decision-making approaches. The present paper is concerned with a prescriptive approach to GDM that can aid a group of decision-makers (DMs) to arrive at a decision. To this end, the recent concept of probabilistic linguistic term set is utilized. The discrimination among the alternatives, as in the real world, are mimicked using an integrated framework that adopts CRITIC and variance methods for attribute weight calculation, Gini index for calculating the weights of DMs, Maclaurin symmetric mean for aggregating preferences, and weighted distance-based approximation for prioritization of alternatives. A real-world problem on electric bike selection illustrates the usefulness of the proposed work. Finally, comparative analysis with extant methods demonstrates the technical results, and it is inferred that the proposed work is (i) highly consistent (from Spearman correlation) and (ii) produces broad rank values (from standard deviation) that could be efficiently discriminated for rational decision-making and backup management during critical situations.},

  abstract     = {Definitive optimization algorithms are not able to solve high-dimensional optimization problems because the search space grows exponentially with the problem size and an exhaustive search will be impractical. Therefore, approximate algorithms are applied to solve them. A category of approximate algorithms are meta-heuristic algorithms. They have shown an acceptable efficiency to solve these problems. Among them, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the well-known swarm intelligence algorithms to optimize continuous problems. A transfer function is applied in this algorithm to convert the continuous search space to the binary one. The role of the transfer function in binary PSO (BPSO) is very important to enhance its performance. Several transfer functions have been proposed for BPSO such as S-shaped, V-shaped, linear and other transfer functions. However, BPSO algorithm can sometimes find local optima or show slow convergence speed in some problems because of using the velocity of PSO and these transfer functions. In this study, a novel transfer function called x-shaped BPSO (XBPSO) is proposed to increase exploration and exploitation of BPSO in the binary search space. The transfer function uses two functions and improved rules to generate a new binary solution. The proposed method has been run on 33 benchmark instances of the 0–1 multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP), two discrete maximization functions and 23 minimization functions. The results have been compared with some well-known BPSO and discrete meta-heuristic algorithms. The results showed that x-shaped transfer function considerably increased the solution accuracy and convergence speed in BPSO algorithm. The average error of compared algorithms on all 0–1 MKP benchmark instances indicated that XBPSO has the minimum error of 8.9\%. Also, the mean absolute error (MAE) obtained by XBPSO on two discrete maximization functions is 0.45. Moreover, the proposed transfer function provides superior solutions in 18 functions from 23 minimization functions.},

However, when multiple independent bodies of evidence with conflict are aggregated by Dempster’s rule of combination, the counterintuitive results can be generated. Evidence discounting is proved to be an efficient way to eliminate the counterintuitive combination results. Following the discounting ideas, a new combination approach based on fuzzy discounting is put forward. Both the conflict between bodies of evidence and the uncertainty of a body of evidence itself are taken into account to determine the discounting factors. Jousselme’s evidence distance is used to represent conflict between bodies of evidence, and discriminability measure is defined to represent uncertainty of a body of evidence itself. Consider that both the evidence distance and the discriminability measure are semantically fuzzy. Thus, fuzzy membership functions are defined to describe both of them, and a fuzzy reasoning rule base is constructed to derive the discounting factors. Numerical examples indicate that this new combination approach proposed can achieve fast convergence speed and is robust to disturbing evidences, i.e., it is an effective method to process conflicting evidences combination.},

Then, some desirable properties of the proposed T-SFWAI and T-SFWGI operators and some special cases of the generalized T-spherical fuzzy interaction aggregation operators are discussed in detail. Secondly, for the situations where the information about the weights of criteria is partly known or completely unknown, we establish two optimization models to determine the weights of criteria based on the maximizing deviation method and Lagrange function method, respectively. Thirdly, the traditional TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multi-criteria decision-making) approach is extended to solve MCGDM problem under the T-spherical fuzzy environment by defining the distance between T-SFNs, score function and accuracy function of T-spherical fuzzy number. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the application of the extended TODIM approach, and further the sensitivity analysis and comparison analysis are carried out to demonstrate the influence of parameter on the final result and the effectiveness of the extended method.},

Examples of compositional data in the real world include a vector with each entry representing the weight of a stock in an investment portfolio, or the relative concentration of air pollutants in the environment. In this study, we developed a Convex Clustering approach for grouping Compositional data. Convex clustering is desirable because it provides a global optimal solution given its convex relaxations of hierarchical clustering. However, when directly applied to compositions, the clustering result offers little interpretability because it ignores the unit-sum constraint of compositional data. In this study, we discuss the clustering of compositional variables in the Aitchison framework with an isometric log-ratio (ilr) transformation. The objective optimization function is formulated as a combination of a $$L_2$$ -norm loss term and a $$L_1$$ -norm regularization term and is then efficiently solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Based on the numerical simulation results, the accuracy of clustering ilr-transformed data is higher than the accuracy of directly clustering untransformed compositional data. To demonstrate its practical use in real applications, the proposed method is also tested on several real-world datasets.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a framework to solve the dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows. This problem involves determining the minimum cost routes of a homogeneous fleet for meeting the demand for a set of customers within time windows. In addition, new customers can be assigned to vehicles during the execution of the routes. A framework is based on two phases: a priori where the routes are obtained for the known customers using static routing, and a posteriori where routes are re-optimized repeatedly during the planning horizon either continuously or periodically. The framework was validated using seven algorithm variants based on insertion heuristic, ant colony optimization, variable neighborhood descent, and random variable neighborhood descent, which were adapted to solve a posteriori phase. The best algorithm is a hybrid version that combines an improved version of the multiple ant colony systems with a random variable neighborhood descent. Computational results show that most of the algorithms are competitive regarding the state of the art with the best results in the objective of minimizing the number of unserved customers.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection, which plays an important role in high-dimensional data analysis, is drawing increasing attention recently. Finding the most relevant and important features for classifications are one of the most important tasks of data mining and machine learning, since all of the datasets have irrelevant features that affect accuracy rate and slow down the classifier. Feature selection is an optimization process, which improves the accuracy rate of data classification and reduces the number of selected features. Applying too many features both requires a large memory capacity and leads to a slow execution speed. Feature selection algorithms are often responsible to decide which features should be selected to be used during a classification algorithm. Traditional algorithms seemed to be inefficient due to the complexity of dimensions of the problem, thus evolutionary algorithms were used to improve the problem solving process. The algorithm proposed in this paper, chaotic cuckoo optimization algorithm with levy flight, disruption operator and opposition-based learning (CCOALFDO), is applied to select the optimal feature subspace for classification. It reduces the randomization in selecting features and avoids getting stuck in local optimum solutions which lead to a more interesting feature subset. Extensive experiments are conducted on 20 high-dimensional datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. The results showed the superiority of the proposed method to state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy rate. In addition, they prove the ability of the CCOALFDO in selecting the most relevant features for classification tasks. Thus, it is a reasonable solution in handling noise and avoiding serious negative impacts on the classification accuracy rate in real world datasets.},

  abstract     = {Most production scheduling problems, including standard flexible job shop scheduling problems, assume that machines are continuously available. However, in most cases, due to preventive maintenance activities, machines may not be available for a certain time. Meanwhile, in the entire workshop production process, the transportation process of workpieces cannot be ignored. Therefore, the impact of transportation on the production planning should be considered in the scheduling process. To consider both preventive maintenance and transportation processes in the flexible job shop scheduling problem, this paper proposes a flexible job shop scheduling problem considering preventive maintenance activities and transportation processes and establishes a multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling model optimizing the total energy consumption and total makespan. Furthermore, a multi-region division sampling strategy-based multi-objective optimization algorithm integrated with a genetic algorithm and a differential evolution algorithm (MDSS-MOGA-DE) is proposed to solve the model. In the proposed algorithm, a multi-region division sampling strategy and two evaluation functions are utilized to improve the diversity of solutions. In addition, this paper combines a genetic operation and a differential operation to further enhance the search ability of the algorithm. The validity of the algorithm is verified by a real case. The computational results reveal that the proposed model and algorithm obtain appropriate results and have the potential to be applied to other similar problems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the water quality of lakes has been deteriorating, and the water eutrophication phenomenon is particularly serious. Therefore, it is of great significance to evaluate the water eutrophication of lakes accurately to achieve water protection management. Numerous mechanistic or data-driven methods have been proposed to perform evaluations of the water eutrophication status. However, issues with these methods must still be solved, such as the use of unreasonable thresholds for the water eutrophication levels based on arbitrary numerical values and inaccurate threshold intervals in the water eutrophication evaluation criteria. To solve these problems, an integrated water eutrophication evaluation algorithm is proposed in this study. An evaluation model based on a multidimensional trapezoidal cloud model is first established, where numerical intervals are employed to characterize the thresholds of different water eutrophication levels instead of arbitrary numerical values. The Atanassov’s interval-value intuition language numbers are introduced to identify the model parameters, which are calculated based on the data of a specific lake rather than relying on inaccurate classification threshold intervals. Finally, the water quality data of Qionghai were used to validate the proposed method. Experimental results showed that this method can provide a more accurate and reasonable evaluation of water eutrophication compared with other methods.},

The novel algorithm proposed in this paper is called the intersect mutation global harmony search algorithm (IMGHSA), which has been tested and evaluated on a set of well-known benchmark functions. The IMGHSA is compared with several improved variants of the HS algorithm, such as the basic version of harmony search (HS), improved differential harmony search, generalized opposition-based learning with global harmony search , and novel global harmony search.

Computer-aided diagnosis requires the automated classification of retinal artery and vein for diagnosing the progression of diseases. In this paper, a supervised classification with Bat algorithm is proposed to discriminate the artery and vein vessels in the retinal fundus images. A novel feature vector space, including both additive colour space as well as luminous chromaticity model colour space, is constructed.

  abstract     = {Continuous exposure to stress leads to many health problems and substantial economic loss in companies. A lot of attention has been given to the development of wearable systems for stress monitoring to tackle its long-term effects such as confusion, high blood pressure, insomnia, depression, headache and inability to take decisions. Accurate detection of stress from physiological measurements embedded in wearable devices has been the primary goal in the healthcare industry. Advanced sensor devices with a high sampling rate have been proven to achieve high accuracy in many earlier works. However, there has been a little attempt to employ consumer-based devices with a low sampling rate, which potentially degrades the performance of detection systems. In this paper, we propose a set of new features, local maxima and minima (LMM), from heart rate variability and galvanic skin response sensors along with the voting and similarity-based fusion (VSBF) method, to improve the detection performance. The proposed feature set and fusion method are first tested on the acquired dataset which is collected using the wrist-worn devices with a low sampling rate in workplace environments and validated on a publicly available dataset, driveDB from PhysioNet. The experimental results from both datasets prove that the LMM features can improve the detection accuracy for different classifiers in general. The proposed VSBF method further boosts the recognition accuracy by 5.69\% and 2.90\% in comparison with the AdaBoost, which achieves the highest accuracy as a single classifier on the acquired, and the DriveDB dataset, respectively. Our analyses show that the stress detection system using the acquired dataset yields an accuracy of 92.05\% and an F1 score of 0.9041. Based on the analyses, a soft real-time system is implemented and validated to prove the applicability of the proposed work for stress detection in a real environment.},

  abstract     = {With Chinese economic development in a new normal state, micro and small corporations have increasingly played an important role. The credit evaluation for micro and small corporations can contribute to efficient financial decisions. Traditional methods for the corporate credit evaluation rarely consider fuzzy features of micro and small entrepreneurs. Since the credit evaluation procedure for entrepreneurs consists of some alternatives and influential indicators, it can be recognized as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. To better express uncertainty information, a four-branch fuzzy set (FBFS) is presented to deal with the issue, which is characterized by a truth-membership function, an unknown-membership function and a falsity-membership function. In the paper, to handle the MCDM problems under four-branch fuzzy environments, the evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) method is extended and utilized. These obvious improvement places include integrating an interval weight vector, determining an average solution, transforming a decision matrix and analyzing a change trend of the coefficients. To demonstrate the applicability and rationality of the proposed method in practice, an illustrative example is implemented, concerning a credit evaluation for some micro and small entrepreneurs. Its feasibility and validity are further verified by a sensitivity analysis and a comparative analysis. The results show the FBFSs and extended EDAS method can well match the reality and appropriately handle the credit evaluation problems for micro and small entrepreneurs.},

  abstract     = {Multicore processors that support multithreading techniques have many advantages, including processors’ utilization, responsiveness, resource sharing, and economical usage of threads. Thus, to have these advantages, programming languages must support multithreading programming. Unfortunately, this technique is not compatible with old programs since most of the old program codes have been prepared sequentially. Inevitably, this posed a challenge when attempts were made to convert old sequential codes into multithreading codes. Despite the existence of several approaches of multithreading, differences do exist in their overhead, efficiency, and speedup, thereby underpinning the need for further optimization. Thus, a chemical reaction optimizer demonstrates the efficacy of its optimization in several problems. Against this backdrop, this paper presents a chemical reaction optimizer for the multithreading scheduling (CROTS) technique that generates multithreaded code while considering a sequential one. CROTS technique has been evaluated using several performance metrics, such as the number of steps, execution time, speedup, efficiency, cost, and percentage of error. Experimental results show that the maximum speedup achieved by CROTS is 11.98 upon the usage of 32 threads, with an average percentage of error being 14.56\% in regard to the comparison between experimental and analytical cost results. Furthermore, after comparing CROTS with intermediate representation based on diKernel (KIR), it has been established that it can accommodate more threads and attain greater speedup. For example, the experiments show that when applying both approaches CROTS and KIR using 32 threads on dataset M7000, CROTS attains a speedup of 11.71, that is, about tripled the speedup achieved by KIR, which is 3.77.},

  abstract     = {The classical methods for solving fuzzy equations are very limited because, often, there are no solutions or very strong conditions for the equations it is placed to have a solution. In addition, the solution’s support obtained in these methods is large. All of this is due to the consideration of operations related to equations based on the principle of extension, which is due to the absence of ineffective members. These high points are our motive for achieving a new approach to solving fuzzy equations. We will solve the fuzzy equations, taking into account the fuzzy operations involved in the equation based on the transmission average by Abbasi et al. (J Intell Fuzzy Syst 29:851–861, 2015). In this paper, a computational procedure is proposed to solve the fuzzy equations that meets the defects of previous techniques, specially reluctant to question whether the answer is valid in the equation. The proposed approach is implemented on the fuzzy equations as $$AX+B=C$$ , $$AX^{2}+BX+C=D$$ , $$AX^{3}+BX^{2}=CX$$ . At the end, it is shown that the solution of the proposed method in comparison with other methods of solving fuzzy equations are more realistic, that is, they have smaller support.},

A new nonlinear demand function has been introduced, which depends on the stock, selling price and product quality. The realistic reasons come from logistical function and entry into the initial demand for the product and the reliance on uncertain advertising rates, uncertain stock rates, uncertain selling prices and uncertain product quality. In order to control and test the stability, the model needs to be defuzzified. The concept of granular differentiability has been applied to defuzzification. Granular differentiability is the new definition of fuzzy derivatives based on the function of horizontal membership. For the first time in this paper, we have used the granular differentiation method in production inventory systems. We analyzed vaguely optimized controls in terms of granular differentiation analytically and numerically.},

  abstract     = {With massive growth in decision-making theory, representation of preference information plays an indispensable role. To rationally handle uncertainty, scholars presented different ideas of which hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) is a good choice to represent hesitancy in decision makers’ (DMs) preferences. The challenge with HFLTS is that it cannot be used for representing complex linguistic terms. To better circumvent this challenge, double-hierarchy HFLTS (DHHFLTS) is presented. Motivated by the power of DHHFLTS in expressing complex linguistic terms by using two linguistic hierarchies, a decision framework is proposed under the DHHFLTS context. Initially, the framework presents a new aggregation operator called simple double-hierarchy frequency match aggregation operator for sensible aggregation of DMs’ preference information. Later, the mathematical programming model is extended under the DHHLTS context for rational estimation of attribute weight with partially known information. Also, the popular Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje ranking method is extended under the DHHFLTS context for the selection of a suitable object from the set of objects. Finally, the proposed decision framework is validated for its practicality by demonstrating two numerical examples viz., green supplier selection problem and renewable energy source selection problem. Also, the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed framework are realized by comparison with other methods.},

A novel hybrid neural network (denote by E-STERNN) is proposed through combining Elman recurrent neural network model with stochastic time strength (ST-ERNN), and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is also introduced to improve the performance of forecasting neural network system for energy markets. ST-ERNN model is established for taking into account the weight of energy historical data with time variations. EEMD is an algorithm that decomposes any non-stationary and nonlinear time series into simple and independent time sequence. From the empirical research for four global energy market prices, the proposed hybrid E-STERNN model is verified to have higher prediction accuracy compared with the original ERNN and the ST-ERNN models. Moreover, a new error evaluation approach, called the exponent of multi-scale composite complexity synchronization (EMCCS), is utilized to analyze and estimate the prediction performance, and the demonstration analyses confirm that the hybrid E-STERNN model has higher prediction accuracy for global energy futures indexes.},

In this work, edge-enhanced dominant valley and discrete Tchebichef (EDV-DT) method is presented to eradicate noise and segment image into number of partitions with higher accuracy and lesser time. In EDV-DT method, an edge-enhancing anisotropic diffusion filtering technique is used to perform the preprocessing for MRI, CT and texture features. The adaptive anisotropic diffusion creates scale space and reduces the image noise without removing the texture image content (i.e., edges, lines) that is found to be essential for texture image segmentation. Followed by preprocessing, histogram dominant peak valley segmentation technique is applied to segment the localization of region of interest. Valleys in histogram for the preprocessed images help in segmenting the texture image into equal-sized texture regions. Finally, with the segmented images, discrete Tchebichef moment feature extraction is applied to extract relevant features from the segmented texture image for reducing the dimensionality. This in turn helps in improving the feature extraction rate. Further a deep convolution multinomial logarithmic-based image classification (DCML-IC) model is presented for predicting results via positive and negative fact classification.

The proposed inverter is the combination of a buck–boost converter and an H-bridge inverter (B2H multilevel inverter). This system produces a constant AC output voltage with multilevels for a PV connected system with few number of switches. With the proposed inverter, the constant output voltage level is obtained from the PV system irrespective of the variable irradiance. Any number of levels is achieved by varying the duty cycle of the buck–boost converter over a wide range using an n-level generation algorithm. Thus, many numbers of levels can be attained in the output voltage which reduces the THD significantly. The voltage regulation process is performed by designing an optimized fractional-order proportional integral and derivative (FOPID) controller. The FOPID controller provides improved voltage regulation characteristics through the optimization of parameters of controller with the use of modified flower pollination algorithm. The proposed configuration is designed and implemented in MATLAB Simulink. The quality of output, their harmonics and the output resolution time are evaluated for various input voltages and for various numbers of output levels.},

These input features can be considered for the prediction of symptoms whether they belong to AD or normal cognitive impairment due to aging. In the proposed study, the hypothesis is derived for supervised learning methods such as multivariate linear regression, logistic regression, and SVM. Feature scaling and normalization are performed with features as initial steps for applying the parameters to derive the hypothesis. Performance metrics are analyzed with the implementation results. The present work is applied to 1000 baseline assessment data from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies that give conversion prediction.

Initially, the tree knapsack problem is considered as an intentional islanding issue and therefore the OCSO algorithm is employed in solving such shortcomings. In OCSO approach, the opposition-based generation jumping and population initialization concept are used in crow search optimizer for improving the convergence profile and computational speed. In next process, island feasibility is verified by means of conducting power flow computation and providing significant modifications. Six distributed generations containing IEEE 69-bus test system are employed in validating experimentally the efficiency of the proposed approach, and comparison was done for the obtained results with the other existing approaches.

Utilizing these parameters, the objective function is characterized and solved by MEHA method.

The existence of symmetry has a profound and far-reaching impact on the properties of solution of chaotic dynamical systems. The relation between the KR chaotic attractor with twofold symmetry and its projected image without symmetry is shown in this article. Chaotic behavior of KR flow is studied through Lyapunov spectrum and boundedness to specify the chaotic region. Moreover, the computation of the Hamilton energy shows that KR flow depends on all its variables and, therefore, enough energy is critical to generate wings of KR flow.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a complete ranking method for interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IVIFNs) is introduced by using a score function and three types of entropy functions. This work is motivated by the work of Lakshmana Gomathi Nayagam et al. (Soft Comput 21, 7077–7082, 2017) in which a novel non-hesitant score function for the theory of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets was introduced. The authors claimed that the proposed non-hesitant score function could overcome the shortcomings of some familiar methods. By using some examples, they pointed out that the non-hesitant score function is better compared with Sahin’s and Zhang et al.’s approaches. It is pointed out that although in some specific cases, the cited method overcomes the shortcomings of several of the existing methods mentioned, it also created new defects that can be solved by other methods. The main aim of this study is to give a complete ranking method for IVIFNs which can rank any two arbitrary IVIFNs. At last, two examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method are provided.},

  abstract     = {Every year a huge amount of money is invested by the football clubs in the transfer window period to hire or release players. Estimating players’ value in the transfer market is a crucial task for the managers of the clubs. Also, it is one of the attractive aspects of football for fans. Tranfermarkt.com is a reference website that determines the transfer fee of the players based on its members’ opinions. The limitation of this website has attracted the attention of data scientists in recent years, resulting in creating datasets and data-driven estimating methods. In this paper, a novel method for estimating the value of players in the transfer market, based on the FIFA 20 dataset, is proposed. The proposed method has two phases. In the first phase, the dataset is clustered using an automatic clustering method called APSO-clustering. This automatic clustering method, which can detect the proper number of clusters, has divided the dataset into 4 clusters automatically indicating the position of the players: goalkeepers, midfielders, defenders, and strikers. In the second phase, a hybrid regression method which is a combination of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector regression (SVR), is used to build a prediction model for each clusters’ data points. In this hybrid method, PSO is used for feature selection and parameter tuning of SVR. The achieved results show that the proposed method can estimate the players’ value with an accuracy of 74\%. Comparing the performance of PSO with 3 other metaheuristics, the results demonstrated the superiority of PSO over GWO, IPO, and WOA.},

  abstract     = {The use of wind turbines to generate electricity is growing worldwide. They comprise an extended area of hundreds of square miles, making the inspection process difficult and time-consuming. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using a drone, or also known as unmanned aircraft systems, for inspecting wind turbines. Motivated by leveraging drone technology, this paper provides a routing optimization model to reduce the total operation time for inspecting a wind farm. We assume that one drone and one ground vehicle which carries the drone and extra batteries and charging equipment are available. The optimization model is solved in two steps. The first step clusters the wind turbines and optimizes the drone routing in each cluster by solving the classical traveling salesman problem using an integer linear programming model. The second step optimizes the ground vehicle routing by solving the equality generalized traveling salesman problem using an integer linear programming model. We test our proposed model using three case studies created by using actual wind farm locations. We compare the results with two models. One model assumes no clustering of the wind turbines, and the other model uses a greedy approach for determining the ground vehicle route. The results show that the proposed model is more efficient at different flight speeds and endurances. Also, we confirm that the efficiency increases as the drone flies faster or it has longer flight endurance.},

  abstract     = {Link prediction is used to predict future links in complex networks. Traditional methods proposed for link prediction make estimates based on similarity measurements, taking into account only the instant topological structure of the network. However, especially in dynamic networks, the activity of nodes varies over time, so it is not enough to measure similarity from topological properties for a good prediction process. Accordingly, the success rate is low in prediction processes where the power of the nodes in the network is not sufficiently reflected. In this study, a novel link prediction model called “Link Prediction Based on Node Weighting in Complex Networks” is proposed to overcome the mentioned problems. Unlike using weights between nodes, the proposed model is based on calculating the own weights of the nodes and making the link prediction. The weighting process includes factors such as eigenvector centrality, experience, continuity that can reveal the power of nodes over time. The model consists of two parts. The first part is node weighting, which calculates the strength of nodes in the network. The second part is the node-weighted link prediction process, where node weights are used to predict future links. Scientific collaboration data at IEEE Xplore and Australian Open Tennis Tournaments data were used to test the success of the proposed model. In experimental studies conducted in networks created from different time periods, it has been determined that the proposed method gives more successful results than the latest technology methods according to the AUC metric.},

By combining the advantages of fractional modeling, kernel function methods and grey models, we derived the theoretical framework of FKGM. The parameters of FKGM were obtained using particle swarm optimization algorithm. Then, FKGM was applied in a case study of a landslide in Hubei, China. The engineering geological characteristics of the landslide were analyzed, and seven factors including rainfall and the rate of the reservoir water-level change were selected as inputs. The results show that the mean absolute percentage error and mean square error of FKGM are smaller than those of the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and the classical grey prediction model—GM(1,1). The influence of the FKGM parameters was investigated. Our results indicate that FKGM can be applied to reliably predict large deformation of landslides.},

These two learning strategies have outstanding performance in improving the uniformity and diversity of obtained Pareto front. The extreme solutions, compromise solution and three metrics obtained by MOLBSA are further compared with those of well-known multi-objective optimization algorithms in IEEE 30-bus 6-unit test system and 10-unit test system.

  abstract     = {The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) rule is a simple and effective nonparametric classification algorithm in pattern classification. However, it suffers from several problems such as sensitivity to outliers and inaccurate classification decision rule. Thus, a local mean-based k-nearest neighbor classifier (LMKNN) was proposed to address these problems, which assigns the query sample with a class label based on the closest local mean vector among all classes. It is proven that the LMKNN classifier achieves better classification performance and is more robust to outliers than the classical KNN classifier. Nonetheless, the unreliable nearest neighbor selection rule and single local mean vector strategy in LMKNN classifier severely have negative effect on its classification performance. Considering these problems in LMKNN, we propose a globally adaptive k-nearest neighbor classifier based on local mean optimization, which utilizes the globally adaptive nearest neighbor selection strategy and the implementation of local mean optimization to obtain more convincing and reliable local mean vectors. The corresponding experimental results conducted on twenty real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed classifier achieves better classification performance and is less sensitive to the neighborhood size $$k$$ compared with other improved KNN-based classification methods.},

Further, bagged decision tree (BDT) is used to fine-tune the estimate. Unlike existing techniques, the proposed approach does not require internal vehicle parameters from manufacturer and can easily learn complex patterns even from noisy data.

In DFWPSO, a dynamic explosion amplitude mechanism based on the evolution speed of population, which is dynamically adjusted by evaluating the evolution speed of fitness in each iteration process, is designed to control the global and local searching information. Moreover, a new nonlinear minimal amplitude check strategy based on function decreasing is designed to obtain appropriate amplitude. Furthermore, a new firework updating mechanism based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is implemented to accelerate the convergence of algorithm and cut down on computing resources. In addition, the selection operator of FWA is abandoned and all fireworks are updated by velocity and current location in each iteration process. To verify the performance of the proposed DFWPSO algorithm, three groups of the benchmark functions are used and tested for experiments. Compared with other variants of FWA and PSO variants, results show that the proposed algorithm performs competitively and effectively.},

Moreover, media advertising and manufacturer’s desire for accepting massive payments made us take into account the advertising as another factor influencing the demand. By an agreement between the manufacturer and the retailer, the costs of advertising and raising the level of the product quality are shared by two agreed rates. Two numerical examples are considered and the associated results are analyzed under fuzzy and crisp conditions when customers are sensitive or insensitive to the quality of the product.

  abstract     = {Visual decoding is a critical way to understand the face perception mechanism of the brain in the neuroscience field. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a completely noninvasive measurement technique that provides information about brain cortical functioning using the magnetic field of neuronal electrical activity. These neuromagnetic signals measured by MEG may emerge as a result of a visual stimulus during the brain decoding process for the face perception mechanism. In this research study, two classes of visual stimuli (face/scrambled face), including 9414 trials in total, were used. In order to obtain meaningful data from noisy MEG recordings, feature extraction approaches and classification systems are required. For the purpose of feature extraction, the Riemannian approach, characterized by its competitive nature, has been used. A probabilistic neural network and a multilayer neural network structures were proposed to classify magnetoencephalography signals. The obtained results were presented comparatively with the results of prior studies using the same dataset. The classification accuracies of 82.36\% and 77.78\% were achieved for the probabilistic neural network and multilayer neural network, respectively. Moreover, the probabilistic neural network classifier could be expected to be an alternative method to other competing methods. Because PNN does not use the back-propagation algorithm, so there is no need to train the network with the whole dataset. Thus, the classification process is performed faster.},

These technologies have penetrated production systems and converted them smart. However, this transformation did not only affect production systems, but also differentiated supplier selection processes. In the supplier selection process, the usage of new technologies along with traditional and green criteria extensively has been investigated in recent years. This paper aims to develop a new group decision-making approach based on Industry 4.0 components for selecting the best green supplier by integrating AHP and TOPSIS methods under the Pythagorean fuzzy environment. In the proposed approach, judgments of different experts are expressed by linguistic terms based on Pythagorean fuzzy numbers. The interval-valued Pythagorean Fuzzy AHP method is utilized to determine the criteria weights. The Pythagorean Fuzzy TOPSIS method based on the distances of suppliers is applied to obtain the ranking of the suppliers and determine the most suitable one. Finally, a real case study on an agricultural tools and machinery company is presented to indicate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed selection approach.},

Then, a critic NN is used to solve the event-triggered Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equation for multi-player zero-sum game. Meanwhile, the optimal control law and the worst disturbance law are approximated with the help of critic NN only, respectively. Compared with time-triggered method, the developed control law and the disturbance law are updated only when the triggering condition is violated; thus, the computational and communication burden are reduced. The Lyapunov stability analysis shows that the closed-loop system can be guaranteed to be stable. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

It is a traditional and critical vision challenge to remove rain streaks from rainy images. In this paper, we introduce a deep connectionist screen blend model for single-image rain removal research. The novel deep structure is mainly composed of shortcut connections, and ends with sibling branches. The specific architecture is designed for joint optimization of heterogeneous but related tasks. In particular, a feature-level task is design to preserve object edges which tend to be lost in de-rained images. Moreover, a comprehensive image quality assessment is an additional vision task for further improvement on de-rained results. Instead of using rules of thumb, we propose an actionable method to dynamically assign appropriate weighting coefficients for all vision tasks we use. On the other hand, various factors such as haze also give rise to weak visual appeal of rainy images. To remove these adverse factors, we develop an image enhancement framework which enables the hyperparameters to be optimized in an adaptive way, and efficiently improves the perceived quality of de-rained results. The effectiveness of the proposed de-raining system has been verified by extensive experiments, and most results of our method are impressive. The source code and more de-rained results will be available online.},

The intent identification, also called intent mining, assists business organizations in identifying user’s purchase intentions. The prior works have focused on using only the CNN model to perform the feature extraction without retaining the sequence correlation. Moreover, many recent studies have applied classical feature representation techniques followed by a machine learning classifier. We examine the intention review identification problem using a deep learning model with an emphasis on maintaining the sequence correlation and also to retain information for a long time span. The proposed method consists of the convolutional neural network along with long short-term memory for efficient detection of intention in a given review, i.e., whether the review is an intent vs non-intent. The experimental results depict that the performance of the proposed system is better with respect to the baseline techniques with an accuracy of 92\% for Dataset1 and 94\% for Dataset2. Moreover, statistical analysis also depicts the effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to the comparing methods.},

  abstract     = {Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an emerging machine learning algorithm for training single-hidden-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs). The salient features of ELM are that its hidden layer parameters can be generated randomly, and only the corresponding output weights are determined analytically through the least-square manner, so it is easier to be implemented with faster learning speed and better generalization performance. As the online version of ELM, online sequential ELM (OS-ELM) can deal with the sequentially coming data one by one or chunk by chunk with fixed or varying chunk size. However, OS-ELM cannot function well in dealing with dynamic modeling problems due to the data saturation problem. In order to tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel OS-ELM, named adaptive OS-ELM (AOS-ELM), for enhancing the generalization performance and dynamic tracking capability of OS-ELM for modeling problems in nonstationary environments. The proposed AOS-ELM can efficiently reduce the negative effects of the data saturation problem, in which approximate linear dependence (ALD) and a modified hybrid forgetting mechanism (HFM) are adopted to filter the useless new data and alleviate the impacts of the outdated data, respectively. The performance of AOS-ELM is verified using selected benchmark datasets and a real-world application, i.e., device-free localization (DFL), by comparing it with classic ELM, OS-ELM, FOS-ELM, and DU-OS-ELM. Experimental results demonstrate that AOS-ELM can achieve better performance.},

  abstract     = {Training optimization plays a vital role in the development of convolution neural network (CNN). CNNs are hard to train because of the presence of multiple local minima. The optimization problem for a CNN is non-convex, hence, has multiple local minima. If any of the chosen hyper-parameters are not appropriate, it will end up at bad local minima, which leads to poor performance. Hence, proper optimization of the training algorithm for CNN is the key to converge to a good local minimum. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce an evolutionary convolution neural network (ModPSO-CNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm results in the fusion of modified particle swarm optimization (ModPSO) along with backpropagation (BP) and convolution neural network (CNN). The training of CNN involves ModPSO along with backpropagation (BP) algorithm to encourage performance improvement by avoiding premature convergence and local minima. The ModPSO have adaptive, dynamic and improved parameters, to handle the issues in training CNN. The adaptive and dynamic parameters bring a proper balance between the global and local search ability, while an improved parameter keeps the diversity of the swarm. The proposed ModPSO algorithm is validated on three standard mathematical test functions and compared with three variants of the benchmark PSO algorithm. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed ModPSO-CNN is also compared with other training algorithms focusing on the analysis of computational cost, convergence and accuracy based on a standard problem specific to classification applications, such as CIFAR-10 dataset and face and skin detection dataset.},

First, an allocation model of risk preference for education environmental resource based on rough set and data reduction classifier is developed. This model divides risk preference into the existing risk preference and non-existent risk preference. Also, it trains and optimizes the data set for the allocation of education environmental resources by rough set and data reduction classifier. Second, as the rough set and data reduction classifier may fail sometimes in predicting the allocation of education environmental resource, the fuzzy clustering based on rough set is optimized, and combined with the data reduction theory to enhance the effectiveness of allocating the education environmental resources. Finally, based on the simulation research on the allocation model of education environmental resources, the proposed algorithm can obtain a more reasonable allocation of education environmental resources, which embodies the effectiveness of the algorithm. The data reduction classifier of a rough set is used to train and optimize the data set of the allocation of education environmental resources, and visual c++ is used to realize the allocation of education environmental resources. The simulation results show that the algorithm can effectively allocate education environmental resources. The model takes into account the characteristics of the incompatibility between the evaluation of historical data and the complex index system in the evaluation decision-making. It can divide the evaluation decision-making table reasonably, and realize the objective calculation of the weights of each evaluation index based on the rough set condition through hierarchical calculation.},

Because the expressions for the Bayes estimators for the characteristics under investigation cannot be derived in the closed form, we proposed the Lindley’s approximation and Tierney and Kadane’s approximation for their numerical estimation. The comparison among the proposed estimators was made by analyzing the simulated and real-life datasets, which elucidated that the estimators are consistent. The proposed estimators, however, are insensitive with respect to change in values of hyper-parameters and model parameters. The employment of censoring schemes with tail behavior along with entropy loss function and Tierney and Kadane’s approximation provided the best results, especially in the small-to-moderate samples.},

Therefore, large-scale optimization problems and solution techniques have become an important research field. One of the most effective methods used in this research field is memetic algorithm which is the combination of evolutionary algorithms and local search methods. The local search method is an important part that greatly affects the memetic algorithm’s performance. In this paper, a novel local search method which can be used in memetic algorithms is proposed. This local search method is named as golden ratio guided local search with dynamic step size (GRGLS). To evaluate the performance of proposed local search method, two different performance evaluations were performed. In the first evaluation, memetic success history-based adaptive differential evolution with linear population size reduction and semi-parameter adaptation (MLSHADE-SPA) was chosen as the main framework and comparison is made between three local search methods which are GRGLS, multiple trajectory search local search (MTS-LS1) and modified multiple trajectory search. In the second evaluation, the improved MLSHADE-SPA (IMLSHADE-SPA) framework which is a combination of MLSHADE-SPA framework and proposed local search method (GRGLS) was compared with some recently proposed nine algorithms. Both of the experiments were performed using CEC’2013 benchmark set designed for large-scale global optimization. In general terms, the proposed method achieves good results in all functions, but it performs superior on overlapping and non-separable functions.},

We establish our demand functions relying on the price and marketing efforts, and then build six decentralized game models to examine how marketing strategies and power structures (manufacturer-dominant and retailer-dominant) affect supply chain members’ performances. It is found that, for the dominant retailer, he will make marketing efforts if free riding is not severe. As for the following retailer, in retailer-dominant structure, he will also make marketing efforts if the dominant retailer makes that, while his strategy varies with the degree of free riding in manufacturer-dominant structure. We also show that if the dominant retailer wants to make marketing efforts, he will make the same level of marketing efforts regardless of his market base and competitor’s decision.},

Deep forest (DF) is an interesting deep learning model that can perfectly work on small-sized datasets, and its performance is highly competitive with deep neural networks. In the present study, a variant of the DF called the imbalanced deep forest (IMDF) is proposed to effectively improve the classification performance of the minority class. It aims to explore the application of deep learning on small-sized imbalanced datasets. The IMDF is the cascade of multiple layers, where each layer is the ensemble of multiple units. The main idea behind the proposed method is to enable each unit of the IMDF to handle imbalanced data so that the classification results of the entire IMDF are biased toward minority class.

  abstract     = {Group decision making (GDM) under a fuzzy environment is one of the research focuses recently. Triangular fuzzy number can be used as an effective tool to capture the vagueness encountered by decision makers (DMs). In this study, a novel GDM model is proposed when triangular fuzzy multiplicative reciprocal matrices (TFMRMs) are adopted to express the opinions of DMs. A generalized consistency index is constructed to quantify the inconsistency degree of TFMRMs, which reflects the basic idea of fuzzy set theory that everything has some elasticity. The interesting properties of the new consistency index are studied, and acceptable consistency of TFMRMs is discussed. Then, based on the proposed consistency index, an operator is proposed to aggregate the individual TFMRMs. The properties of the collective TFMRM are further investigated. Finally, a new algorithm for solving a GDM problem with TFMRMs is elaborated on. Numerical results are reported to illustrate the advantages and novelty of the proposed consistency-index-driven GDM model.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a deep learning model, the deep forest (DF), was designed as an alternative to deep neural networks. Each cascade layer of the DF contains a set of random forests (RFs) with a large number of decision trees, some of which are of high redundancy and poor performance. To avoid the negative impacts of such decision trees, this paper proposes to optimize RFs in each cascade layer of the DF so as to realize a pruned deep forest (PDF) with higher performance and smaller ensemble size. In this paper, a new ordering-based ensemble pruning method is proposed based on feature vectorization and quantum walks. This method simultaneously considers the accuracy and the diversity of base classifiers, and it provides an integrated evaluation criterion for ordering base classifiers in the ensemble system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments and discussions.},

Generally, they produce good results quite close to optimal despite some weaknesses such as premature convergence and stagnation in the local optima. However, some techniques are used to improve the obtained results, one of them is the adoption of chaos theory. Including chaotic sequences in metaheuristics has proven its efficiency in previous studies by improving the performance and quality of the results obtained. In this study, we propose an improvement of the metaheuristic lightning search algorithm (LSA) by using chaos theory. In fact, the idea is to replace the values of random variables with a chaotic sequences generator. To prove the success of the metaheuristic—chaos theory association, we tested five chaotic version of lightning search algorithm on a benchmark of seven functions. Experimental results show that sine or singer map are the best choices to improve the efficiency of LSA, in particular with the lead projectile update.},

The approach is applied to a genetic algorithm (GA) and tested further on the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. The joint influence of parameters (the crossover and mutation probabilities for GA and the number of population and limit for ABC) on the performance of the algorithms is investigated. As a case study, a model parameter identification of an E. coli fed-batch cultivation process is considered. E. coli is one of the most commonly used bacteria for producing medical substances in the pharmaceutical industry. The development of an effective model of a fed-batch cultivation process is very important. The processes in a bioreactor are usually described by a system of parametric nonlinear differential equations. The model parameter identification is a difficult optimization problem, which cannot be solved by applying traditional numerical methods. Feasibilities of GA and ABC for a model parameter identification of a nonlinear fed-batch cultivation process based on real experimental data are presented. The application of the proposed Joint set-up approach leads to a significant improvement in the performance of GA and ABC. As a result, a reasonable enhancement of the E. coli cultivation model accuracy is achieved. The main advantage of the tuning procedure, which searches an optimal set of values of GA and ABC control parameters, focusing on promising intervals of variation of the parameter values and refining their ranges, is that the computational efforts are reduced by more than 60\% for the ABC algorithm and more than 90\% for GA.},

  abstract     = {Pruning decision trees is the way to decrease their size in order to reduce classification time and improve (or at least maintain) classification accuracy. In this paper, the idea of applying different pruning methods to C-fuzzy decision trees and Cluster–context fuzzy decision trees in C-fuzzy random forest is presented. C-fuzzy random forest is a classifier which we created and we are improving. This solution is based on fuzzy random forest and uses C-fuzzy decision trees or Cluster–context fuzzy decision trees—depending on the variant. Five pruning methods were adjusted to mentioned kind of trees and examined: Reduced Error Pruning (REP), Pessimistic Error Pruning (PEP), Minimum Error Pruning (MEP), Critical Value Pruning (CVP) and Cost-Complexity Pruning. C-fuzzy random forests with unpruned trees and trees constructed using each of these pruning methods were created. The evaluation of created forests was performed on eleven discrete decision class datasets (forest with C-fuzzy decision trees) and two continuous decision class datasets (forest with Cluster–context fuzzy decision trees). The experiments on eleven different discrete decision class datasets and two continuous decision class datasets were performed to evaluate five implemented pruning methods. Our experiments show that pruning trees in C-fuzzy random forest in general reduce computation time and improve classification accuracy. Generalizing, the best classification accuracy improvement was achieved using CVP for discrete decision class problems and REP for continuous decision class datasets, but for each dataset different pruning methods work well. The method which pruned trees the most was PEP and the fastest one was MEP. However, there is no pruning method which fits the best for all datasets—the pruning method should be chosen individually according to the given problem. There are also situations where it is better to remain trees unpruned.},

Here, the evaluation commonly encompasses different TSP options under various operational factors; thus, the assessment of TSPs can be considered as a rigorous multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) issue. This paper initiates a structure for the exploration of the TSPs in the Madhya Pradesh region, India. To do this, a framework associated with grey relational analysis (GRA) on intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) is planned to obtain the performance of various telecom participants. The developed approach is based on the conception of the best and worst solutions. To find the attribute weights, a divergence measure is developed and employed by relative comparisons. Additionally, to show the proficiency and practicality, a selection problem of TSPs options of Madhya Pradesh circle, India is presented within the IFSs context. By employing the developed model, an expert can enlarge tactics to enhance the performance by standard operational factors. Comparison and sensitivity analysis are considered to validate the developed approach in the prioritization of the TSPs options.},

By means of granular computing, in this article, a novel spatial–temporal fuzzy information granule (STFIG) model is proposed to achieve the multi-step forecasting of time series. From the perspective of time dimension, by using unequal division method, time series is converted into generalized time-varying fuzzy information granules, where the trend information and dispersion degree of sequence data can be quantitatively described. Moreover, in terms of spatial dimension, the fluctuation information of time series is also calculated and involved into information granules, which can further enhance the semantic representation of sequential data. In order to improve the ability of dealing with uncertainties and fuzziness in time series, the interval type-2 fuzzy set is applied in the granules model. By using synthetic data and real-life time series, experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, where abundant semantic information and better long-term predictive performance can be obtained.},

The searching ability of standard salp swarm algorithm is enhanced following the strategies in differential evolution, and hence the algorithm is named as differential evolution-based salp swarm algorithm (DESSA). Most of the existing image denoising algorithms are suitable to remove either Gaussian, Salt &amp; Pepper, or Speckle noise. Alternatively, due to the optimal combination of filters in the cascaded arrangement, the proposed denoising method exhibits its effectiveness in the removal of all three noises and the denoised images are better in terms of both quantitative analysis and visual quality. The denoising performance of the proposed method is also tested on the mixed noise which demonstrates the significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Further, the experiment on CEC 2014 benchmark functions indicates that the proposed DESSA achieves better optimal solutions than existing algorithms.},

Furthermore, we use the elliptic entropy to characterize the risk of investment and establish a mean-entropy portfolio selection model, in which the future security returns are described by uncertain random variables. Based on the chance theory, the equivalent form of the mean–entropy model is derived. To show the performance of the mean–entropy portfolio selection model, several numerical experiments are presented. We also numerically compare the mean–entropy model with the mean–variance model, the equi-weighted portfolio model, and the most diversified portfolio model by using three kinds of diversification indices. Numerical results show that the mean-entropy model outperforms the mean–variance model in selecting diversified portfolios no matter of using which diversification index.},

Consequently, associated risks involved in the treatment, recycling, disposing, and transportation of these hazardous materials have become more attractive for the researchers. In this study, we propose a new model for hazardous waste location routing problem. Appending the service time window and workload balance to the previous mathematical models can be taken into account as the major contributions of this study. Three objective functions including two systematic goals (cost and risk) and one social goal (workload balancing) have been considered for the model. Compatibility between wastes and a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, which are rarely investigated in the literature, is discussed in this paper. Since the proposed model is classified as a multi-objective model, three multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm II (PESA-II), and Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm II (SPEA-II) are employed. As two other innovations, an adaptive penalty function is developed and the PESA-II is modified by removing replicated solutions from its archive and their obtained results are discussed. Finally, by experimenting a number of test problems in different sizes, it is demonstrated that proposed modified PESA-II and SPEA-II perform better than NSGA-II in most of comparison metrics including feasible answers exploration, CPU time, spacing metric, inverted generational distance, quality metric, etc., whereas, NSGA-II creates more spread Pareto frontiers which are suitable for decision-maker to choose, from among a range of different options.},

In this paper, we propose a novel routing protocol for supervised device-data transfer from smart grid generators to the command and control center using wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. Our protocol assumes various sensor devices (temperature sensors, oil level sensor, turbine status sensors, etc.) to be employed on each generator due to their mechanical sophistication. Additionally, we introduce the ambient energy harvesting for the sensors energy replenishment to accommodate tolerable node outage. Our simulation results demonstrate promising outcome with respect to different key parameters such as message flow, energy consumption, outage frequency, remaining energy, and harvested energy.},

The proposed scheme adopts two main operations one to generate pseudorandom data block that will be used for stream cipher, and the second to create substitution and permutation tables in initial step and perform rounds for confusion and diffusion processes in block cipher. Some cryptographic tests and metrics are applied to measure the degree of security and analyze the performance of the encryption scheme.

  abstract     = {With the development of Internet, the amount of data increases exponentially. With the development of network technology, human beings have entered the era of big data. Therefore, it is very important to find valuable information from massive network data. At present, most of the network security products in the market record the system test results in the form of logs. Users can view and analyze the log information one by one to find out the suspicious behavior and carry out the next diagnosis. Finally, they can defend the identified attacks. Intrusion detection system usually stores detection results in the form of alert files. There may be a large number of redundant or false alarm information in the alarm file, so the heavy cognitive burden of users has become one of the disadvantages of traditional intrusion detection system. In consideration of the above situation, visualization technology has been introduced into the field of network security by researchers. The network visualization analysis displays the massive network data and log information in the way of graph and image, and uses the developed human vision to process the massive graphical data. Data visualization is a method of transforming abstract symbols into concrete geometric figures, which presents the results of simulation and calculation in the form of figures and images. In this paper, multi-agent model is used to build a network data visualization analysis model. The experimental results show that the method in this paper can effectively visualize a large number of network data, and the experimental results are easy to understand.},

  abstract     = {The topic predictive analytics is the ray that lightning the way to patch the gap between accuracy in decision-making by the expertise and the inexperience. In particular, the health domain is more crucial about disease prediction accuracy. The disease diagnosis by clinical practitioner correlates to his exposer toward the clinical observations of the disease. However, the perceptions of an experienced clinical practitioner on a medical record often fail to identify the premature states of the disease, which costs patient life in the sector of critical diseases such as heart diseases. Hence, contemporary computer science engineering research has more attention to define substantial predictive analytics built by machine learning toward heart disease prediction. The critical objective to define predictive analytics with minimal false alarming is centric to potential training data corpus, and the optimal feature selection. In order to these arguments, the contribution of this manuscript aimed to portray the feature selection approach to perform supervised learning and label the given patient record is prone to heart disease or not with minimal false alarming. The contribution is a dynamic n-gram Features Optimization by Discrete Weights of the feature correlation. The experimental study signified the performance of the proposed model compared to the contemporary methods of feature selection for heart disease prediction.},

  abstract     = {Due to the high competition in today’s global market, design of an efficient supply chain is necessary to achieve competitive advantages. Having concerned this issue, scheduling is one of critical concepts in supply chain management that leads to increase efficiency and customer satisfaction as well as decrease costs. Recently, build-to-order supply chain (BTO-SC) system has attracted considerable attention because of its successful implementation in high-tech companies such as Dell, BMW, Compaq, and Gateway. Despite several studies in the context of BTO-SC, there has been revealed several gaps that this study attempts to eliminate them. In this paper, a fuzzy mixed-integer linear programming optimization model is proposed for an integrated supply, production, and distribution supply chain of multi-product, multi-level, multi-plant. Because of uncertainty, imprecision and variability associated with real data, fuzzy approach is utilized for processing such information in modeling the problem. Usually, supply chain problems have conflicting objectives that should be optimized simultaneously. Thus, the proposed model aims to optimize customer satisfaction as well as chain supply costs, simultaneously. Due to high complexity and lack of proper benchmark for this problem, the model is solved by some popular multi-objective meta-heuristic algorithms. Also, Taguchi method is deployed to calibrate as well as control the parameters in four mentioned algorithms. Finally, a new framework is proposed for ranking of these algorithms use of fuzzy VIKOR method. The presented framework is an excellent comparison dashboard, and it is applicable not only for comparing multi-objective genetic algorithms but also for comparing all of multi-objective meta-heuristic algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The genetic algorithm-backpropagation neural network algorithm (GA-BP) makes full use of the advantages of genetic algorithm (GA) and BP neural network (BPNN). It has been widely used in practical problems, but it also has shortcomings such as slow convergence. Inspired by the generative adversarial network, a population competition mechanism (PCM) is proposed to improve the search ability of the GA, two populations are generated to compete, and the winning population can obtain the optimal individual from the failed population to ensure that the winning population has a sustainable advantage. The failed population will randomly generate new individuals and add new genes so as to get better individuals, through such a mechanism to ensure the rapid optimization of the entire population, avoid the risk of premature convergence, speed up the iterative speed and improve the stability of the GA. According to the characteristics of the fitness landscape, the learning rate of the BPNN is optimized, and it can change adaptively, which can effectively improve the network convergence speed and greatly reduce the time cost. We define the GA-BP that improves the learning rate based on fitness landscape as FL-GA-BP algorithm. On the basis of the FL-GA-BP algorithm, adding GA improved with PCM, we define this new algorithm as I-GA-BP algorithm, namely the I-GA-BP algorithm that combines PCM-improved GA and fitness landscape-improved BPNN. In this paper, we use two types of test functions with different characteristics and complexity to conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of the I-GA-BP algorithm. By comparing the experimental data of the three algorithms GA-BP, FL-GA-BP and I-GA-BP, it is obtained that the I-GA-BP algorithm can better escape from the local optimal solution, which is more conducive to finding the global optimal solution. It also greatly improves the convergence speed of the neural network. Finally, we briefly discussed the effect of adjusting the number of neurons on the stability of the I-GA-BP algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Minor-embedding heuristics have become an indispensable tool for compiling problems in quadratically unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) into the hardware graphs of quantum and CMOS annealing processors. While recent embedding heuristics have been developed for annealers of moderate size (about 2000 nodes), the size of the latest CMOS annealing processor (with 102,400 nodes) poses entirely new demands on the embedding heuristic. This raises the question, if recent embedding heuristics can maintain meaningful embedding performance on hardware graphs of increasing size. Here, we develop an improved version of the probabilistic-swap-shift-annealing (PSSA) embedding heuristic [which has recently been demonstrated to outperform the standard embedding heuristic by D-Wave Systems (Cai et al. in http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2741 , 2014)] and evaluate its embedding performance on hardware graphs of increasing size. For random cubic and Barábasi–Albert graphs we find the embedding performance of improved PSSA to consistently exceed the threshold of the best known complete graph embedding by a factor of 3.2 and 2.8, respectively, up to hardware graphs with 102,400 nodes. On the other hand, for random graphs with constant edge density not even improved PSSA can overcome the deterministic threshold guaranteed by the existence of the best known complete graph embedding. Finally, we prove a new upper bound on the maximal embeddable size of complete graphs into hardware graphs of CMOS annealers and show that the embedding performance of its currently best known complete graph embedding has optimal order for hardware graphs with fixed coordination number.},

  abstract     = {Emotion recognition through facial expression and non-verbal speech represents an important area in affective computing. They have been extensively studied from classical feature extraction techniques to more recent deep learning approaches. However, most of these approaches face two major challenges: (1) robustness—in the face of degradation such as noise, can a model still make correct predictions? and (2) cross-dataset generalisation—when a model is trained on one dataset, can it be used to make inference on another dataset?. To directly address these challenges, we first propose the application of a spiking neural network (SNN) in predicting emotional states based on facial expression and speech data, then investigate, and compare their accuracy when facing data degradation or unseen new input. We evaluate our approach on third-party, publicly available datasets and compare to the state-of-the-art techniques. Our approach demonstrates robustness to noise, where it achieves an accuracy of 56.2\% for facial expression recognition (FER) compared to 22.64\% and 14.10\% for CNN and SVM, respectively, when input images are degraded with the noise intensity of 0.5, and the highest accuracy of 74.3\% for speech emotion recognition (SER) compared to 21.95\% of CNN and 14.75\% for SVM when audio white noise is applied. For generalisation, our approach achieves consistently high accuracy of 89\% for FER and 70\% for SER in cross-dataset evaluation and suggests that it can learn more effective feature representations, which lead to good generalisation of facial features and vocal characteristics across subjects.},

  abstract     = {Partitional clustering is the most used in cluster analysis. In partitional clustering, hard c-means (HCM) (or called k-means) and fuzzy c-means (FCM) are the most known clustering algorithms. However, these HCM and FCM algorithms work worse for data sets in a noisy environment and get inaccuracy when the data set has different shape clusters. For solving these drawbacks in HCM and FCM, Wu and Yang (Pattern Recognit 35:2267–2278, 2002) proposed the alternative c-means clustering with an exponential-type distance that extends HCM and FCM into alternative HCM (AHCM) and alternative FCM (AFCM). In this paper, we construct a more generalization of AHCM and AFCM with Gaussian-kernel c-means clustering, called GK-HCM and GK-FCM. For theoretical behaviors of GK-FCM, we analyze the bordered Hessian matrix and then give the theoretical properties of the GK-FCM algorithm. Some numerical and real data sets are used to compare the proposed GK-HCM and GK-FCM with AHCM and AFCM methods. Experimental results and comparisons actually demonstrate these good aspects of the proposed GK-HCM and GK-FCM algorithms with its effectiveness and usefulness. Finally, we apply the GK-FCM algorithm to MRI segmentation.},

In this paper, we characterize all nth ancestors using a Boolean formula that can be computed in polynomial time. Once simplified, this formula can be exploited to easily solve all preimage and ancestor problems. This allows us to directly relate the difficulty of ancestor problems to the cost of the simplification so that new insights into computational complexity investigations can be achieved. In particular, we focus on two problems: (i) deciding whether a preimage/nth ancestor exists and (ii) finding a preimage/nth ancestor of minimal size. Our approach is constructive, it aims at finding classes of reactions systems for which the ancestor problems can be solved in polynomial time, in exact or approximate way.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel method, which is coined as ARBBPNN, for biometric-oriented face detection, based on autoregressive model with Bayes backpropagation neural network (BBPNN). Firstly, the given input colour key face image is modelled to HSV and YCbCr models. A hybrid model, called HS–YCbCr, is formulated based on the HSV and YCbCr models. The submodel, H, is divided into various sliding windows of size, 3 × 3. The model parameters are estimated for the window using the BBPNN. Based on the model coefficients, autocorrelation coefficients (ACCs) are computed. An autocorrelation test tests the significance of the ACCs. If the ACC passes the test, then it is inferred that the small image region, viz. the window, represents the texture and it is treated as the texture feature. Otherwise, it is regarded as structure, which is treated as the shape feature. The texture and shape features are formulated as feature vectors (FV) separately, and they are combined into a single FV. This process is performed for all colour submodels. The FVs of the submodels are combined into a single holistic vector, which is treated as the FV of the key face image. The key FV has twenty feature elements. The similarity of the key and target face images is examined, based on the key and target FVs, by deploying multivariate parametric statistical tests. If the FVs of the key and target images pass the tests, then it is concluded that the key and target face images are the same; otherwise, they are regarded as different. The GT, FSW, Pointing’04, and BioID datasets are considered for the experiments. In addition to the above datasets, we have constructed a dataset with face images collected from Google, and many images captured through a digital camera. It is also subjected to the experiment. The obtained recognition results show that the proposed ARBBPNN method outperforms the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {In the world of information retrieval, recognizing hand-written digits stands as an interesting application of machine learning (deep learning). Though this is already a matured field, a way to recognize digits using an effective optimization using soft computing technique is a challenging task. Training such a system with larger data often fails due to higher computation and storage. In this paper, a recurrent deep neural network with hybrid mini-batch and stochastic Hessian-free optimization (MBSHF) is for accurate and faster convergence of predictions as outputs. A second-order approximation is used for achieving better performance for solving quadratic equations which greatly depends on computation and storage. Also, the proposed technique uses an iterative minimization algorithm for faster convergence using a random initialization though huge additional parameters are involved. As a solution, a convex approximation of MBSHF optimization is formulated and its performance on experimenting with the standard MNIST dataset is discussed. A recurrent deep neural network till a depth of 20 layers is successfully trained using the proposed MBSHF optimization, resulting in a better quality performance in computation and storage. The results are compared with other standard optimization techniques like mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (MBSGD), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), stochastic Hessian-free optimization (SHF), Hessian-free optimization (HF), nonlinear conjugate gradient (NCG). The proposed technique produced higher recognition accuracy of 12.2\% better than MBSGD, 27.2\% better than SHF, 35.4\% better than HF, 40.2\% better than NCG and 32\% better than SGD on an average when applied to 50,000 testing sample size.},

  abstract     = {Optimisers for multi- or many-objective optimisation problems can be categorised as scalarisation and meta-heuristic approaches. Many of the approaches from both groups require to use a set of weighting vectors, which are expected to be as evenly distributed as possible. The current practice employs the normal-boundary intersection (NBI) method which has one disadvantage in that the number of sampling points must be the number of k-combination. This work proposes a numerical scheme called clustering-based hyperplane sampling (CBHS) to deal with such a weak point. The method is based on random sampling on a hyperplane and clustering. The classical NBI method and some of its extended versions are used to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm. The comparative results reveal that CBHS is the best performer with using longer computing time. Moreover, its real advantage is the capability of generating a set of weighting vectors with any sample size.},

  abstract     = {Customer segmentation (CS) is the most critical application in the field of customer relationship management that primarily depends on clustering algorithms. Rough k-means (RKM) clustering algorithm is widely adopted in the literature for achieving CS objective. However, the RKM has certain limitations that prevent its successful application to CS. First, it is sensitive to random initial cluster centers. Second, it uses default values for parameters $$w_{l}$$ and $$w_{u}$$ used in calculating cluster centers. To address these limitations, a new initialization method is proposed in this study. The proposed initialization mitigates the problems associated with the random choice of initial cluster centers to achieve stable clustering results. A weight optimization scheme for $$w_{l}$$ and $$w_{u}$$ is proposed in this study. This scheme helps to estimate suitable weights for $$w_{l}$$ and $$w_{u}$$ by counting the number of data points present in clusters. Extensive experiments were carried out by using several benchmark datasets to assess the performance of these proposed methods in comparison with the existing algorithm. The results reveal that the proposed methods have improved the performance of the RKM algorithm, which is validated by the evaluation metrics, namely convergence speed, clustering accuracy, Davies–Bouldin (DB) index, within/total (W/T) clustering error index and statistical significance $$t$$ test. Further, the results are compared with other promising clustering algorithms to show its advantage. A CS framework that shows the utility of these proposed methods in the application domain is also proposed. Finally, it is demonstrated through a case study in a retail supermarket.},

  abstract     = {Reactive power optimization is one of the major problems of concern in smart grid (SG) environment. Although several techniques have been proposed for reactive power optimization, demand side management (DSM) plays a vital role in smart grid networks. The main idea of this work is to address reactive power optimization by developing a smart controller for DSM by effective monitoring of real power loss in the smart grid network. The proposed smart controller is developed by formulating the DSM as an optimization problem and obtaining its solution by applying elephant herd optimization–firefly (EHO–FF) evolutionary algorithm. Further, the proposed smart controller for DSM aims to meet the power demand and limit the power flow in transmission network by adding distributed generation (DGs) units at optimal locations. The proposed work aims to improve the energy efficiency and voltage profile in the power grid network when operating under different load scenarios. The benchmark IEEE 30 bus system consisting of 6 generating units, 41 transmission lines with total load of 283.4 MW and 126.2 MVAR is used as the test system in this work. The test system is subjected to varying load pattern for 24 h in a typical day. The performance of the proposed smart controller is evaluated on the bench mark IEEE 30 bus system through program code developed in MATLAB environment. The simulation results have proved that the proposed smart controller for DSM minimizes the power loss and improves the voltage profile significantly by incorporating DG units in optimal locations. The effectiveness of the EHO–FF algorithm is analyzed by comparing the results obtained with PSO and bAT algorithm.},

The semantic information provided by this scene image is very much valuable for human beings to realize the whole environment. But the text in such natural images depicts a flexible appearance in an unconstrained environment which makes the text identification and character recognition process a more challenging one. Therefore, a weighted naïve Bayes classifier (WNBC)-based deep learning process is used in this framework to effectively detect the text and to recognize the character from the scene images. Normally, the natural scene images may carry some kind of noise in it, and to remove that, the guided image filter is introduced at the pre-processing stage. The features that are useful for the classification process are extracted using the Gabor transform and stroke width transform techniques. Finally, with these extracted features, the text detection and character recognition is successfully achieved by WNBC and deep neural network-based adaptive galactic swarm optimization. Then, the performance metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, mean absolute error, mean square error and recall metrics are evaluated to estimate the adeptness of the proposed method.},

This paper describes an optimization-based methodology for automatic parameter/center selection applicable both to the DPC and to other algorithms derived from it. The objective function is an internal/external cluster validity index, and the decisions are the parameterization of the algorithm and the choice of centers. The internal validation measures lead to an automatic parameter-tuning process, and the external validation measures lead to the so-called optimal rules, which are a tool to bound the performance of a given algorithm from above on the set of parameterizations. A numerical experiment with real data was performed for the DPC and for the fuzzy weighted k-nearest neighbor (FKNN-DPC) which validates the automatic parameter-tuning methodology and demonstrates its efficiency compared to the state of the art.},

One of the efficient control strategies of PMSM is based on ANFIS. ANFIS is very popular technique to deal with uncertainties. System dynamics in such cases can be compared with combining the proportional–integral–derivative (PID) with the Sliding Mode Controller (SMC). Simulations have been performed in MATLAB to validate the performance of the proposed model, and comparisons are made with ANFIS, SMC–PID and PID controllers compared to other controllers reported in the benchmark of the proposed controller’s efficiency. The proposed adaptive neuro-fuzzy-dependent results indicate good transient efficiency. Robustness against the robustness of adaptive neuro-fuzzy-based PID and SMC–PID controllers is satisfactory in terms of easy settling time, zero peaks overflow and zero steady state error.

In a PFSS problem, there are n jobs and m machines in series. Jobs are separated into operations on $$ m $$ different machines in series, and jobs have to follow the same machine order with the same sequence. The PFSS problem under the effects of learning and deterioration is introduced with a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. The time requirement for solving large-scale problems type of PFSS problem is exceedingly high. Therefore, well-known metaheuristic methods for the PFSS problem without learning and deterioration effects such as iterated greedy algorithms and discrete differential evolution algorithm are adapted for the problem with learning and deterioration effects in order to find a faster and near-optimal or optimal solution for the problem. Furthermore, this paper proposes a hybrid solution algorithm that is called population-based Tabu search algorithm (TSPOP) with evolutionary strategies such as crossover and mutation. The search algorithm is built on the basic structure of Tabu search and it searches for the best candidate from a solution population instead of improving the current best candidate at each iteration. Furthermore, the performances of these methods in view of solution quality are discussed in this paper by using test problems for 20, 50, and 100 jobs with 5, 10, 20 machines. Experimental results show that the proposed TSPOP algorithm outperforms the other existing algorithms in view of solution quality.},

In the most previous wind speed forecasting studies, only one wind speed signal decomposition method is considered, which is insufficient. To better deal with the wind speed time series, TSD method combining complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise with wavelet transform is firstly employed in the proposed model to preprocess the wind speed samples; then, binary-valued particle swarm optimization gravitational search algorithm is exploited as feature selection to identify and eliminate the abnormal noise signal within the input candidate matrix that is determined by partial autocorrelation function. The kernel function and the kernel parameters have great influence on the regression performance of LSSVM. To solve these problems, integrations of radial basis function, polynomial (poly) and linear kernel functions by optimal weighted coefficients are constructed as multi-kernel function for LSSVM, namely MKLSSVM, and the parameter combination is tuned by conventional PSOGSA. The feature selection and parameter optimization are realized by hybrid PSOGSA (HPSOGSA) simultaneously. Finally, comprehensive comparison and analysis are carried out using the historical wind speed data from one wind farm of China to illustrate the excellent forecasting performance of TSD–HPSOGSA–MKLSSVM.},

The algorithm calculates the mutual impact of each pair of vertices, making it possible to rank the nodes according to their importance within the system and to determine the most influential components. It produces results similar to those of the commonly used impulse method when applied to graphs that are impulse-stable in an impulse process, while overcoming the disadvantages of the impulse method in other situations. Results are always obtained regardless of impulse stability; they do not depend on the initial impulse, so that the initial values of the weights affect the calculation results. When elements in the adjacency matrix of the weighted directed graph are multiplied by a constant factor, scale invariance is not violated, and the full affect for each of the nodes scales proportionally. Several examples of analyses of weighted directed graphs, including one related to the practical problem of urban solid waste removal, are provided to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Association rule mining (ARM) is a well-known data mining scheme that is used to discover the commonly co-occurred itemsets from the transactional datasets. Two considerable steps of ARM are frequent item recognition and association rule generation. Minimum support and confidence measures are used in the generation of association rules. Many algorithms have been projected by the researchers to generate association rules. Fuzzy logic is incorporated to uncover the recurrent itemsets and interesting fuzzy association rules. In general, huge volume of datasets could be analyzed which in turn needs more number of database scans. In addition to this, all the transactions and items are not required for data analysis. Hence, the first step of this research work uses a dimensionality reduction technique which drastically reduces the size of the data set. This dimensionality reduction technique uses low variance and hash table methods. The proposed algorithm effectively identifies the significant transactions and items from the database. The issues of dimensionality reduction appear when the items in the databases are higher dimension than endure. The proposed algorithm reduces the irrelevant items and transactions from the transactional database. The proposed dimensionality reduction technique dimensionality reduction in transactions and items is compared with the extend frequent pattern (EFP) and intersection set theory EFP and dimensionality reduction using frequency count. Item reduction, transaction reduction, execution time and memory space are the performance factors. Second step proposes fuzzy and whale optimization for frequent item identification and association rule generation. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is compared with particle swarm optimization genetic algorithm and fuzzy frequent itemset-Miner. Performance metrics used in this step are number of frequent items, association rules generated, execution time and memory required.

  abstract     = {Minimum-cost capacitated fuzzy network is formulated as a fuzzy linear programming problem. A novel fuzzy linear programming formulation for minimum-cost capacitated fuzzy network where the total resource constraints are fuzzy is proposed. The proposed model is then implemented to minimize the operations cost of American Airlines. The research is helpful to identify the most profitable destinations for the American Airlines. Twelve origin/destination pairs are taken into considerations namely Atlantic (A), Latin American (L), Pacific (P) and Domestic (D). Flight operations capacity, Available Seat Miles ASM, is taken as a measure of capacity. The goal is to minimize the flight operations cost while ensuring maximum flight operations capacities to all destinations. This is followed by perspective data analytics for “What American Airline should do to be more profitable?” Perspective analytics suggest the airline to extend flight operations capacity in certain origin/destination pairs, whereas to maintain the previous approximate average capacity for those having high operations costs. The solution of the proposed fuzzy model suggests that flight operations capacity ASM can be significantly increased by 22345148 (000) with relatively small increase 1539356 (000) USD in operations cost. The fuzzy model is superior for it emphasizes to increase flight operations capacity ASM for the origin/destination pairs with minimum flight operations costs.},

  abstract     = {This research study aims to enhance the optimization accuracy of the two recently emerged metaheuristics of whale and sine–cosine optimizers by means of the balanced improvements in intensification and diversification phases of the algorithms provided by cellular automata (CA). Stagnation at the early phases of the iterations, which leads to entrapment in local optimum points in the search space, is one of the inherent drawbacks of the metaheuristic algorithms. As a favorable solution alternative to this problem, different types of cellular topologies are implemented into these two algorithms with a view to ameliorating their search mechanisms. Exploitation of the fertile areas in the search domain is maintained by the interaction between the topological neighbors, whereas the improved exploration is resulted from the smooth diffusion of the available population information among the structured neighbors. Numerical experiments have been carried out to assess the optimization performance of the proposed cellular-based algorithms. Optimization benchmark problems comprised of unimodal and multimodal test functions have been applied and numerical results have been compared with those found by some of the state-of-the-art literature optimizers including particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, artificial cooperative search and differential search. Cellular variants have been outperformed by the base algorithms for multimodal benchmark problems of Levy and Penalized1 functions. Then, the proposed cellular algorithms have been applied to two different parameter identification cases in order to test their efficiencies on real-world optimization problems. Extensive performance evaluations on different parameter optimization cases reveal that incorporating the CA concepts on these algorithms not only improves the optimization accuracy but also provides considerable robustness to acquired solutions.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of digital information, the data volume generated by humans and machines is growing exponentially. Along with this trend, machine learning algorithms have been formed and evolved continuously to discover new information and knowledge from different data sources. Learning algorithms using hyperboxes as fundamental representational and building blocks are a branch of machine learning methods. These algorithms have enormous potential for high scalability and online adaptation of predictors built using hyperbox data representations to the dynamically changing environments and streaming data. This paper aims to give a comprehensive survey of the literature on hyperbox-based machine learning models. In general, according to the architecture and characteristic features of the resulting models, the existing hyperbox-based learning algorithms may be grouped into three major categories: fuzzy min–max neural networks, hyperbox-based hybrid models and other algorithms based on hyperbox representations. Within each of these groups, this paper shows a brief description of the structure of models, associated learning algorithms and an analysis of their advantages and drawbacks. Main applications of these hyperbox-based models to the real-world problems are also described in this paper. Finally, we discuss some open problems and identify potential future research directions in this field.},

  abstract     = {Characteristics like robustness, adaptability to several load conditions, and low costs of operation and maintenance are some of the reasons three-phase induction motors are ubiquitous in industrial applications. Even so, these machines are subjected to electrical and mechanical faults which can result in malfunction. The detection of incipient faults is the focus of several recent studies because they provide information for timely decisions to avoid unplanned stops of industrial processes. A common problem of induction motors is the presence of broken rotor bars. Most of the methods of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis focus on the usage of only one type of power supply: line-connected or fed by frequency inverters. Given this situation, we present an alternative technique for the detection of broken rotor bars of three-phase induction motors regardless of the type of power supply. Our approach is based on similarity measures of the stator current signals of two motor phases in order to extract the relevant features of such signals, which are then classified using three intelligent systems: artificial neural network, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors. We performed 3310 experimental tests with motors operating in steady state, with sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal power supply, and variations of voltage unbalance levels, supply frequency, and load torque. Classification accuracy rates over 92\% of success were obtained in these tests, which validate the proposed approach.},

Meanwhile, we propose a new mechanism to introduce the hierarchical context behind emotion word information for extracting emotion cause inspired by a convolution operation. Our proposed framework can extract both enhanced represented emotion level features and context level features to better detect the emotion cause. We have conducted extensive experiments on the emotion cause dataset.

  abstract     = {Accurate wind speed forecasting (WSF) has become increasingly important to overcome the adverse effects of stochastic nature of the wind on wind power generation. This paper proposes a multi-step hybrid online WSF model by combining online sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM), optimized variational mode decomposition (OVMD) and cuckoo search optimization algorithm (CSO). OVMD decomposes the wind speed series into subseries, and CSO selects the input features for each subseries. Multi-step forecasting for each subseries is performed using OSELM model optimized by CSO. Finally, the forecasting results are obtained by the aggregate calculations. The proposed model has been examined by using 10-min average wind speed data collected in monsoon and winter seasons from a supervisory control and data acquisition system of a 1.5 MW wind turbine situated in central dry zone of Karnataka, India. The results reveal that the model proposed captures the nonlinear characteristics of the wind speed in a better manner in comparison with the batch learning approach, giving accurate wind speed forecasts. This can help wind farms to estimate the wind power in a location efficiently.},

We use the two types of representations to compare the effectiveness of support vector machines, random forest, and multi-layer perceptrons on data from 117 drives performed by 39 participants during a previous study in the high-fidelity driving simulator at the University of Guelph. Classification of mind-wandering and prediction of hazard response time was successful when compared to baseline measures. Specifically, random forest methods were most effective in both types of prediction and feature extraction supported the strongest random forest prediction of hazard response time. A discussion of the reasoning for this is included. While this has previously been studied using a single screen experimental setup, to our knowledge this is the first driving pattern-based classification of mind-wandering in a fully immersive driving simulator.},

  abstract     = {Owing to integrating the dense range of distinct electric power sources, high volume of power generation units, abrupt and continuous changes in load demand, and rising utilization of power electronics, the electric power system (EPS) is striving for high-performance control schemes to counterwork the concerns depicted above. Additionally, it is highly creditable to have the controller structure as simple as possible from a viewpoint of practical implementation. Thus, this paper describes a virgin application of fractional order proportional integral–fractional order proportional derivative (FOPI–FOPD) cascade controller for load frequency control (LFC) of electric power generating systems. The proposed controller includes fractional order PI and fractional order PD controllers connected in cascade wherein orders of integrator ( $$\lambda$$ ) and differentiator ( $$\mu$$ ) may be fractional. The gains and fractional order parameters of the controller are concurrently tuned using recently proposed dragonfly search algorithm (DSA) by minimizing the integral time absolute error (ITAE) of frequency and tie-line power deviations. DSA is the mathematical model and computer simulation of static and dynamic swarming behaviors of dragonflies in nature, and its implementation in LFC studies is very rare, unveiling additional research gap to be bridged. Performance of the advocated approach is first explored on popular two-area thermal PS with/without governor dead band (GDB) nonlinearity and then on three-area hydrothermal PS with suitable generation rate constraints. To highlight the prominence and universality of our proposal, the work is extended to single-/multi-area multi-source EPSs. Several comparisons with DSA optimized FOPID controller and the relevant recent works for each test system indicate the contribution of proposed DSA optimized FOPI–FOPD cascade controller in alleviating settling time/undershoot/overshoot of frequency and tie-line power oscillations.},

An optimal turning angle is generated by the hybrid controller that helps to avoid the obstacles present in the arena to create a collision-free path. The results obtained from hybrid PA–Fuzzy motion planning procedure show the capability of the controller in achieving the optimal paths in different environments with both static and dynamic obstacles. The results observed from simulation and experimental arenas are found to be in satisfactory agreement with each other producing minimal error limits.

First, the CNN is used to learn the spatial feature algorithm of data, and long-short term memory of RNN is used to learn the temporal feature algorithm of data. Then the two original data sets DARPA1998 and ISCX2012 are preprocessed. The accuracy, detection rate, and false positive rate of normal traffic and Dos, Probe, U2R, and R2L attack traffic are compared in DARPA1998 data set. The accuracy, detection rate, and false positive rate of normal traffic and Brute force SSH, DDoS, HttpDoS, and buffering attack traffic are compared in ISCX2012 data set. Finally, it is compared with other network traffic anomaly detection methods. The results show that when the network flow length is 800, the model shows good performance on the DARPA1998 data set (accuracy, detection rate and false positive rate are 98.68\%, 97.78\%, and 0.07\%, respectively). When the network flow length is 600, the model performs better on the ISCX2012 dataset (accuracy, detection rate and false positive rate are 99.69\%, 96.91\%, and 0.22\%, respectively). At the same time, when the packet length is 100 and the number of packets is 6, the model shows high precision, high detection rate, and low false positive rate on ISCX2012 data set. In the same data set, the temporal feature algorithm has better performance and lower false positive rate than the spatial feature algorithm. Compared with other network traffic anomaly detection methods, HAST-NAD has better comprehensive test results. In conclusion, the combination of CNN and RNN can better realize abnormal detection of network traffic, which has practical application and theoretical value.},

  abstract     = {In the recent years, the volume of text documents in the form of digital way has grown up extremely in size. As significance, there is a need to be competent to automatically bring together and classify the documents based on their content. The main goal of text classification is to partition the unstructured set of documents into their respective categories based on its content. The main aim of this research work is to automatically classify the documents which are stored in the personal computer into their relevant categories. This work has two significant phases. In the first phase, the important features are selected for classification and the second phase is the classification of text documents. For selecting the optimal features, this research work proposes a new algorithm, optimization technique for feature selection (OTFS) algorithm. To estimate the proficiency of proposed feature selection algorithm, the OTFS algorithm was compared with the existing approaches artificial bee colony, firefly algorithm, ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization. In the second phase, this research work proposed machine learning-based automatic text classification (MLearn-ATC) algorithm for text classification. In classification, the MLearn-ATC algorithm was compared with widely used classification techniques probabilistic neural network, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor and Naïve Bayes. From this, the output of first phase is used as the input for classification phase. The decisive results establish that the proposed algorithms achieve the better accuracy for optimizing the features and classifying the text documents based on their content.},

Many machine learning and artificial intelligence methods have been presented for automated surface electromyogram signals classification. In this method, a novel surface electromyogram signals recognition method is presented using a novel 1D local descriptor. The proposed descriptor is called as statistical decimal pattern and it is utilized as feature extractor in this study and tunable q-factor wavelet transform is used as pooling in this method. By using tunable q-factor wavelet transform and the proposed statistical decimal pattern, a multileveled learning method is constructed. Ten levels are created by using tunable q-factor wavelet transform. Statistical decimal pattern extracts features from tunable q-factor wavelet transform sub-bands of the raw surface electromyogram signal. Then, the generated features are concatenated, and to select distinctive features, ReliefF and neighborhood component analysis are used together. In the classification phase, k-nearest neighbor classifier with city block distance is chosen. To test performance of the proposed tunable q-factor wavelet transform and the proposed statistical decimal pattern-based surface electromyogram classification method, a freely and publicly published dataset was used. In this dataset, 10 hand gestures were defined. Experimental results clearly shown that the proposed tunable q wavelet transform and statistical decimal pattern-based method achieved 98.0\%, 99.79\% accuracy rates on two datasets and it outcomes other state-of-the-art methods according to these results.},

  abstract     = {Inventory classification is a fundamental issue in the development of inventory policy that assigns each inventory item to several classes with different levels of importance. This classification is the main determinant of a suitable inventory control policy of inventory classes. Therefore, a great deal of research is done on solving this problem. Usually, the problem of inventory classification is considered in a multi-criteria and uncertain environment. The proposed method in this paper inspired by the notion of heterogeneous decision-making problems in which decision-makers deal with different types of data. To this aim, a mathematical modeling-based approach is proposed considering different types of uncertainty in classification information. Demand information is considered to be stochastic due to its time-varying nature and cost information is considered to be fuzzy due to its cognitive ambiguity. A hybrid algorithm based on chance-constrained and possibilistic programming is proposed to solve the problems. Considering the stochastic nature of demand information, solving the proposed model using the hybrid algorithm, the classification of items to three classes of extremely important, class A, moderately important, class B, and relatively unimportant, class C, items are determined along with a minimum inventory level required to deal with the stochasticity of demands information. The proposed approach is applied to a case study of classifying 51 inventory items. The obtained results assigned 22\%, 39\%, and 39\% of the items to A, B, and C classes, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In the context of gradient-free multi-modal optimization, numerous algorithms are based on restarting evolution strategies. Such an algorithm classically performs many local searches, for finding all the global optima of the objective function. The strategy used to select the restarting points (i.e., the initial points of the local searches) is a crucial step of the method. In previous works, a strategy based on reinforcement learning has been proposed: the search space is partitioned and a multi-armed bandit algorithm is used to select an interesting region to sample. This strategy significantly improves the main optimization algorithm but is limited to small dimensional problems. In this paper, we propose an algorithm tackling this problem. The main contributions are (1) a tree-based scheme for hierarchically partition the search space and (2) a multi-armed bandit strategy for traversing this tree. Thus, a node in the tree corresponds to a region of the search space, and its children partition this region according to one dimension. The multi-armed bandit strategy is used to traverse the tree by selecting interesting children recursively. We have experimented our algorithm on difficult multi-modal functions, with small and large dimensions. For small dimensions, we observe performances comparable to previous state-of-the-art algorithms. For large dimensions, we observe better results as well as lower memory consumption.},

This paper suggests a better solution for such traffic issues via delay-optimized Shortest Path Prediction (SPP) method. Even though Shadowed Type 2 (ST2) fuzzy logic works well for delay optimization with uncertain data, it causes a rise in fuzzy partitioning complexity. This motivates to development Shadowed Type 2 Fuzzy Markov (ST2FM) scheme for accurate prediction of the shortest path. In ST2FM, waiting for time optimization performed at rush junction based on ST2 fuzzy rules. Optimized path detail is periodically updated in the Transition Probability Matrix of the Markov model for SPP. Thus, ST2FM helps a node to easily identify the shortest path to reach the destination without waiting at traffic junctions. The absence of fuzzy partitioning and the use of Markov prediction greatly reduce the computational complexity of ST2FM. Matlab 2016a working environment is utilized for research implementation and results are compared with ST2 fuzzy, Interval Type 2 fuzzy and Fuzzy-based Convolution Neural Network. From this analysis, the proposed work demonstrates 96\% of prediction accuracy with less error than existing works.},

When considering the decision assessment of express company, the key issue that emerge powerful ambiguity. Pythagorean fuzzy set as an efficient math tool can capture the indeterminacy successfully. The major focus of this manuscript is to explore various interactive Hamacher power aggregation operators for Pythagorean fuzzy numbers. Firstly, we defined novel interactive Hamacher operation, on this basis we presented some Pythagorean fuzzy interactive Hamacher power aggregation operators such as Pythagorean fuzzy interactive Hamacher power average, weighted average (PFIHPWA), ordered weighted average, Pythagorean fuzzy interactive Hamacher power geometric, weighted geometric (PFIHPWG) and ordered geometric operators,respectively. Meanwhile, we verified their general properties and specific cases as well. The salient feature of proposed operators is that they can not only reduce the impact of negative data and consider the interactions between membership and nonmembership degrees, but also provide more general results through a parameter. Secondly, we defined a Pythagorean fuzzy entropy measure, and then establish a method to determine the attribute weights. Further, based on the conceived PFIHPWA and PFIHPWG operators we explored a novel approach to manage multiple attribute decision making problems. At last, the proposed techniques are carried out in a real application concerning on the assessment of express service quality to display the applicability and effectiveness, as well as the influence of changed parameters on the results. In addition, its advantages are displayed by a systematic comparison with relevant approaches.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of modern life, people have paid more and more attention to the needs of healthy and comfortable outdoor activities. The traditional static recuperation mode has been impacted, and the modern dynamic leisure agricultural tourism health care mode is more and more popular. Horticultural therapy improves people’s cognitive, psychological and physiological functions and provides people with positive values through plant-related sensory activities and horticultural operations. Therefore, horticultural therapy has become a product of the idea that designers have been exploring new forms of landscape architecture, trying to create a more comfortable environment and maximize the benefits of people in landscape architecture. In recent years, the theoretical and empirical studies of complex networks provide an important means to reveal the complexity of complex systems. As a new and active field of scientific research, complex networks have been introduced into the empirical research of real-world networks for a long time. At present, more and more people pay attention to computer science, social science, biological science, management science and many other fields. This paper constructs a BIM horticultural therapy health environment analysis system based on complex network model. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively analyze the application of BIM horticultural therapy in healthy environment.},

However, both pessimistic and optimistic rough sets have disadvantages in describing target concept. In this paper, a novel model, called weighted multigranulation fuzzy decision rough sets, is proposed. Gaussian kernel is used to compute the similarity between objects, which induces a fuzzy equivalence relation. We employ the relation to fuzzily partition the universe and then obtain multiple fuzzy granulations from multisource fuzzy information system. Moreover, some interesting properties of the proposed model are discussed. A comparative study between the proposed multigranulation model and Sun’s multigranulation rough set model is carried out.

Moreover, at the end of the paper, estimation of compressive strength using ANN methods has been presented. Based on the results, the recycled concrete and recycled fiber concrete with the proposed mix design have a high compressive strength, and due to relatively high porosity of the recycled aggregate concrete, its density has decreased by 2.48\% and its water absorption increased by 54\% compared to the natural concrete. Two artificial intelligence methods of ANN and SVM benefit from a quite equal coefficient of consistency, and the results of 124 test specimens with the results obtained from SVM are in a better agreement. Finally, two artificial intelligence methods were compared with the MLR using K-fold cross-validation, indicating superior performance of the artificial intelligence.},

Then Jensen’s inequalities for these Choquet integrals are proved. These include reverse Jensen’s inequality for nonnegative real-valued functions, real-valued Choquet integral Jensen’s inequalities for set-valued functions, and two families of set-valued and fuzzy set-valued Choquet integral Jensen’s inequalities. One is that the related convex function is set-valued or fuzzy set-valued, and the integrand is real-valued, the other is that the related convex function is real-valued, and the integrand is set-valued or fuzzy set-valued.

When several different OWA weight vectors are offered, it is necessary to develop certain techniques to aggregate them into one OWA weight vector. This study firstly details several motivating examples to show the necessity and usefulness of merging those OWA weight vectors. Then, by applying the general method for aggregating OWA operators proposed in a recent literature, we specifically elaborate the use of OWA aggregation to merge OWA weight vectors themselves. Furthermore, we generalize the normal preference degree in the unit interval into a preference sequence and introduce subsequently the preference aggregation for OWA weight vectors with given preference sequences. Detailed steps in related aggregation procedures and corresponding numerical examples are also provided in the current study.},

The AIS data from Danish and Xiamen port are chosen to test the proposed algorithm. The results show FOGDM-RBF can repair the ship’s AIS trajectories with satisfying learning speed and interpolation accuracy.

In all the above-mentioned examples, we are in fact dealing with a pair of lattices related by two meet-preserving maps. We use this insight to develop a Priestley-style duality for such structures, mainly building on the duality for meet-semilattices of G. Bezhanishvili and R. Jansana.

  abstract     = {The preference-inspired coevolutionary algorithm (PICEAg) is an effective method for solving many-objective optimization problems. But PICEAg cannot identify the quality of non-dominated solutions, which have a similar fitness value, and lacks an effective diversity maintenance mechanism. Meanwhile, owing to the different preference space dominated by individuals, there are significant differences in the search ability of individuals, which makes the allocation of computing resources unreasonable. To address the above issues, in this paper, a neighbor selection strategy is first proposed, by which excellent individuals are selected from the neighboring individuals in a layer-by-layer manner. Next, a dynamic allocation of the preference strategy based on a differential space is proposed. By combining a decomposition-based method, a reference vector is used to divide an objective space into several subspaces, where the number of non-dominated solutions is used to evaluate the selection pressure. The smaller the number of non-dominated solutions, the larger the selection pressure is within the subspaces, and the larger the number of preferences that should be allocated. Finally, the improved algorithm is compared against eight state-of-the-art algorithms on the WFG and ZDT test suites. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the improved algorithm in tackling most many-objective problems.},

In this paper, the idea of soft multi-rough set (SMRS) is introduced as a hybrid model of soft set, multi-set and rough set. The SMRS provides roughness of a multi-set in terms of soft multi-approximation space. The novel concept of soft multi-rough topology (SMR-topology) is defined to discuss topological structure of SMRSs by using pairwise SMR-approximations. The proposed models of SMRS and SMR-topology are suitable for modeling uncertainties in the real-life circumstances. SMR-topology is the generalization of crisp topology, soft topology and soft rough set topology. Some fundamental properties of SMR-topology and their related results are studied. Some algorithms for are developed for multi-criteria decision making based on soft multi-sets, soft multi-rough sets and soft multi-rough topology. Based on proposed algorithms, the applications of SMRSs and SMR-topology toward diagnosis of depression and diabetes are illustrated by the numerical examples.

Turkey’s CO2 emissions have increased significantly due to economic and industrial growth since 2000. Due to Turkey’s responsibility in the climate agreements, it needs to explore the CO2 emissions resulting from future investments and policies. In this study, an adaptive grey prediction model was proposed to forecast energy-related CO2 emission of Turkey for 2023 and 2030 based on planned energy investments and policies. The paper has addressed two scenarios that express the current usage level and the planned level where future investments are put into use in order to observe the change of CO2 emissions. The obtained results show that the amount of CO2 emissions in 2030 will decrease significantly thanks to nuclear energy investments according to the current scenario. However, in order to reduce the CO2 emissions of Turkey to desired levels, there is still a need to tighten energy policies and continue emission-free energy investments.},

This can facilitate predicting photovoltaic power generation based on weather forecasting. For this purpose, in the present paper, we aim to propose corresponding model. However, the Korea Meteorological Administration does not forecast the amount of solar radiation and sunshine that mostly influence the results of photovoltaic power generation prediction. In this study, we predict these parameters considering various input/output (I/O) variables and learning algorithms applied to weather forecasts on hourly weather data. Finally, we predict photovoltaic power generation based on the best sunshine and solar radiation prediction results. The data structure underlying all predictions relies on four models applied to fundamental weather factors on sunshine and solar radiation data two hours ago. Then, the photovoltaic power generation prediction is implemented using four models depending on whether to add the predicted sunshine and solar radiation data obtained at the previous step. The prediction algorithm relies on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques, including dynamic neural network (DNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). The results of the conducted experiment indicate that ANN perform better than the neuro-fuzzy approach. Moreover, we demonstrate that RNN and LSTM are more suitable for the time series data structures compared with DNN. Furthermore, we report that the weather forecast structure and the model 4 structure, which includes sunshine and solar radiation data two hours ago, achieve the best prediction results.},

In other words, the main objectives of the firm are to have the optimal price, vehicle routes, and location of the depot in each zone. Therefore, a flow-based model as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming is proposed to solve the problem. In the light of this nonlinearity, we employ a piecewise linearization approximation method. In addition, to adapt with the large-scale problems, two heuristic algorithms with three combinations of operators in the local search are suggested. In order to evaluate their performance, some test instances and a case study are solved. Based on the results, the performance of the algorithms is compared with each other and the flow-based formulation. The results show the outperformance of the algorithms rather than the flow-based model. Moreover, the results show the linearization approach can efficiently approximate the nonlinear model. Furthermore, the impact of the shipping cost ratio on the depot selection, vehicles’ route, and firms’ profit is revealed.},

In this paper, we have developed an artificial intelligence-based mathematical model using fuzzy logic to implement control measures timely in the dengue-prone areas.

  abstract     = {Literature indicates that many efforts have been conducted toward the development of forecasting models with a high degree of accuracy. Combining different models is known as a powerful alternative to access more reliable and more accurate results than single models. Given the great importance of hybridization theory, various hybrid models have been proposed in the literature of time series forecasting. Series hybrid approaches are one of the most well study and the most widely used hybridization models, in which components are sequentially applied. However, according to the modeling essence of this hybrid structure, the performance of the series hybrid models is directly dependent on the order of using components and modeling sequence. Besides, selecting the best modeling order that can yield the best performance in all situations is a problematic theoretical as well as practical task. Thus, the main purpose of this paper is to eliminate the drawback of series models, regarding modeling order selection using a parallel hybridization schema, which is addressed for the first time. The core principle of the proposed parallel hybridization of series (PHOS) models is to improve the series hybrid model’s forecasting accuracy by integrating two hybrid structures in contrast to existing hybrid models, which emphasize only the combination of individual models. The proposed model decomposes the original time series into two linear and nonlinear parts and uses the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) models to model underlying patterns, incorporating two series models including ARIMA–MLP and MLP–ARIMA. Finally, the series models are integrated as components of the parallel hybridization scheme. Moreover, an ordinary least square algorithm is developed to determine the optimal weights of these two components. Three benchmark data sets, including the closing of the DAX index, the closing of the Nikkei 225 index (N225), and the opening of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, are used for empirical analysis and verifying the effectiveness of the PHOS model. The empirical analysis indicates that the PHOS model can improve the forecasting performance of both series ARIMA–MLP and MLP–ARIMA models as well as individual models and some parallel hybrid models.},

Thus, an accurate prediction of stock price can be considered as a tough task. This study intends to design an efficient model for predicting future price of stock market using technical indicators derived from historical data and natural inspired algorithm. The model adopts Elman neural network (ENN) because of its ability to memorize the past information, which is suitable for solving stock problems. Trial and error-based method is widely used to determine the parameters of ENN. It is a time-consuming task. To address such an issue, this study employs Grey Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm to optimize the parameters of ENN. Optimized ENN is utilized to predict the future price of stock data in 1 day advance. To evaluate the prediction efficiency, proposed model is tested on NYSE and NASDAQ stock data. The efficacy of the proposed model is compared with other benchmark models such as FPA-ELM, PSO-MLP, PSOElman, CSO-ARMA and GA-LSTM to prove its superiority. Results demonstrated that the GWO-ENN model provides accurate prediction for 1 day ahead prediction and outperforms the benchmark models taken for comparison.},

The past few decades witnessed the gradual prevalence of fuzzy set theory in different industries. The construction industry was not an exception either. It is in use now for SCs prequalification thanks to its competence in covering the flaws underlying the SC selection methods. Most previous researches employed Type-1 Fuzzy Sets (T1FSs) in SCs prequalification models. But, the result of the applying TIFSs to solve a SC prequalification could be simply misleading because it is principally a group (Multi-Criteria Decision Making) MCDM problem. An important limitation of T1FS assures the fact that it can handle the decision-making problem of only one person because its membership function is crisp, relying on his subjective viewpoint, and deterring it from revealing differing views among the experts. We aim to introduce a novel SCs prequalification method using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (IT2FSs) in a bid to rectify the linguistic flaws as well as differences of the experts’ views. Therefore, an integration of two methods, namely “Shannon Entropy Weight” and “Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solutions,” is used under IT2FS for solving the SC prequalification problem. In addition, a real case is considered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Control charts (CCs) are very effective tools to follow process variation and to improve process quality. It is completely critical to increase the sensitiveness and flexibility of CCs to gain a deeper perspective for process control. When constructing conventional CCs, errors may occur due to operator or measuring instruments in performing the measurement. By the way, some data related to CCs can include “uncertainty” or “vagueness” related to process and human evaluations or inspector judgments. We know that classical CCs cannot be able to manage this process. The fuzzy set theory (FST) is one of the most important tools to solve these problems, and the CCs designed based on FST are more usable and preferable for monitoring the process. By the way, one of the extensions of FST named type-2 fuzzy sets that have fuzzy membership degrees is more capable of modeling uncertainty. Therefore, they can be successfully used to the design of the control process in a more flexible and sensitive way. In this paper, the type-2 fuzzy sets have been used to the design of variable control charts to increase the precision and flexibility of them. For this aim, $$\bar{x} - R$$ , $$\bar{x} - S$$ and $$I - MR$$ control charts have been re-designed by using type-2 fuzzy sets. Additionally, these charts have been applied on a real case application from electronic industry, and the obtained results indicate that CCs based on type-2 fuzzy sets can evaluate the process in a more sensitive and flexible way.},

  abstract     = {Soft sets are efficient mathematical structures to model systems in multiple relations. Since a soft set is basically set system, it is possible to endow them with a proper distance function to obtain a metric space. By this embedding, we propose a discretization of the Ricci curvatures that stresses the relational character of universe elements in a soft set through the analysis of parameters rather than the elements themselves. The Forman and Ollivier-type Ricci curvatures we propose here quantifies the trade-off between parameter size and the cardinality of participation of parameterized universe elements in other parameters. Such discretizations of the Ricci curvature have already been applied to complex systems; however, it has not yet been formulated for soft sets. In this study, our main question is whether the defined geometric concept determines statistics for soft set models. Two examples are discussed for the answer to this question. The first example Ricci on soft sets model of occupational accidents occurred in Turkey in 2013–2014 is compared with the Wasserstein distance of the curvature distributions. The second example is the use of Ricci curvatures as an indicator in the soft sets model of a financial system while the system is in stress. These real world examples show that discrete Ricci curvatures for soft sets offer effective statistics.},

In these cases to design filter by an analytical method like the SFG, we need to obtain new transfer function. Obtaining novel transfer function would make filter designating complicated in terms of calculation and simulation time while the RBFNN can match with any change as fast as possible.

  abstract     = {Environmental factors are increasingly being considered in supply chain risk management (SCRM), which itself represents a growing trend. Accordingly, dynamic supplier selection and order allocation have become very important. Both qualitative and quantitative factors should be considered in the selection of eligible suppliers. In this study, a novel two-stage comprehensive mathematical model is developed for selecting a set of suppliers and assigning an order quantity to each supplier. The first stage involves a primary selection of alternative suppliers according to the risk value, which is determined using qualitative and quantitative methods based on the best–worst method, and the second stage involves establishing a multiobjective mathematical model for dealing with dynamic supplier selection and order allocation. The proposed approach, which helps enterprises manage uncertainty in SCRM, is applied in this study to the new energy vehicles industry.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection (FS) is the process of finding the least possible number of features that are able to describe a dataset in the same way as the original features. Feature selection is a crucial preprocessing step for data mining techniques as it improves the performance of the prediction process in terms of speed and accuracy and also provides a better understanding of stored data. The success of the FS process depends on achieving a balance between two important factors, namely selecting the minimal number of features and maintaining the maximum accuracy in the results. In this paper, two methods are proposed to improve the FS process. Firstly, the mine blast algorithm (MBA) is introduced to optimize the FS process in the exploration phase. Secondly, the MBA is hybridized with simulated annealing as a local search in the exploitation phase to enhance the solutions located by the MBA. The proposed approaches (MBA and MBA–SA) are tested on 18 benchmark datasets from the UCI repository, and the comprehensive experimental results indicate that MBA–SA achieved good performance when compared with five approaches in the literature.},

The method finds an optimal number of the hidden neurons in restricted Boltzmann machine by using a normalized Euclidean distance from the worst possible error for each hidden layer progressively. The dataset used for experimental results is obtained via vibroacoustics simulation software such as VA-One and actual site measurements. The results show that output parameters such as spatial SPL, average spatial SPL, structure-borne SPL and airborne SPL improve the testing root mean square error to around 20\% as compared to randomly assigning the number of neurons for each hidden layer. The testing RMSE in the output parameters has improved when compared with a multi-layer perceptron, sparse autoencoder, Softmax, self-taught learning and extreme learning machine.},

For unsupervised methods, the prior knowledge is often required to guarantee the detection accuracy. To break the traditional limitations, we present an unsupervised method to detect various shilling profiles from reconstructed user–user graph based on deep learning and community detection. Firstly, we construct the user–user graph, whose edge weight is calculated by the similarity of user’s behaviors. Secondly, the stacked denoising autoencoders are used to extract the robust graph features at different scales with different corruption rates. Based on the features at different scales, we generate multiple clustering results and reconstruct the user–user graph by evidence accumulation method. Thirdly, the community detection is carried out by using the persistence optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on two datasets illustrate that our proposed method has better performance than some baseline detectors for detecting the simulated attacks and actual attacks.},

Such sharing is common in the Chinese language, as approximately 15\% of the world’s population are native speakers of Mandarin. Due to comments shared that may contain complex sentences in such micro-blogs, the result of sentiment classification may be affected, reducing its accuracy. Aimed at this point, a Sentiment Classification model of Chinese Micro-blog Comments based on Key Sentences (SC-CMC-KS) is proposed. The key sentence extraction algorithm for Chinese Microblog Comments is presented by considering three factors to recognize the key sentences of a given comment: the sentiment attributes, location attributes, and the critical feature word attributes. Besides, a computing algorithm of sentence sentiment value that integrates both dependency relationships and multi-rules (i.e., sentence-type rule and inter-sentence rule) is designed, as well defined a modification distance describing the relationship between modification words and core words, in which the sentiment value in the phrase level is computed according to the calculation rules so that the sentiment value in sentence level is obtained based on the multi-rules. Furthermore, the sentiment classification algorithm of micro-blog comments is presented, so that the key sentences and emoticon of the complete micro-blog are weighted to compute the final sentiment value, and comments are classified according to the threshold set.

  abstract     = {Software defect prediction (SDP) is a very important way for analyzing software quality and reducing development costs. The data during software lifecycle can be used to predict software defect. Currently, many SDP models have been proposed; however, their performance was not always ideal. In many existing prediction models based on machine learning, the distance metric between samples has significant impact on the performance of the SDP model. In addition, most samples are usually class imbalanced. To solve these issues, in this paper, a novel distance metric learning based on cost-sensitive learning (CSL) is proposed for reducing the impact of class imbalance of samples, which is then applied to the large margin distribution machine (LDM) to substitute the traditional kernel function. Further, the improvement and optimization of LDM based on CSL are also studied, and the improved LDM is used as the SDP model, called as CS-ILDM. Subsequently, the proposed CS-ILDM is applied to five publicly available data sets from the NASA Metrics Data Program repository and its performance is compared to other existing SDP models. The experimental results confirm that the proposed CS-ILDM not only has good prediction performance, but also can reduce the misprediction cost and avoid the impact of class imbalance of samples.},

To increase the speed and capacity of apples being sorted, a new algorithm for segmenting the region of interest from an apple fruit image and to find the percentage of defective area after sorting process has been proposed in this paper. First, the region of interest from the acquired color image of an apple fruit was segmented using the proposed global thresholding algorithm GTA. Features were extracted from the segmented image using the coefficients obtained by applying wavelet transformation using the Haar filter. Further, the Naive Bayesian classifier was applied to sort apples as defective and sound. Second, the defective area of the defective sample was segmented using the K-means algorithm and median filter. The defective area in percentage was calculated using the proposed diseased area calculation algorithm DACA to decide about the acceptance of that defective sample. The performance of the proposed GTA was compared with Otsu’s and Kapur’s thresholding algorithms. With less segmentation time, it was found that the Naive Bayesian classification using GTA gave a 96.67\% accuracy rate than Otsu’s with 65\% and Kapur’s with 93.33\% accuracy rate. The execution time of the proposed DACA was less when compared to the bwarea function in MATLAB.},

Nowadays, the two-stage network DEA models have been widely applied in the field of economy and management, such as green supply chain and reverse supply chain. Due to the novelty of evaluation indexes, these emerging research objects with network structure, such as green supply chain, involve not only traditional evaluation indexes such as cost and time, but also some novel evaluation indexes such as customer satisfaction and flexibility. However, these new evaluation indexes are difficult to quantify accurately, which will lead to the failure of the traditional two-stage network DEA models. Therefore, this paper attempts to extend the traditional two-stage network DEA models to the uncertain two-stage network DEA models with the application of uncertainty theory. In the new models, inputs, intermediates and outputs are considered to be uncertain variables to deal with the problem of inaccurate data. Finally, a numerical example of the uncertain two-stage network DEA models will be presented for illustration.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, embedded systems are comprised of heterogeneous multi-core architectures, i.e., CPUs and GPUs. If the application is mapped to an appropriate processing core, then these architectures provide many performance benefits to applications. Typically, programmers map sequential applications to CPU and parallel applications to GPU. The task mapping becomes challenging because of the usage of evolving and complex CPU- and GPU-based architectures. This paper presents an approach to map the OpenCL application to heterogeneous multi-core architecture by determining the application suitability and processing capability. The classification is achieved by developing a machine learning-based device suitability classifier that predicts which processor has the highest computational compatibility to run OpenCL applications. In this paper, 20 distinct features are proposed that are extracted by using the developed LLVM-based static analyzer. In order to select the best subset of features, feature selection is performed by using both correlation analysis and the feature importance method. For the class imbalance problem, we use and compare synthetic minority over-sampling method with and without feature selection. Instead of hand-tuning the machine learning classifier, we use the tree-based pipeline optimization method to select the best classifier and its hyper-parameter. We then compare the optimized selected method with traditional algorithms, i.e., random forest, decision tree, Naïve Bayes and KNN. We apply our novel approach on extensively used OpenCL benchmarks, i.e., AMD and Polybench. The dataset contains 653 training and 277 testing applications. We test the classification results using four performance metrics, i.e., F-measure, precision, recall and $$R^2$$ . The optimized and reduced feature subset model achieved a high F-measure of 0.91 and $$R^2$$ of 0.76. The proposed framework automatically distributes the workload based on the application requirement and processor compatibility.},

An optimization problem can be approached as searching problem where an algorithm is proposed to search for the value of one or more variables that minimizes or maximizes an optimization function depending on an optimization goal. Multi-objective optimization problems are also abundant in many aspects of our lives with various applications in different fields in applied science. To solve such problems, evolutionary algorithms have been utilized including genetic algorithms that can achieve decent search space exploration. Things became even harder for multi-objective optimization problems when the algorithm attempts to optimize more than one objective function. In this paper, we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) that utilizes a genetic algorithm (GA) to perform a global search supported by the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to perform a local search. The proposed HGA achieved the concept of rehabilitation of rejected individuals. The proposed HGA was supported by a modified selection mechanism based on the K-means clustering algorithm that succeeded to restrict the selection process to promising solutions only and assured a balanced distribution of both the selected to survive and selected for rehabilitation individuals. The proposed algorithm was tested against 4 benchmark multi-objective optimization functions where it succeeded to achieve maximum balance between search space exploration and search space exploitation. The algorithm also succeeded in improving the HGA’s overall performance by limiting the average number of iterations until convergence.},

Combining the direct IFPRs and the indirect IFPRs extracted from the IVIFPR, an algorithm is designed to determine the comprehensive IVIF priority weights of IVIFPR. For GDM with IVIFPRs, a multi-objective programming model is constructed to derive DMs’ weights by combining TOPSIS and cross entropy, which is solved by Lagrange function method. Based on the determination of DMs’ weights, the determination of priority weights and the new order relation of IVIFVs, a comprehensive method is proposed for GDM with IVIFPRs.

  abstract     = {All the existing probabilistic hesitant fuzzy element (P-HFE) comparison techniques are directly based on the possible membership degree of an element together with its probability of occurring. Here, we are going to propose a class of P-HFE comparison techniques which are indirectly based on the ingredients of a P-HFE. Indeed, the proposed P-HFE comparison techniques are mainly related to the multiplying and exponential deformation formulas of each pair of possible membership degree and its associated probability. The proposed P-HFE comparison techniques are classified into three categories: (i) the element-based processes for comparing P-HFEs, (ii) the step-based processes for comparing P-HFEs, and (iii) the step-based processes for comparing P-HFEs. These indirect P-HFE comparison techniques provide us with more insights into the ways to increase the applicability of the P-HFE comparison algorithms, and enable us to deal with the comparison step in multiple criteria decision making problems from a different viewpoint.},

  abstract     = {One of the most important problems faced in supply chain management is the coordination between supply chain members. Supply chain contracts, such as buyback contract, quantity-flexibility contract, revenue sharing contract, etc., can be used for solving this problem. In revenue sharing contracts, the manufacturer applies a low wholesale price to the retailer and in return shares a portion of the retailer’s revenue. In this study, the revenue sharing contracts between the supplier and the retailer are handled as two-person non-constant sum games. There are two players in the game, supplier and retailer, and the main motivation of both is to increase their profitability. To this end, the supplier applies different wholesale prices, while the retailer responds by using different revenue sharing rates. In the study, profit functions of the supply chain members are calculated in the event of an income sharing agreement. These functions differ due to changes in supply chain parameters. The profits of the retailer and supplier corresponding to different wholesale prices and revenue sharing rates have been transferred to the two-person non-constant sum game revenue matrix. Then, the best strategies of the supplier and retailer are tried to be determined by the search of equilibrium point which is one of the solution methods that can be used to determine the best strategies in two-person non-constant sum games. The results showed that the solution approaches of game theory can be applied successfully in determining the best strategies that the parties can implement in revenue sharing contracts between the supplier and the retailer.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the manufacturing costs proportion of part feeding in automotive mixed-model assembly lines (MMALs) being up to 20–35\%, this paper takes the dynamic scheduling of part feeding for automotive MMALs as a crucial and complex problem. Therefore, a dynamic scheduling mechanism basing on the knowledge base (KB) and fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) with variable step sizes and logistic chaos (VSCFOA)-enhanced general regression neural network (VSCFOA-GRNN) is proposed to tackle the real-time part feeding scheduling problem of tow trains under the dynamic manufacturing system. A mathematical model is developed to illustrate the problem, where the throughput of the assembly line and the material delivery distance are determined as components of the objective function. Subsequently, samples of the MMAL are generated by the plant simulation software and used to train the VSCFOA-GRNN model off-line. Afterward, the trained model and KB are adopted in the real-time scheduling process to determine the optimal scheduling rule combination. Finally, the effectiveness, feasibility and accuracy of the novel scheduling mechanism are validated by computational results, especially in dynamic scheduling processes. It can cope well with changes in the dynamic environment, thus effectively realizing the higher productivity of assembly lines and better system performance.},

  abstract     = {Clustering is extensively realistic and considered in computer vision that follows unsupervised learning principles. In this, the performance of a clustering process mainly depends on the feature representation. Generally, the clustering process may have an error rate, and this affects the feature representation. To avoid this, unsupervised Learning (USL) provides an alternative path to obtain the best clusters from the dataset through the optimum features. In this proposed work, the clustering process is done by using a hybrid firefly-based flower pollination algorithm (FFPA). So this clustering process removes the complexity in USL. The better performance is obtained by identifying an essential group from the data to avoid the problems obtained by a USL. In the standard USL, the PCA method is used to minimize a large amount of original data. Here, the features are extracted based on RGB features and Zernike moments, and this is given to the input for the hybrid cluster. Finally, the hybrid convolutional neural network classifier, along with the datasets that are trained from a similar patch manifold, is used to create a label for several datasets. The performance of this proposed method portrays that the local features are effectively clustered from the various datasets by an unsupervised FFPA algorithm. In this work, the unsupervised clustering process with a hybrid classification for the object recognition application is used. In this work, the average accuracy, error rate, and run time are nearly 95\%, 73\%, and 26 s, respectively.},

In the existing works, there are auto creation of skeletons from meshes, and skeleton axes optimizations from a predefined set of actions. In this work, we extend automatic construction of skeletons by proposing skeleton axes design from an objective task. A two-layered framework is proposed to optimize randomly initialized axes based on auto generated actions. First, the limit of skeleton scales that can be automatically designed is discussed. Second, a self-adaptive actions discretizer implemented by neural networks is proposed to reduce the optimization complexity. Third, actions and axes are scored by physics engine simulation, and optimizations on the score generate axes that have the best performance. Experiments include robotic designs and an animation application. Comparisons show that the proposed framework outperforms other mainstream optimizers both in speed and effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Optimal design of controllers without considering uncertainty in the plant dynamics can induce feedback instabilities and lead to obtaining infeasible controllers in practice. This paper presents a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm integrated with Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) to perform the optimal stochastic design of robust controllers for uncertain time-delay systems. Each potential optimal solution represents a controller in the form of a transfer function with the optimal numerator and denominator polynomials. The proposed methodology uses genetic programming to evolve robust controllers. Using GP enables the algorithm to optimize the structure of the controller and tune the parameters in a holistic approach. The proposed methodology employs MCS to apply robust optimization and uses a new adaptive operator to balance exploration and exploitation in the search space. The performance of controllers is assessed in the closed-loop system with respect to three objective functions as (1) minimization of mean integral time absolute error (ITAE), (2) minimization of the standard deviation of ITAE and (3) minimization of maximum control effort. The new methodology is applied to the first-order and second-order systems with dead time. We evaluate the performance of obtained robust controllers with respect to the upper and lower bounds of step responses and control variables. We also perform a post-processing analysis considering load disturbance and external noise; we illustrate the robustness of the designed controllers by cumulative distribution functions of objective functions for different uncertainty levels. We show how the proposed methodology outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the literature.},

  abstract     = {The emerging fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks are empowered by softwarization and programmability, leading to the huge potentials of unprecedented flexibility and capability in cognitive network management such as self-reconfiguration and self-optimization. To help unlock such potentials, this paper proposes a novel framework that is able to monitor and calculate 5G network topological information in terms of advanced spatial metrics. These metrics, together with enabling and optimization algorithms, are purposely designed to address the complexity of 5G network topologies introduced by network virtualization and infrastructure sharing among operators (multi-tenancy). Consequently, this new framework, centred on a topology monitoring agent (TMA), enables on-demand 5G networks’ spatial knowledge and topological awareness required by 5G cognitive network management in making smart decisions in various autonomous network management tasks including but not limited to virtual network function placement strategies. The paper describes several technical use cases enabled by the proposed framework, including proactive cache allocation, computation offloading, node overloading alerting, and load balancing. Finally, a realistic 5G testbed is deployed with the central component TMA, together with the new spatial metrics and associated algorithms, implemented. Experimental results empirically validate the proposed approach and demonstrate the scalability and performance of the TMA component.},

  abstract     = {The performance of any meta-heuristic algorithm depends highly on the setting of dependent parameters of the algorithm. Different parameter settings for an algorithm may lead to different outcomes. An optimal parameter setting should support the algorithm to achieve a convincing level of performance or optimality in solving a range of optimization problems. This paper presents a novel enhancement method for the salp swarm algorithm (SSA), referred to as enhanced SSA (ESSA). In this ESSA, the following enhancements are proposed: First, a new position updating process was proposed. Second, a new dominant parameter different from that used in SSA was presented in ESSA. Third, a novel lifetime convergence method for tuning the dominant parameter of ESSA using ESSA itself was presented to enhance the convergence performance of ESSA. These enhancements to SSA were proposed in ESSA to augment its exploration and exploitation capabilities to achieve optimal global solutions, in which the dominant parameter of ESSA is updated iteratively through the evolutionary process of ESSA so that the positions of the search agents of ESSA are updated accordingly. These improvements on SSA through ESSA support it to avoid premature convergence and efficiently find the global optimum solution for many real-world optimization problems. The efficiency of ESSA was verified by testing it on several basic benchmark test functions. A comparative performance analysis between ESSA and other meta-heuristic algorithms was performed. Statistical test methods have evidenced the significance of the results obtained by ESSA. The efficacy of ESSA in solving real-world problems and applications is also demonstrated with five well-known engineering design problems and two real industrial problems. The comparative results show that ESSA imparts better performance and convergence than SSA and other meta-heuristic algorithms.},

In Lu’s scheme, k is used to define the total number of thresholds for categories of the complexity of the block, and F1 is the length of the secret message that can be concealed in the smoothest area. The hiding performance of Lu’s scheme for the smooth image is great. However, the results of that scheme for complex images can still be improved. Therefore, this paper proposed an enhanced interpolation-based hiding scheme by modifying the structure of the CFS from having a single layer to having multiple layers. The secret data are encoded by the multiple-layer folding table to reduce the distortion between the original image and the stego-image. Experimental results show that the image quality and the payload of the proposed scheme are better than those of the other schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new population-based stochastic optimization algorithm called Hybrid Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution (HSADE) is proposed. The algorithm addresses unconstrained global optimization problems, exploring and combining the best features of some Differential Evolution (DE), obtaining a good balance between exploration and exploitation. These approaches are important for increasing the accuracy and efficiency of a population-based stochastic algorithm and for adapting the control parameter values during the optimization process. Further, they are crucial for increasing the convergence speed and reducing the risk of search stagnation. To verify the performance of the HSADE, 25 benchmark functions were tested presenting an optimal performance when compared to some state-of-the-art DEs algorithms. Furthermore, an experimental problem in an automotive sector, related to automatic internal combustion engine calibration, was used adjusting 300 decision variables. The HSADE achieved a reliable calibration, reducing the time required to perform approximately 90\% when comparing to other optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a technique to solve LR-bipolar fuzzy linear system(BFLS), LR-complex bipolar fuzzy linear (CBFL) system with real coefficients and LR-complex bipolar fuzzy linear (CBFL) system with complex coefficients of equations. Initially, we solve the LR-BFLS of equations using a pair of positive $$(*)$$ and negative $$(\bullet )$$ of two $$n \times n$$ LR-real linear systems by using mean values and left-right spread systems. We also provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for the solution of LR-BFLS of equations. We illustrate the method by using some numerical examples of symmetric and asymmetric LR-BFLS equations and obtain the strong and weak solutions to the systems. Further, we solve the LR-CBFL system of equations with real coefficients and LR-CBFL system of equations with complex coefficients by pair of positive $$(*)$$ and negative $$(\bullet )$$ two $$n \times n$$ real and complex LR-bipolar fuzzy linear systems by using mean values and left-right spread systems. Finally, we show the usage of technique to solve the current flow circuit which is represented by LR-CBFL system with complex coefficients and obtain the unknown current in term of LR-bipolar fuzzy complex number.},

  abstract     = {Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms use non-dominated sorting as an intermediate step. These algorithms are easy to parallelize as various steps of these algorithms are independent of each other. Researchers have focused on the parallelization of non-dominated sorting in order to reduce the execution time of these algorithms. In this paper, we focus on one of the initial approaches for non-dominated sorting also known as naive approach, proposed by Srinivas et al. and explore the scope of parallelism in this approach. Parallelism is explored in the considered approach in three different ways considering Parallel Random Access Machine, Concurrent Read Exclusive Write model. The time and space complexities of three different parallel versions are also analyzed. Analysis of parallel algorithms is usually carried out under the assumption that an unbounded number of processors are available. Thus, the same assumption has been considered in our analysis too and we have obtained the maximum number of processors required for three parallel versions.},

  abstract     = {Opposition-based learning (OBL) is an effective strategy to enhance many optimization methods among which opposition-based differential evolution (ODE) is one of the successful variants. However, ODE is a strict point-to-point algorithm, which may cause those opposite solutions to be ignored who are close to, however, have a gap to more promising solutions in the neighborhood. It usually provides a relatively narrow search channel for the candidate solutions and cannot maintain well population diversity. Hence, it is necessary to broaden the search neighborhood of the opposite solutions to increase the possibility of seeking out an even better solution. Thus, a new approach, GODE, is proposed to implement a Gaussian perturbation operation around the opposite point to expand its search neighborhood. Three different self-adaptive standard deviation models are then proposed and compared in the Gaussian perturbation strategy. Subsequently, a multi-stage perturbation strategy with different sized neighborhood is adopted to balance exploration and exploitation during different evolutionary stages. GODE is firstly compared with DE and ODE on CEC2014 benchmark suite with dimension of 30, 50 and 100. Many recent state-of-the-art algorithms using OBL strategy are further conducted comparison with GODE. The experimental results and statistical comparison analysis demonstrated that GODE has better or equal competitive performance against the classical and recent competitors.},

The monadic filters of monadic quantum B-algebras are defined, and their properties are studied. We prove that there is an isomorphism between the lattice of all filters of a monadic quantum B-algebra and the lattice of all filters of its subalgebra of fixed elements.
