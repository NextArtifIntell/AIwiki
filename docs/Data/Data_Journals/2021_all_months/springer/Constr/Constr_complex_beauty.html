  abstract     = {Cable trees are used in industrial products to transmit energy and information between different product parts. To this date, they are mostly assembled by humans and only few automated manufacturing solutions exist using complex robotic machines. For these machines, the wiring plan has to be translated into a wiring sequence of cable plugging operations to be followed by the machine. In this paper, we study and formalize the problem of deriving the optimal wiring sequence for a given layout of a cable tree. We summarize our investigations to model this cable tree wiring problem (CTW). as a traveling salesman problem with atomic, soft atomic, and disjunctive precedence constraints as well as tour-dependent edge costs such that it can be solved by state-of-the-art constraint programming (CP), Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT), and mixed-integer programming (MIP). solvers. It is further shown, how the CTW problem can be viewed as a soft version of the coupled tasks scheduling problem. We discuss various modeling variants for the problem, prove its NP-hardness, and empirically compare CP, OMT, and MIP solvers on a benchmark set of 278 instances. The complete benchmark set with all models and instance data is available on github and was included in the MiniZinc challenge 2020.},

  abstract     = {Conflict-driven pseudo-Boolean solvers optimize 0-1 integer linear programs by extending the conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) paradigm from SAT solving. Though pseudo-Boolean solvers have the potential to be exponentially more efficient than CDCL solvers in theory, in practice they can sometimes get hopelessly stuck even when the linear programming (LP) relaxation is infeasible over the reals. Inspired by mixed integer programming (MIP), we address this problem by interleaving incremental LP solving with cut generation within the conflict-driven pseudo-Boolean search. This hybrid approach, which for the first time combines MIP techniques with full-blown conflict analysis operating directly on linear inequalities using the cutting planes method, significantly improves performance on a wide range of benchmarks, approaching a “best-of-both-worlds” scenario between SAT-style conflict-driven search and MIP-style branch-and-cut.},

  abstract     = {The recent emergence of novel computational devices, such as quantum computers, coherent Ising machines, and digital annealers presents new opportunities for hardware-accelerated hybrid optimization algorithms. Unfortunately, demonstrations of unquestionable performance gains leveraging novel hardware platforms have faced significant obstacles. One key challenge is understanding the algorithmic properties that distinguish such devices from established optimization approaches. Through the careful design of contrived optimization tasks, this work provides new insights into the computation properties of quantum annealing and suggests that this model has the potential to quickly identify the structure of high-quality solutions. A meticulous comparison to a variety of algorithms spanning both complete and local search suggests that quantum annealing’s performance on the proposed optimization tasks is distinct. This result provides new insights into the time scales and types of optimization problems where quantum annealing has the potential to provide notable performance gains over established optimization algorithms and suggests the development of hybrid algorithms that combine the best features of quantum annealing and state-of-the-art classical approaches.},
