  abstract     = {We consider the problem of cost sensitive multiclass classification, where we would like to increase the sensitivity of an important class at the expense of a less important one. We adopt an apportioned margin framework to address this problem, which enables an efficient margin shift between classes that share the same boundary. The decision boundary between all pairs of classes divides the margin between them in accordance with a given prioritization vector, which yields a tighter error bound for the important classes while also reducing the overall out-of-sample error. In addition to demonstrating an efficient implementation of our framework, we derive generalization bounds, demonstrate Fisher consistency, adapt the framework to Mercer’s kernel and to neural networks, and report promising empirical results on all accounts.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we study the One-to-Many Shortest Path Problem (OMSPP), which is the problem of solving k shortest path problems that share the same start node. This problem has been studied in the context of routing in road networks. While past work on routing relied on pre-processing the network, which is assumed to be provided explicitly. We explore how OMSPP can be solved with heuristic search techniques, allowing the searched graph to be given either explicitly or implicitly. Two fundamental heuristic search approaches are analyzed: searching for the k goals one at a time, or searching for all k goals as one compound goal. The former approach, denoted k×A∗, is simpler to implement, but can be computationally inefficient, as it may expand a node multiple times, by the different searches. The latter approach, denoted kA∗, can resolve this potential inefficiency, but implementing it raises fundamental questions such as how to combine k heuristic estimates, one per goal, and what to do after the shortest path to one of the goals has been found. We propose several ways to implement kA∗, and characterize the required and sufficient conditions on the available heuristics and how they are aggregated such that the solution is admissible. Then, we analytically compare the runtime and memory requirements of k×A∗ and kA∗, identifying when each approach should be used. Finally, we compare these approaches experimentally on two representative domains, providing empirical support for our theoretical analysis. These results shed light on when each approach is beneficial.},

Second, disjunctive logic programs are represented in third-order tensors and their minimal models are computed by algebraic manipulation of tensors. Third, normal logic programs are represented by matrices and third-order tensors, and their stable models are computed. The result of this paper exploits a new connection between linear algebraic computation and symbolic computation, which has the potential to realize logical inference in huge scale of knowledge bases.},

In this paper, we propose a re-interpretation of this paradigm for Spohn’s ranking functions which we call Generalized Ranking Kinematics as a new principle for iterated belief revision of ranking functions by sets of conditional beliefs with respect to their specific subcontext. By taking into account semantical independencies, we can reduce the complexity of the revision task to local contexts. We show that global belief revision can be set up from revisions on the local contexts via a merging operator. Furthermore, we formalize a variant of the Ramsey-Test based on the idea of local contexts which connects conditional and propositional revision in a straightforward way. We extend the belief change methodology of c-revisions to strategic c-revisions which will serve as a proof of concept.},

Although BN inference is generally exponential on treewidth, the inference is tractable with NAT-modeled BNs of high treewidth and low density. In this work, we present the first study to learn NAT-modeled BNs from data. We apply the MDL principle to learning NAT-modeled BNs by developing a corresponding scoring function, and we couple it with heuristic structure search. We show that when data satisfy NAT causal independence, high treewidth, and low density structure, learning underlying NAT modeled BNs is feasible.},

We propose a new learning algorithm for this model based on a PC algorithm and a conditional independence test proposed by Bouezmarni et al. (2009). This test being non-parametric, no model assumptions are made allowing it to be as general as possible. This algorithm is compared on generated data with the parametric method proposed by Elidan (2010) and proves to have better results.},

Our contribution is a new loose hierarchical Bayesian network model that encloses latent variables. These hidden variables are introduced for ensuring a multi-view clustering of the records. We propose a new framework for learning our proposed Bayesian network model. It starts by extracting the cliques of highly dependent features and it proceeds to learn representative latent variable for each features’ clique. The experimental results of our comparative analysis prove the efficiency of our model in tackling the distance concentration challenge. They also show the effectiveness of our model learning framework in skipping the overfitting trap, on benchmark high-dimensional datasets.},

  abstract     = {How humans reason in general about syllogisms is, despite a century of research and many proposed cognitive theories, still an unanswered question. It is even more difficult, however, to answer how an individual human reasons. The goal of this article is twofold: First, it analyses the predictive quality of existing cognitive theories by providing a standardized (re-) implementation of existing theories. Towards this, theories are algorithmically formalized, including their potential capabilities for adaptation to an individual reasoner. The implementations are modular with regard to the underlying mental operations defined by the cognitive theories. Second, it proposes a novel composite approach based on existing cognitive theories, resulting in a cognitive model for predicting an individual reasoner before s/he draws a conclusion. This approach uses sequences of operations, inherited and combined from different theories, to form its predictions. Among the existing models, our implementations of PHM, mReasoner, and Verbal Models make the most accurate predictions of the conclusions drawn by individual reasoners. The designed composite model, however, is able to significantly surpass those implementations by exploiting synergies between different models. In particular, it successfully combines operations from PHM and Verbal Models. Therefore, the composite approach is a promising tool to model and study syllogistic reasoning and to generate tailored cognitive theories. At the same time it provides a general method that can potentially be applied to predict individual human reasoners in other domains, too.},

  abstract     = {The open shop is a classical scheduling problem known since 1976, which can be described as follows. A number of jobs have to be processed by a given set of machines, each machine should perform an operation on every job, and the processing times of all the operations are given. One has to construct a schedule to perform all the operations to minimize finish time also known as the makespan. The open shop problem is known to be NP-hard for three and more machines, while is polynomially solvable in the case of two machines. We consider the routing open shop problem, being a generalization of both the open shop problem and the metric traveling salesman problem. In this setting, jobs are located at nodes of a transportation network and have to be processed by mobile machines, initially located at a predefined depot. Machines have to process all the jobs and return to the depot to minimize makespan. A feasible schedule is referred to as normal if its makespan coincides with the standard lower bound. We introduce the Irreducible Bin Packing decision problem, use it to describe new sufficient conditions of normality for the two machine problem, and discuss the possibility to extend these results on the problem with three and more machines. To that end, we present two new computer-aided optima localization results.},

  abstract     = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has gained tremendous attention in the past few years for its advantages over network controllability. Nonetheless, the deployment of SDN in legacy network is likely to span multi-periods over months or years for budget consideration. Network operators, especially for a network consists of thousand or more nodes, are eager to understand how legacy networks can be deploying gradually towards SDN with variety of constraints. The reliability of network should be the utmost concern during SDN deployment in legacy network. Primarily, node exclusion is essential in SDN deployment process as the exclusion of critical node during the process greatly improves network stability and reliability. Therefore, we propose a heuristic algorithm for multi-periods SDN node migration in legacy network with respect to node exclusion and budget. We first formulate the aforementioned problem in Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model, and we evaluate the proposed ILP model and our proposed heuristic algorithm with regard to solution quality and processing time. The results show that our proposed algorithm maintains its overall correctness with O(N2) polynomial time complexity. In addition to migration sequence computation, the results of our proposed algorithm reveal the impact of each node in SDN deployment as Key Node, Critical Node and Diminishing Return Analysis. These information offers better decision for network operator during hybrid SDN deployment. Ultimately, the results of our proposed algorithm offers valuable insight in which significantly reduce up to 83\% of investment while reaping the most performance gain out of SDN deployment in legacy network.},

  abstract     = {In many Natural Language Processing problems the combination of machine learning and optimization techniques is essential. One of these problems is the estimation of the human effort needed to improve a text that has been translated using a machine translation method. Recent advances in this area have shown that Gaussian Processes can be effective in post-editing effort prediction. However, Gaussian Processes require a kernel function to be defined, the choice of which highly influences the quality of the prediction. On the other hand, the extraction of features from the text can be very labor-intensive, although recent advances in sentence embedding have shown that this process can be automated. In this paper, we use a Genetic Programming algorithm to evolve kernels for Gaussian Processes to predict post-editing effort based on sentence embeddings. We show that the combination of evolutionary optimization and Gaussian Processes removes the need for a-priori specification of the kernel choice, and, by using a multi-objective variant of the Genetic Programming approach, kernels that are suitable for predicting several metrics can be learned. We also investigate the effect that the choice of the sentence embedding method has on the kernel learning process.},

We classify the found papers into five categories based on the topics, i.e., home health care problems, operating room problems, nurse rostering problems, routing optimization problems, and other topics. For each topic, the detailed operations of VNS and the differences in solving various problems have been discussed. In addition, we analyze the studied problems and summarize the approaches used in the literature. The application tendency of VNS in the health care area is also discussed at the end of the paper.},

Our goal is to train machine learning methods to automatically improve the performance of optimization and signal processing algorithms. As a proof of concept, we use our approach to improve two popular data processing subroutines in data science: stochastic gradient descent and greedy methods in compressed sensing. We provide experimental results that demonstrate the answer is “yes”, machine learning algorithms do lead to more effective outcomes for optimization problems, and show the future potential for this research direction. In addition to our experimental work, we prove relevant Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning theorems for our problems of interest.

  abstract     = {Various hard real-time systems have a desired requirement which is impossible to fulfill: to solve a computationally hard optimization problem within a short and fixed amount of time T, e.g., T = 0.5 seconds. For such a task, the exact, exponential algorithms, as well as various Polynomial-Time Approximation Schemes, are irrelevant because they can exceed T. What is left in practice is to combine various anytime algorithms in a parallel portfolio. The question is how to build such an optimal portfolio, given a budget of K computing cores. It is certainly not as simple as choosing the K best performing algorithms, because their results are possibly correlated (e.g., there is no point in choosing two good algorithm for the portfolio if they win on a similar set of instances). We prove that the decision variant of this problem is NP-complete, and furthermore that the optimization problem is approximable. On the practical side, our main contribution is a solution of the optimization problem of choosing K algorithms out of n, for a machine with K computing cores, and the related problem of detecting the minimum number of required cores to achieve an optimal portfolio, with respect to a given training set of instances. As a benchmark, we took instances of a hard optimization problem that is prevalent in the real-time industry, in which the challenge is to decide on the best action within time T. We include the results of numerous experiments that compare the various methods. Hence, a side effect of our tests is that it gives the first systematic empirical evaluation of the relative success of various known stochastic-search algorithms in coping with a hard combinatorial optimization problems under a very short and fixed timeout.},

  abstract     = {Designing auction parameters for online industrial auctions is a complex problem due to highly heterogeneous items. Currently, online auctioneers rely heavily on their experts in auction design. The ability of predicting how well an auction will perform prior to the start comes in handy for auctioneers. If an item is expected to be a low-performing item, the auctioneer can take certain actions to influence the auction outcome. For instance, the starting selling price of the item can be modified, or the location where the item is displayed on the website can be changed to attract more attention. In this paper, we take a real-world industrial auction data set and investigate how we can improve upon the expert’s design using insights learned from data. More specifically, we first construct a classification model that predicts the expected performance of auctions. We propose a data driven auction design framework (called DDAD) that combines the expert’s knowledge with the learned prediction model, in order to find the best parameter values, i.e., starting price and display positions of the items, for a given new auction. The prediction model is evaluated, and the new design for several auctions is discussed and validated with the auction experts.},

However, by choosing the basis functions of the surrogate model in a certain way, we show that it can be guaranteed that the optimal solution of the surrogate model is integer. This approach outperforms random search, simulated annealing and a Bayesian optimization algorithm on the problem of finding robust routes for a noise-perturbed traveling salesman benchmark problem, with similar performance as another Bayesian optimization algorithm, and outperforms all compared algorithms on a convex binary optimization problem with a large number of variables.},

We create a new, more diverse set of instances based on an initial instance space analysis that reveals gaps in the instance space, and offers the opportunity to generate additional instances to add diversity to the test suite. The results of three algorithms on our extended instance set reveal insights based on this visual methodology. We observe different regions of strength and weakness in the instance space for each algorithm, as well as a phase transition from feasible to infeasible instances with more challenging instances at the phase transition boundary. This rigorous and insightful approach to analyzing algorithm performance highlights the critical role played by the choice of test instances, and the importance of ensuring diversity and unbiasedness of test instances to support valid conclusions.},

The winner of a play is determined by the smallest priority (even or odd) that is encountered infinitely often along the play. In the last two decades, several algorithms for solving parity games have been proposed and implemented in PGSolver, a platform written in OCaml. PGSolver includes the Zielonka’s recursive algorithm (RE, for short) which is known to be the best performing one over random games. Notably, several attempts have been carried out with the aim of improving the performance of RE in PGSolver, but with small advances in practice. In this work, we deeply revisit the implementation of RE by dealing with the use of specific data structures and programming languages such as Scala, Java, C++, and Go. Our empirical evaluation shows that these choices are successful, gaining up to three orders of magnitude in running time over the classic version of the algorithm implemented in PGSolver.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce and study schema mapping coverage for relational databases. Given a relational schema mapping in the presence of both source dependencies and target dependencies, the coverage problem is to decide and describe which source instances have solutions under the mapping. Our main motivation is to describe limitations of schema mappings and hence to effectively determine if the mappings can fulfill their user expectations for the given tasks. We first propose using database dependencies to model user expectations of schema mappings. Then we formally define the notion of schema mapping coverage and propose using a set of dependencies in the source schema language to represent coverage. We look into how target dependencies indirectly enforce dependencies via mapping specifications on source instances and thus determine which source instances have solutions. We prove that the problem of computing schema mapping coverage is undecidable in general. We present algorithms for computing coverage for schema mappings where both the source dependencies and the target dependencies consist of functional dependencies and acyclic inclusion dependencies. Schema mapping coverage describes the ability to map source instances to target instances for mappings, it provides a way to describe limitations of schema mappings, which can be especially useful for mapping design and evolution.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel approach to automated reasoning in System P. System P axiomatizes a set of core properties that describe reasoning with defeasible assertions (defaults) of the form: if α then normally (usually or typically) β. A logic with approximate conditional probabilities is used for modeling default rules. That representation enables reducing the satisfiability problem for default reasoning to the (non)linear programming problem. The complexity of the obtained instances requires the application of optimization approaches. The main heuristic that we use is the Bee Colony Optimization (BCO). As an alternative to BCO, we use Simplex method and Fourier-Motzkin Elimination method to solve linear programming problems. All approaches are tested on a set of default reasoning examples that can be found in literature. The general impression is that Fourier-Motzkin Elimination procedure is not suitable for practical use due to substantially high memory usage and time consuming execution, the Simplex method is able to provide useful results for some of the tested examples, while heuristic approach turns out to be the most appropriate in terms of both success rate and time needed for reaching conclusions. In addition, the BCO method was tested on a set of randomly generated examples of larger dimensions, illustrating its practical usability.},

This paper works towards overcoming these challenges by presenting a characterization, a representation, a construction method, and an existence result, each of which applies to any universal approximator on most function spaces of practical interest. Our characterization result is used to describe which activation functions allow the feed-forward architecture to maintain its universal approximation capabilities when multiple constraints are imposed on its final layers and its remaining layers are only sparsely connected. These include a rescaled and shifted Leaky ReLU activation function but not the ReLU activation function. Our construction and representation result is used to exhibit a simple modification of the feed-forward architecture, which can approximate any continuous function with non-pathological growth, uniformly on the entire Euclidean input space. This improves the known capabilities of the feed-forward architecture.},

Fast diffusion of information creates accuracy and scalability issues towards topic detection. Most of the existing approaches can detect the most popular topics on a large scale. However, these approaches are not effective for faster detection. This article proposes a novel topic detection approach – Node Significance based Label Propagation Community Detection (NSLPCD) algorithm, which detects the topic faster without compromising accuracy. The proposed algorithm analyzes the frequency distribution of keywords in the collection of tweets and finds two types of keywords: topic-identifying and topic-describing keywords, which play an important role in topic detection. Based on these defined keywords, the keyword co-occurrence graph is built, and subsequently, the NSLPCD algorithm is applied to get topic clusters in the form of communities. The experimental results using the real data of Twitter, show that the proposed method is effective in quality as well as run-time performance as compared to other existing methods.},

Applic. 22(1), 257–267, 2013). Since its objective function is strongly convex, piece-wise quadratic and differentiable, it can be solved by gradient-based iterative methods. Notice that its objective function having non-smooth ‘plus’ function, so one can consider either generalized Hessian, or smooth approximation function to replace the ‘plus’ function and further apply the simple Newton-Armijo step size algorithm. These algorithms can be easily implemented in MATLAB and do not require any optimization toolbox. The advantage of this method is that proposed algorithms take less training time and can deal with data having heteroscedastic noise structure. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, computational results are obtained on synthetic and real-world datasets which clearly show comparable generalization performance and improved learning speed in accordance with support vector regression, twin support vector regression, and twin parametric insensitive support vector regression.},

The architecture reasons with transition diagrams of any given domain at two different resolutions, with the fine-resolution description defined as a refinement of, and hence tightly-coupled to, a coarse-resolution description. For any given goal, nonmonotonic logical reasoning with the coarse-resolution description computes an activity, i.e., a plan, comprising a sequence of abstract actions to be executed to achieve the goal. Each abstract action is implemented as a sequence of concrete actions by automatically zooming to and reasoning with the part of the fine-resolution transition diagram relevant to the current coarse-resolution transition and the goal. Each concrete action in this sequence is executed using probabilistic models of the uncertainty in sensing and actuation, and the corresponding fine-resolution outcomes are used to infer coarse-resolution observations that are added to the coarse-resolution history. The architecture’s capabilities are evaluated in the context of a simulated robot assisting humans in an office domain, on a physical robot (Baxter) manipulating tabletop objects, and on a wheeled robot (Turtlebot) moving objects to particular places or people. The experimental results indicate improvements in reliability and computational efficiency compared with an architecture that does not include the theory of intentions, and an architecture that does not include zooming for fine-resolution reasoning.},

  abstract     = {This paper explores the nature of competition between hypotheses and the effect of failing to model this relationship correctly when performing abductive inference. In terms of the nature of competition, the importance of the interplay between direct and indirect pathways, where the latter depends on the evidence under consideration, is investigated. Experimental results show that models which treat hypotheses as mutually exclusive or independent perform well in an abduction problem that requires identifying the most probable hypothesis, provided there is at least some positive degree of competition between the hypotheses. However, even in such cases a significant limitation of these models is their inability to identify a second hypothesis that may well also be true.},

  abstract     = {We present LogAG, a weighted algebraic non-monotonic logic for reasoning with graded beliefs. LogAG is algebraic in that it is a language of only terms, some of which denote propositions and may be associated with ordered grades. The grades could be taken to represent a wide variety of phenomena including preference degrees, priority levels, trust ranks, and uncertainty measures. Reasoning in LogAG is non-monotonic and may give rise to contradictions. Belief revision is, hence, an integral part of reasoning and is guided by the grades. This yields a quite expressive language providing an interesting alternative to the currently existing approaches to non-monotonicity. We show how LogAG can be utilised for modelling resource-bounded reasoning; simulating inconclusive reasoning with circular, liar-like sentences; and reasoning about information arriving over a chain of sources each with a different degree of trust. While there certainly are accounts in the literature for each of these issues, we are not aware of any single framework that accounts for them all like LogAG does. We also show how LogAG captures a wide variety of non-monotonic logical formalisms. As such, LogAG is a unifying framework for non-monotonicity which is flexible enough to admit a wide array of potential uses.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this work is to study a generalisation of Dung’s abstract argumentation frameworks that allows representing recursive attacks, that is, a class of attacks whose targets are other attacks. We do this by developing a theory of argumentation where the classic role of attacks in defeating arguments is replaced by a subset of them, which is “extension-dependent” and which, intuitively, represents a set of “valid attacks” with respect to the extension. The studied theory displays a conservative generalisation of Dung’s semantics (complete, preferred, stable and grounded) and also of its principles (conflict-freeness, acceptability and admissibility). Furthermore, despite its conceptual differences, we are also able to show that our theory agrees with the AFRA interpretation of recursive attacks for the complete, preferred, stable and grounded semantics and with a recent flattening method.},

  abstract     = {Activity recognition refers to the detection of temporal combinations of ‘low-level’ or ‘short-term’ activities on sensor data. Various types of uncertainty exist in activity recognition systems and this often leads to erroneous detection. Typically, the frameworks aiming to handle uncertainty compute the probability of the occurrence of activities at each time-point. We extend this approach by defining the probability of a maximal interval and the credibility rate for such intervals. We then propose a linear-time algorithm for computing all probabilistic temporal intervals of a given dataset. We evaluate the proposed approach using a benchmark activity recognition dataset, and outline the conditions in which our approach outperforms time-point-based recognition.},

PD operators are natural generalizations of Dalal’s revision operator, with a much greater range of applicability, hence, the epistemic-entrenchment and partial-meet characterizations of the latter are also provided, as a by-product. Lastly, we prove that PD operators satisfy the strong version of Parikh’s relevance-sensitive axiom for belief revision, showing that they are fully compatible with the notion of relevance.},
